40|$|Zika virus (ZIKV) {{was first}} {{isolated}} in Africa; decades later, caused large outbreaks in the Pacific, {{and is considered}} endemic in Asia. We aim to describe ZIKV disease epidemiology outside the Americas, the importance of travelers as <b>sentinels</b> of <b>disease</b> transmission, and discrepancies in travel advisories from major international health organizations. This descriptive analysis using GeoSentinel Surveillance Network records involves sixty-four travel and tropical medicine clinics in 29 countries. Ill returned travelers with a confirmed or probable diagnosis of ZIKV disease acquired in Africa, Asia and the Pacific seen between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016 are included, and the frequencies of demographic, trip, and diagnostic characteristics described. ZIKV was acquired in Asia (18), the Pacific (10) and Africa (1). For five countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cameroon), GeoSentinel patients were sentinel markers of recent Zika activity. Additionally, the first confirmed ZIKV infection acquired in Kiribati was reported to GeoSentinel (2015), and a probable case was reported from Timor Leste (April 2016), representing the only case known to date. Review of Zika situation updates from major international health authorities for country risk classifications shows heterogeneity in ZIKV country travel advisories. Travelers are integral to the global spread of ZIKV, serving as <b>sentinel</b> markers of <b>disease</b> activity.

Blood samples from 21 neighborhood dogs that were found in nine of 22 bus stations and two public parks were subjected to a complete blood cell (CBC) count, serum biochemical profiling, a commercial rapid ELISA test and a commercial real-time PCR panel of vector-borne diseases. The CBC count and serum biochemical profiling were within the normal range for dogs and only 1 / 21 (4. 7 %) of the dogs was seroreactive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. The commercial real-time PCR panel showed that 7 / 21 (33. 3 %) of the dogs had Mycoplasma haemocanis infection, 9 / 21 (42. 8 %) had ‘Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum’ and 4 / 21 (19. 0 %) had both.

Under the supervision of Dr. Raymond Tarpley, the director of the Conservet Program, the course explores concepts related to conservation and facilitates collaboration amongst veterinary students, veterinarians, biologists, and ecologists to identify levels of health dysfunction in the ecosystem and establish methods of intervention to protect public health. The Conservet Program included lecture-based discussions with local professionals about the biodiversity in Costa Rica, disease ecology, drivers of global health dysfunction, and conservation strategies. The course also provided opportunities for fieldwork data collection from two different eco-zones of rain forest and local farms to explore the complexity of environmental function. The fieldwork focused on birds, bats, rodents, local livestock, fish, and mosquitoes as <b>sentinels</b> for <b>disease</b> and ecosystem health. Diseases investigated include Dengue, Chikungunya, Chagas Disease, West Nile Virus, and Avian Influenza. With a focus on conservation, this program allowed me to develop a greater understanding of public health from studying the interface between human, animal, and environmental health. This report describes my field experience in Costa Rica and discusses the relevance of conservation efforts as it affects public health. The key to understanding emerging infectious diseases is to understand the protective effects of nature intact, and recognize the consequences of destroying it.

40|$|From the past, {{species have}} been {{transferred}} among ecosystems trough traveling and global trade. The establishment and spread of such invasive species has caused significant damage to the economy, the environment, and human or native species health. This review compiles information on infections or contact with pathogens reported in raccoons (Procyon lotor). Raccoons are opportunistic carnivores native to North America. However, nowadays they are distributed across mainland Europe {{as a result of}} escaped pets and introductions. In their native range, raccoons are known to be host to a number of disease agents that could be transmitted to humans, domestic animals and other wildlife. Hence, the increase of raccoon populations and their geographic spread in Europe may result in new disease hazards. Raccoons have been identified as possible <b>sentinels</b> of <b>diseases</b> such as West Nile virus, and they pose a disease-related conservation risk by maintaining circulation of canine distemper virus. They also have the potential to participate in the maintenance of zoonoses including the raccoon roundworm Baylisascaris procyonis. Due its fast expansion and the large list of diseases, we conclude that the introduction of the raccoon has had adverse effects on health in Europe. This might well be the case of other invasive species, too. Hence, studies on invasive species health aspects are urgently needed to assess the risk of disease spread and eventually establish control measures.

We then later conducted a focused and intensive evaluation of calves in a subset of these households to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for diarrhoeal disease and Cryptosporidium and Giardia shedding, while also assessing household animal care and hygiene practices through a targeted risk factor questionnaire. By considering the findings from the human health survey with those from the calf-focused investigation, we hoped to gain meta-insight on potential environmental and shared risks of zoonotic transmission between herds and households. In addition, we conceptually explored the potential for calves to serve as <b>sentinels</b> for diarrhoeal <b>disease</b> risk.

There has been much recent literature identifying different services and the communities and species that provide them. This is a vital ﬁrst step towards management and maintenance of these services. In this review, we speciﬁcally address the waterbirds, which play key functional roles in many aquatic ecosystems, including as predators, herbivores and vectors of seeds, invertebrates and nutrients, although these roles have often been overlooked. Waterbirds can maintain the diversity of other organisms, control pests, be effective bioindicators of ecological conditions, and act as <b>sentinels</b> of potential <b>disease</b> outbreaks.

We identify key gaps {{in the understanding of}} ecosystem services provided by waterbirds and areas for future research required to clarify their functional role in ecosystems and the services they provide. We consider how the economic value of these services could be calculated, giving some examples. Such valuation will provide powerful arguments for waterbird conservation. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Outbreak control is limited to disinfection and isolation measures. Strategies to control the spread of noroviruses should be developed and models to study norovirus transmission will greatly facilitate this. Here, a mouse-to-mouse transmission model, in which mice develop acute murine norovirus (MNV) -induced diarrhea, was used to explore the role of interferon lambda (IFN-λ) in the control of a norovirus infection. Sentinel AG 129 mice [deficient in IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptors] that were co-housed with MNV-infected mice shedding high amounts of virus in their stool, developed a MNV-infection with associated diarrhea. Inoculation of such sentinel mice with an IFN-λ expression plasmid resulted {{in the production of}} circulating IFN-λ and upregulation of the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) of the gut. Injection of the IFN-λ-expressing plasmid to <b>sentinels</b> prevents MNV-induced <b>disease</b> upon exposure to MNV-infected mice, as well as MNV replication in the small intestine, the associated signs of inflammation and the mounting of a specific IgG-based immune response.

40|$|Some climate {{datasets}} are incomplete {{at certain}} places and times. A novel technique called the point estimation model of Biased <b>Sentinel</b> Hospitals-based Area <b>Disease</b> Estimation (P-BSHADE) is introduced to interpolate missing data in temperature datasets. Effectiveness {{of the technique}} was empirically evaluated {{in terms of an}} annual temperature dataset from 1950 to 2000 in China. The P-BSHADE technique uses a weighted summation of observed stations to derive unbiased and minimum error variance estimates of missing data. Both the ratio and covariance between stations were used in calculation of these weights. In this way, interpolation of missing data in the temperature dataset was improved, and best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE) were obtained. Using the same dataset, performance of P-BSHADE was compared against three estimators: kriging, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and spatial regression test (SRT). Kriging and IDW assume a homogeneous stochastic field, which may not be the case. SRT employs spatiotemporal data and has the potential to consider temperature nonhomogeneity caused by topographic differences, but has no objective function for the BLUE. Instead, P-BSHADE takes into account geographic spatial autocorrelation and nonhomogeneity, and maximizes an objective function for the BLUE of the target station. In addition to the theoretical advantages of P-BSHADE over the three other methods, case studies for an annual Chinese temperature dataset demonstrate its empirical superiority, except for the SRT from 1950 to 1970. 2013 American Meteorological Society...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{outbreak}} of West Nile virus (WNV) {{in and around}} New York City during the late summer of 1999 {{was the cause of}} extensive mortality among free-ranging birds. Within the Bronx Zoo/Wildlife Conservation Park, viral activity was also observed and produced some morbidity and mortality among specimens in the zoo’s bird collection and probably caused morbidity in at least one specimen from the zoo’s mammal collection. To determine the extent of the outbreak and attempt to ascertain the temporal appearance of virus within the park, a serologic survey of birds and mammals was performed. The survey showed that 34 % of tested birds (125 of 368; 124 species) were positive for antibody to WNV. The virus caused a disease to infection ratio of 22 % (27 of 125) among birds with a 70 % (19 of 27) case fatality rate. In contrast, only 8 % of the mammals (9 of 117; 35 species) possessed antibody to WNV and there was no virus-associated mortality. Testing of banked and fresh sera obtained from both birds and mammals revealed that {{there was no evidence of}} WNV circulation before the 1999 outbreak and that birds introduced into the park were not the source of the New York outbreak. West Nile virus RNA was detected in tissues from one bird that died in February 2000, long after the end of the mosquito transmission season.

40|$|BACKGROUND. An {{investigation}} {{of the relationship between}} incident human cases of Lyme disease and seroprevalence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in dogs was undertaken in order to determine whether dogs might serve as <b>sentinels</b> for Lyme <b>disease.</b> METHODS. 3011 canine serum samples were analyzed by ELISA for antibody to B. burgdorferi. Records of incident human cases of Lyme disease were obtained from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. RESULTS. Regression analyses {{of the relationship between the}} log 10 (mean incidence in people 1985 - 1989) and canine seroprevalence from July 1988 -August 1989 revealed that canine seroprevalence was highly predictive of incidence (R 2 = 0. 86, p less than. 0001). A logistic regression model that incorporates the altitude of the town where each dog was resident, the date of sampling, and information on each dog's age, sex, and breed adequately explained the risk of canine seropositivity. Dogs resident at altitudes less than 200 feet, of sporting or large mixed breeds, and greater than two years of age were five times, four times, and almost three times more likely, respectively, to exhibit seropositivity than were other dogs. CONCLUSIONS. Estimates of the prevalence of antibody to B. burgdorferi in dog populations offers a sensitive, reliable, and convenient measure of the potential risk to people of B. burgdorferi in the environment. Risk factors for canine seropositivity may directly or indirectly illuminate certain aspects of the epidemiology of human Lyme disease...|$|R
40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the most common {{gynecologic}} malignancy worldwide. Squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma are the three major histologic types, and this cancer develops slowly and locally. Radical hysterectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection or concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment when the disease is at an early stage. CCRT remains the standard for locally advanced disease, and systemic chemotherapy {{plays a major role in}} disease with distant metastases.

A series of clinical trials and retrospective studies support a more conservative surgical treatment in early-stage <b>disease.</b> <b>Sentinel</b> lymph node mapping is used to decrease the morbidities after nodal dissection. Some new concurrent chemotherapeutic agents and schedules have been developed to replace the traditional cisplatin-base agents in order to decrease the toxicity during CCRT.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy has revealed itself as the potential application as part of a new therapeutic trend in treating locally advanced cervical cancer patients.

A novel technique called the point estimation model of Biased <b>Sentinel</b> Hospitals-based Area <b>Disease</b> Estimation (P-BSHADE) is introduced to interpolate missing data in temperature datasets. Effectiveness {{of the technique}} was empirically evaluated {{in terms of an}} annual temperature dataset from 1950 to 2000 in China. The P-BSHADE technique uses a weighted summation of observed stations to derive unbiased and minimum error variance estimates of missing data. Both the ratio and covariance between stations were used in calculation of these weights. In this way, interpolation of missing data in the temperature dataset was improved, and best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE) were obtained. Using the same dataset, performance of P-BSHADE was compared against three estimators: kriging, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and spatial regression test (SRT). Kriging and IDW assume a homogeneous stochastic field, which may not be the case. SRT employs spatiotemporal data and has the potential to consider temperature nonhomogeneity caused by topographic differences, but has no objective function for the BLUE. Instead, P-BSHADE takes into account geographic spatial autocorrelation and nonhomogeneity, and maximizes an objective function for the BLUE of the target station. In addition to the theoretical advantages of P-BSHADE over the three other methods, case studies for an annual Chinese temperature dataset demonstrate its empirical superiority, except for the SRT from 1950 to 1970...|$|R
