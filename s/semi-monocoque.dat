5|$|The {{construction}} of the airframe was fairly conventional, with a <b>semi-monocoque</b> frame and multi-spar wing. The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage, the latter limited largely to {{the area around the}} engines and to fasteners. Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because it was difficult to machine.|$|E
5|$|He {{established}} his own aeronautics manufacturing company, Longren Aircraft Corporation, which produced several models through the 1920s. The handcrafted Longren planes were well regarded by aviation professionals of the era. Longren created several innovations including {{the design for}} the first <b>semi-monocoque</b> airplane body. In addition to his own independent enterprises, he worked for many years {{with some of the}} best-known companies in the industry – Spartan, Luscombe, and Cessna – until his retirement in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of <b>semi-monocoque,</b> stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} is of <b>semi-monocoque</b> structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section <b>semi-monocoque</b> {{fuselage}} {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, <b>semi-monocoque</b> duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
25|$|The Whitley {{holds the}} {{distinction}} of having been the first aircraft to serve with the RAF to utilise a <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage, which was built using a slab-sided structure to ease production. This replaced the traditional tubular construction method previously employed by Armstrong Whitworth, instead constructing the airframe from light-alloy rolled sections, pressings, and corrugated sheets. According to aviation author Philip Moyes, the decision to adopt the <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage design was a significant step forwards, {{and the integrity of}} which was well-proven during subsequent RAF service, having survived multiple instances of severe damage being sustained.|$|E
25|$|The XP-9 was {{designed}} in 1928 {{to meet the}} requirements of a US Army request for a monoplane fighter. Its primary contribution to aircraft design was its <b>semi-monocoque</b> construction, which would become a standard for future aircraft. Boeing employed the structural features of the XP-9 into their contemporary P-12 biplane fighter when the P-12E variant incorporated a <b>semi-monocoque</b> metal fuselage structure {{similar to that of the}} XP-9. The undercarriage arrangement of the P-12C had also been first tried out on the XP-9 and then transferred into the production model.|$|E
25|$|Ship No.2: (c/n 2) The second {{aircraft}} was built {{with a new}} three wheeled undercarriage, <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage, new tail rotor mounting and fully enclosed cockpit for pilot and passenger.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is mainly}} built with wood, a <b>semi-monocoque</b> construction with steel tubes for wing attachments. The two seat cockipt has dual controls. The empennage is conventional, with a braced tailplane mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. The landing gear is a forward skid with elastic dampers and a single, fixed wheel aft of the centre of gravity.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{nacelles}} {{consisted of}} <b>semi-monocoque</b> wooden constructions, with the paired engines amidships, a cockpit for the engineer and defensive gun {{position for the}} gunner either forward or behind of the engines depending on whether a pusher or tractor arrangement was used. Aircraft using push-pull nacelles, i.e. individual propellers for each engine, had no provision for defensive armament, just a cockpit for the engineer amidships.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{construction}} low-wing cantilever monoplane, conventional in layout, with a fixed {{landing gear}} and a closed cockpit. The fuselage was <b>semi-monocoque,</b> plywood-covered. Single-piece trapezoid wings with rounded tips, two-spar, plywood (in front) and canvas covered. Conventional cantilever empennage, plywood (fins) and canvas (elevators and rudder) covered. Two seats side-by-side, with twin controls, under a common canopy, with a fixed windshield. Conventional fixed landing gear with a rear skid.|$|E
25|$|It was {{considered}} to be sturdy and very manoeuvrable for a glider. The design of the Horsa adopted a high-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, being equipped with wooden wings and a wooden <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage. The fuselage was built in three sections bolted together, the front section held the pilot's compartment and main freight loading door, the middle section was accommodation for troops or freight, the rear section supported the tail unit.|$|E
25|$|The Sporting Type was {{designed}} to meet RAF specification number RAF XXXII. It was a four-seat, single-engined biplane with twin wooden floats mounted on wire-braced struts below the fuselage. It had two cockpits, the forward cockpit for the pilot and a passenger sitting in tandem, the other for two passengers sitting abreast; the rear cockpit could also function as cargo room, increasing the aircraft's operational flexibility. The fuselage was of <b>semi-monocoque</b> plywood construction with a fabric fairing.|$|E
25|$|The F-15 has an {{all-metal}} <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage {{with a large}} cantilever shoulder-mounted wing. The wing planform of the F-15 {{suggests a}} modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are utilized. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with spanwise position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.|$|E
25|$|The Yak-16 was a low-winged, twin-engined {{monoplane}} {{that closely}} resembled the Li-2. The metal-skinned, <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage had {{room for a}} two-person cockpit and ten passengers plus a toilet and baggage hold. The control surfaces of the tail were fabric-covered although the tail itself was metal-skinned. The two-spar metal wing was built in three sections, a rectangular center section and two trapezoidal outer panels. The main undercarriage legs retracted forward into the engine nacelles, with the wheels remaining semi-exposed, while the tailwheel was fixed. The ASh-21 engines had NACA cowlings and drove two-bladed variable-pitch VISh-11V-20 propellers.|$|E
25|$|At a {{time when}} most {{aircraft}} were small, single-engine biplanes made of wood and canvas, the E-4 was a large (102-foot wingspan), all-metal, four-engine, stress-skinned, <b>semi-monocoque,</b> cantilevered-wing monoplane, with an enclosed cockpit, accommodation for 18 passengers plus a crew of five, including two pilots, a radio operator, an engineer and a steward, as well as radio-telegraph communications, a toilet, a galley and separate baggage and mail storage. With a maximum speed of 143mph, cruising speed of , a range of about , and a fully loaded weight of , it outperformed most other airliners of its day.|$|E
25|$|The Skywarrior had a 36° degree {{swept wing}} and two Pratt & Whitney J57 {{turbojet}} engines. Early prototypes {{had used the}} intended Westinghouse J40, a powerplant {{that proved to be}} disastrous and subsequently canceled. The turbojets could be supplemented by a provision for twelve 4,500lbf (20kN) thrust JATO bottles. The aircraft had a largely conventional <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage, with the engines in underwing nacelles. Flight controls were hydraulic, and for storage below deck, the A-3's wings folded outboard of the engines, lying almost flat, and its vertical stabilizer was hinged to starboard. Capacious internal fuel tanks provided long range.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic design}} of the Typhoon was a {{combination}} of traditional Hawker construction (such as used in the earlier Hawker Hurricane) and more modern construction techniques; the front fuselage structure, from the engine mountings {{to the rear of the}} cockpit, was made up of bolted and welded duralumin or steel tubes covered with skin panels, while the rear fuselage was a flush-riveted, <b>semi-monocoque</b> structure. The forward fuselage and cockpit skinning was made up of large, removable duralumin panels, allowing easy external access to the engine and engine accessories and most of the important hydraulic and electrical equipment.|$|E
25|$|The F-111 was an {{all-weather}} attack aircraft, {{capable of}} low-level penetration of enemy defenses to deliver ordnance on the target. The F-111 featured variable-geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with side-by-side seating. The cockpit {{was part of}} an escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varied between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The wing included leading edge slats and double slotted flaps over its full length. The airframe was made up mostly of aluminium alloys with steel, titanium and other materials used in places. The fuselage was made of a <b>semi-monocoque</b> structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb structure panels for skin.|$|E
25|$|It had a circular-section <b>semi-monocoque</b> {{fuselage}} with a nose air intake. A range-only radar {{was fitted}} in the conical inlet cone {{of the air}} intake. The wings had a sweep angle of 55° at quarterchord. Two wing fences were fitted on the upper surface of each wing. The horizontal stabilizer was midway down the rear fuselage and two air brakes were fitted on its underside. The cockpit canopy was faired into the spine that {{ran the length of}} the top of the fuselage. The tandem undercarriage had a single wheel on the forward unit and twin wheels on the main unit with outrigger struts that retracted aft into wingtip fairings.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, each Meteor was {{constructed}} from several modular sections or separately produced units, a deliberate design choice {{to allow for}} production to be dispersed and for easy disassembly for transport. Each aircraft comprised five main sections: nose, forward fuselage, central section, rear fuselage and tail units; the wings were also built out of lengthwise sections. The forward section contained the pressure cabin, gun compartments, and forward undercarriage. The center section incorporated much of the structural elements, including the inner wing, engine nacelles, fuel tank, ammunition drums, and main undercarriage. The rear fuselage was of a conventional <b>semi-monocoque</b> structure. Various aluminium alloys were the primary materials used throughout {{the structure of the}} Meteor, such as the stressed duralumin skin.|$|E
25|$|The F-111B was an {{all-weather}} {{interceptor aircraft}} intended to defend U.S. Navy carrier battle groups against bombers and anti-ship missiles. The F-111 features variable geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with {{side by side}} seating. The cockpit {{is part of an}} escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varies between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The airframe consisted mostly of aluminum alloys with steel, titanium and other materials also used. The fuselage is a <b>semi-monocoque</b> structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb sandwich panels for skin. The F-111B was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines and included the AN/AWG-9 radar system for controlling the AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles. Poor visibility over the nose made the aircraft more difficult to handle for carrier operations.|$|E
25|$|The IS-1 Sęp was {{constructed}} of wood throughout with steel for high-stress areas and fittings. The fuselage was a plywood-covered <b>semi-monocoque</b> structure with smooth lines. Incorporated in the fuselage was the cockpit, which {{was covered by}} a built-up plexi-glass canopy, and an integral fin which supported the plywood stressed-skin tailplane just above the fuselage top decking level. The undercarriage consisted of a long pneumatically-sprung ash skid under the nose and a rubber-sprung tail skid. For take-off a jettisonable two-wheeled dolly {{was attached to the}} front skid. As with all drop-off dollies it was important to release the dolly at the right moment to avoid the dolly bouncing into the structure, causing damage. An aero-tow hook was provided in the extreme nose, as well as a bungee hook and twin winch-launch hooks either side of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The ST {{featured}} two open cockpits {{in tandem}} {{in a metal}} <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage of two main frames – one steel, {{the other half of}} steel and half of aluminium alloy (alclad) – to take the loads from the wing spars and six more alclad frames; and alclad skin. It had wings in three sections of hybrid construction; the center section integral with the fuselage had tubular steel spars, the front spar a simple tube with an external brace to the upper fuselage, and the rear spar {{in the form of a}} parallel chord truss. The two outer wing panels had wooden spars and alclad ribs, with diagonal rods bracing the wings internally. Alclad sheet was used to form the leading edges, and fabric covered the whole structure. When attached, the outer wings were braced with flying wires to the fixed conventional landing gear and landing wires to the upper fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Canberra is of <b>semi-monocoque</b> construction with a pressurised nose compartment. The whole {{lower section}} of the fuselage is {{taken up by the}} sizable bomb bay, which was typically covered by a pair of hydraulically-driven doors. The Canberra's undercarriage used a simple arrangement, the main landing gear being equipped with a single outboard-mounted wheel and the nose gear being a twin-wheel arrangement. Due to the use of a new alloy, DTD683, the undercarriage suffered from stress corrosion, causing decay to start within only a few years. The extreme hazard posed of undercarriages collapsing during landings, especially if the aircraft were carrying nuclear weapons, led the RAF to institute regular inspections, at first using radiography before moving to more effective and reliable ultrasound technology. The Canberra is made up mostly of metal, only the forward portion of the tail-fin is made from wood.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Sukhoi was {{tasked with}} {{designing}} a high-altitude fighter, the resulting Su-1 was a conventional monoplane with a streamlined wooden <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage, low-set all-metal wing made of duralumin and un-pressurized cockpit. The key {{feature of the}} aircraft {{was a pair of}} TK-2 turbochargers driven by exhaust gases from the Klimov M-105P engine. The prototype was completed at the Sukhoi plant in Kharkov in May 1940, flying for the first time, on 15 June 1940, with A.P. Chernyavsky at the controls. Testing continued until 3 August, when Chernavskii mistakenly landed with the landing gear retracted. After the completion of repairs in mid-September, testing resumed, but an in-flight engine failure on 2 October resulted in a dead-stick landing. Limited flight testing continued until April 1941, with the Su-1 reaching a top speed of 641km/h (345kn, 400mph) at 10,000m (32,810ft). However, the turbochargers proved unreliable and without them the aircraft was inferior in performance to the Yakovlev Yak-1.|$|E
25|$|The {{airframe}} of the P.8 continued Pulawski's {{theme of}} <b>semi-monocoque</b> stressed skin Aluminium alloy structure with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings were built up around two I-section Aluminium alloy spars with alloy ribs and finely corrugated sheet Duralumin. High set gull style wings {{were attached to}} the upper fuselage with about 5 degrees dihedral out to the joint between centre-section and outer wings which had zero dihedral. Support for the wings came from pairs of struts attached to the lower fuselage and at the thickest section of the outer wings at about 1/3span. A fixed tail-wheel undercarriage consisted of strut mounted mainwheels attached to the fuselage at the wing strut attachment points and a steel shod tail-skid. Cooling for the engine was achieved by a large radiator bath under the rear fuselage on the P.8/I and by special surface heat exchangers under the rear fuselage of the P.8/II. The special heat exchangers caused cooling difficulties and were replaced by small radiators {{either side of the}} rear fuselage aft of the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} unusual and innovative, being {{based on a}} strong central keel that incorporated the armament, cockpit, and engine. Two strong fuselage beams to port and starboard {{formed the basis of}} the structure. These angled upwards fore and aft to create mounting points for the T9 cannon and propeller reduction gearbox and for the engine and accessories respectively. A strong arched bulkhead provided the main structural attachment point for the main spar of the wing. This arch incorporated a fireproof panel and an armor plate between the engine and the cockpit. It also incorporated a turnover pylon and a pane of bullet-resistant glass behind the pilot's head. The arch also formed the basis of the cockpit housing; the pilot's seat was attached to the forward face as was the cockpit floor. Forward of the cockpit the fuselage nose was formed from large removable covers. A long nose wheel well was incorporated in the lower nose section. The engine and accessories were attached {{to the rear of the}} arch and the main structural beams; these too were covered using large removable panels. A conventional <b>semi-monocoque</b> rear fuselage was attached aft of the main structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{construction was}} quite novel. Barnwell borrowed from marine experience by using duralumin sheet, varnished to prevent corrosion and used these {{to make the}} fuselage in four sections. The two forward sections were <b>semi-monocoque</b> (i.e. open channels) with braced longitudinal upper members which, bolted together, held the engine, a water-cooled inline upright 140hp (100kW) Hispano-Suiza) and the pilot's cockpit. Aft, two more sections, both true monocoques, held the observer and carried the tail unit. The two cockpits were close together, with the pilot under the wing at mid-chord and the observer under a trailing edge cutout; Barnwell proposed that the short observer's fuselage section should be removable to turn the M.R.1 into a single-seater, though this configuration was not realised. The monocoque sections were very early examples of double-skinned construction, with a smooth outer skin riveted to a longitudinally-corrugated inner skin. The detailed design was by W.T.Read. The complete fuselage was of round-cornered rectangular cross-section and quite slender, mounted between the wings. The M.R.1 was a two-bay biplane without stagger or sweep, with ailerons on both planes. Aluminium wing spars proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid and Bristol outsourced their manufacture to The Steel Wing Company at Gloucester, who had built experimental steel wings for other aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Wankel engines run {{very hot}} on the {{ignition}} and exhaust side of the engine's trochoid chamber, whereas the intake and compression parts are cooler. Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water cooling system, with Garside reasoning that provided the power did not exceed , air-cooling would suffice. Garside cooled {{the interior of the}} rotors with filtered ram-air. This very hot air was cooled in a plenum contained within the <b>semi-monocoque</b> frame and afterwards, once mixed with fuel, fed into the engine. This air was quite oily after running through the interior of the rotors, and thus was used to lubricate the rotor tips. The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields. Garside simply tucked the pipes out of harm's way under the engine, where heat would dissipate in the breeze of the vehicle's forward motion. Suzuki opted for complicated multi-stage carburation, whilst Garside choose simple carburetors. Suzuki had three lube systems, whilst Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system which was fed to both the main bearings and the intake manifolds. Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, however with rough patches at 4,000rpm; Garside opted for a turbine-smooth twin-rotor motor. Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame, but Garside put his rotors as low as possible to lower the center of gravity of the motorcycle.|$|E
500|$|The AK {{was not the}} {{commercial}} breakthrough that Longren would have liked, but it featured a design innovation that would burnish his reputation greatly. Improving upon the day's standard airplane bodyform – essentially a wooden frame with a fabric skin – Longren designed the first <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage. The AK body was formed by joining two mirroring halves into a simple but aerodynamic shape. The two halves formed a hard shell, made of strong vulcanized fibrous material and reinforced {{on both sides with}} wood veneer. The advanced design of the AK was remarkable for its day, and presents what Air & Space/Smithsonian calls [...] "the world's first <b>semi-monocoque,</b> truly composite shell fuselage".|$|E
500|$|He was {{responsible}} for numerous aviation-related patents throughout his career. His most significant work concerned the process of [...] "stretch-forming" [...] metal into assembly-ready fuselage panels. Luscombe {{was the first of}} many manufacturers to benefit from this patent when it produced its Luscombe Phantom, the first mass-produced airplane with an all-aluminum, <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage. Longren brought most of his patents over to Cessna in 1935 when he joined that company as Vice-President for the next three years.|$|E
500|$|Holden {{launched}} the new HQ series in 1971. At this time, {{the company was}} producing all of its passenger cars in Australia, and every model was of Australian design; however, {{by the end of}} the decade, Holden was producing cars based on overseas designs. The HQ was thoroughly re-engineered, featuring a perimeter frame and <b>semi-monocoque</b> (unibody) construction. Other firsts included an all-coil suspension and an extended wheelbase for station wagons, while the utilities and panel vans retained the traditional coil/leaf suspension configuration. The series included the new prestige Statesman brand, which also had a longer wheelbase, replacing the Brougham. The Statesman remains noteworthy because it was not marketed as a [...] "Holden", but rather a [...] "Statesman".|$|E
500|$|The XBTM-1 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} monoplane with folding {{wings to}} allow more compact storage in carrier hangar decks, and conventional landing gear. Its fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin <b>semi-monocoque</b> with the single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped [...] canopy positioned just aft of the air-cooled engine. Just behind the cockpit was a [...] fuel tank. The large wing consisted of a two-spar center section with hydraulically-folded three-spar outer panels. A large dive brake was positioned on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. When closed it could be lowered for use as a landing flap or it could be split into alternating upper and lower sections, with intermeshing [...] "fingers" [...] for use in its intended role. It was very effective in this role, mainly due to its great surface area, but this was at the cost of the width of the ailerons, which significantly reduced their efficiency. A pair of [...] fuel tanks were positioned in the roots of the center section. All fuel tanks were self sealing and the pilot and oil cooler were protected by [...] of armor.|$|E
500|$|The Yak-19 had an {{flattened}} oval-shaped, metal <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage {{with the}} single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped canopy positioned just {{forward of the}} [...] axial-flow RD-10F turbojet engine. Its air intake was in the nose and the afterburner was positioned {{at the rear of}} the fuselage, just below the tail structure. Fitted with tricycle landing gear, the main landing gear retracted inwards into the fuselage while the nose gear retracted forwards. The laminar-flow, two-spar, straight wing was mounted in the middle of the fuselage. It was equipped with modified Fowler flaps and Frise ailerons. The rudder was split into two sections by the horizontal stabilizers; the upper portion was fabric-covered while the lower half was metal-skinned. The pilot was protected by a bulletproof windscreen, a forward armor plate and an armored seat back. In addition, he was provided with an ejection seat. The Yak-19 was equipped with four fuel tanks in the fuselage that had a total capacity of [...] of fuel. It was armed with two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, each with 70 rounds.|$|E
