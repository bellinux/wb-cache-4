500|$|Weird Tales {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} magazines in the fantasy field; in Ashley's view, it is [...] "second only to Unknown in significance and influence". [...] Weinberg goes further, calling it [...] "the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines". [...] Weinberg argues that much of the material Weird Tales published would never have appeared if the magazine had not existed. [...] It was through Weird Tales that Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith became widely known, and it was the first and one of the most important markets for weird and science fantasy artwork. [...] Many of the horror stories adapted for early radio shows such as <b>Stay</b> <b>Tuned</b> <b>for</b> Terror originally appeared in Weird Tales. [...] The magazine's [...] "Golden Age" [...] was under Wright, and de Camp argues that one of Wright's accomplishments was to create a [...] "Weird Tales school of writing". [...] Justin Everett and Jeffrey H. Shanks, the editors of a recent scholarly collection of literary criticism focused on the magazine, argue that [...] "Weird Tales functioned as a nexus point in the development of speculative fiction from which emerged the modern genres of fantasy and horror".|$|E
500|$|... "Welcome Wagon" [...] is {{the first}} episode of the series to air on The CW as opposed to UPN. Paul Maguire, the {{spokesman}} for The CW, said that the series was picked up because [...] "the critics are behind it and our research has consistently shown that Gilmore shared more audience commonality with Veronica than with any other show from UPN, except Top Model". Veronica Mars was placed on Tuesdays after Gilmore Girls, with the network hoping for the Gilmore Girls audience to <b>stay</b> <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> Veronica Mars. Thomas stated that The CW had requested some changes to the show to fit in better with the Gilmore Girls audience: [...] "The network really wants us {{to be a good}} companion piece to Gilmore Girls. They've had a couple of thoughts on storylines that are too dark." [...] "Welcome Wagon" [...] also introduces a new title sequence for the show. The visuals of the theme song are different, and although [...] "We Used to Be Friends" [...] by The Dandy Warhols was still employed as the theme song, a remix was used instead of the original. Regarding the changes, Thomas elaborated: ...|$|E
500|$|On September 17, 2007, the {{day before}} the twelfth and final episode of the {{televised}} anime was to air on TV Kanagawa, a sixteen-year-old girl murdered her forty-five-year-old father in their Kyoto home with an axe. TV Kanagawa promptly cancelled the Tuesday airing of the finale for its similarly violent content, replacing it instead with a thirty-minute video compilation of scenery footage from Norway, played to August Wilhelmj's [...] "Air on the G String". Newspapers such as The Japan Times and Mainichi Shimbun reported on the killing and episode preempt on September 19. According to Mainichi Shimbun, Chiba TV and TV Aichi had also cancelled their airings, with AT-X the only station remaining indecisive. 0verflow issued an apology through their blog the same day, asking viewers to <b>stay</b> <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> updates. In the following week, 0verflow announced that it had arranged for two screenings of the edited finale at the Akihabara 3D Theater on September 27. Those wishing to attend would be required to register a seat by email, be at least 18 years old with photo ID, and bring a Windows copy of School Days or Summer Days. That same day AT-X announced that it had decided to air the unedited finale on September 27 and October 1.|$|E

50|$|They {{were used}} {{in a range of}} {{settings}} such as schools and public halls, as they were renowned for their ability to <b>stay</b> in <b>tune</b> <b>for</b> prolonged periods of time, requiring little maintenance. They were also used by piano teachers and for professional live performance, the most famous of which was for performances by Dame Nellie Melba, who frequently requested that Wertheim Pianos be used during her performances.|$|R
500|$|As the {{shooting}} took place, ABC News was signing off from its electoral broadcast, while the CBS broadcast was already over. It {{was not until}} 21 minutes after the shots that CBS's coverage of {{the shooting}} would begin. [...] ABC's Howard K. Smith had signed off {{the air and the}} closing credits and advertisements were playing over a wide studio shot of the anchors and staff when a voice over alerted the audience several times to <b>stay</b> <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> a special report. [...] More than four minutes passed before Smith came back on the air announcing [...] "a disturbing report that Senator Robert Kennedy had been shot". [...] During that four minutes of extended coverage, the studio camera broadcast the live panic and bewilderment in the ABC newsroom. The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy's win in the primary ended up crowding into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC, all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white. CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident.|$|E
500|$|A Daily Bugle website {{revealed}} Denis Leary as George Stacy, {{lamenting the}} appearance of the wall-crawler and asking whoever spots Spider-Man to e-mail the police. The site hosted the best fan-made Spider-Man scenes. People who uploaded images of [...] "Spider-Man" [...] on the [...] "Webbed Menace" [...] viral site received a poster that sent them to a website for a boxing gym called [...] "Jerera's Boxing Gym". The gym was funded by Peter Parker's school. A viral website of that class was discovered. Entering the correct password revealed Parker's class schedule. The Midtown High School site then revealed a Twitter user tracking down Lizard and asked people in Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Austin, Tampa, Minneapolis and New Orleans to <b>stay</b> <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> details. A viral site for Oscorp Industries was available. The Twitter account that coordinated a nationwide effort to track Lizard sightings revealed locations that had packages containing Connors' shredded lab coat, an Oscorp ID badge and scientific samples of reptilian skin. When unscrambling the letters listed on each sample, the words [...] "animal dynamics lab" [...] led players to a new Oscorp Industries site focusing on a science program about reptile genetics. The site depicts Doctor Connors search for interns who could begin applying on May 14. Completing the application and supplying the keyword [...] "Mutagen" [...] unveiled a Lizard featurette. The Oscorp Industries website contained puzzles that revealed two in-game documents, two video updates featuring Connors and a following cipher that as of July 2012 had yet to be cracked. From there images were then unscrambled, revealing a research project with spiders, a letter from Mary Parker to Richard Parker that exposed his workaholic habits and a Daily Bugle newspaper that contained notes about Oscorp.|$|E

50|$|These pianos were hand crafted in {{the factory}} on Bendigo Street, Richmond, using {{predominantly}} Australian materials. These were the first pianos ever manufactured {{in the state of}} Victoria. Around 18,000 were produced, many were exported interstate and overseas. They were used for many purposes, from live performance to performance halls, school theatres and by piano teachers. They were designed for the Australian climate and were noted for their ability to <b>stay</b> in <b>tune</b> <b>for</b> long periods of time. Many of these pianos are still in use today around Australia and, undamaged or restored, can be quite expensive.|$|R
30|$|Multi-channel and multi-radio {{wireless}} {{networks have}} popularly been studied {{to increase the}} network capacity by enriching the freedom of using wireless channels. They lead wireless nodes to avoid effectively intraflow or interflow interferences within wireless networks using multiple orthogonal channels [1 – 3]. Channel assignment has been a central issue in such multi-channel wireless networks to determine which interface uses which channel {{in order to maximize}} the utilization of available channels. Static channel assignment to multiple radios based on network flows leads to a chain effect of channel mobility whenever network topology changes. In contrast, dynamic channel assignment requires an additional rendezvous scheme to meet on the same channel. Hybrid channel assignment however supports flexible and robust connectivities among nodes compared to those static and dynamic channel assignments [4, 5] even if it costs channel switching delay. For example, it assigns two different channels to two radio interfaces of a mesh node for concurrent operations of receiving and transmitting similar to full-duplex communication. Thus, it enables a transmitting radio interface to switch very rapidly among the receiving channels of neighbor nodes to maintain full connectivity while the other receiving interface <b>stays</b> <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> the fixed channel to avoid deafness and disconnection problems.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{received}} mainly negative reviews with Robert David Sullivan of The A.V. Club {{giving the}} episode a C, commenting, [...] "'Changing Of The Guardians' is three mini Simpsons episodes: a comic {{portrayal of a}} natural disaster, a well-worn sitcom story with cameos from lots of recurring characters, and a brief tale in which our favorite family is threatened by the Guest Voice Of The Week." [...] He goes on to state that [...] "everything is so rushed {{that none of this}} feels sad or tense or heartwarming or funny." [...] Teresa Lopez of TV Fanatic called this episode [...] "the most disappointing I can recall" [...] of the 24th season far. She found it [...] "very difficult to <b>stay</b> <b>tuned</b> in <b>for</b> the whole episode - and that's pretty sad", explaining that [...] "The dullness of the installment lies in the uninspired storytelling". Rob H. Dawson of TV Equals gave the episode an equally negative review saying [...] "The whole thing feels rushed and weird, as well as heavily front-loaded".|$|R
2500|$|The final Jay Leno Show {{aired on}} February 9, 2010. The guests were Ashton Kutcher, Gabourey Sidibe and Bob Costas, with unannounced visits from Donald Trump and Kurt Warner. Following the monologue, {{there was a}} brief clip reel of {{highlights}} from the show's short tenure; otherwise, little mention was made about {{the fact that it was}} the final episode of the program. The last moments of the show featured the program's [...] "10 at 10" [...] segment, with its celebrity guest being Bob Costas. When Leno asked Costas how it felt to be the show's final guest, the sportscaster replied, [...] "Kind of like being involved in the last game of a Clippers season, isn't it?" [...] Directly following the interview with Costas, Leno thanked him, told the audience to <b>stay</b> <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> their local news, and then abruptly went off-air.|$|E

The series carried on the same format until 2004, when it was made a one-hour programme to combat the Seven Network's hit Deal or No Deal, {{in the hopes that}} people would <b>stay</b> <b>tuned</b> to Nine <b>for</b> the news after watching the first half-hour. This format involved four pricing games; after the second and fourth games, a Showcase Showdown was played, with a $1,000 bonus for achieving a total score of $1.
