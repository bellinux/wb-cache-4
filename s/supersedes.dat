5|$|While it {{was long}} thought that the Chinese had {{developed}} the blast furnace and cast iron as their first method of iron production, Donald Wagner (the author of the above referenced study) has published a more recent paper that <b>supersedes</b> some of the statements in the earlier work; the newer paper still places {{the date of the}} first cast-iron artifacts at the 5th and 4th centuries BC, but also provides evidence of earlier bloomery furnace use, which migrated from China to Western parts and Central Asia during the beginning of the Chinese Bronze Age of the late Longshan culture (2000BC). He suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties. By the 11th century AD, the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to bituminous coal in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.|$|E

40|$|Uncertainty {{prevails}} in spatial databases whose objects {{are defined as}} multidimensional probable density function. Identifying an object is tedious task in uncertain spatial databases. Recent work on searching objects and its closeness to other objects was presented as <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor search technique. In <b>superseding</b> neighbor search, one of all other objects in the spatial database, which was more close to the querying point is called as <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor object. However there are cases where no object was unavailable to <b>supersede</b> to all other nearest neighbor object, ambiguity arises. To overcomes the situation of ambiguity, in this paper Marginal Object Weight(MOW) is introduced to all nearest neighbor object for any respective query point, from there on most highly ranked object is identified as <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor object. The performance of MOW ranking on nearest neighbor search is carried out for optimal amount of query point in the spatial databases of real and synthetic dataset. The <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor object obtained with MOW ranking scheme identify more optimal to the query points {{compared to that of}} unranked <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor object search scheme...|$|R

40|$|When agents violate norms, {{they are}} {{typically}} {{judged to be}} more of a cause of resulting outcomes. In this paper, we suggest that norm violations also affect the causality attributed to other agents, a phenomenon we refer to as ‘‘causal <b>superseding.</b> ’’ We propose and test a counterfactual reasoning model of this phenomenon in four experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 provide an initial demonstration of the causal <b>superseding</b> effect and distinguish it from previously studied effects. Experiment 3 shows that this causal <b>superseding</b> effect is dependent on a particular event structure, following a prediction of our counterfactual model. Experiment 4 demonstrates that causal <b>superseding</b> can occur with violations of non-moral norms. We propose a model of the <b>superseding</b> effect based on the idea of counterfactual sufficiency...|$|R
