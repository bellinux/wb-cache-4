40|$|Background and Aim: Regional (<b>saddle</b> <b>block)</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in {{anorectal}} {{and some}} urological and gynaecological procedures provides suitable {{conditions for the}} surgeon due to the sufficiency of analgesia and decreases {{the side effects of}} spinal anaesthesia. In this study, duration of the painless period and complications after saddle block with Meperidine (pethidine) were assessed in perineal surgeries. Materials and Methods:This study was conducted on 50 cases observed by the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class I, II(21 - 70 years old patients), who were scheduled to undergo anorectal surgery. All patients received 500 ml of crystalloid solution. The saddle block was done with 30 mg pethidine and sub arachnoid puncture was performed with the patient in the sitting position. Vital signs were recorded 5 minutes before the block and at the 5 th, 10 th, 15 th and 60 th minutes after the block. The severity of postoperative pain was assessed by a visual analog scale. The data was analyzed by appropriate descriptive statistical methods. Results: The mean period of analgesia was more than 24 hours in 18 % of the patients. The VAS pain score showed no pain in 78 % of the patients. Sixteen percent of the patients complained of itching in the nose, face and chest, ten minutes after injection and it continued for about two hours. Conclusions: This study showed that the haemodynamic stability and quality of postoperative analgesia with pethidine was good, without any need for additional analgesia. We suggested using low dosage pethidine (30 mg) as saddle block for perineal and anorectal surgeries...|$|E

40|$|Carotid surgery must be preventive; {{therefore}} cerebral protection {{procedures have}} been the centre of interest for a decade. Nowadays local cervical <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> seems to have changed {{the terms of the}} problem allowing achieve the aim of "no risk surgery". Therefore we considered our 16 year experience (352 carotids operated on 290 patients). Since 1990 we employed cervical <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> In order to ratify as much as possible the two groups of comparison, considering that we adopted some exclusion criteria, we compared the results of the first hundred carotids that underwent surgery with general anaesthesia and the first hundred operated using cervical <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Since we adopted cervical <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> there was no need of intra-operative monitoring systems because we considered exclusively the patients' clinical answer to preclamping. The use of shunt decreased from 9 % to 3 %. Surgery performed in cervical <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> gives a positive impression. This {{is due to the fact}} that there is not only a significant reduction of the morbidity rate, especially from a neurologic point of view, but also a reduction of the post-operation hospital stay. Furthermore there is also a better organization of the surgical phases. Direct monitoring of the cerebral function allows a precise analysis of the peri-operatory neurological events. In conclusion our study suggests that cervical <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> allows clinical benefits for the patient as far as safety is concerned being also more convenient under the economic point of view...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} effects of intratracheal general {{anesthesia}} (ITGA) and regional (<b>saddle</b> <b>block)</b> anesthesia on leptin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cortisol blood concentrations during anorectal surgery. Methods: Fifty-eight patients suffering from hemorrhoidal disease, pilonidal sinus, anal fissure, or anal fistula were included the study. Patients were randomly assigned {{into one of the}} two groups (n[*]=[*] 29). Patients in one group received ITGA. After thiopental and fentanyl induction, vecuronium was used as a muscle relaxant. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. In the other group we applied <b>saddle</b> <b>block,</b> injecting hyperbaric bupivacaine into the subarachnoid space, through the L 3 -L 4 intervertebral space, in the sitting position. Blood samples were collected for leptin, CRP, and cortisol analysis before the induction of anesthesia at 3 and 24 hours postoperatively. Results: Preoperative leptin, CRP, and cortisol concentrations were comparable between the groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} postoperative levels of leptin and CRP in both groups. Although not significant, leptin and CRP concentrations were lower in the <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> group at three hours postoperatively (mean[*]±[*]SD, 6. 95 [*]±[*] 8. 59 and 6. 02 [*]±[*] 12. 25, respectively) than in the ITGA group (mean[*]±[*]SD, 9. 04 [*]±[*] 9. 89 and 8. 40 [*]±[*] 15. 75, respectively). During early postoperative period, cortisol increased slightly in the ITGA group and remained at similar level in the <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> group, but later decreased in both groups.

40|$|Background: Spinal {{anesthesia}} is {{the technique}} of choice in transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). The major complication of spinal technique is risk of hypotension. <b>Saddle</b> <b>block</b> paralyzed pelvic muscles and sacral nerve roots and hemodynamic derangement is less. Aims and objectives: To compare the hemodynamic changes and adequate surgical condition between <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> and subarachnoid block for TURP. Material and methods: Ninety patients of aged between 50 to 70 years of ASA-PS I, II scheduled for TURP were randomly allocated into 2 groups of 45 in each group. Group A patients were received spinal (2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine) and Group B were received <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> (2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine). Baseline systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation were recorded and measured subsequently. The height of block was noted in both groups. Hypotension was corrected by administration of phenylephrine 50 mcg bolus and total requirement of vasopressor was noted. Complications (volume overload, TURP syndrome etc.) were noted. Results: Incidence of hypotension and vasopressor requirement was less (P < 0. 01) in Gr B patients. Adequate surgical condition was achieved in both groups. There was no incidence of volume overload, TURP syndrome, and bladder perforation.

40|$|Objective: A {{survey of}} European dental schools was {{conducted}} in 2006 to determine the curricular structure, techniques and materials used in local anaesthesia teaching to dental students. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was designed to collect information about local anaesthesia education. The questionnaires {{were sent to the}} Dean of each dental school in Europe and Israel; 49 returned the completed survey, resulting in a response rate of 18. 4 %. Results: Results from this survey show that dental schools are managing local anaesthesia education in different ways. At most schools, theoretical teaching begins {{during the first half of}} the third year (41 %), half a year before the practical instruction (43 %). In 37 % of the dental schools, students use non-human objects to practice before they inject an anaesthetic in humans. The first injection in humans, usually a fellow student (61 %), is mostly supervised by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon (65 %). The number of injections under supervision usually depends on the individual capabilities of the student (41 %). Ten per cent of the schools need permission of a medical ethics committee for the practical instruction on fellow students. All dental curricula include teaching of mandibular <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> The majority also include instruction of infiltration anaesthesia of the upper (98 %) and lower (92 %) jaws in addition to infra-orbital <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (57 %). Although 82 % of the schools are satisfied with the current curriculum with regard to local anaesthesia, 43 % are planning changes, frequently the introduction of preclinical training models.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{influence}} of anaesthetic technique on perioperative complications in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Material and methods: In a retrospective study of 1020 consecutive patients who underwent carotid artery surgery over 10 years, perioperative neurologic and cardiologic complications {{and the use of}} an internal carotid artery shunt were compared in 337 patients (33 %) treated under general anaesthesia nad 683 (67 %) under cervical block. The two groups had similar characteristics. The most frequent surgical indication eas symptomatic carotid artery disease (91. 5 %). The remaining patients had asymptomatic severe internal carotid lesions (> 70 %). Results: The overall perioperative stroke rate was 1. 9 %, the death-stroke rate 0. 7 % and the cardiac complication rate 0. 8 %. The perioperative stroke rate was higher in the general anaesthesia group than in the cervical block group (3. 2 % vs 1. 3 %, p = 0. 01). Cardia complication rates were similar in the two groups. A carotid artery shunt was used in 75 patients (22 %) receiving general anaesthesia and in 92 patients (13 %) receiving cervical block (p = 0. 0004). The causes of stroke in the cervical block group were intraoperative embolism (4 cases, 26 %), perioperative thromboembolism (7 cases, 58 %) and clamping ischaemia (1 cases, 16 %). Mechanisms causing stroke in the general anaesthesia group remained unidentified or uncertain. Conclusions: Cervical <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> yields better perioperative results than general anaesthesia probably because it allows more reliable cerebral monitoring, reducing or even eliminating perioperative strokes related to champing ischaemia. It facilitates detection of the mechanism underlying intraoperative stroke allowing surgical techniques and intraoperative management to be modified accordingly.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this dissertation is to compare the influence of general <b>anaesthesia</b> and interscalene <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> on thyroid hormones and cortisol levels during elective shoulder surgery, {{as well as in}} the early postoperative period (within 48 hours after the surgery). Secondary objectives of the research include: comparison of hemodynamic parameters (non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate and frequency measured every 5 minutes during surgery) between the two anaesthesia techniques; comparison of non-specific inflammatory parameters (white blood cells, C-reactive protein) and glycaemia between the two anaesthesia techniques as well as individual times of measurement; comparison of postoperative pain by Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) during rest and movement; comparison of analgesic expenditure within 48 hours after surgery; comparison of early complications related to the anaesthesia techniques (nausea, vomiting, hemodynamic instability, respiratory failure); comparison of patient satisfaction between the two anaesthesia techniques; comparison of early physical therapy starting time and length of hospital stay between the two groups. A total of 66 patients were analysed in this research. The patients were randomized into two groups: general anaesthesia, GA (33 patients) and interscalene <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> ISB (33 patients). Due to failure of brachial plexus <b>block</b> (incomplete <b>anaesthesia),</b> 3 patients from the ISBA group were excluded from the research. The results obtained in this research indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in TSH, T 3, T 4 and cortisol levels between the groups at all times of measurements, with lower levels in the ISB group (P < 0. 001). T 3 levels were found as lower, which was statistically significant in general anaesthesia group (P < 0. 001), while there was no notable T 3 level changes found. There were no statistically significant differences in free T 3 and T 4 levels, with the exception of lower FT 3 levels in the regional anaesthesia group after the second measurement (P = 0. 012). There is a statistically significant difference in glycaemia and non-specific inflammatory parameters levels between the two groups, whereas the patients in the ISB group had notably lower levels (P < 0. 001). Postoperative nausea and vomiting were significantly less common after interscalene <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (P < 0. 001). Postoperative pain control was found as more adequate in patients that received regional anaesthesia which was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Opioid analgesic expenditure was less common among patients in the ISBA group which was also found as statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Within this study, a statistically significant difference was also found in intraoperative hemodynamic stability between the groups, whereas ISB provided a more adequate hemodynamic stability (P < 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference found in postoperative hemodynamic stability values as well as in respiratory insufficiency values between the two groups. There is a statistically significant difference regarding the starting time of early physical therapy. ISBA patients begun with the therapy sooner than the ones from the GA group (P < 0. 001). Patient satisfaction was higher among patients in the ISBA group which was found as statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Length of hospital stay was considerably shorter for patients in the ISBA group (P < 0. 001). It can be concluded that the interscalene brachial plexus block in surgical reconstruction of rotator cuff results in minor alterations of thyroid hormones and cortisol levels in serum during surgery and early postoperative period; minor alterations of glycaemia and non-specific inflammatory parameters; better pain control; earlier physical therapy starting time; better patient satisfaction; less common nausea and vomiting; better intraoperative hemodynamic stability and shorter length of hospital stay...|$|R

40|$|Tourniquet cuff pain is a {{significant}} cause of morbidity following regional anaesthesia of the upper limb. We describe a simple new technique for effectively anaesthetizing the area under a pneumatic tourniquet (the “mini-Bier’s block”), which permits comfortable surgery under axillary <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> even if the local block is incomplete. We report a controlled study of 40 patients in whom statistically significant tourniquet cuff pain relief was obtained in patients receiving an additional low-dose intravenous injection of local anaesthetic localized beneath the cuff.

40|$|The {{majority}} of children, even those well prepared and with positive attitudes, experiences {{stress in the}} operating theatre and during the postoperative period. In some cases, the stress is even stronger for their parents. The role of anaesthetists is to minimize the unpleasant sensations by providing painless vein cannulation, uneventful induction of anaesthesia, suitably planned and timed analgesia, and prevention of postoperative vomiting. The effectiveness of combined analgesics, early administration of saturating doses and analgesia supplemented or based on methods of <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> – particularly on peripheral and local blocks, less appreciated in children, have been highlighted. Such a stress-reducing strategy should be initiated before hospitalisation and consistently continued to its completion or even longer, the example of which are one-day surgery patients who should receive prescriptions for or suitable drugs (mainly analgesics) on discharge {{for use in the}} home setting.

5000|$|Pudendal {{anesthesia}}, {{also known}} as a pudendal <b>block,</b> or <b>saddle</b> <b>block,</b> is a form of local anesthesia commonly used in the practice of obstetrics to relieve pain during the delivery of baby by forceps. The pudendal nerve block prevents fainting during forceps delivery which was common before pudendal nerve block use was available. The anesthesia is produced by blocking the pudendal nerves near the ischial spine of the pelvis. [...] The ischial spine separates the greater and lesser sciatic foramina at the exit of the bony pelvis. Pelvis in Latin means 'saucepan' and one can view the bony human pelvis as a saucepan, with circular/cylidrical walls, but without a base and a flailed upper rim, or wings to which the gluteal muscles (hip bone stabilisers) attach.

The main diagnostic procedures were urethrocystoscopy (n =  222), and cystoscopy alone (n =  116), cystoscopy and biopsy (n =  46) while the therapeutic procedures were direct visual internal urethrotomy (n =  86), endoscopic cystolitholapaxy (n =  10), and rigid retrograde endoscopic realignment (n =  7) for posterior urethral injury. The main <b>anaesthesia</b> was caudal <b>block</b> in 472 patients and topical 2 % xylocaine jelly with sedation in 86 patients. Conclusions: There is a steady increase in therapeutic day case endourology. Caudal anaesthesia provides effective pain free procedure to the patient.

40|$|Background: The {{sciatic nerve}} {{is the large}} stand {{thickest}} branch of lumbosacral plexus. It has a long course in the pelvic cavity and in the lower extremity. It separates into its two branches, the tibial and common peroneal nerves outside the pelvis. But the division can occur at any level from the sacral plexus to the inferior part of the popliteal fossa. These anatomical variations in division may cause nerve compression resulting in sciatica, piriformis syndrome, and coccygodynia. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to observe the variations in division of sciatic nerve as compared to known facts. Methods: The study was performed on cadavers. The inferior extremities of 45 cadavers were examined and variations of division of sciatic nerve were noted and classified. Results: The highest incidence of sciatic nerve variation was observed in its termination. In 11. 11 % of cases the sciatic nerve was found to be divided in the gluteal region. In 11. 11 %specimens, the common peroneal nerve pierced the piriformis muscle. Conclusion: The higher division of sciatic nerve can result in the involvement of only one out of the two divisions for the sciatic neuropathy. It is important to consider the higher divisions while performing opliteal <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia...</b>|$|R
40|$|The use {{of passive}} {{stretching}} of the elbow after arthrolysis is controversial. We report {{the results of}} open arthrolysis in 81 patients. Prospectively collected outcome data with a minimum follow-up of one year were analysed. All patients had sustained an intra-articular fracture initially and all procedures were performed by the same surgeon under continuous brachial plexus <b>block</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and with continuous passive movement (CPM) used post-operatively {{for two to three}} days. CPM was used to maintain the movement achieved during surgery and passive stretching was not used at any time. A senior physiotherapist assessed all the patients at regular intervals. The mean range of movement (ROM) improved from 69 ° to 109 ° and the function and pain of the upper limb improved from 32 to 16 and from 20 to 10, as assessed by the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand score and a visual analogue scale, respectively. The greatest improvement was obtained in the stiffest elbows: nine patients with a pre-operative ROM < 30 ° achieved a mean post-operative ROM of 92 ° (55 ° to 125 °). This study demonstrates that in patients with a stiff elbow after injury, good results may be obtained after open elbow arthrolysis without using passive stretching during rehabilitation...|$|R
