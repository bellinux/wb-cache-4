25|$|The {{reason for}} the long gap between {{approval}} and completion was an alarming escalation of costs that beset all major North American projects in the 1970s. High inflation multiplied budgets for practically {{every aspect of the}} <b>Syncrude</b> project.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-two {{jet fuel}} samples of varying {{properties}} were produced from shale oil and coal <b>syncrudes,</b> and analyzed {{to assess their}} suitability for use. TOSCO II shale oil and H-COAL and COED <b>syncrudes</b> were used as starting materials. The processes used were among those commonly in use in petroleum processing-distillation, hydrogenation and catalytic hydrocracking. The processing conditions required to meet two levels of specifications regarding aromatic, hydrogen, sulfur and nitrogen contents at two yield levels were determined and {{found to be more}} demanding than normally required in petroleum processing. Analysis of the samples produced indicated that if the more stringent specifications of 13. 5 % hydrogen (min.) and 0. 02 % nitrogen (max.) were met, products similar in properties to conventional jet fuels were obtained. In general, shale oil was easier to process (catalyst deactivation was seen when processing coal <b>syncrudes),</b> consumed less hydrogen and yielded superior products. Based on these considerations, shale oil appears to be preferred to coal as a petroleum substitute for jet fuel production...|$|R
50|$|Bantrel's parent company, Bechtel Corporation, was {{involved}} in oil sands development early. Bechtel designed and constructed the Great Canadian Oil Sands upgrader in 1962, which is now Suncor Energy. Bechtel also developed <b>Syncrude's</b> upgrading facilities.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the technical problems in the conversion of {{a significant portion of}} a barrel of either a shale oil or a coal synthetic crude oil into a suitable aviation turbine fuel. Three <b>syncrudes</b> were used, one from shale and two from coal, chosen as representative of typical crudes from future commercial production. The material was used to produce jet fuels of varying specifications by distillation, hydrotreating, and hydrocracking. Attention is given to process requirements, hydrotreating process conditions, the methods used to analyze the final products, the conditions for shale oil processing, and the coal liquid processing conditions. The results of the investigation show that jet fuels of defined specifications can be made from oil shale and coal <b>syncrudes</b> using readily available commercial processes...|$|R
25|$|In the 1960s Great Canadian Oil Sands, Ltd., a small, {{indigenous}} Canadian firm, {{relied on}} {{new technology and}} heavy capital investment to pioneer oil sand extraction in the Athabascan region. Unfavorable leasing terms from the provincial government and the strong financial risk inherent in the project forced the firm to seek an investment partner. The large American oil company Sun Oil Company took the risk, but as the investment burden on Sun increased, the company became compelled to assume both financial and managerial control of the operation. Thus, the native Canadian firm had to yield its autonomy {{as the price of}} pursuing a pioneering but complicated industrial project. In 1995 Sun sold its interest to Suncor Energy, based in Calgary. Suncor is second to <b>Syncrude</b> in the oil sands, but <b>Syncrude</b> is controlled by a consortium of international oil companies.|$|E
25|$|Cities Service later reapplied for a {{much larger}} plant, and the {{proposal}} received approval in late 1969. The <b>Syncrude</b> plant which resulted went on production exactly two centuries after Peter Pond's first sighting of the oil sands, in 1978. But before the plant shipped its first barrel of oil, the project went through many trials.|$|E
25|$|Few Canadian {{refineries}} can {{process more}} than {{small amounts of}} heavy oil, so production has traditionally gone to United States asphalt plants. This changed in the 1980s, however, with the announcement that construction would begin on two heavy oil upgraders. Like the plants at <b>Syncrude,</b> Suncor and Shell's Scotford facility near Edmonton, these refinery-like operations turn heavy oil and bitumen into lighter and lower-sulfur, more desirable crude.|$|E
5000|$|A {{third stage}} of {{expansion}} was undertaken between 2001 and 2006, {{in which a}} second train at the Aurora line came online and the Mildred Lake upgrader was expanded. The expansion added [...] to <b>Syncrude's</b> production ( [...] a year assuming this is average). The cost was $8.4 billion, a substantial cost overrun over the original estimate of $5.7 billion.|$|R

50|$|Scientific wunderkind Dr. Karl Clark, of the University of Alberta, {{ran out of}} room in the {{university}} basements, and human muscle to move the raw oilsand material he was researching at the University of Alberta, and thus he moved his washing machine, steam plant and other apparatus, to the ED&BC shop facilities in Edmonton. He continued to perfect his oil separation process which {{became the basis for}} modern-day Alberta's oilsands industry, demonstrated by <b>Syncrude's</b> vast operation in Fort McMurray.|$|R
25|$|Industry is {{the core}} force of oil sands development. The first major players, Suncor Energy and <b>Syncrude,</b> {{dominated}} the market until the 1990s. Currently there are 64 companies operating several hundred projects. The majority of production now comes from foreign-owned corporations, {{and the maintenance of}} a favourable climate for these corporations grants them strong influence; much stronger than that of non-productive stakeholders, such as citizens and environmental groups.|$|E
25|$|By 2013 {{there were}} nine oil sands mining {{projects}} in the Athabasca oil sands deposit: Suncor Energy Inc. (Suncor), <b>Syncrude</b> Canada Limited (Syncrude)'s Mildred Lake and Aurora North, Shell Canada Limited (Shell)'s Muskeg River and Jackpine, Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), Horizon, Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited (Imperial), Kearl Oil Sands Project (KOSP), Total E Canada Ltd. Joslyn North Mine and Fort Hills Energy Corporation (FHEC). In 2011 alone they produced over 52 million cubic metres of bitumen.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century, oil sands {{development}} in Canada started to take off, with an expansion at the Suncor mine, a new mine and expansion at <b>Syncrude,</b> and a new mine by Royal Dutch Shell associated with their new Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton. Three new large steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects were added – Foster Creek, Surmont, and MacKay River – by different companies, all of which have since been bought by larger companies.|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} {{survey of the}} properties of synfuels for ground-based gas turbine applications is presented. Four major concepts for converting coal into liquid fuels are described: solvent extraction, catalytic liquefaction, pyrolysis, and indirect liquefaction. Data on full range <b>syncrudes,</b> various distillate cuts, and upgraded products are presented for fuels derived from various processes, including H-coal, synthoil, solvent-refined coal, donor solvent, zinc chloride hydrocracking, co-steam, and flash pyrolysis. Some typical ranges of data for coal-derived low Btu gases are also presented...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{infrastructure}} for monitoring remote equipment and solving {{some of the}} logistic challenges of operating satellite surface mines is presented. This infrastructure includes strategies for communicating timely and accurate information amongst operators, planners and supervisors, using off-the-shelf network protocols. Advanced data visualization techniques are implemented, so users can find information easily in a familiar format. A computerized excavator test-bed was developed to demonstrate performance and diagnostic monitoring systems, {{as well as other}} operator assisted systems. Results to date, including data from the <b>Syncrude's</b> mine site, are presented. ...|$|R
50|$|Installed {{capacity}} reached 12,834 MW in 2009, with coal (5,692 MW) {{and natural}} gas (5,189 MW) representing {{the bulk of the}} province's generation fleet. Recent additions to the grid have increased wind capacity to 657 MW, while hydroelectric capacity stands at 900 MW. Despite tougher new emission measures announced by the federal government in June 2010, industry officials believe the province will continue using coal to generate electricity into 2050. <b>Syncrude's</b> Mildred Lake and Aurora North Plant Sites, the coal fired Sundance Power Station and the coal fired Genesee Generating Station are the top three sources of greenhouse gases in Canada.|$|R
25|$|A {{large number}} of oil sands mines are {{currently}} in operation and more are in the stages of approval or development. The <b>Syncrude</b> Canada mine was the second to open in 1978, Shell Canada opened its Muskeg River mine (Albian Sands) in 2003 and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNRL) opened its Horizon Oil Sands project in 2009. Newer mines include Shell Canada's Jackpine mine, Imperial Oil's Kearl Oil Sands Project, the Synenco Energy (now owned by Total S.A.) Northern Lights mine, and Suncor's Fort Hills mine.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} the world was in the thralls of an energy crisis. Beginning in 1973, {{the members of the}} Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had taken {{advantage}} of tight world oil supplies to rapidly and regularly increase prices. Policy-makers in the oil consuming countries therefore considered it a matter of national urgency to develop stable, secure energy supplies. Because the resource was so large and development was clearly possible, the oil sands looked like Canada's best bet. As a result, the prospect that the <b>Syncrude</b> project would collapse was a matter of both political and economic concern.|$|E
25|$|In Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce {{synthetic}} crude oil {{and a variety of}} other products: The Suncor Energy upgrader near Fort McMurray, Alberta produces {{synthetic crude}} oil plus diesel fuel; the <b>Syncrude</b> Canada, Canadian Natural Resources, and Nexen upgraders near Fort McMurray produce {{synthetic crude oil}}; and the Shell Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery. A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near Redwater, Alberta, will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{stability}} breakpoint {{temperatures are}} shown for 32 jet fuels prepared from oil shale and coal <b>syncrudes</b> by {{various degrees of}} hydrogenation. Low severity hydrotreated shale oils, with nitrogen contents of 0. 1 to 0. 24 weight percent, had breakpoint temperatures in the 477 to 505 K (400 to 450 F) range. Higher severity treatment, lowering nitrogen levels to 0. 008 to 0. 017 weight percent, resulted in breakpoint temperatures in the 505 to 533 K (450 to 500 F) range. Coal derived fuels showed generally increasing breakpoint temperatures with increasing weight percent hydrogen, fuels below 13 weight percent hydrogen having breakpoints below 533 K (500 F).

Recently, rapid high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods have been proposed for hydrocarbon group type analysis, with some suggestion for their use as a replacement of the FIA technique. Two of these methods were used to analyze some of the samples, and these results are also presented and compared. Two samples of petroleum-based Jet A fuel are similarly analyzed...|$|R
