5|$|The {{new head}} of state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces and of the ruling <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council.</b> He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of a {{coalition}} of Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored {{by any of the}} involved Arab states, such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and the Palestine Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the Palestinian National Council (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him staking command of al-Assifa, holding major positions in the PNC, and the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> of the PLO. He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.|$|E

50|$|Yar'Adua also {{guided the}} <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council's</b> {{initiatives}} on local government reforms {{which led to}} the conduct of local government elections in 1976. The local government reforms excluded traditional rulers from certain governance issues and limited their control over property rights. The reforms also granted recognition to local government as a third tier arm of government.|$|R
50|$|The FSA's formal {{leader is}} its Commander-in-Chief Colonel Riad al-Asaad; however, the army's {{effective}} military leader is its <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Councils</b> Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Abdul-Ilah al-Bashir. Beneath General al-Bashir {{there are five}} deputy chief of staffs who {{are in charge of}} five different regions of Syria. Two of these deputy chiefs of staff are Abdelbasset Tawil from Idlib Governorate and Abdelqader Saleh from Aleppo Governorate.|$|R

25|$|In December 2013, the Islamic Front, mainly {{composing}} of Ahrar ash-Sham, {{took over}} several bases at the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing from the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> {{and removed the}} FSA's revolutionary flags. The Islamist fighters captured some SMC guards and seized thousands of small arms and ammunition. As a result, the Islamic Front withdrew from the SMC.|$|E
25|$|Trotsky {{was one of}} {{the first}} Bolshevik leaders to {{recognize}} the problem, and he pushed for the formation of a military council of former Russian generals that would function as an advisory body. Lenin and the Bolshevik Central Committee agreed on 4 March to create the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council,</b> headed by former chief of the imperial General Staff Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich.|$|E
50|$|Former {{commander}} of 3rd Corps, Mustafa Ethem Erdağı, who {{also served as}} {{commander of}} ISAF in Afghanistan, was tried before a military court for allegations of abusing of his power while on duty at the 8th Corps in a construction tender held in the years 2002-2003. In May 2007, he was convicted for corruption to eleven and half months in prison. Erdağı became so the highest-ranked military officer in Turkey to be prisoned. He was forced to retire by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council's</b> annual meeting in August 2007.|$|R
50|$|Akufo-Addo's {{participation}} in politics {{began in the}} late 1970s when he joined the People's Movement for Freedom and Justice, an organization formed to oppose the General Acheampong-led <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council's</b> Union Government proposals. In May 1995, he was among a broad group of elites who formed Alliance for Change, an alliance that organized demonstrations against neo-liberal policies such as the introduction of Value Added Tax and human rights violations of the Rawlings presidency. The broad-based opposition alliance later collapsed as the elite leaders jostled for leadership positions. In the 1990s, he formed a civil rights organization called Ghana's Committee on Human and People's Rights.|$|R
50|$|Presidential {{elections}} {{were held in}} South Korea on 15 October 1963. They were the first elections since the 1961 May Coup, and the first during the Third Republic. The result was a narrow victory for the acting incumbent {{and leader of the}} governing <b>military</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Council</b> for National Reconstruction, Park Chung Hee, who won 46.6% of the vote, securing a transition to civilian rule under his Democratic Republican Party. Voter turnout was 85.0%.|$|R
25|$|In August 1985, Major General Buhari {{was overthrown}} in a coup led by General Ibrahim Babangida {{and other members}} of the ruling <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> (SMC). Babangida brought many of Buhari's most vocal critics into his administration, {{including}} Fela Kuti's brother Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, a doctor who had led a strike against Buhari to protest declining health care services. Buhari was then detained in Benin City until 1988.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{after years}} of {{political}} pressure from the United States and the human rights community, Peru’s <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> overturned Berenson’s treason conviction and life sentence and remanded her case to the civilian court for retrial. On June 20, 2001, a three-judge panel convicted Berenson of collaboration with terrorists, but ruled {{she was not a}} terrorist. She was sentenced to 20 years, with consideration given for time already served under her prior conviction.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> (SMC) held an {{unofficial}} {{meeting in the}} afternoon. It was also attended {{by a number of}} other officers, including Kashii, Yamashita, Kawashima and Hajime Sugiyama, Vice Chief of Staff. The SMC, while a prestigious part of the army, had little function in peacetime and had therefore become a body to which high-ranking officers could be appointed without actually granting them power. For this reason, by 1936 a number of Kōdō-ha generals, including Araki and Mazaki, had been made members.|$|E
5|$|He {{served as}} the first head of the newly created Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce and Public Works from 2 March 1861 until 21 April. Although created by a decree of 1856 (following a {{suggestion}} made by Joaquim Inácio in 1851), the first professional firefighter corps in Brazil was effectively formed under his tenure {{at the head of}} the Ministry of Agriculture. The cabinet resigned on 24 May 1862 after losing its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (the national legislature's lower house). Joaquim Inácio returned to his position on the naval council on 2 July and left that post when he became a member of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> and Justice <b>Council</b> on 2 October 1864.|$|R
5000|$|The May 16 coup (...) was a {{military}} coup d'état in South Korea in 1961, organized and carried out by Park Chung-hee and his allies who formed the Military Revolutionary Committee, nominally led by Army Chief of Staff Chang Do-yong after the latter's acquiescence {{on the day of}} the coup. The coup rendered powerless the democratically elected government of Yun Bo-seon and ended the Second Republic, installing a reformist <b>military</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Council</b> for National Reconstruction effectively led by Park, who took over as Chairman after General Chang's arrest in July.|$|R
5000|$|The National Intelligence Service (NIS) (대한민국국가정보원, 국정원) is {{the chief}} {{intelligence}} agency of South Korea. The agency was officially established in 1961 as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) (...) , during the rule of President Park Chung-hee's <b>military</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Council</b> for National Reconstruction, which displaced the Second Republic of South Korea. The original duties of the KCIA were to supervise and coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities and criminal investigation by all government intelligence agencies, including that of the military. The agency's broad powers allowed it to actively intervene in politics.|$|R
25|$|In September 1918, the Bolshevik government, facing {{continuous}} military difficulties, declared {{what amounted}} to martial law and reorganized the Red Army. The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> was abolished and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by {{the commander of the}} Latvian Riflemen, Ioakim Vatsetis (a.k.a. Jukums Vācietis), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of day-to-day operations of the army while Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.|$|E
25|$|It {{is alleged}} that the Akıncı AFB was the command center of the pro-coup military. At 22:00 hours local time on July 15, 2016, Akın Öztürk, a four-star General in the Turkish Air Force {{and a member of}} the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council,</b> who served as the 30th Commander of the Turkish Air Force between 2013 and 2015, {{reportedly}} started the coup d'état in Ankara by ordering of F-16 jet fighters of the 141st squadron to take off. The operation was led by Air Pilot Staff Lieutenant colonel Hakan Karakuş, who is the son-in-law of Akın Öztürk. The personnel of the 141st squadron had been sent home in the afternoon with the remark that their duty terminated earlier on that day.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1918, Trotsky's {{resignation}} as Commissar for Foreign Affairs {{was officially}} accepted, {{and he was}} appointed People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs – in place of Podvoisky – {{and chairman of the}} <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council.</b> The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over Brest-Litovsk. With the help of his deputy Ephraim Sklyansky, Trotsky {{spent the rest of the}} Civil War transforming the Red Army from a ragtag network of small and fiercely independent detachments into a large and disciplined military machine, through forced conscription, party-controlled blocking squads, compulsory obedience and officers chosen by the leadership instead of the rank and file. He defended these positions throughout his life.|$|E
50|$|Peiping National <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> was the Republic of China's <b>supreme</b> <b>military</b> {{command in}} charge of the National Revolutionary Army forces in Northern China in the 1930s prior to the {{beginning}} of the Second Sino-Japanese War. As its name implies it was located in Peiping.|$|R
50|$|Initially, a new {{administration}} was formed from among those military officers who supported Park. The reformist <b>military</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Council</b> for National Reconstruction was nominally led by General Chang. Following Chang's arrest in July 1961, Park took overall control of the council. The coup was largely welcomed by a general populace exhausted by political chaos. Although Prime Minister Chang and United States Army General Carter Magruder resisted the coup efforts, President Yun sided with the military and persuaded the United States Eighth Army and the commanders of various ROK army units not {{to interfere with the}} new government. Soon after the coup, Park was promoted to Lieutenant General.|$|R
5000|$|The Revolutionary <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> (Революционный Военный Совет), {{sometimes}} called the Revolutionary War Council or Revvoyensoviet (...) , was the <b>supreme</b> <b>military</b> authority of Soviet Russia and later the Soviet Union. It was instituted on September 2, 1918 by decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK), known as the [...] "Decree Declaring the Soviet Republic Military Camp".|$|R
25|$|The National Armada (later {{known as}} the Brazilian Navy), informally known as Imperial Armada, {{appeared}} with {{the independence of the}} country. The Armada was formed almost entirely by ships, staff, organizations and doctrines proceeding from the transference of the Portuguese Royal Family in 1808. Some of its members were native-born Brazilians, who under Portugal had been forbidden to serve. Other members were Portuguese who adhered to the cause of separation and foreign mercenaries. Some establishments created by King João VI of Portugal were used and incorporated such as the Department of Navy, Headquarters of the Navy, the Intendancy and Accounting Department, the Arsenal (Shipyard) of the Navy, the Academy of Navy Guards, the Naval Hospital, the Auditorship, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council,</b> the powder plant, and others. The Brazilian-born Captain Luís da Cunha Moreira was chosen as the first minister of the Navy on 28 October 1822.|$|E
25|$|Tension between FSA {{groups and}} ISIL had been high since ISIL {{attacked}} and captured the FSA-held border town of Azaz north of Aleppo {{and the nearby}} Bab al-Salameh border crossing with Turkey (which served as an important supply route for rebel forces), between 18–23 September 2013. The conflict was renewed over Azaz in early October 2013, and in late November ISIL captured the border town of Atme from the Hawks of Islam Brigade. This came after infighting between the brigade and other FSA groups in the town. During the battle, activists accused the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> of collaborating with ISIL against the Hawks of Islam. On 31 December 2013, the body of Dr. Hussein Suleiman was handed over in a prisoner swap between ISIL and rival rebel forces. Suleiman was tortured, and died, in ISIL custody. The opposition National Coalition and activists accused ISIL of serving {{the interests of the}} Ba'athist Syrian government by tarnishing the image of their uprising.|$|E
25|$|John's {{policies}} led to far-reaching economic changes, {{beginning with}} the opening of the ports and the abolition of the Portuguese commercial monopolies, with the United Kingdom being the great beneficiary. On the one hand, traders based in Brazil had to face strong foreign competition; on the other, it encouraged the creation of new manufacturing and other economic activities that were previously banned, poor or nonexistent in Brazil. At the same time, he created such high-level administrative bodies as the War Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry of Marine and Overseas; the Councils of State and of Finance, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council,</b> the Military Archive, the Bureaus of Justice and of Conscience and Orders, the Casa de Suplicação (Supreme Court), the Intendency General of Police, the first Bank of Brazil the Royal Board of Commerce, Agriculture, Factories and Navigation, and the General Postal Administration, as well as bringing Brazilians into administrative and staff positions, which helped diminish tensions between the natives and the Portuguese. He also encouraged agricultural production, especially cotton, rice and sugar cane, opened roads and encouraged the development of inland waterways, stimulating the movement of people, goods and products between regions.|$|E
40|$|The popular uprisings {{that swept}} Egypt and Tunisia this winter were remarkably similar, but their {{immediate}} outcomes {{have been quite}} different. In Tunisia, civilian politicians and technocrats quickly took {{the helm of the}} country {{in the wake of the}} revolution. In Egypt, by contrast, the <b>military’s</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Council</b> is slated to rule the nation for six months, and whether it stays in power or returns to the barracks, it will surely try to ensure that civilians do not subordinate its role in politics. Given the nature and history of the two countries’ militaries, this divergence is not surprising. Still, Egypt’s military may not have the stranglehold on power that many think, and a real Tunisian solution [...] a civilian government free of military involvement [...] could form in Egypt as well...|$|R
50|$|In September 1977 Habré started {{negotiating}} {{an alliance}} with the Malloum and the <b>Military</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Council</b> {{for the formation of}} a national unity government, that was created in August 1978 with Malloum as president and Habré as Prime minister. At the same time Goukouni consolidated his positions in the north, united most of the insurgent formations, including the first army of the FROLINAT and the majority of the CCFAN. All these formations united under the banner of the newly formed People's Armed Forces (FAP), led by Goukouni, who conquered Faya-Largeau in February 1979, assuming control of half the Chadian territory. His advance towards the capital seemed unstoppable, and only the intervention of the French army made it possible to block him at Ati, less than 300 miles north of N'Djamena.|$|R

2500|$|The final {{collapse}} of the provisional non-Islamist government came at 2pm 11 February when the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Council</b> declared itself [...] "neutral in the current political disputes… {{in order to prevent}} further disorder and bloodshed." [...] All military personnel were ordered back to their bases, effectively yielding control of the entire country to Khomeini. Revolutionaries took over government buildings, TV and radio stations, and palaces of the Pahlavi dynasty, marking the end of the monarchy in Iran. Bakhtiar escaped the palace under a hail of bullets, fleeing Iran in disguise. He was later assassinated by an agent of the Islamic Republic in 1991 in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Ali is very {{critical}} of the <b>military</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Council</b> of the Armed Forces (SCAF). He has accused them of propaganda and state-media manipulation surrounding the election. He advises the military to maintain {{its relationship with the}} Egyptian populace and not to parrot the police, who lost its favor. He spoke out against military ownership of industry and the means of production. Ali has criticized economic assets accumulated by SCAF, championing the need to renationalise factories and other assets. [...] "It is precisely this plethora of institutions they own that prevents them from properly carrying out their mandate," [...] he argued. One particular example Ali criticizes is foreign exploitation of 120 of Egypt's gold mines, saying use and development of the nation's mineral wealth should be planned and not become a means for foreign companies to benefit. He also says the army should turn factories and economic projects over to the public sector and let the unemployed work, rather than conscripts.|$|R
