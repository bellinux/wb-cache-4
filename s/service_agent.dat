40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{adaptive}} efficient job scheduling service model on Grids using multi agent systems and a market like Service level Agreement (SLA) negotiation protocol based on the Contract Net model. This job scheduling service model involves four types of agents: <b>service</b> user <b>agents,</b> <b>service</b> provider <b>agents,</b> local scheduler agents and inter-grid <b>agents.</b> <b>Service</b> provider <b>agents</b> provide <b>services</b> to <b>service</b> user <b>agents</b> by allocating resources using local scheduler <b>agents.</b> <b>Service</b> provider <b>agents</b> provide <b>services</b> to <b>service</b> user <b>agents</b> by allocating resources using local scheduler <b>agents.</b> The <b>service</b> provider <b>agents</b> may contact the inter-grid agents if enough resources are not available in their own grid. Inter-grid agents provide resources from the neighboring grid. The <b>service</b> provider <b>agent</b> may adapt the dedicated service according to its interactions with <b>service</b> user <b>agent.</b> The SLA negotiation protocol is a hierarchical bidding mechanism involving negotiations between the four agents. In this protocol, the agents exchange SLA announcements, SLA-bid, and SLA-awards to negotiate the schedule of jobs on Grid Compute resources. To deal {{with the presence of}} uncertainties, renegotiation is used to allow the agents to re-negotiate the SLA in failur...|$|R
