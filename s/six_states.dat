5|$|By October22, over 72,000people were {{housed in}} 560shelters nationwide. Additional {{evacuations}} occurred after further floods impacted Tabasco {{weeks after the}} initial deluge, and by October25, 94,203people were staying in 896shelters. The Mexican Department of Health declared a sanitary alert in <b>six</b> <b>states,</b> and 354medical teams operated in 894communities to assist 50,000homes. The Secretaría de Gobernación declared Tabasco, Veracruz, Hidalgo and Puebla as disaster areas, which allocated federal funding for relief. The National Fund for Natural Disasters allocated $234million (2.34billion pesos) in emergency relief, including $41.5million (400million pesos) in Oaxaca where the earthquake previously struck; this was smaller than the flood's damage total. The repair cost in Puebla alone was estimated at $200million (1.83billion pesos), which was largely completed within two years and dealt with repairing roads and protecting cities from landslide and flood mitigation.|$|E
5|$|Flooding {{caused by}} Connie {{generally}} did not attract much media attention; however, the floods were important {{in setting the}} conditions for later significant flooding across the northeastern United States. Just five days after Connie struck North Carolina, Hurricane Diane affected the same area, but instead of continuing to the northwest it turned to the northeast. Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie. Damage from Diane totaled at least $700million, and <b>six</b> <b>states</b> were declared federal disaster areas from the combined hurricanes' impact; this allowed federal assistance for the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Greene built railroads in <b>six</b> <b>states</b> and {{designed}} municipal sewage and water systems for Washington, D.C., Detroit, {{and several other}} cities. In New York City, he designed the Croton Aqueduct reservoir in Central Park and the enlarged High Bridge over the Harlem River. He was one of twelve founders in New York City of the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects. While {{on a trip to}} Maine for railroad surveying, he met Martha Barrett Dana, daughter of Samuel Dana, a prominent Massachusetts politician. They were married in Charlestown, Massachusetts, on February 21, 1837. They had six children together, including four sons (three of them later served in the military), one daughter, and one son who died in infancy.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma is the 20th-largest {{state in}} the United States, {{covering}} an area of 69,898 square miles (181,035km2), with 68,667 square miles (177,847km2) of land and 1,281 square miles (3,188km2) of water. It is one of <b>six</b> <b>states</b> on the Frontier Strip and lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas.

The Australian and New Zealand governments agreed with the Imperial government to help fund the Royal Navy's Australian Squadron, while the Admiralty committed itself to maintain the Squadron at a constant strength.

5|$|A pier at Port Aransas {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} {{at a cost}} of $10,000. The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice, cotton, and vegetable crops in the region. An estimate several days after the storm placed the total quantity of rice damaged at 500,000 bushels, totaling $10million in monetary losses. However, Zoch (1949) reported that total damage from the storm was $6.7 million. Following the storm, thousands of automobiles in <b>six</b> <b>states</b> were affected by widespread peeling and blistering paint. The blisters, usually concentrated on the hoods, fenders and tops of vehicles, contained a small amount of water, and peeling paint was also reported on one Shreveport home. Most of the cars damaged were parked outside, and sheltered automobiles were unaffected. Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars, experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm. Two deaths were attributed to the storm: a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted, and a young woman who drowned in Matagorda Bay.|$|E
