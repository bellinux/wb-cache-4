40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 to 20 years, many {{companies}} have converted their traditional {{defined benefit plans}} to cash balance or pension equity plans. In a cash balance plan, the worker s account {{is based on an}} annual contribution rate for each year of employment, plus accumulating interest on annual contributions. A pension equity plan defines the benefit as a percentage of final average earnings for each year of service under the plan. Both types of plans specify the benefit as a lump <b>sum</b> <b>payable</b> <b>at</b> termination. In contrast, traditional defined benefit plans specify benefits in terms of an annuity <b>payable</b> <b>at</b> retirement. From the employees perspective, cash balance and pension equity plans look somewhat like defined contribution plans. However, they are funded, administered, and regulated as defined benefit plans. ...|$|R

60|$|The weather still {{continuing}} favourable for {{the operations}} at the rock, the work proceeded with much energy, through the exertions both of the seamen and artificers. For the more speedy and effectual working of the several tackles in raising the materials as the building advanced in height, and there being a great extent of railway to attend to, which required constant repairs, two additional millwrights {{were added to the}} complement on the rock, which, including the writer, now counted thirty-one in all. So crowded was the men's barrack that the beds were ranged five tier in height, allowing only about one foot eight inches for each bed. The artificers commenced this morning at five o'clock, and, {{in the course of the}} day, they laid the forty-eighth and forty-ninth courses, consisting each of sixteen blocks. From the favourable state of the weather, and the regular manner in which the work now proceeded, the artificers had generally from four to seven extra hours' work, which, including their stated wages of 3s. 4d., yielded them from 5s. 4d. to about 6s. 10d. per day besides their board; even the postage of their letters was paid while they were at the Bell Rock. In these advantages the foremen also shared, having about double the pay and amount of premiums of the artificers. The seamen being less out of their element in the Bell Rock operations than the landsmen, their premiums consisted in a slump <b>sum</b> <b>payable</b> <b>at</b> the end of the season, which extended from three to ten guineas.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} what seem to be basic principles in contract law: 2 ̆ 2 consideration need not be adequate 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 the rule against penalties applies only to <b>sums</b> <b>payable</b> on breach. 2 ̆ 2 The 2 ̆ 7 reluctant inspiration 2 ̆ 7 lies in the recent Australian case of Andrews v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, which establishes {{that the absence of}} breach or an obligation to avoid the occurrence of an event upon which a <b>sum</b> becomes <b>payable,</b> does not render such sum incapable of being characterized as a penalty. This decision constitutes an unexpected divergence from the position in most other common law jurisdictions. What are its practical implications? Should we even engage in historical arguments given that the penalty jurisdiction evolved at the time where the law did not recognize enforceable promises to perform? The paper commences with broad observations regarding the enforceability of liquidated damages clauses, the increasingly commercial approach to evaluating whether a pre-estimate of loss is 2 ̆ 2 genuine 2 ̆ 2 and the necessity to treat <b>sums</b> <b>payable</b> on breach as part of the commercial bargain. The more liberal the attitude with regards to the amount (i. e. the higher the sum that can be stipulated), the more limited the effect of the rule against penalties. A liberal approach does not affect the contract breaker’s ability to invoke the rule but his ability to succeed. In combination with the description of the performance, the price and the limitation of liability (if any), <b>sums</b> <b>payable</b> on breach often point towards a transaction-specific risk allocation. In many instances such sums come dangerously close to primary obligations. And courts do not, as a matter of principle, review primary obligations. Once this is acknowledged, it becomes even more difficult to justify any attempts to expand the scope of the penalty jurisdiction beyond payments triggered by breach. After confronting some of the historical arguments made by the court in Andrews, the paper analyzes the recurring attempts to extend judicial review of contractual payments by creating 2 ̆ 2 hybrid stipulations 2 ̆ 2 – sums that are neither payable on breach nor in return for contractual performance. A difficult theoretical exercise awaits: should we create artificial divisions between contractual payments to establish whether they can be reviewed? Or should we finally acknowledge that all <b>sums</b> <b>payable</b> under a contract are part of the commercial bargain? On one hand, doctrinal integrity may point towards the need to vigorously defend the present form of the rule against penalties, including its (seemingly) strict limitation to <b>sums</b> <b>payable</b> on breach. On the other, some arguments made in Andrews and in other recent cases highlight the theoretical inconsistencies of its current formulation. After all, the 2 ̆ 2 breach/no breach 2 ̆ 2 dichotomy can also be regarded as a device for avoiding judicial scrutiny. At present, on the basis of Andrews alone it appears incorrect to use an institution that prohibits deterrence from breach to review the commercial substance of contracts. The rule against penalties reflects the general equitable principle not to enforce oppressive or unconscionable transactions. It does not reform commercially imprudent transactions. Given its exceptional nature, the penalty jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly – even with regards to <b>sums</b> <b>payable</b> on breach. Once <b>sums</b> <b>payable</b> on breach are regarded as part of commercial bargain, it is more difficult to subject them to review. If, however, payment is unrelated to the breach of a contractual promise, it comes dangerously close to being a contractual promise. Any review seems unacceptable...|$|R
