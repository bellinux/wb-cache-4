40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} hazards that {{are unique to}} a compressed-natural-gas (CNG) -fueled heavy hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (HEV) design compared with a conventional heavy vehicle. The unique design features of the heavy HEV are the CNG fuel system for the internal-combustion engine (ICE) and the electric drive system. This report addresses safety issues with the CNG fuel system and the electric drive system. Vehicles on U. S. highways have been propelled by ICEs for several decades. Heavy-duty vehicles have typically been fueled by diesel fuel, and light-duty vehicles have been fueled by gasoline. The hazards and risks posed by ICE vehicles are well understood and have been generally accepted by the public. The economy, durability, and safety <b>of</b> ICE <b>vehicles</b> have established a <b>standard</b> for other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Heavy-duty (i. e., heavy) HEVs have recently been introduced to U. S. roadways, and the hazards posed by these heavy HEVs can {{be compared with the}} hazards posed by ICE <b>vehicles.</b> The benefits <b>of</b> heavy HEV technology are based on their potential for reduced fuel consumption and lower exhaust emissions, while the disadvantages are the higher acquisition cost and the expected higher maintenance costs (i. e., battery packs). The heavy HEV is more suited for an urban drive cycle with stop-and-go driving conditions than for steady expressway speeds. With increasing highway congestion and the resulting increased idle time, the fuel consumption advantage for heavy HEVs (compared with conventional heavy vehicles) is enhanced by the HEVs' ability to shut down. Any increase in fuel cost obviously improves the economics of a heavy HEV. The propulsion system for a heavy HEV is more complex than the propulsion system for a conventional heavy vehicle. The heavy HEV evaluated in this study has in effect two propulsion systems: an ICE fueled by CNG and an electric drive system with additional complexity and failure modes. This additional equipment will result in a less reliable vehicle with a lower availability than a conventional heavy vehicle. Experience with heavy HEVs to date supports this observation. The key safety concern for the electric drive system is the higher voltages and currents that are required in the electric drive system. Faults that could expose personnel to these electric hazards must be considered, addressed, and minimized. The key issue for the CNG-fueled ICE is containment of the high-pressure natural gas. Events that can result in a release of natural gas with the possibility of subsequent ignition are of concern. These safety issues are discussed. The heavy HEV has the potential to have a safety record that is comparable to that <b>of</b> the conventional <b>vehicle,</b> but adequate attention to detail will be required...|$|R

40|$|The total {{emission}} level is {{heavily dependent on}} the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Additionally, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their age structures are very important. The structure <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> also depends on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> the road. The article {{presents the results of}} calculations of the pollutants emission from the road transport. Total emission was calculated with combination of the investigation results i. e. the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their age structures for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> roads. The investigations have been made for different classes of roads with different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The traffic line has been recorded in the same length of time. On the basis of analysis of the recorded traffic line, the number and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> have been estimated. The classification <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> have been made according to the level of emission i. e. passenger cars, light duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, busses and others, taking into consideration the age structures <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The level <b>of</b> total traffic emission has been calculated on the basis of results. There has been used the Copert programme methodology. The results of the calculations have been made with combination <b>of</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> road, the speed <b>of</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their age structure, are presented...|$|R
