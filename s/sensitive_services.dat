The interaction potential of the Smart Home, which is a special type of smart space, is of particular interest in fields in which the acceptance of new technologies is limited and restrictive. The integration of smart home design patterns with sensitive solutions can increase user acceptance. In this paper, we present the main challenges that have been identified in the literature for the successful deployment of <b>sensitive</b> <b>services</b> (e. g., telemedicine and assistive services) in smart spaces and a software architecture that models the functionalities of a Smart Home platform that are required to maintain and support such <b>sensitive</b> <b>services.</b> This architecture emphasizes user interaction as a key concept to facilitate the acceptance of <b>sensitive</b> <b>services</b> by end-users and utilizes activity theory to support its innovative design.

40|$|Abstract. Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN) is a {{promising}} approach to allowing strangers to access <b>sensitive</b> <b>services</b> in open environments. Although many ATN systems are proposed, some issues still {{remain to be}} addressed: 1) they are centralized and cannot scale well; and 2) their policy languages are coarse-grained. To address the above problems and secure grids, we present a novel automated trust negotiation framework, FORT, to establish trust relationship between service providers and service requesters. FORT is decentralized, so it scales well. Furthermore, we utilize attribute constraints to refine its language. This paper implements FORT and designs experiments to evaluate its performance. Experimental results show that FORT can effectively protect <b>sensitive</b> <b>services</b> {{at the cost of}} little performance of systems and scale well...|$|E

40|$|A key design {{issue in}} relay based {{cooperative}} wireless networks is {{the design of}} an appropriate metric for relay selection algorithms.

40|$|Quality of Service {{provisioning}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} design goals of IEEE 802. 16 mesh networks. In order to provide quality delivery of delay <b>sensitive</b> <b>services</b> such as voice, video etc., it is required to route such traffic over a minimum delay path. In this paper we propose a routing metric for delay <b>sensitive</b> <b>services</b> in IEEE 802. 16 mesh networks. We design a new cross layer routing metric, namely Expected Scheduler Delay (ESD), based on HoldOff exponent and the current load at each node of the network. This proposed metric takes into account the expected theoretical end-to-end delay of routing paths as well as network congestion to find the best suited path. We propose an efficient distributed scheme to calculate ESD and route the packets using source routing mechanism based on ESD. The simulation results demonstrate that our metric achieves reduced delay compared to a standard scheme used in IEEE 802. 16 mesh, that takes hop count to find the path.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} problem of {{congestion}} and quality loss of data transmission through the Internet from an economic perspective. We show that due to the congestion problem, quality <b>sensitive</b> <b>services</b> {{are likely to be}} crowded out by high volume but less quality sensitive applications in a strict "neutral" system. This crowding out reduces the availability of services and the development and diffusion of innovative and high value services. Not least, the congestion problem causes welfare loss. As we discuss in this paper, the differentiation of data packets according to their quality sensitivity could remedy the congestion problem. Appropriate business models that incorporate quality of service concepts could be very efficient in preventing the crowding out of high value quality <b>sensitive</b> <b>services</b> without affecting other applications and would be very convenient for Internet users at the same time. We show that any ex ante regulation in the sense of strict Net neutrality could seriously harm the development of innovative business models and discourage innovation and investment. Net neutrality, Internet, bandwidth, quality sensitivity, crowding-out...|$|E

We suggest an add-on approach to realize secure {{telecommunication services}} which saves the huge investments into existing network {{infrastructure of the}} ISDN. This is done by adding trusted runtime environments that contain security functions to existing service infrastructure. This approach aims at separating <b>sensitive</b> <b>service</b> functions from highly complex functions of public telecommunication networks. We propose an enhancement of existing network service interfaces by standardized security service interfaces to enable the provision of open security services. Separated security control functions of independent service providers, however, might not be trusted by network operators. Therefore, this contribution particularly considers gateway functions implementing access control and ancillary conditions concerning network integrity. 1 Introduction The term telecommun [...] ...|$|R

This issue is complicated by the possibility that a vehicle may be unavailable when called for service. In this paper we analyze current techniques for locating EMS and highlight some of the problems associated with these methods. We propose a genetic algorithm to locate emergency facilities and vehicles to minimize the number of locations which cannot be covered in a specified time. Our proposed genetic algorithm is driven by the evaluation of the fitness of chromosomes through a discrete event simulation model. This method of evaluating the fitness of the chromosomes is used because of the difficulty of evaluating the required probabilities. We believe that our approach will lead to a general cost efficient technique for locating EMS...|$|R
