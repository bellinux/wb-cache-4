Neela meets with Winn, [...] revealing that the two had been working together. [...] She informs Winn that her escape plan with the Runabout will no longer work. Winn tells Neela {{to continue with the}} plan, even if it means Neela must sacrifice herself. [...] Bareil arrives at the station to help, and at the same time, Miles and Lt. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) discover a hidden <b>sub-program</b> on the station's computer created by Neela. [...] The program controls a timed delay of forcefields running from the promenade to the Runabouts. They alert Sisko who is nearby, just as Bareil and Winn begin to address a crowd of Bajorans on the promenade. [...] Sisko searches the crowd {{just in time to see}} Neela raising her phaser at Bareil. Sisko tackles Neela to the ground and saves Bareil's life. Kira suggests that the assassination attempt was planned by Winn to secure her position as the new Kai, but Neela insists she was working alone. Kira later apologises to Sisko, and agrees with his earlier sentiment about Winn's actions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique, called input space adaptive software synthesis, {{for the energy}} and performance optimization of embedded software. The proposed technique {{is based on the}} fact that the computational complexities of programs or subprograms are often highly dependent on the values assumed by input and intermediate program variables during execution. This observation is exploited in the proposed software synthesis technique by augmenting the program with optimized versions of one or more <b>sub-programs</b> that are specialized to, and executed under, specific input sub-spaces. We propose a methodology for input space adaptive software synthesis which consists of the following steps: control and value profiling of the input program, application of compiler transformations as a preprocessing step, identification of <b>sub-programs</b> and corresponding input sub-spaces that hold the highest potential for optimization, and transformation of the <b>sub-programs</b> to realize performance and energy savings. We have evaluated input space adaptive software synthesis by compiling the resulting optimized programs to two commercial embedded processors (Fujitsu SPARClite TM and Intel StrongARM TM). Our experiments indicate that our techniques can reduce energy consumption of the whole program by up to 7. 8 X (an average of 3. 1 X for SPAR-Clite and 2. 6 X for StrongARM) while simultaneously improving performance by up to 8. 5 X (an average of 3. 1 X for SPARClite and 2. 7 X for StrongARM), leading to an improvement in the energydelay product by up to 66. 7 X (an average of 8. 2 X for SPARClite and 6. 3 X for StrongARM), at the cost of minimal code size overheads (an average of 5. 9 %). ...|$|R
