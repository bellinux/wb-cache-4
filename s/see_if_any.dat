5|$|In genetics, a {{genome-wide}} association study (GWA study, or GWAS), {{also known}} as whole genome association study (WGA study, or WGAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> variant {{is associated with a}} trait. GWASs typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other organism.|$|E

By {{the conclusion of the}} study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections of the vaccine, about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group, who would then be observed to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> contracted polio.|$|E

If the drug proves unstable, it will invalidate the results from clinical trials since {{it would be impossible to}} know what the administered dose actually was. Stability studies are carried out to test whether temperature, humidity, oxidation, or photolysis (ultraviolet light or visible light) have any effect, and the preparation is analysed to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> degradation products have been formed.|$|E

25|$|ARPA {{was asked}} to {{consider}} the problem of using the technology in a cost-effective way, and noticed one possible application. As Soviet warheads were accurate to within only a few kilometers, {{and they had to}} fall within less than a kilometer to kill a missile silo, that meant the Soviets would have to launch several warheads at every US silo in a counterforce attack. The defender had a significant advantage here; they could watch the incoming warheads, <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> were going to come within the lethal range of a silo, and then shoot just those ones. This meant a small number of ABMs would be effective against a huge number of Soviet warheads.|$|E
25|$|During development, it {{was found}} that the rifle was not only solidly {{designed}} and well engineered, but it was also capable of firing 18 to 19 aimed shots a minute when used as a single loader – faster than the standard Remington M1867's 13 aimed shots per minute. When used as a magazine loader, {{it was found}} that 11 shots – ten in the magazine and one in the chamber – could be fired in 25 seconds. Tests carried out during the evaluation also indicated that the rifle was more accurate than the Remington M1867, although both weapons were firing the same ammunition from identical barrels. The rifle was also found to be extremely rugged – one of the tests carried out consisted of throwing the rifle repeatedly from a height of 4 meters (12ft) towards a rocky surface in order to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> of the rounds in the magazine would go off. Even modern firearms would be damaged by this treatment, but the Krag–Petersson survived it with only superficial damage to the woodwork.|$|E
25|$|According to the woman, {{another car}} pulled over {{and tried to}} help Bermúdez Zacarías by telling a nearby {{security}} officer to call the police.

When the first policemen arrived, she reportedly told them that she saw two men walk into an abandoned lot. A third policemen went to inspect the lot, but came back to the murder scene after not seeing anything suspicious. The eyewitness complained to the press that the policemen were slow to act and may not have checked the abandoned lot thoroughly since she said there were several large bushes where the two men may have been hiding. A few days after her confession, the eyewitness stated that she was harassed by people who were presumably armed outside her home and in a vehicle.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the family}} members told {{investigators}} that civilians in Villa Purificación were scared {{to reach out to the}} government for help because they feared reprisals from the Army. They said that they believe the Army summarily executed civilians out of rage for the incidents that occurred on May 1 in Villa Purificación. The families also said that the Army was not letting cattle ranchers give water to their livestock in order to kill them, and asked President Peña Nieto to intervene in the incidents. One {{of the family}} members who supposedly approached the military men guarding the bodies told the press that when he asked a soldier if she could get close to the bodies to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> of them corresponded to her missing relative, the soldier told her that they were not getting their bodies back and that they would let the corpses rot. The lady claimed that the soldier told her that they killed those people because they were responsible for death of their comrades.|$|E
25|$|Drift diving {{occurs when}} the divers allow {{themselves}} to be conveyed past the bottom by the prevailing current, minimising the effort required to cover a relatively large distance, but moving the divers away from the start position and making their surfacing position uncertain. The usual way of monitoring the position of a group is by the lead diver towing a surface marker buoy, and the divers of the group all following the dive leader. The dive boat follows the buoy at a distance where the lookouts can <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> diver surfaces near the buoy. Divers from the group either surface along the buoy line, or if there is current shear or they are separated from the group, deploy their own DSMB and surface on that. Groups of inexperienced divers may be escorted by a second divemaster who tries to keep them together, directs stragglers back to the dive leader, and keeps track of remaining gas. Divers may be formally grouped in buddy pairs, surfacing together when the first is low on gas, or more informally, and rely on the divemasters if they have a problem.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October 1789, {{the royal}} family was forced by a Parisian mob mostly {{composed}} of women to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they spent {{the next three years}} as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the national guards who did not spare any humiliation to {{the royal family}}; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children. The family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner. On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in {{what is known as the}} Flight to Varennes, but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on 10 August 1792, the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.|$|E

[...] Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years, while Back to the Future went through two more drafts. During the early 1980s, popular teen comedies (such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's) were risqué and adult-aimed, so the script was commonly rejected for being too light. Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney.
