5|$|Mayan {{languages}} are ergative in their alignment. This {{means that the}} subject of an intransitive verb is treated <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> the object of a transitive verb, but differently from the subject of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|Online {{multiplayer}} {{is set up}} <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> local multiplayer but {{allows the}} players to be at separate computers. Additionally, hotseat can be combined with online play, so multiple human players can use each computer.|$|E

5|$|Selenium is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} metalloid in the environmental chemistry literature. It moves through the aquatic environment <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> arsenic and antimony; its water-soluble salts, in higher concentrations, have a similar toxicological profile to that of arsenic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Similarly</b> <b>to</b> Illinois, Indiana {{experienced}} its wettest {{tropical cyclone}} in 1957 {{with the arrival}} of Hurricane Audrey. In 1979, Hurricane Bob produced considerable flooding in the state.|$|E

5|$|When receptive, females respond <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> {{both male}} types: {{approach}} and settle; extend the foremost pair of legs or tap with them. Both male morphs typically end their initial display and start leg-clapping and zig-zag dancing.|$|E
5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E

50|$|It is <b>similarly</b> related <b>to</b> {{the uniform}} {{truncated}} polyhedra with vertex figure n.6.6.|$|R
5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. <b>Similarly,</b> <b>to</b> check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|Although both {{hydrogen}} and helium are in the s-block, neither of them behaves <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> other s-block elements. Their behaviour is {{so different from the}} other s-block elements that there is considerable disagreement over where these two elements should be placed in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Before Zeb {{brushed the}} east coast of Taiwan, a typhoon warning was issued, causing schools, {{government}} buildings, and financial markets to close. Airports and ferry travel were also disrupted. 183residents evacuated to storm shelters, including 50 from a nursing home. Hundreds of Chinese fishing boats rode out the storm in Taiwan harbors. <b>Similarly</b> <b>to</b> Taiwan, Zeb delayed ferry service in Japan, and caused 271domestic flights to be canceled. Train service was canceled on Kyushu during the storm.|$|E

5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> other diseases, {{which must}} be ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E
5|$|Convicted {{prisoners were}} refused {{the same rights}} as internees until July 1972, when Special Category Status was {{introduced}} following a hunger strike by 40 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners led by the veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category, or political, status meant prisoners were treated <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> prisoners of war; for example, not having to wear prison uniforms or do prison work.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{pressure}} from the Nine Network to adopt the nine dots, NBN Television retained its logo {{for a few years}} after aggregation. However, in 1994, NBN added nine dots into a new logo designed <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> the Nine Network's, and also began using Nine's on-air promotion, with the NBN logo replacing Nine's. In 1997, the dots were changed to spheres.|$|E

5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|Division II works <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> Division I, {{with two}} six-team groups where group 'A' {{promotes}} one team to Division I and group 'B' exchanges its last placed team with Division III. Division III is now composed of {{one group of}} six, and if more than six nations register for this, the lowest level, then a qualification tournament will be held.|$|E
5|$|Even some nonhuman animals show {{a limited}} ability to add, {{particularly}} primates. In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn's 1992 result (but using eggplants instead of dolls), rhesus macaque and cottontop tamarin monkeys performed <b>similarly</b> <b>to</b> human infants. More dramatically, after being taught {{the meanings of}} the Arabic numerals 0 through 4, one chimpanzee was able to compute the sum of two numerals without further training. More recently, Asian elephants have demonstrated an ability to perform basic arithmetic.|$|E
