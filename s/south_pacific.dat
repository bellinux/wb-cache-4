The destroyer was hit by fragments while docked in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack, and suffered a few casualties. She escorted convoys between Pearl Harbor and the west coast {{for the first six}} months of World War II.

5|$|Within the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific,</b> {{tropical}} cyclones are {{monitored by}} the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific.</b> The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific,</b> designating tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure windspeeds {{over a period of}} ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E

5|$|Patagonia {{is located}} between the {{subtropical}} high pressure belt, and the subpolar low pressure zone, meaning it {{is exposed to}} westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40o S, there is little land to block these winds. Being located between the semipermanent <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> and the South Atlantic Highs at around 30oS, and the Subpolar Low at arount 60o S, {{the movement of the}} high and low pressure systems, along with ocean currents, determine the precipitation pattern. During winter, both the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> and South Atlantic highs move to the north, while the Subpolar Low strengthens, which, when combined with higher ocean temperatures than the surrounding land, results in higher precipitation during this time of the year. Due to the northward migration of the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> High, more frontal systems can pass through, allowing for more precipitation to occur. During summer, the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> High migrates southward, preventing the passage of fronts, and cyclones that can cause precipitation to occur, resulting in lower precipitation during this time of the year. Northeastern areas, along with southern parts of the region, are influenced by air masses from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in precipitation being more evenly distributed throughout the year. Most precipitation comes from frontal systems, particularly stationary fronts that bring humid air from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
