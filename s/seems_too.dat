5|$|Captain Archibald Haddock (Capitaine Haddock in Hergé's {{original}} version) is a Merchant Marine sea {{captain and}} Tintin's best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock is initially {{depicted as a}} weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Chevalier François de Hadoque in the original version). The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> idealistic. After he and Tintin find Red Rackham's treasure, Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall (Le château de Moulinsart in the original French).|$|E

25|$|One {{inference}} {{from the}} Kievan {{theory is that}} Edgar Ætheling and St. Margaret were, through their mother, first cousins of Philip I of France. The connection <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> notable to be omitted from contemporary sources, yet we have no indication that medieval chroniclers were aware of it. The argumentum ex silentio leads critics of the Kievan theory to search for alternative explanations.|$|E

25|$|N.B. An extra four centuriae were {{allocated}} to engineers, trumpeters et al., {{to make a}} total of 193 centuriae. There is a discrepancy in the minimum rating for legionary service between Polybius (400 drachmae) and Livy (1,100). In addition, Polybius states that the proletarii were assigned to naval service while Livy simply states that they were exempt from military service. In both cases, Polybius is to be preferred, as 1,100 drachmae <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> high a figure for destitute individuals {{and it is likely}} that the Roman military would have made use of the manpower of this group.|$|E
25|$|John Benjamin Hickey as John Stanton Will's {{father a}} {{lecturer}} {{at a college}} in the United Kingdom, the family patriarch he is initially critical of his son Max and <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> busy to listen to Will. It is revealed that when Will was a new-born, his twin brother Tom was kidnapped as John {{was working on a}} thesis, The Light and The Dark, and the loss of his son, the guilt and emotional distress he went through made him abandon the thesis. Hickey also plays a small role as Thomas Stanton, an ancestor of the Stanton family and the creator of the Six Signs.|$|E
500|$|Zenithia, {{also called}} Zenith Castle, Zenith, or [...] in Japanese, is a {{floating}} castle that first appears in Dragon QuestIV; {{it is used}} as a descriptor for several elements in Dragon QuestIV, V and VI. Its appearance in all three games has led to the games being described as the Zenithia or Tenkū trilogy, despite different geographical layouts {{in each of the three}} games' worlds. Horii explained that a trilogy was never the intention: [...] "Each Dragon Quest title represents a fresh start and a new story, so it <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> much of a connection between the games in the series. It could be said that the imagination of players has brought the titles together in a certain fashion." ...|$|E

500|$|The debate's {{focus on}} the public {{perception}} of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger Glenn Reynolds stated that [...] "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just <b>seems</b> <b>too,</b> well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market." [...] Lawrence Lessig criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that [...] "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research." [...] Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, {{set in the}} Los Angeles underworld. The {{film was}} not well {{received}} by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie [...] "finds a certain warmth {{in a kind of}} role that is usually hard and aggressive; she <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> nice to be [...] girlfriend, and maybe she is." [...] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as [...] "horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara" [...] who relies on [...] "gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips." [...] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's [...] "Anybody Seen My Baby?" [...] as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.|$|E
500|$|Dean Piper for the Daily Mirror {{called the}} song [...] "fantastic" [...] {{claiming}} that Roberts [...] "means business with her debut solo material", and saying {{he could not}} [...] "get enough of the single", calling it [...] "classic pop, fresh and fantastic." [...] Michael Cragg for The Guardian compared the chanting chorus to that of Justice vs. Simian's track, [...] "We Are Your Friends". He called it both [...] "ridiculously cool and a bit naff". In response to the general acclaim from critics, Roberts wished that the track would be well received amongst her peers, saying [...] "I haven't seen one bad review from the single or album samplers – it <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> good to be true. The response from critics has been amazing. It's like being at school and being told ‘well done’ by the teachers but I want my classmates to like it too. I want the people at home to get something from the record. Then I'll be doubly happy." ...|$|E

500|$|Gould also {{discusses}} {{the possibility that}} what Morrell sighted was [...] the eastern coast of Graham Land, the so-called [...] "Foyn Coast", despite its being 14° further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting. [...] Gould asserts that {{the features of the}} peninsula's eastern coast corresponds [...] closely with [...] Morrell's description of Nw South Greenland. This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ship's position, perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation. In his account Morrell writes that he was [...] "destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments", although other parts of his narrative seem to indicate that the occasional dead reckoning calculation was the exception to the norm. A longitudinal error of 14° is very large, and the additional distance of about [...] to the Foyn coast <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> great to have been covered within the ten-day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands, where the ship's position is recorded accurately. Even so, Gould suggests that a [...] "balance of evidence" [...] shows that what Morrell saw was the Foyn coast.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Roshan {{was cast}} in Ashutosh Gowariker's Jodhaa Akbar, a partly fictionalised account of a {{marriage}} of convenience between the Mughal emperor Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar (played by Roshan) and the Rajput princess Jodha Bai (played by Rai). Gowariker believed Roshan possessed the regal bearing and physique required {{to play the role}} of a king. For the role, Roshan learned sword-fighting and horse-riding, and also took Urdu lessons. Jodhaa Akbar was an economic success and earned [...] worldwide. Roshan's performance earned him his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award as well as his first international award –"Best Actor" [...] at the Golden Minbar International Film Festival in Kazan, Russia. Critics were generally appreciative of Roshan's performance. Raja Sen of Rediff.com thought that Roshan [...] "proves a very good Akbar. There are times when his inflection <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> modern, but the actor gives the performance his all, slipping into the skin of the character and staying there." [...] Roshan ended 2008 with an appearance in the popular item number [...] "Krazzy 4" [...] from the film of same name.|$|E
500|$|With {{all of the}} {{interest}} generated by the book, a number of communities declared {{that they were the}} setting for the novel in order {{to cash in on the}} boom, most notably Rancho Guajome in San Diego County, which Jackson had also visited prior to writing her book. However, the location of the fictional Moreno Ranch, [...] "midway in the valley [...] to the east and west, which had once belonged to the Missions of San Fernando and San Bonaventura" [...] corresponds to the location of Rancho Camulos, and the physical description of some of the buildings on the fictional ranch accurately describe buildings at Camulos. On the other hand, relative to the other locations in the novel (Ramona's having been married in San Diego and Alessandro's family being from the Temecula area), Camulos <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> distant to be the real location. Jackson died in 1885, never having publicly disclosed what locations she drew from for the book. Historians today are unsure whether Moreno Ranch represented a historic site.|$|E

500|$|However, {{even after}} {{defeating}} {{the last of}} the Demons, it <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> late to stop Malduke's weapon from destroying Filgaia, but the Guardians are able to pool their strength and revive the world. Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia board the teleportation device to be transported back to Filgaia, only to be stopped in mid-voyage by what is left of Zeikfried's body and his spear. The weakened Zeikfried launches a last desperate assault on the heroes, and, though defeated in the end, the energy released in the battle destabilizes the portal. [...] Narrowly escaping through the portal to Filgaia, the trio arrives at Ka Dingel just as it collapses, with Asgard arriving to shield them from the falling debris, but the sheer strain causes great damage to the Earth Golem and so, is later allowed to sleep once more beneath the earth with Cecilia's help. [...] With the demons defeated and nature beginning to recover, Jack and Rudy set off on a new journey while Cecilia remains in Adlehyde to fulfill her duties as ruler. In a letter she writes to Jack and Rudy, she tells them that she will send them the item they forgot to help them on their future adventures and shows up shortly after to join them on a new quest.|$|E
500|$|... "The Problem Solvers" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN {{reviewed the}} episode, {{giving it a}} 7.4 out of 10 rating and opining the episode had [...] "a few audible chuckles and several silent smiles", and that the tone of it [...] "was just off." [...] He cited that the Liz and Jack characters on opposing sides [...] "was not {{as much fun as}} seeing them working together", and that Jenna and Tracy's antics throughout the series have been [...] "funny most of the time", though [...] "very little clicked in this episode." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the Tracy and Jenna team [...] "often <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> far out of the realm of reality... to enjoy them." [...] Sepinwall was positive about Cheyenne Jackson's debut, noting he [...] "fit in well his first time out." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine called the episode the [...] "best so far in the season" [...] but admitted he was [...] "disappointed in it" [...] for not coming [...] "close to greatness and we all know [...] done it before and can do it again." [...] Gandert, who has not been a fan of Liz's [...] "Dealbreakers" [...] storyline, commented her plot here was [...] "somewhat annoying, generally not that interesting", and concluded [...] "it's hard to really care" [...] that Liz get her talk show.|$|E
500|$|Rachel, {{along with}} Kurt, {{plans to attend}} a {{performing}} arts school in New York City after graduation. School counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) suggests they consider The New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA), a highly desirable school. The two attend an Ohio [...] "mixer" [...] for potential applicants, {{only to discover that}} their competition is very much like them, and quite talented. Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical, since she believes herself to be a shoo-in for the lead role, Maria, and she needs the experience for her NYADA application. However, Mercedes also auditions for Maria, and the directors, unable to decide {{between the two of them}} even after head-to-head callbacks, decide to double-cast the role, giving Rachel and Mercedes each a week of the two-week run. Mercedes, believing she did better in the callbacks, refuses to accept the double-casting and withdraws from the show, leaving Rachel to be Maria. She and Finn decide to have sex in the episode [...] "The First Time". In the episode [...] "Mash Off", Rachel abruptly withdraws from the race for senior class president in favor of Kurt after she realizes he might not get into NYADA with her if he doesn't win. She goes even further in the next episode, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", when she stuffs an election ballot box in Kurt's favor to keep him from losing. He loses anyway, and she confesses: she is suspended from school for a week and forbidden to compete in Sectionals with New Directions, though the glee club wins without her. At the end of the episode [...] "Yes/No", Finn asks her to marry him, and after hesitating for several days, she accepts. Their parents find out in [...] "Heart", and hope to discourage the pair, but their plans backfire and the wedding date is moved up to May. Even that date <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> distant, so Rachel and Finn later decide to marry after Regionals in [...] "On My Way".|$|E

500|$|Quest mode, {{considered}} the game's largest change, has mixed reception. The use of [...] "2112" [...] as a centerpiece in the Quest mode was praised by critics; Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer {{said that the}} concept is [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] for Warriors of Rock and was [...] "a clever and enjoyable break from the typically rigid career structure". Cocke noted that the [...] "2112" [...] section feels like [...] "nice fanservice" [...] and its length and complexity would not be fun for players uninterested in Rush, while Helgeson felt that the [...] "awkward recitation" [...] by the band members were unnecessary. Other aspects of Quest mode {{were found to be}} less enjoyable. Gene Simmons's voice-over narration was found [...] "stilted and awkward". While the story carried similar heavy metal themes as Brutal Legend, very few of the songs within the game are from that genre; to Cocke, this felt [...] "like a desperate attempt to gain credibility with too many crowds, but it ends up spreading itself too thin". The Globe and Mails Chad Sapieha felt that the Quest mode [...] "simply disguised [...] aging career mode", with the characters' powers being [...] "hardly satisfying" [...] and only a means to [...] "artificially inflate one's score". After the player has completed the [...] "2112" [...] setpiece, the rest of the Quest mode was disappointing; Minkley compared the second half of this mode as a [...] "disengaging slog to level up the remaining four characters". Gies felt the [...] "rigid and often frustrating" [...] Quest mode led to playing the songs in an order that was [...] "all over the place in terms of tone, difficulty, and most importantly, fun". Some reviewers felt the improved Quickplay+ mode to be the highlight of the game; Heppe noted that the mode [...] "probably <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> basic to be the star of the game, but it really shines" [...] while Minkley considered that it [...] "offer a far stronger reason to replay than the embryonic Quest Mode manages". Gies' review of the Wii version noted that the Roadie Battles mode exclusive to the Wii version was enjoyable and [...] "helps the Wii version of the game to stand tall" [...] to the high-definition console version.|$|E
