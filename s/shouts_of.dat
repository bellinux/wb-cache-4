5|$|Kalākaua's party {{embarked}} on the steamship Bangkok for Singapore on May 1. As the ship sailed away, they were bid farewell {{by a military}} gun salute, and <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> approval by well-wishers at the dock.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Paris, Custine {{displayed}} his usual , {{which seemed to}} exasperate his political enemies. He took private rooms in a furnished hotel, and rented a room for his secretary. He visited his son and daughter-in-law, and carried on his usual Parisian social calendar: he appeared in all the public places, at the Palais-Royal and the theater, and was received with noisy ovations and <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> Vive Custine! The Committee of Public Safety ordered a policeman to accompany him everywhere. On 22 July, {{he was arrested and}} imprisoned in the Luxembourg. On 23 July, the news came that Mainz had capitulated; on 28 July came the news of the loss of Valenciennes. He was transferred to the Concierge on 28 July, and his rooms, those of his secretary, and those of his son were sealed, pending a search.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{continued}} {{in single file}} towards {{the top of the}} plateau, with 1 Platoon—under Sergeant Gordon Peterson—leading, followed by 2 and then 3 Platoon. The going was slow in the dense jungle and visibility was limited. By 16:30 the lead section was nearing {{the top of the hill}} having gone just , while the last platoon—3 Platoon—was still leaving the harbour. Suddenly, 1 Platoon was hit by heavy small arms fire from at least three Viet Cong machine-guns in well-sited bunkers, supported by rifles and grenades. The fire engulfed the lead section and platoon headquarters, causing five casualties in the opening minute. Pinned down, the Australians went to ground and began returning fire, allowing all except one of the wounded to crawl to safety. Private Richard Parker, who had fallen directly in front of the bunker system, was unable to be recovered. Failing to respond to the <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> his comrades, Parker was exposed to further hits, although was probably already dead. To support the beleaguered platoon, Healy subsequently ordered the support section from company headquarters to move forward to provide covering fire, while 3 Platoon moved up on the left flank. However, due to the dispersed patrolling plan adopted, the remaining companies were unable to provide any assistance.|$|E

25|$|Soon word of Jayavira’s murder {{spread through}} the Lascarin camp. <b>Shouts</b> <b>of</b> Rajadore Jayavire marapue! ("King Jayavira is murdered!") echoed from all {{directions}} and many Lascarins fled in panic to the Kandyans, along with the remaining Badaga mercenaries. By {{the morning of the}} following day most of the Lascarins, excepting those from Colombo and Mannar, had deserted.|$|E
25|$|Cork {{is home to}} one of Ireland's main {{national}} newspapers, the Irish Examiner (formerly the Cork Examiner). It also prints the Evening Echo, {{which for}} decades has been connected to the Echo Boys, who were poor and often homeless children who sold the newspaper. Today, the <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> the vendors selling the Echo can still be heard {{in various parts of the}} city centre. One of the biggest free newspapers in the city is the Cork Independent. The city's University publishes the UCC Express and Motley magazine.|$|E

25|$|The {{captain of}} the Ollie K Wilds stated that the windows of his pilot house were closed, {{and that he did}} not hear the Frosta's horn. A {{previous}} accident involving the George Prince followed a similar scenario. On that occasion, the {{captain of the}} ferry stated that he did not hear the sounding of vehicle horns or the <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> passengers. The morning of the accident, the windows were likely closed, and this may have prevented Auletta from hearing the Frosta's horn. Therefore, it is imperative that a lookout be designated and posted outside to listen for and relay signals from other vessels.|$|E
25|$|Thiers {{arrived at}} Versailles on 31 October and {{negotiations}} began {{the next day}} (1 November). Thiers initially asked for a 28-day armistice with provisioning of Paris and all besieged cities. Bismarck refused and countered by asking {{for one of the}} Parisian forts to balance the military advantages France would accrue from a ceasefire. Thiers rejected the surrender of any fortress. He later claimed that Bismarck had been amenable to French demands until news of the popular uprising in Paris had reached him. This uprising—accompanied by <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> Pas d'armistice! (No armistice!)—had been a response to rumours of Thiers's negotiations. According to Thiers it caused Bismarck to increase his demands, but Lord Lyons believed that the chancellor was merely looking for an excuse to break off talks.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{consists of}} a single large nave mostly constructed of metal. Inside, {{there are a number}} of narrow aisles containing stalls owned or rented by individual merchants. Most merchants are grouped by the type of merchandise they sell, such as party supplies, dishes, and pets. What little parking lot is left is filled by street vendors. On Saturday, when the market is busiest, these vendors overflow from the parking lot onto the surrounding narrow streets. These and various trucks and other vehicles block traffic, effectively closing the streets. The scene is noisy, filled with <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> vendors and music blaring from stands selling CDs. However, this is also the time to find the widest variety of merchandise, such as nopal cactus and fresh corn from Milpa Alta, flower pots and soil from Xochimilco, and medicinal herbs from Puebla, Morelos and the State of Mexico.|$|E

25|$|After {{the bloody}} Battle of Eylau on 7 and 8 February 1807, Napoleon's forces {{lingered in the}} {{vicinity}} so that the emperor could claim a victory. However, his soldiers clamored {{for an end to}} the fighting. Instead of the usual <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> Vive l'Empereur (long live the emperor), cries of Vive la paix (long live peace) were heard in the bivouacs when the emperor passed by. On 17 February the French began their withdrawal westward into winter quarters. By the 23rd the French reached their cantonments, with Bernadotte's I Corps on the left, Soult's IV Corps in the center, and Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's III Corps on the right. Ney's VI Corps occupied an advanced position at Guttstadt, while the Imperial Guard and the Reserve Cavalry occupied the rear area around Ostróda (Osterode). Napoleon stationed the V Corps in a position to cover Warsaw. Marshal Pierre Augereau's decimated VII Corps was broken up and its survivors were allotted to the other corps.|$|E
25|$|Pharès {{is angry}} that Amédès might reveal his guilt. Chemmis {{says that the}} people still love him and to cement his {{position}} as new king, he should be crowned and marry Nephté that very day. But Pharès suggests that he will only be safe when Amédès is dead and Chemmis promises to kill him if he reveals the secret. The statesmen, heads {{of the army and}} soldiers march in. Pharès tells them that the peoples of Asia are in revolt against Egypt after Séthos' death; it is vital that Egypt has a commander for its army. The soldiers acclaim Pharès as their new general. Their <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> congratulation are interrupted by the arrival of Nephté. Nephté is outraged at Pharès' behaviour but says that Amédès will soon reveal the killer's name. The soldiers, who have not heard this conversation, urge Pharès and Nephté to marry. Pharès asks where Nephté's son is; he should be brought up in the palace in the view of his people. He sends soldiers to search for the boy. He leaves with the soldiers, promising them that the military campaign will begin at dawn. Alone with her waiting women, Nephté says she can see no escape from her predicament: if she seeks revenge, her son's life will be in danger; if she does not, justice will not be done and she will be a criminal. Her waiting women try to comfort her, but Nephté asks to be alone. Amédès now enters, shadowed by Chemmis. Amédès tells Nephté he is in danger and the gods seem to have abandoned them, but the priests will defend her son to the death. Chemmis emerges and threatens Amédès but the priest says he is willing to sacrifice his life. However, Nephté vows to die in his place to secure revenge for her husband. News comes that the soldiers have found her son's hiding place. The people arrive and beg Nephté to marry Pharès. Nephté finally agrees.In an aside, she reveals she has a secret plan.|$|E

500|$|On 24 November 1998, {{in opening}} {{the second session}} of Parliament, the Queen {{delivered}} her annual Speech from the Throne; the Speech is written for her by the ruling party and outlines that party's legislative agenda for the forthcoming year. In it, she suggested that her Government (i.e. the ruling Labour Party) would pursue a reform of the House of Lords. These remarks were followed by <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Hear! Hear!" [...] from supportive Labour Members of Parliament, and by similar <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Shame! Shame!" [...] from Conservative peers; such outbursts were unprecedented, for the Queen's Speech is with few exceptions heard by a silent Parliament.|$|E

500|$|During the 1950s, Szigeti {{began to}} develop {{arthritis}} {{in his hands and}} his playing deteriorated. Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In Naples, Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> Viva l’Ungheria! (Italian for [...] "Long live Hungary!"), delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes.|$|E
500|$|Agrippina proved {{extremely}} popular and established Handel's international reputation. Its original run of 27 performances was extraordinary for that time. Handel's biographer John Mainwaring {{wrote of the}} first performance: [...] "The theatre at almost every pause resounded with <b>shouts</b> <b>of</b> Viva il caro Sassone! ('Long live the beloved Saxon!') They were thunderstruck with the grandeur and sublimity of his style, for they had never known till then all the powers of harmony and modulation so closely arranged and forcibly combined." [...] Many others recorded overwhelmingly positive responses to the work.|$|E
