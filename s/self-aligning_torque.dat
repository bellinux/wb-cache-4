50|$|Pacejka has {{developed}} a series of tire design models over the last 20 years. They were named the 'magic formula' {{because there is no}} particular physical basis for the structure of the equations chosen, but they fit a wide variety of tire constructions and operating conditions. Each tire is characterized by 10-20 coefficients for each important force that it can produce at the contact patch, typically lateral and longitudinal force, and <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque,</b> as a best fit between experimental data and the model. These coefficients are then used to generate equations showing how much force is generated for a given vertical load on the tire, camber angle and slip angle.|$|E
50|$|An {{asymmetric}} tire may {{refer to}} a passenger car radial tire in which asymmetric structure stabilizing belts are built. Generally the stabilizing belts give a <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> when a motor vehicle is running straight ahead as well as when it is cornering. However, the sidewalls of the radial tire are so flexible {{that there will be}} a delay in the lateral reaction between the tread of the tire and the rim of its wheel as the vehicle is being steered positively. The lateral force will be transmitted from the front wheel to the rear of the vehicle, which will tend to be steered off course. Whereas the asymmetric belts bring a gradual change in the lateral displacement of the tire tread corresponding to the rim while the cornering load grows. The progressive change will harden the sidewalls to produce an immediate response to steering, which results in safer driving.|$|E
40|$|The {{string theory}} was {{evaluated}} for predicting lateral tire dynamic properties as obtained from scaled model tests. The experimental data and string theory predictions are in generally good agreement using lateral stiffness and relaxation length values {{obtained from the}} static or slowly rolling tire. The results indicate that lateral forces and <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torques</b> are linearly proportional to tire lateral stiffness and to the amplitude of either steer or lateral displacement. In addition, {{the results show that}} the ratio of input excitation frequency to road speed is the proper independent variable by which frequency should be measured...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of tyres {{have a large}} influence on the stability of single-track vehicles. This paper focuses on the characterization of the dynamic {{properties of}} tyres. In {{the first section of}} the paper, modal analysis of the tyres is presented. Two motorcycle tyres and four scooter tyres are modally tested in order to measure the natural frequencies and the damping coefficients of the first typical modes of vibration. Tests are carried out for seven different inflation pressures in order to study how the pressure affects the properties of the tyres. The modal stiffnesses and the damping coefficients are identified for each mode of vibration. The second section of the paper focuses on the characterization of the transient properties of the tyres according to a ring model, in which the tyre tread is a ring connected to the rim with a series of springs and dampers. A comparison between a first-order model, which takes into account only the modal stiffnesses, and a second-order model, which considers also the <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torques</b> and the modal damping coefficients, is made. A prediction of the relaxation length according to the first-order model is presented. The relaxation length is calculated considering the term due to the measured contact patch, the terms due to the stiffnesses of the lateral and camber modes and the residual stiffness term, which accounts for the modes with ring deflection. In the last section, the predicted relaxation lengths are compared with those measured by means of a tester machine...|$|R
40|$|Stability {{and safety}} of road {{vehicles}} are largely affected by tyre properties. Single-track vehicles are characterised by weakly damped modes of vibration (weave and wobble) and therefore this phenomenon is even more important. This article focuses {{on the study of}} both steady-state and transient properties of motorcycle and scooter tyres in the presence of very low and very high inflation pressures. The steady-state properties are defined as lateral forces (side-slip and camber forces) and yaw <b>torques</b> (<b>self-aligning</b> and twisting). The transient properties are described in terms of relaxation length, which represents the distance needed to reach a certain percentage of the steady-state value of the tyre force. Experimental tests are carried out on a specific rotating disk machine. Three sets of tyres are analysed. Steady-state properties are measured by increasing step by step the values of camber and side-slip angles. Transient properties are studied carrying out tests with harmonic sideslip excitation and measuring the phase lag between the excitation (input) and the tyre force (output). Experimental results show important variations in tyre properties with inflation pressure with general trends of all the tested tyres and particular features related to the tyre’s geometry. After the analysis and discussion of experimental results, the measured data are fitted by means of a specific version of the Magic Formula. The dependence of the Magic Formula’s coefficients on inflation pressure is analysed and interpolation curves are given...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of four model aircraft tires of various construction were evaluated experimentally and compared with available theory. The experimental investigation consisted of measuring the cornering {{force and the}} <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> developed by the tires undergoing sinusoidal steering inputs while operating on a small scale, road-wheel tire testing apparatus. The force and moment data from the different tires are compared with both finite- and point-contact patch string theory predictions. In general, agreement between finite contact patch theory and experimental observation is good. A modified string theory is also presented in which coefficients for cornering force and <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> are determined separately. This theory improves the correspondence between the experimental and analytical data, particularly on tires with relatively high self-aligning torques...|$|E

A sliding mode controller can then be designed based on the bound information of uncertain system parameters, uncertain <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque,</b> and external disturbances.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple rubber {{friction}} law, {{which can be}} used, e. g., in models of tire (and vehicle) dynamics. The friction law is tested by comparing numerical results to the full rubber friction theory (B. N. J. Persson, J. Phys. : Condensed Matter 18, 7789 (2006)). Good agreement is found between the two theories. We describe a two-dimensional (2 D) tire model which combines the rubber friction model with a simple mass-spring description of the tire body.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an iterative learning control (ILC) {{design for a}} vehicle Steer-by-Wire (SbW) system. First, the SbW system is modeled as a second-order system from the steering motor input voltage to the front wheel angle. For simplicity, the <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> and the friction between the tires and various road surfaces are treated as unknown external disturbance imposed at the SbW system input. Next, a discretetime ILC is designed for the SbW system under the scenario that the steering reference command is periodic. The ILC is essentially a feedforward control approach which utilizes past information of the control loop to further reduce the tracking error in each iteration. Finally, simulation is carried out to validate {{the performance of the}} ILC design. It is shown that the steering tracking error achieved by the ILC is much smaller than a conventional PD controller...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} sliding mode {{learning}} control (SMLC) scheme is developed for steer-by-wire (SbW) systems. It is shown that an SbW system with uncertain system parameters and unknown external disturbance from {{the interactions between}} the tires and the variable road surface can be modeled as a second-order system. A sliding mode learning controller can then be designed to drive both the sliding variable and the tracking error between the steered front-wheel angle and the hand-wheel reference angle to asymptotically converge to zero. The proposed SMLC scheme exhibits many advantages over the existing schemes, including: 1) no information about vehicle parameter uncertainties and <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> variations is required for controller design; and 2) the control algorithm is capable of efficiently adjusting the closed-loop response based on the most recent history of the closed-loop stability and ensuring a robust steering performance.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the addition of}} camber to a previously published semi-empirical tyre model by the same authors. The model combines empirical models for pure braking, cornering and cambering with a model for simultaneous braking, cornering and cambering. It is based on brush-model tyre mechanics and aims to offer an easy-to-use accurate model for vehicle-handling simulations. The proposed model is a method to extract and rescale the adhesion and sliding forces from empirical pure-slip tyre models {{to account for the}} combined-slip condition. The combined-slip <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> is described likewise. Cambering affects the natural path of the tyre carcass on the road surface and deforms the threads to produce an additional force in the lateral direction. Thereby, the proportions of the sliding and adhesive forces changes. The model is computationally sound and efficient and does not rely on any additional parameters that depend on combined-slip data for calibration. It can be used in combination with virtually any empirical pure-slip model...|$|E
40|$|The steer-by-wire (SbW) system, {{in which}} the {{conventional}} mechanical linkage between {{the steering wheel and}} the front wheel is removed, is capable of acting as an actuator for the active front steering system enhancing vehicle handling performance and safety. Several control strategies have been utilized to control the front wheel subsystem, which is {{the main part of the}} SbW system, and the steering response of SbW in the presence of system uncertainties and external disturbance has been improved; however, improvement of the controller transient response is not considered in most of these control strategies. In this paper a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) control method for the front wheel subsystem is first established. The NFTSM technique aims to provide a fast transient response for the front wheel tracking controller in the existence of system uncertainties and disturbance including the tire <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque,</b> Coulomb friction torque and variation of road condition.

40|$|A new tyre-force {{model for}} {{simultaneous}} braking and cornering is presented, {{which is based}} on combining existing empirical models for pure braking and cornering with brush-model tyre mechanics. The aim is to offer an easy-to-use, accurate model for vehicle-handling simulations. On a working tyre the contact patch between the tyre and the road is, in general, divided into an adhesion region where the rubber is gripping the road and a sliding region where the rubber slides on the road surface. The total force generated by the tyre is then composed of components from these two regions. The brush model describes this in a mechanical framework. The proposed model is based on a new method to extract adhesion and sliding forces from empirical pure-slip tyre models. These forces are then scaled to account for the combined-slip condition. The combined-slip <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> is also described. A particular feature of the model is the inclusion of velocity dependence, even if this is not explicitly present in the empirical pure-slip model. The approach is quite different from most previous combined-slip models, in that it is based on a rather detailed mechanical model in combination with empirical pure-slip models. The model is computationally sound and efficient and does not rely on any additional parameters that depend on combined-slip data for calibration. It can be used in combination with virtually any empirical pure-slip model and in this work the Magic Formula is used in examples. Results show good correspondence with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to derive the tire forces for simultaneous braking and cornering, by combining empirical models for pure braking and cornering using brush-model tire mechanics. The method {{is aimed at}} simulation of vehicle handling, and is of intermediate complexity such {{that it may be}} implemented and calibratedby the end user. The brush model states that the contact patch between the tire and the road is divided into an adhesion region where the rubber is gripping the road and a sliding region where the rubber slides on the road surface. The total force generated by the tire is then composed of components from these two regions. In the proposed method the adhesion and the sliding forces are extracted from anempirical pure-slip tire model and then scaled to account for the combined-slip condition. The combined-slip <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> is described likewise. The separation of the adhesive and sliding forces makes it possible to let the sliding force depend on the relative velocity between the tire and the road. This introduces a velocity dependence in the model, even though this is not explicitly present inthe pure-slip model. The approach is quite different from most previous combined-slip models, in that it is based on a rather detailed mechanical model in combination with empirical pure-slip models. The model is computationally sound and efficient and does not rely on any additional parameters that depend on combined-slip data for calibration.

40|$|A new 3 D mathematical-physical tire {{model is}} presented. This model {{considers}} {{not only the}} handling behavior of the tire but also its comfort characteristics, i. e., the dynamic properties in the lateral and the vertical planes. This model {{can be divided into}} two parts, the structural model and the contact area model. The structural parameters are identified by comparison with frequency responses of a 3 D finite element model of the tire, whereas the contact parameters are directly calculated with a finite element model of the tread pattern. The 3 D physical model allows predicting both steady state and transient behavior of the tire without the need of any experimental tests on the tire. The steady state analysis allows obtaining the friction circle diagram, i. e., the plot of the lateral force against the longitudinal force for different slip angles and for longitudinal slip, and the Gough plot, i. e., the diagram of the <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> versus the lateral force. The transient analysis allows obtaining the dynamic behavior of the tire for any maneuver given to the wheel. Among its outputs there are the relaxation length and the dynamic forces and torque transmitted to the suspension of the vehicle. Combining the tire model with the vehicle model it is possible to perform any kind of maneuver such as overtaking, changing of lane and steering pad at growing speed with or without braking, or accelerating. Therefore the 3 D tire model {{can be seen as a}} powerful tool to optimize the tire characteristics through a sensitivity analysis performed with tire and vehicle models linked to each other without the need of building prototypes. Some preliminary comparisons with experimental data have been carried out...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} {{for developing a}} tire suitable for performing small scale vehicle dynamics research is discussed. This will allow for physical verification of vehicle dynamics modelling and controls in environments where a full scale prototype is either not feasible or too large an investment. Currently, scale vehicle research {{is limited by the}} availability of tires on the desired scale, which are typically sourced from the radio controlled (RC) vehicle industry. Use of these tires, however, results in poor similitude between the representative scale vehicle and the full scale vehicle. This is due to variations in the behaviour of the scale tire to the full scale tire. An existing analytical tire model known as the cornering force <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> model (CF/SAT), is analyzed and modifications to the model are proposed to allow it to be used for non-dimensional tire parameterization. The model is then non-dimensionalized, using Buckingham Pi theory, to allow for comparison of small scale tire performance to large scale tire performance. A static load-deflection tire testing apparatus named the Windsor Automotive Tire Tester (WATT) is also developed. This machine is used to analyze if it is possible to determine the CF/SAT parameters for a given tire without the use of full scale tire dynamic studies and regression analysis. A DUBRO 5. 00 T. V. RC airplane tire is then parameterized and modelled using relationships derived from the static tire data. The results of the tire model are compared with experimental data of the DUBRO 5. 00 T. V. tire in order to analyze the effectiveness of the approach. It was found {{that it was possible to}} estimate some tire parameters using this method, however, more research is required to fully parameterize the tire using static load-deflection data...|$|E
40|$|Bobsleigh is {{a winter}} sport in which teams make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in gravity-powered sleds. To {{win the race}} it is of great {{importance}} to have a sled that is optimized from both the sliding and the aerodynamic point of view. However, also typical vehicle parameters, such as the weight distribution and the inclination of the steering axis, play an important role. In fact, being the friction coefficient between skates and ice very small (approx. 0. 04), an change in the weight acting on the front skates may significantly modify the steering feedback of the driver thus highlighting his/her driving ability. Better trajectories imply less corrections on the steering axis and thus better performances. The inclination of the steering axis, instead, generates a torque similar to the <b>self-aligning</b> <b>torque</b> produced by road vehicle tires thus stabilizing the front skates and requiring less control ac-tions to the sled driver. Up to now, bobsleigh design {{has been carried out}} mainly {{on the basis of the}} feedback of ath-letes. The drawback of this approach is that it leads to small modifications in the bobsleigh design and it does not allow to objectively identify the influence of the applied modifica-tions/innovative solutions on the bobsleigh overall performance. To be able to quantify the influence of certain design changes on the performance of bob-sleighs, it was decided to set up a multi-body model of a two-men sled. To validate the nu-merical model an experimental campaign with an instrumented bobsleigh was carried out at Cesana Pariol Olympic Park. During the tests, the bobsleigh was instrumented with two iner-tial gyroscopic platforms to measure the dynamics of the two frames constituting the bob-sleigh body, sixteen strain gauge channels to measure the ice-skates contact forces, one optical sensor to measure the bobsleigh speed and one potentiometer to measure the steer an-gle imposed by the driver. Numerical results have shown a good agreement with the experi-mental data...|$|E
