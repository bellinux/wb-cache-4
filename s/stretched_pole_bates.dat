40|$|Back {{ground and}} introduction: Thoracic Core {{conditioning}} exercises {{are found to}} be effective in increasing chest expansion in healthy middle aged individuals. The purpose is to find the short term effect of thoracic core conditioning using <b>stretch</b> <b>pole</b> on improving thoracic expansion, intensity of perceived exertion of breathlessness and functional performance for community elderly with moderate COPD. Method: A Single blinded experimental study design, 40 subjects with moderate COPD randomized 20 subjects into each Study and Control group. Study group received thoracic core conditioning exercises with <b>stretch</b> <b>pole</b> while Control group received thoracic core conditioning exercises without <b>stretch</b> <b>pole</b> for one week. Subjects were followed up after one week post intervention where no intervention was given during follow up week. Results: Analysis using RMANOVA found that there was a statistically significant (p< 0. 05) greater percentage of improvement in Chest expansion, intensity of perceived exertion and functional performance following one week of intervention in Study group when compared with Control Group. During follow-up there is statistically significant greater percentage of maintenance of improvements were found in study group than control group. Conclusion: It is concluded that thoracic core conditioning exercises with <b>stretch</b> <b>pole</b> found to be more effective than without <b>stretch</b> <b>pole</b> in short term improving chest expansion, intensity of perceived exertion and functiona...|$|R
50|$|A beitass, or a <b>stretching</b> <b>pole,</b> is {{a wooden}} spar used on Viking ships that was fitted {{into a pocket}} at the lower corner of the sail. This {{innovation}} was used to stiffen and hold {{the edge of the}} sail when sailing close to the wind.|$|R

5000|$|An {{innovation}} that improved the sail's performance was the beitass, or <b>stretching</b> <b>pole</b> [...] - [...] a wooden spar stiffening the sail. The windward {{performance of the}} ship was poor by modern standards as there was no centreboard, deep keel or leeboard. To assist in tacking the beitass kept the luff taut. Bracing lines were attached to the luff and led through holes on the forward gunwale. Such holes were often reinforced with short sections of timber about 500 to 700 mm long {{on the outside of}} the hull.|$|R
60|$|The {{furniture}} of {{the cabins}} was, like the clothing of the pioneers, homemade. A bedstead was contrived by <b>stretching</b> <b>poles</b> from forked sticks {{driven into the}} ground, and laying clapboards across them; the bedclothes were bearskins. Stools, benches, and tables were roughed out with auger and broadax; the puncheon floor was left bare, and if the earth formed the floor, no rug ever replaced the grass which was its first carpet. The cabin had but one room where the whole of life went on by day; the father and mother slept there at night, and the children mounted to their chamber in the loft {{by means of a}} ladder.|$|R
50|$|According to Myers, “‘Players cannot {{expect to}} {{overcome}} golf’s many challenges without peak {{physical fitness and}} mental focus.’” In his work at The Golf Learning Center, Myers concentrates on flexibility as an integral component of injury prevention, and therefore, creates unique stretching routines for guests to use during their stay at the resort and to continue upon returning home. He devised The Randy Myers Golf <b>Stretching</b> <b>Pole,</b> the only such training aid approved by the United States Golf Association for players to carry in their golf bags. Beyond the stretching plan, Myers provides a fitness program designed to improve the player’s game. He creates this program based on his “fitness handicap,” a form of assessment Myers himself developed to judge the individual’s fitness {{in terms of the}} physical necessities and desires for the sport.|$|R
50|$|The Robinson {{projection}} {{is neither}} equal-area nor conformal, abandoning both for a compromise. The creator felt this produced a better overall view {{than could be}} achieved by adhering to either. The meridians curve gently, avoiding extremes, but thereby <b>stretch</b> the <b>poles</b> into long lines instead of leaving them as points.|$|R
6000|$|Crayford {{opened the}} door. It led into a desolate inclosure, half garden, half yard. Some nets <b>stretched</b> on <b>poles</b> were hanging up to dry. No other objects were visible--not a living {{creature}} {{appeared in the}} place. [...] "It doesn't look very inviting, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Crayford. [...] "I am at your service, however.

60|$|The pack-horses were {{unloaded}} {{and when}} the tents were pitched the surveyor's cook helped Carrie to prepare an unusually good meal. When it was over the party sat outside the surveyor's tent, which had a double top <b>stretched</b> on <b>poles</b> beyond its front. The surveyor studied their faces with understanding, for he knew the wilds and noted signs of strain. He thought all had a fine-drawn look.|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Maine, Drew {{received}} degrees from Bates College in Maine and Springfield College in Massachusetts. He played football for both schools. He also played baseball and also competed as a <b>pole</b> vaulter at <b>Bates</b> College. His athletic career {{was interrupted by}} service as a naval aviator during World War I.|$|R

60|$|The Indian village, {{which was}} merely a cluster of tents made of deerskins <b>stretched</b> on <b>poles,</b> was now plainly visible from the {{commanding}} ridge along which the party travelled. It occupied a piece of green level land on {{the margin of the}} lake before referred to, and, with its background of crag and woodland and its distance of jagged purple hills, formed as lovely a prospect as the eye of man could dwell upon.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s, the Japanese {{improved}} {{this method}} by placing nets of synthetic material tied to bamboo poles. This effectively doubled the production. A cheaper variant {{of this method}} is called the hibi method — simple ropes <b>stretched</b> between bamboo <b>poles.</b>|$|R
60|$|Neale {{went out}} {{in search of a}} meal and entered the first restaurant. It was merely a canvas house <b>stretched</b> over <b>poles,</b> with {{compartments}} at the back. High wooden benches served as tables, low benches as seats. The floor was sand. At one table sat a Mexican, an Irishman, and a Negro. The Irishman was drunk. The Negro came to wait on Neale, and, receiving an order, went to the kitchen. The Irishman sidled over to Neale.|$|R
60|$|The {{buffalo and}} elk were hunted with {{the bow and}} arrow. This {{effective}} weapon {{did not make a}} noise and frighten the game. The wary Indian crawled through the high grass until within easy range and sometimes killed several buffalo or elk before the herd became alarmed. The meat was then jerked. This consisted in cutting it into thin strips and drying it in the sun. Afterwards it was hung up in the lodges. The skins were <b>stretched</b> on <b>poles</b> to dry, and when cured they served as robes, clothing and wigwam-coverings.|$|R
50|$|Permian {{period is}} {{characterized}} by the presence of single supercontinent called Pangea. Pangaea <b>stretched</b> from <b>pole</b> to pole, and thus created a single great ocean called Panthalassa, and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, which was located between Asia and Gondwana. The single gigantic continental landmass created climates of extreme continental climate, which {{is characterized by}} extreme variations of heat and cold as well as highly seasonal monsoon conditions {{in some parts of the}} supercontinent. Not all regions received abundant rainfalls, and deserts were widespread on Pangaea. Such climate patterns favored gymnosperms, over plants that use spore dispersion.|$|R
50|$|A tea chest bass is a {{variation}} of the washtub bass that uses a tea chest as the resonator for an upright stringed bass. The instrument is made from a pole, traditionally a broomstick, placed into or alongside the chest. One or more strings are <b>stretched</b> along the <b>pole</b> and plucked.|$|R

5000|$|On the night, the gang's hired {{train driver}} (an {{acquaintance}} of Ronnie Biggs, later {{referred to as}} [...] "Stan Agate" [...] or [...] "Peter") was unable to operate this newer type of locomotive; although having driven trains for many years (by then retired), he was experienced only on shunting (switching) locomotives on the Southern Region. With no other alternative available to them, it was quickly decided that Mills {{would have to move}} the train to the stopping point near the bridge, which was indicated by a white sheet <b>stretched</b> between <b>poles</b> on the track. Ronnie Biggs's only task was to supervise Stan Agate's participation in the robbery, and when it became obvious that Agate was not able to drive the train, he and Biggs were sent to the waiting truck to help load the mail bags.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{opposition}} between the tourists and the vagabonds is the major, principal {{division of the}} postmodern society. We are all plotted on a continuum <b>stretched</b> between the <b>poles</b> of the "perfect tourist" and the "vagabond beyond remedy" - andour respective places between the poles are plotted according {{to the degree of}} freedom we possess in choosing our life itineraries. Freedom of choice is in the postmodern society by far the most seminal among the stratifying factors. The more freedom of choice one has, the higher is his or her rank in the postmodern social hierarchy. ...|$|R
50|$|The steel {{superstructure}} includes the bridge, rigged mast, and cable. The main {{span of the}} bridge, which is <b>stretched</b> between two <b>poles,</b> has a length of 450 meters. The main span is a trapezoid 33 meters wide. The bridge has a walkway along its side. The bridge has two main pylons 3 x 4.50 metres. This serves to hold the tension of the cable and weight into the pylon pier. The 121 - 167 mm diameter cables consist of many small wires wound together. The cables vary in length from 50 to 223 meters can absorb the tension for 1,500 - 3,000 tons.|$|R
60|$|One of the Siwash {{shook out}} the two spritsails which {{sat on a}} <b>pole</b> <b>stretching</b> up to the peak from {{the foot of the}} mast, and when he had led the sheets aft his {{companion}} knelt astern with a paddle held over the gunwale. Slanting gently down to the faint breeze, the craft slid away through the smooth, green water with a long ripple running back behind her. The log houses dropped astern and were lost among the trees, a valley filled with somber forest, and a rampart of tall hillside, slipped by, and as they crept on from point to point the strip of still water stretched away before them between somber ranks of climbing trees.|$|R
60|$|When {{she reached}} the wagon Alison found it covered by a heavy {{waterproof}} sheet which was <b>stretched</b> across a <b>pole.</b> Loose hay had been strewn between a row of wooden cases and {{one side of the}} vehicle and the space beneath the sheeted roof was filled with a faint aromatic odor, which she afterward learned was the smell of the wild peppermint that grows in the prairie grass. When she had spread one blanket on the hay the couch felt seductively soft, and she sank into it contentedly. Tired as she was, however, she did not go to sleep immediately, for it was the first night she had ever spent in the open, and for a time the strangeness of her surroundings reacted on her.|$|R
60|$|On the 10th of May {{the party}} {{arrived at the}} Omaha (pronounced Omawhaw) village, about eight hundred and thirty miles above {{the mouth of the}} Missouri, and encamped in its neighborhood. The village was {{situated}} under a hill {{on the bank of the}} river, and consisted of about eighty lodges. These were of a circular and conical form, and about sixteen feet in diameter; being mere tents of dressed buffalo skins, sewed together and <b>stretched</b> on long <b>poles,</b> inclined towards each other so as to cross at about half their height. Thus the naked tops of the poles diverge in such a manner that, if they were covered with skins like the lower ends, the tent would be shaped like an hour-glass, and present the appearance of one cone inverted on the apex of another.|$|R
500|$|Liquid water cannot {{exist on}} the surface of Mars due to low {{atmospheric}} pressure, which is less than 1% that of Earth's, except at the lowest elevations for short periods.

The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008.|$|R
50|$|Most {{information}} about the Nicoleño comes through Juana Maria. When Nidever located her, {{she was living in}} a round brush enclosure, about 6 ft in diameter and 5 ft high, with a narrow opening on one side. She cooked her food over a fire inside her home. Several similar enclosures were still standing at the time, and another type of structure, made of brush walls supported by whale ribs, was also found. Juana Maria hung seal meat from a series of 4 - 8 ft long poles placed around the structures, or from ropes <b>stretched</b> between the <b>poles.</b> Like other California natives, the Nicoleño were apparently skilled basket weavers, and Juana Maria is described as making four different shapes. When found she was wearing a dress made of green cormorant skins, decorated with feathers. She had a number of possessions made of sinew and bone.|$|R

Beginning at the ring, where the only deep level station was located, the line follows the Krasnaya Presnya street and then turns north along the 1905 year street, further work was hampered by the necessity to cross under the sorting yard of the Belorussky Rail Terminal with a total of 27 individual railroads, and when building the last <b>stretch</b> Polezhayevskaya-Oktyabrskoye <b>Pole.</b> In both cases the soil was typical sand that was used to elevate the railways, which made it impossible to bore under using conventional means. First chemical adhesive had to be used to strengthen it, so that when drained, it would not fall in. To avoid a collapse after the shield bored its way, a horizontal platform had to be installed above it, and the TBM moved at maximum pressure, without any temporary joining in the sand. Just like the Zhdanovskaya Line, the line relieved major transport arteries and congestion, Begovaya was built in a similar manner to Tekstilshchiki with exists from subways coming straight onto railway platforms.|$|R
