5000|$|RAID 1 {{consists}} of data mirroring, without parity or striping. Data is written identically to two drives, thereby producing a [...] "mirrored set" [...] of drives. Thus, any read request can be serviced by any {{drive in the}} set. If a request is broadcast to every drive in the set, it can be serviced by the drive that accesses the data first (depending on its seek time and rotational latency), improving performance. Sustained read throughput, if the controller or software is optimized for it, approaches the sum of throughputs of every drive in the set, just as for RAID 0. Actual read throughput of most RAID 1 implementations is slower than the fastest drive. Write throughput is always <b>slower</b> because every <b>drive</b> must be updated, and the <b>slowest</b> <b>drive</b> limits the write performance. The array continues to operate as long as at least one drive is functioning.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} an active gate drive (AGD) {{technology}} for high-power insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT’s). It {{is based on}} an optimal combination of several requirements necessary for good switching performance under hard-switching conditions. The scheme specifically combines together the <b>slow</b> <b>drive</b> requirements for low noise and switching stress and the fast drive requirements for high-speed switching and low switching energy loss. The gate drive can also effectively dampen oscillations during low-current turn-on transient in the IGBT. This paper looks at the conflicting requirements of the conventional gate drive circuit design and demonstrates using experimental results that the proposed three-stage AGD technique can be an effective solution.

40|$|We {{find that}} the {{hypothesis}} made by Jan, Stauffer and Moseley [Theory in Biosc., 119, 166 (2000) ] {{for the evolution of}} sex, namely a strategy devised to escape extinction due to too many deleterious mutations, is sufficient but not necessary for the successful evolution of a steady state population of sexual individuals within a finite population. Simply allowing for a finite probability for conversion to sex in each generation also gives rise to a stable sexual population, in the presence of an upper limit on the number of deleterious mutations per individual. For large values of this probability, we find a phase transition to an intermittent, multi-stable regime. On the other hand, in the limit of extremely <b>slow</b> <b>drive,</b> another transition takes place to a different steady state distribution, with fewer deleterious mutations within the asexual population.

40|$|When {{the drive}} which causes the level {{crossing}} in a qubit is slow, the probability, P_{LZ}, of the Landau-Zener transition {{is close to}} 1. We show that in this regime, which is most promising for applications, the noise due to the coupling to the environment, reduces the average P_{LZ}. At the same time, the survival probability, 1 -P_{LZ}, which is exponentially small for a <b>slow</b> <b>drive,</b> can be completely dominated by noise-induced correction. Our main message is {{that the effect of}} a weak classical noise can be captured analytically by treating it as a perturbation in the Schroedinger equation. This allows us to study the dependence of the noise-induced correction to P_{LZ} on the correlation time of the noise. As this correlation time exceeds the bare Landau-Zener transition time, the effect of noise becomes negligible. We consider two conventional realizations of noise: Gaussian noise and telegraph noise.

40|$|We take a {{new look}} at {{parameter}} estimation for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). In particular, we propose using Riemannian manifold optimization as a powerful counterpart to Expectation Maximization (EM). An out-of-the-box invocation of manifold optimization, however, fails spectacularly: it converges to the same solution but vastly <b>slower.</b> <b>Driven</b> by intuition from manifold convexity, we then propose a reparamerization that has remarkable empirical consequences. It makes manifold optimization not only match EM [...] -a highly encouraging result in itself given the poor record nonlinear programming methods have had against EM so far [...] -but also outperform EM in many practical settings, while displaying much less variability in running times. We further highlight the strengths of manifold optimization by developing a somewhat tuned manifold LBFGS method that proves even more competitive and reliable than existing manifold optimization tools. We hope that our results encourage a wider consideration of manifold optimization for parameter estimation problems. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

An existing perturbative diagonalization by Imbrie is simplified and reinterpreted {{in order to prove}} the anticipated form of the Lieb-Robinson bound and the area law in an eigenstate. We also show how to approximately reduce Imbrie’s unitary to a finite depth circuit. The concept of resonances in Imbrie’s work can be given a physical meaning as an avoided crossing of levels as functions of a magnetic field. For a <b>slow</b> <b>drive</b> of this field, we discuss the proofs of validity for an efficient classical simulation of such disordered systems, both isolated and in contact with the environment. Our results are applicable to Floquet systems and describe an unexpected mechanism of heating up over long times.

40|$|We studied {{changes of}} the transmembrane resting and steady state action {{potentials}} in the rabbit atrial trabecular preparations (length 2 - 4 mm, diameter 150 - 800 micrometers, standard microelectrode techniques). Following cessation of rapid drive the transmembrane potential shows an initial depolarization and a terminal hyperpolarization. Increasing the stimulation frequencies before the cessation of driving the initial depolarization and the terminal hyperpolarization are more accentuated. When the stimulation frequency is abruptly reduced, the enddiastolic ("resting") potential increases (steady state resting potential - 82 +/- 3 mV at 1. 0 s, - 73 +/- 6 mV at 0. 25 s driving interval). Decreasing the rate of stimulation {{the duration of the}} steady state action potential shortens at 25 % and prolongs at 90 % repolarization.
