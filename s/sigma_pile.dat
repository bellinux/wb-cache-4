40|$|The Brookhaven Nationa Laboratory <b>Sigma</b> <b>Pile</b> a Radium-Beryllium {{neutron source}} {{imbedded}} in a cube of graphite blocks. The pile is approximately 2. 13 m on four sides and is 3. 07 m high. Absolute and relative thermal neutron flux measurements {{have been made}} using gold and indium foils, which were both bare and cadmiw covered. Thermo-luminescent dosimeters {{were used to determine}} the neutron and gamma-ray dose rates in the pile. Gamma-ray dose rate measurements have also been made in the air outside of the pile, while the Radium-Beryllium neutron source was being withdrawn fiom the pile. The Monte Carlo MCNP code has been used to calculate the coupled neutron-photon &amport, Measured dose rates at various locations agreed with the calculated values within 5 % to 15 %...|$|E
