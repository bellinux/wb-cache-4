5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's chances in the 2006 congressional elections. It states that Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E

25|$|Captain Nutsch soon {{requested}} {{replacements for}} the traditional small, hard, wooden saddles used by the Afghanistan soldiers. He specified a supply of lightweight saddles, either McClellan or Australian-style, suitable for the smaller Afghan horses. A supply of saddles was air-dropped in mid-November. The last U.S. Army unit to receive horseback training was the 28th Cavalry in 1943. A picture of the soldiers on horseback was shown by Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> during a news conference on 15 November 2001. When sculptor Douwe Blumberg saw that image, he felt impressed {{that he had to}} do something and created what became the only public sculpture to commemorate special forces, America's Response Monument.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the uprisings U.S. General John Abizaid in April 2004 {{requested}} an additional 10,000 troops be sent to Iraq after admitting that a number of Iraqi security personnel had abandoned their posts or joined the Iraqi insurgency. On 16 April 2004, U.S. Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> announced that he had approved General Abizaid's request and had extended the tour of roughly 20,000 soldiers, who were scheduled to be rotated out of Iraq, by three months. A fresh mass grave was found near Ramadi, containing the bodies of over 350 Iraqis. It is unclear whether this mass grave contained dead civilians and/or militants.|$|E
25|$|The artist, {{sculptor}} Douwe Blumberg, {{had been}} a horse trainer for 18 years and is a military history buff. He has completed more than 200 private and public commissions and has received numerous awards. He was inspired to begin the sculpture by a photo that Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> displayed {{at a press conference}} shortly after U.S. forces entered Afghanistan. As part of Operation Enduring Freedom, President George W. Bush sent covert forces into Afghanistan to help the Northern Alliance defeat the Taliban. The group, named Task Force Dagger, was a joint Special Operations team consisting of Green Berets from the 5th Special Forces Group, aircrew members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ("Nightstalkers"), and Air Force Combat Controllers.|$|E

25|$|In November 2011, the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission purportedly {{exercised}} {{universal jurisdiction}} {{to try and}} convict in absentia former US President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for the invasion of Iraq. In May 2012, the tribunal again under a purported exercise of universal jurisdiction took testimony from victims of torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and convicted in absentia former President Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld,</b> former Deputy Assistant Attorneys General John Yoo and Jay Bybee, former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, and former counselors David Addington and William Haynes II for conspiracy to commit war crimes. The tribunal referred their findings to the chief prosecutor at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.|$|E
500|$|Though {{neither side}} ever apologized, a US-Turkish {{commission}} {{set up to}} investigate the incident later issued a joint statement of regret. In addition, US Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> {{wrote a letter to}} the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan expressing sorrow over the incident. The Hood event damaged diplomatic relations between Turkey and the United States and marked a low point in US-Turkish relations. [...] While the incident received comparatively little coverage in the United States, it was a major event in Turkey, many of whose citizens saw it as a deliberate insult and nicknamed it [...] "The Hood event".|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, even as {{the term}} came into wide use, there was {{disagreement}} about its exact meaning. In 2002 a U.S. State Department official, reporting on a meeting between President George W. Bush {{and the leaders of}} Japan and Pakistan, said that the latter, Pervez Musharraf, had referred to the [...] "possibility of trouble in the Arab street, whatever that is" [...] over the upcoming invasion of Iraq. This uncertainty has led to confusion over what the term represents. During the same period of time, Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> later recalled, Arab leaders urged him to make sure the operation went quickly as they [...] "were worried about the 'Arab street' erupting in anger at the West's invasion of a Muslim country. I was skeptical of the idea that a monolithic Arab street existed... but I did understand that popular discontent could cause them difficulties." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 12, 2002, Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> and General Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, {{dedicated}} the Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. The memorial specifically {{honors the}} five individuals for whom no identifiable remains were found. This included Dana Falkenberg, age three, who was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 {{with her parents}} and older sister. A portion of the remains of 25 other victims are also buried at the site. The memorial is a pentagonal granite marker [...] high. On five sides of the memorial along the top are inscribed the words [...] "Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon September 11, 2001". Aluminum plaques, painted black, are inscribed with the names of the 184 victims of the terrorist attack. The site is located in Section 64, on a slight rise, which gives it a view of the Pentagon.|$|E
500|$|Gingrich {{has served}} on several commissions, {{including}} the Hart-Rudman Commission, formally known as the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st century, which examined national security issues affecting the armed forces, law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

For over two decades, Gingrich has taught at the United States Air Force's Air University, where he is the longest-serving teacher of the Joint Flag Officer Warfighting Course. In addition, he is an honorary Distinguished Visiting Scholar and Professor at the National Defense University and teaches officers from all of the defense services.

500|$|On June 26, {{two days}} before the summit, US Under Secretary of State R. Nicholas Burns and US Ambassador to Russia Alexander Vershbow wrote a joint {{newspaper}} article in which they commented that the relations between NATO and Russia were good and that NATO and Russia took [...] "a little-noticed but enormous step in our maturing partnership", referring to [...] "Exercise Kaliningrad 2004" [...] which brought together some 1,000 personnel from 22 NATO member and partner countries for a terrorism response exercise. In practice, several rifts between Russia and NATO were visible and became increasingly more so during the summit. One rift existed about NATO's non-ratification of the adapted CFE treaty and Russia's non-fulfillment of its OSCE obligations (the withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova and Georgia). Even before the summit commenced, the rift was visible as US Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> stopped, en route to Istanbul, in Moldova where he called for the withdrawal of Russian forces from the country. Another reason for tension was the accession of seven Eastern European states to NATO in March 2004 and NATO's increasing cooperation with other Eastern European and Caucasian states. On June 27, Russia warned NATO to respect its security interests and expressed concern over NATO's stepped up activity in the Caucasus and Central Asia.|$|E
