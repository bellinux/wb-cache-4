In {{the course of a}} junior research group, supported by the Development Bank of Saxony as well as the European social fund, the magnesium alloy WE 43 was successfully Twin-Roll-Cast for the first time. For this, a new developed casting system with a maximum width of 250 mm has been used. This system is part of the Twin-Roll-Casting pilot plant at the Institute of Metal Forming, which is used in collaboration with the MgF Magnesium Flachprodukte GmbH. Previously, differential scanning calorimetry was carried out in order to get more information about the solidification range of the WE 43 alloy. Subsequent to Twin-Roll-Casting, the WE 43 sheet was homogenized at different temperatures, and hot rolled to a final thickness of 2 mm. with a reduction per pass of 10 % to 15 %. After every second reduction stage an intermediate annealing was performed. The influence of temperature and time of the annealing on microstructure and mechanical properties has been investigated. Based on the results, conclusions for Twin-Roll-Casting and hot rolling of a WE 43 alloy in industrial scale were made. Finally, a comparison between WE 43 and AZ 31 has been established...|$|E

The present experimental program consists of testing 10 half-scale specimens divided into three groups covering three possible defects {{in addition to an}} adequately detailed control specimen. The considered defects include the absence of the transverse reinforcement within the joint core, insufficient bond length for the beam main reinforcement and inadequate spliced implanted column on the joint. Three different strengthening schemes were used to rehabilitate the defected beam–column joints including externally bonded CFRP <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets</b> in addition to near surface mounted (NSM) CFRP strips. The failure criteria including ultimate capacity, mode of failure, initial stiffness, ductility and the developed ultimate strain in the reinforcing steel and CFRP were considered and compared for each group for the control and the CFRP-strengthened specimens. The test results showed that the proposed CFRP strengthening configurations represented the best choice for strengthening the first two defects from the viewpoint of the studied failure criteria. On the other hand, the results of the third group showed that strengthening the joint using NSM strip technique enabled the specimen to outperform the structural performance of the control specimen while strengthening the joints using externally bonded CFRP <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets</b> failed to restore the strengthened joints capacity...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis: This paper {{presents}} an analytical investigation conducted {{to study the}} flexural behavior of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with various Near-Surface Mounted (NSM) Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) reinforcements. The materials used in this investigation included carbon-fiber-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) rebars <b>and</b> <b>strips,</b> <b>and</b> glass fiber-reinforced-polymer (GFRP) rebars <b>and</b> <b>strips.</b> The analysis included the effects of strengthening on the serviceability and ultimate limit states as well the effect of tension stiffening. The effectiveness of NSM FRP rebars <b>and</b> <b>strips</b> was examined <b>and</b> compared to externally bonded (EB) FRP <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets</b> using the same material type and axial stiffness. Results from the analytical models were compared with those obtained from experimental studies. The analytical results agree very well with those obtained from the experimental results.

Using the same axial stiffness of FRP to strengthen reinforced concrete beams, the beams strengthened with NSM FRP reinforcement achieved higher ultimate load than beams strengthened with EB FRP reinforcement.

50|$|In a flat metal workpiece, the {{flatness}} is {{a descriptive}} attribute characterizing {{the extent of}} the geometric deviation from a reference plane. The deviation from complete flatness is the direct result of the workpiece relaxation after hot or cold rolling, due to the internal stress pattern caused by the non-uniform transversal compressive action of the rolls and the uneven geometrical properties of the entry material. The transverse distribution of differential strain/elongation-induced stress with respect to the material's average applied stress is commonly referenced to as shape. Due to the strict relationship between shape and flatness, these terms can be used in an interchangeable manner. In the case of metal <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets,</b> the flatness reflects the differential fiber elongation across the width of the workpiece. This property must be subject to an accurate feedback-based control in order to guarantee the machinability of the metal sheets in the final transformation processes. Some technological details about the feedback control of flatness are given in.|$|R

The continu-ous-plastic SAFE also significantly reducedM. macleayi catches by ~ 7 %, but this was explained by ~ 5 % less wing-end spread, and could be simply negated through otter-board refinement.

The objective of this study was: (1) to highlight experimentally and analytically the influential parameters on the shear contribution of FRP to RC beams strengthened in shear using EB FRP <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> strips; and (2) to develop a set of transparent, coherent, and evolutionary design equations to calculate the shear resistance of RC beams strengthened in shear.

The specimens were strengthened in shear using carbon FRP (CFRP) <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets.</b> The test variables were: (1) {{the presence or absence}} of internal transverse-steel reinforcement; (2) use of FRP sheets versus FRP strips; and (3) the axial rigidity of the EB FRP reinforcement.

40|$|For {{many high}} rate PVD {{processes}} an adequate pre-treatment is necessary immediately before the deposition. Because the high deposition rate of some PVD techniques (e. g. electron beam (EB) evaporation) enable {{a very high}} throughput, the pre-treatment {{must be carried out}} with an adequate speed. The sputter etching in a magnetron discharge where the substrate serves as a cathode (target) seems to be a very promising pre-treatment technique for this purpose. This technique is especially suitable for flat, electrically conducting substrates like metal <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets.</b> Because of arc problems in direct current (DC) magnetron discharges due to insulating layers on the cathode surface experiments were carried out using discharges in the medium frequency (MF) range (10 [...] . 100 kHz). During the magnetron sputter etching the light emitted by the etching plasma was investigated by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). After the magnetron sputter etching the substrate surface was investigated by optical glow discharge emission spectroscopy (GDOES). Using a MF pulsed magnetron discharge for sputter etching the damage caused by cathode arcs on the substrate surface could be significantly diminished. However, the MF sputter etching process needs nearly twice as much energy as the DC process to remove a contamination layer from the substrate surface...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for analyzing in a unified manner both uniaxial and uniform biaxial strain {{data obtained from}} nearly isotropic tissues. The formulation is a direct application of nonlinear elasticity theory pertaining to large deformations. The general relation between Eulerian stress (σ) and extension ratio (λ) in soft isotropic elastic bodies undergoing uniform deformation takes the simple form: σ = ((λ 3 - 1) /λ) f(λ), where f(λ) must be determined for each material. The extension ratio may be either greater than 1. 0 (uniaxial elongation), or lie between zero and 1. 0 (uniform biaxial extension). Simple analytical functions for f(λ) are most readily found for each tissue by plotting all data as (λ 3 - 1) /λσ vs. λ. Of those tissues investigated in this way (dog pericardium and pleura, and cat mesentery and dura), all but pleura could be adequately described by a parabola: 1 /f(λ) = 1 /k{[(λM - λ) (λ - λm) ]/[λM - λm}. In these instances, three material constants per tissue (K, λM, λm) served to predict approximately the stresses attained during both small and large deformations, in <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets</b> alike.

To estimate {{the potential for the}} application of PVD-coatings (physical vapour deposition) different coating systems for steel sheet as well as for hot-dip or elect ro-galvanized steel sheet were designed, The samples were produced on a laboratory scale using PVD processes with very high deposition rates (in the order of 1 mum s(- 1)) as well as high-power plasma processes for the pre-treatment. The relationship between the composition, microstructure and properties of the coating systems, in particular concerning corrosion protection, abrasion during forming, phosphating and paint adhesion, were studied. It was found that the corrosion resistance of galvanized steel sheets can be considerably improved by vapour deposition of metal or inorganic films with a thickness of several hundred nanometers. Investigations on vapour deposition of titanium and stainless steel coatings on steel sheets, for applications in a severely corrosive environment, showed that the corrosion resistance in relation to the coating thickness can be significantly enhanced by means of plasma activation during the vapour deposition process, Finally, an outlook on possible industrial applications including an estimation of the process costs will be presented.

The performed investigation served as a basis for determining the illuminator and transmitter angles of inclination with respect to the surface unden control. These angles provide for the maximum contrast of the scale against the background of flawless metal. A device is developed for compensating the dergee of diffusion of the object under check.
