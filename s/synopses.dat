5|$|Classic TV Press {{published}} the book Worlds Apart: an unofficial and unauthorised {{guide to the}} BBC's remake of Survivors (March 2010), written by Rich Cross, shortly after transmission of the second series completes. The book incorporates: in depth <b>synopses</b> and reviews for all the episodes from Series 1 and 2; insights into {{the making of the}} series; examination of the similarities and differences between the new series and the 1970s series; a photographic guide to filming locations; and exclusive production shots.|$|E
5|$|The Gnome Motion Picture Company was a film {{production}} {{company that is}} credited with three productions between 1910 and 1911. The purpose of the company to was to produce stories about gnomes. Alice in Funnyland, The Birth of the Gnomes and Alice's New Year's Party were all productions that were most likely never released. Announcements in trade publications ceased in January 1911 and the company treasurer, Frederick Kalmbach, was later sued by the City of New York for taxes. Of the three planned productions, two official <b>synopses</b> were released in The Nickelodeon. Despite no evidence of an actual release, the American Film Institute still recognizes all three films as being released in January 1911.|$|E
5|$|The anime's {{first season}} focuses on Tenma, Harima, and Karasuma, and Harima's {{relationships}} with other females including Sawachika and Yakumo. Its second season involves more of the secondary cast. The Extra Class OVAs are compiled from various first season storylines. Both the Third Semester <b>synopses</b> and episodes return to the main cast. The anime's structure {{has been compared to}} Azumanga Daioh, with thematic influences from Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu. In places it makes deliberate use of unconventional nomenclature; the title of episode25 of season one is a set of pictograms, while episode26's title has 187 characters in the Japanese original. In season two, the Japanese title for episode26 consists of just a period.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to the Indies, Andjar formed another {{theatrical}} troupe, Bolero, with Effendi, but left the troupe around 1940 to work at Kolf Publishers in Surabaya. Effendi was left as the head of Bolero, which then became more politicised. At Kolf Andjar edited the publisher's magazine Poestaka Timoer. As his work entailed writing <b>synopses</b> and serials based on popular films for Kolf's magazine, he became increasingly involved in the film industry. He was soon asked by The Teng Chun, with whom he had maintained a business relationship, to direct a film for his company Java Industrial Film (JIF); with this Andjar became one of several noted theatrical personnel who migrated to film following Albert Balink's 1937 hit Terang Boelan (Full Moon).|$|E
5|$|The German naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger was {{the first}} to {{recognize}} the pinnipeds as a distinct taxonomic unit; in 1811 he gave the name Pinnipedia to both a family and an order. American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen reviewed the world's pinnipeds in an 1880 monograph, History of North American pinnipeds, a monograph of the walruses, sea-lions, sea-bears and seals of North America. In this publication, he traced the history of names, gave keys to families and genera, described North American species and provided <b>synopses</b> of species {{in other parts of the}} world. In 1989, Annalisa Berta and colleagues proposed the unranked clade Pinnipedimorpha to contain the fossil genus Enaliarctos and modern seals as a sister group. Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and the suborder Caniformia (known as dog-like carnivorans). Pinnipedia was historically considered its own suborder under Carnivora. Of the three extant families, the Otariidae and Odobenidae are grouped in the superfamily Otarioidea, while the Phocidae belong to the superfamily Phocoidea.|$|E

30|$|Gordon and Thomas (2014, 2017) {{presented}} {{evidence to}} suggest that interim testing does influence attention and encoding processes of subsequent information in a misinformation paradigm. Specifically, we found that participants spent more time reading sentences in the <b>synopsis</b> that included critical details if a test preceded the <b>synopsis.</b> Further, Gordon et al. (2015) found that both test questions and responses guided subsequent changes in reading time associated with <b>synopsis</b> details. When participants encountered <b>synopsis</b> details that contradicted interim test responses, participants spent more time on those details than when test responses and <b>synopsis</b> details agreed. Consistent with these findings, the present study demonstrated that interim testing influenced how the post-test <b>synopsis</b> was processed and encoded.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, he left behind two {{unfinished}} manuscripts and two one-page <b>synopses</b> for future adventures. Author Brad Strickland was commissioned by the Bellairs estate to complete the two unfinished manuscripts and to write novels based on the two one-page outlines. These would become The Ghost in the Mirror; The Vengeance of the Witch-finder; The Drum, the Doll, and the Zombie; and The Doom of the Haunted Opera, respectively. Starting in 1996 with The Hand of the Necromancer, Strickland began writing his own stories based on the established characters. In 1992, a historical marker was placed in front of the Cronin House in Bellairs's hometown of Marshall, noting that the imposing Italianate mansion was the basis for his 1973 book. Bellairs was inducted posthumously into the Haverhill Hall of Fame in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Leavitt {{continued}} {{to publish the}} eponymous almanac after he moved to Meredith. He had already founded a newspaper in 1811, while still living in Gilmanton, which he called The New Hampshire Register, and which he continued publishing for several years (181117). The Register became well-known thanks to Leavitt's habit of printing brief <b>synopses</b> of historical events. On the side, between farming, teaching school, and publishing his newspaper, Leavitt wrote and published at least eight textbooks on mathematics, grammar, astronomy, geography and music, including an edition of Nicolas Pike's widely distributed A New and Complete System of Arithmetic in 1826, {{as well as the}} staple textbooks of teachers across the nation The Scholar's Review and Teacher's Daily Assistant. The scores of textbooks produced by Leavitt, a dizzying array of titles down the years, including Complete Directions for Parsing the English Language; Or, The Rules of Grammar Made Easy: Being a New Grammatical Essay, Designed as a Supplement to Lindley Murray's Grammar, for the Use of Students as Soon as They Begin to Parse, make one wonder where Leavitt found the time.|$|E

500|$|Dwipayana's {{influence}} {{ensured that}} contemporary reviews, especially <b>synopses,</b> repeated the government's {{position on the}} G30S coup.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Video <b>synopsis</b> is {{the process}} of {{preserving}} key activities and eliminates the less important parts to create a short video summary of long original videos. These techniques are used for fast browsing, ectracting big data, effective storing and indexing. The video <b>synopsis</b> techniques are broadly classified into two types: object based approaches and frame based approaches. But these approaches cannot handle the complexity of the dynamic videos. In object movement method focus on the movements of a single video object, and remove the redundancies present in the object movement, it helps to generate the more compact and efficient video <b>synopsis.</b> Video <b>synopsis</b> is the most popular research in computer graphics and computer vision area and several researches started on this area.
