25|$|A {{performance}} of Faust begins with Christine singing {{the lead role}} of Marguerite ("Ah! Do I Hear My Lover's Voice?"). However, during the song there's an unscheduled blackout and when the lights come back up, Christine has disappeared. The show quickly adjourns {{and the rest of}} the cast <b>search</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns into the audience ("No Sign! I See No Sign!"). But to no avail. The scene switches to The Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind ("Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright").|$|E

When the {{conclusion}} is at last arrived at that it has irrecoverably disappeared all sorts of hypotheses will be started to account for it; some will think that it probably wandered to the hills and became the prey of hyenas or other wild beasts; some will assert {{that it has been}} killed and hidden away; others that it has made its way down to the Nile and has been carried off by a crocodile. Thus {{there is no reason why}} suspicion should fall upon you more than upon others, but you will have to play your part carefully." ...|$|E

I found the place {{in a state of}} wild excitement, for two or three of the men had just come in from the battlefield, and brought the news with them. They are all for the Stuarts there, and you would be well entertained, but there is sure to be a <b>search</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low,</b> and you would not be safe in any village. However, a lad has promised to be here in the morning, and he will guide us to a lonely hut {{in the heart of the}} hills, used by the shepherds in summer. You will be {{perfectly}} safe there." ...|$|E

[...] "We know not yet whether the evil-doers have cleared off, and methinks {{it is not likely}} that they will have gone yet. First they will <b>search</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> for us, then they will {{demolish}} the furniture, and take all they deem worth carrying; then, doubtless, they will quench their thirst in the cellar above, and lastly they will fire the house, thinking that although they cannot find us, they will burn us with it. They will wait some time outside to see if we appear at one of the windows, and not until the roof has fallen in will they be sure that we have perished. Moreover, you cannot well appear in the streets for the present in that attire, for you might well be recognized and denounced. First of all, let me persuade you to take such poor refreshments as I can offer you." ...|$|E
60|$|When the {{soldiers}} reached the farm, {{they went to}} the barn. They examined the outhouses, visited the pasture fields, and made a thorough <b>search,</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low,</b> near and far; but no sign of a horse could they find. Of course, the notion that the animal was concealed in the house did not enter their minds, and the only way in which they could account for the total disappearance of the horse was, that Tempe had ridden off with him--where they knew not. We do not know how long they waited for the sight of a hungry horse coming home to his supper, {{but we do know that}} while there was the slightest danger of her dear horse being taken away from her, that animal remained a carefully attended guest in the spare room of the Wick house; and the tradition is, that he staid there three weeks. There Tempe waited on him as if he had been a visitor of high degree; and if she was afraid to go to the barn to bring him hay and oats, she doubtless gave him biscuit and soft bread,--dainties of which a horse is very fond, especially when they are brought to him by such a kind mistress as Tempe.|$|E

To that end, decision makers should not <b>search</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> for it, as too broad a characterization can have the unwanted effect of improperly impairing provincial legislative authority.|$|E

60|$|The {{girl and}} Button-bright and Cap'n Bill were all rather {{discouraged}} by this time, for they had <b>searched</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> had not found {{a trace of}} the all-important umbrella.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{past few}} years have brought record-setting merger and {{acquisition}} activity {{in just about every}} industry across the board. Private equity firms, known for their pioneering efforts in creating exceptional returns, have been the most active investors in this frenzy. Due to increased competition with hedge funds and institutional investors, private equity shops have been pushed to <b>search</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> in order to meet investor expectations. So while creativity with respect to deal structuring and sourcing has become essential for survival in the private equity business, there has also been a natural progression towards more complicated and risky transactions. The retail sector, an industry segment originally seen as risky territory, has increasingly come under the spotlight during this phenomenon. Ripe with a number of struggling public companies—most of which have significant real estate holdings—it is no surprise that private equity has shown a greater interest in this sector...|$|E

We shunned these signs for a time, but finally we {{concluded}} that the wig-makers must of necessity be the barbers as well, since we could find no single legitimate representative of the fraternity. We entered and asked, {{and found that it}} was even so.|$|R
