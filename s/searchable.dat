5|$|Attractions include guided tours, a visitors' centre with <b>searchable</b> convict database, art gallery, café, gift shop, {{and tourist}} accommodation. Educational {{activities}} are regularly held for school children, as are exhibitions and re-enactments of historical events. Functions such as theme parties and dinners {{are held in}} the prison, with re-enactments serving as entertainment. Tours of the prison show aspects of prison life and recount successful and attempted escapes. Sections of the tunnels are accessible, and night tours focus on the prison's reputation for being haunted.|$|E
5|$|Growers {{register}} new daffodil cultivars by {{name and}} colour with the RHS, whose International Daffodil Register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is <b>searchable.</b> The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth; the fifth was published in 2012. More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the number has continued to grow. However, because of synonymy, the actual number is probably closer to 18,000; only about 500 are in commercial production (470 in 2009–2010).|$|E
5|$|Growers {{register}} new daffodil cultivars by {{name and}} color with the Royal Horticultural Society, which is the international registration authority for the genus. Their International Daffodil Register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is <b>searchable.</b> The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth (the fifth was published in 2012). More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the number has continued to grow. Registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code such as 5 W-W ("Thalia"). In horticultural usage {{it is common to}} also find an unofficial Division 14: Miniatures, which although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. Over 140 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (See List of Award of Garden Merit narcissus).|$|E
5|$|The Amanita Genome Project {{was begun}} in Jonathan Walton's lab at Michigan State University in 2004 {{as part of}} their ongoing studies of Amanita bisporigera. The purpose of the project is to {{determine}} the genes and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. The genome of A.bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing, and the genome sequence information is publicly <b>searchable.</b> The sequence data enabled the researchers to identify the genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, AMA1 and PHA1. The cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, and require proline-specific peptidases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family for processing.|$|E

25|$|It was {{revealed}} in October 2017 {{that during the}} 2016 US Presidential election, Cambridge Analytica funder and GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer had proposed creating a <b>searchable</b> data base for Hillary Clinton emails {{in the public domain}} and then forwarded this suggestion to several people, including Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who personally emailed a request to Julian Assange for Clinton's emails. Assange responded to the report by saying he denied Nix's request.|$|E
25|$|The {{organizers}} {{envisioned a}} society which would help interested scholars {{make contact with}} one another to exchange in academic discourse. The group would additionally publish information about research in progress, it was hoped, as well as aid {{in the search for}} obscure sources — no simple task in the days before easily <b>searchable</b> library catalogs via the internet. Further, organizers sought a place to where one might take esoteric questions about little-known aspects of American communism and hope to find an answer.|$|E

On 15 September 2014, he appeared via remote video link on Kim Dotcom's Moment of Truth town hall meeting held in Auckland.|$|E
25|$|Because of the secretive {{nature of}} magic, {{research}} {{can sometimes be}} a challenge. Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association, which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the Conjuring Arts Research Center, which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a <b>searchable</b> database of rare books and periodicals.|$|E
