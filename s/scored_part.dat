40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{approach}} for bird part localization, targeting fine-grained categories with wide variations in appearance due to different poses (including aspect and orientation) and subcategories. As it is chal-lenging to represent such variations across a large set of di-verse samples with tractable parametric models, we turn to individual exemplars. Specifically, we extend the exemplar-based models in [4] by enforcing pose and subcategory consistency at the parts. During training, we build pose-specific detectors <b>scoring</b> <b>part</b> poses across subcategories, and subcategory-specific detectors <b>scoring</b> <b>part</b> appearance across poses. At the testing stage, likely exemplars are matched to the image, suggesting part locations whose pose and subcategory consistency are well-supported by the im-age cues. From these hypotheses, part configuration can be predicted with very high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains from our method on an extensive dataset: CUB- 200 - 2011 [30], for both lo-calization and classification tasks. 1...|$|R
