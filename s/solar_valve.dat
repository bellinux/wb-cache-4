50|$|A <b>solar</b> <b>valve</b> {{system was}} {{installed}} in 1978, that allowed the light to become active or disactived based on the atmospheric conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant. The system {{was invented by}} Gustaf Dalén and marketed by his company AGA. Dalén later invented the AGA cooker in 1922. The Dalén light is notable because of its sun valve (a.k.a. <b>solar</b> <b>valve),</b> which earned its inventor the Nobel prize in physics. The Carbide lamp {{was developed in the}} early 1900s. While the lamps proved useful in many applications, the problem of safely storing acetylene meant they needed regular refilling which constrained their use in applications such as lighthouses.|$|E
40|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} (ANNs) {{have been used}} for modelling the thermal dynamics of a building's space, its water heating system and the influence of solar radiation. A multi-layer feed-forward neural network, using a Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation-training algorithm, has been applied to predict the future internal temperature. Real weather data for a number of winter months, together with a validated building model (based on the building constructions data), were used to train the network in order to generate a mapping between the easily measurable inputs (outdoor temperature, <b>solar</b> irradiance, heating <b>valve</b> position and the building indoor temperature) and the desired output, i. e., the predicted indoor temperature. The objective of this work was to investigate the potential of using an ANN with singular value decomposition method (SVD) to predict the indoor temperature to shut down the heating system controller early for saving the energy consumption for heating inside the building...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of various high temperature thermal energy storage concepts such as thermocline [3], floating barrier [4] or embedded heat exchanger [7] {{that have been developed}} in recent years. In this context, a description of functionality, a summary of the technical specification and the state of development of each concept is given. The latter includes the next steps and open questions, respectively. Additionally, further research topics, such as the stability of material selections are presented. In order to answer many of the open questions, a new molten salt test facility called “Test facility for thermal energy storage in molten salts (TESIS) ” is under construction at DLR. This facility has two separate sub-systems, which can be operated independently from each other. One system is designed to investigate new single tank storage concepts focusing on the thermocline-filler concept. The other system is a flexible test section for molten salt process technology and component tests, such as <b>valves,</b> <b>solar</b> receiver tubes and instrumentation. Both sub-systems can operate at temperatures up to 560 °C, using nitrate salt as the storage and heat transfer media. Experimental results on the compatibility of filler materials and molten salt are presented. In addition, the current construction and development status of the facility will be reported...|$|R
40|$|At present, two-tank {{molten salt}} storage systems are the {{established}} commercially available concept for {{solar thermal power}} plants. Due to their very low vapour pressure and comparatively high thermal stability, molten salts are preferred as the heat transfer fluid and storage medium. Therefore, the development of alternative, more cost-effective concepts {{is an important step}} in making thermal energy storage more competitive for industrial processes and solar thermal applications. The paper gives an overview of various storage concepts such as thermocline, floating barrier or embedded heat exchanger that have been developed in recent years. In this context, a description of functionality, a summary of the technical specification and the state of development of each concept is given.
