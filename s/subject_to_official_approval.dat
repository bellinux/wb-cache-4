40|$|This article explores school {{improvement}} planning {{under conditions of}} high-stakes accountability {{by means of a}} content analysis of {{school improvement}} plans. The schools examined here were identified by their accountability agencies as low performing and were put on probation to reverse their decline. Schools in three accountability systems are compared. Content analyses indicated that school improvement plans across the three jurisdictions were very similar, suggesting institutional isomorphism. However, certain policy design features prompted variation in the levels of internalization of exter-nal demands by school sites. School improvement plans (SIPs) are a widespread feature in high-stakes accountability systems. SIPs are often a mandatory feature for schools put on probation by their accountability agency for persistently low performance. In many accountability systems, accountability agencies treat SIPs as central to a school’s path back to healthy performance. Often, SIPs are extensive docu-ments <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>official</b> review and <b>approval.</b> Whether they are hastily thrown together or carefully crafted, these SIPs are vivid testimony to the way schools (and districts) think about the task of school improvement unde...|$|R

50|$|Clearly {{there were}} some {{exceptions}} <b>to</b> the <b>official</b> <b>approval</b> of Shakespeare, and the great patriotic plays, most notably Henry V were shelved. But interestingly the reception of The Merchant of Venice was at best lukewarm (Marlowe's The Jew of Malta was suggested as a possible alternative) {{because it was too}} ambiguous and not nearly anti-semitic enough for Nazi taste. So Hamlet was by far the most popular play, along with Macbeth and Richard III.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the week}} of 10 August 2015, against the {{background}} of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%. The devaluation was accomplished by pegging the <b>official</b> rate <b>to</b> closing market rates. A market-based [...] "representative" [...] exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is one of the requirements for designation of a currency as one with Special Drawing Rights (SDR) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), one of China's goals. Since the late-2000s, China has sought to internationalize the renminbi. As of 2013, the RMB is the 8th most widely traded currency in the world. In November 2015 in advance of G-20 and IMF meetings, IMF director Christine Lagarde announced her support for adding the yuan to the SDR currency basket. The announcement gave 'green-light' <b>to</b> <b>official</b> <b>approval</b> at the 30 November IMF meeting.|$|R

After the successes of Tom Thumb and Chrononhotonthologos, theaters staged increasingly vicious attacks on the ministry. These satires were progressively more dangerously near an attack on the crown.|$|R

Under pressure from booksellers, a settlement of 1649 prohibited stalls and the display of books on the Pont Neuf.

25|$|The {{majority}} of sugar substitutes approved {{for food use}} are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural sugar substitutes are known, including sorbitol and xylitol, which are found in berries, fruit, vegetables, and mushrooms. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, xylose is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known, but these have yet <b>to</b> gain <b>official</b> <b>approval</b> for food use.|$|R
25|$|In {{his first}} years in Paris, Mesmer {{tried and failed}} to get either the Royal Academy of Sciences or the Royal Society of Medicine <b>to</b> provide <b>official</b> <b>approval</b> for his doctrines. He found only one {{physician}} of high professional and social standing, Charles d'Eslon, to become a disciple. In 1779, with d'Eslon's encouragement, Mesmer wrote an 88-page book, Mémoire sur la découverte du magnétisme animal, to which he appended his famous 27 Propositions. These propositions outlined his theory at that time. Some contemporary scholars equate Mesmer’s animal magnetism with the Qi (chi) of Traditional Chinese Medicine and mesmerism with medical Qigong practices.|$|R

From being a minority religion, largely confined to urban areas and restricted social groupings, and <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>official</b> hostility and occasional persecution; Christianity acquired greatly expanded numbers of potential adherents of all classes, initially still within city areas, but eventually extending out to the pagus, the city's rural hinterland. The consequence was a radical expansion in the buildings, funding and personnel of associated Church establishments throughout the 4th century. The first cathedrals represent this expansion in material form.|$|R
5000|$|Ukrainization heralded an {{unprecedented}} national renaissance in the 1920s. The Ukrainian communists, including prominent ex-Borotbisty, carried forward Ukrainization, a “weapon of cultural revolution in Ukraine”. Ukrainization meant efforts to assert autonomy and counter ascendant Stalinism. Stalinist centralism and its partner Russian nationalism destroyed senses of equality between the republics. The Ukrainian communists and intelligentsia were annihilated. The Borotbist “co-founders of the Ukrainian SSR” were amongst the last remnants of opposition purged {{under the guise}} of the destruction of the fake “Borotbist Center” in 1936. They were still being <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>official</b> attack in 1938.|$|R

Ratnik, the builder of Alexander III and Suvorov, was confident that the new design was inferior to its predecessors. It had no displacement reserve compared to 246 tonnes of Borodino class and the British standard of at least 4% of standard displacement. The NTC overruled his objections and approved the draft for construction.|$|R

During this period, she became acquainted with Ignatian spirituality through contact with several Jesuit priests. In 1607 the foundation gained the approval of Pope Paul V of a religious order dedicated to education, with the restrictions, however, of being organized along the Benedictine model, as an enclosed religious order of nuns, with each monastery to be independent.
