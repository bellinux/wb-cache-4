5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>there</b> are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua {{brought from the}} recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>there</b> were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and the participation of these Mesoamerican allies was decisive.|$|E

5|$|In most of Brassey's {{contracts}} {{he worked}} in partnership with other contractors, in particular with Peto and Betts. The planning {{of the details of}} the projects was done by the engineers. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>there</b> would be a consulting engineer and below him another engineer {{who was in charge of}} the day-to-day activities. During his career Brassey worked with many engineers, the most illustrious being Robert Stephenson, Joseph Locke and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The day-to-day work was overseen by agents, who managed and controlled the activities of the subcontractors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sometimes,</b> <b>there</b> are {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{was divided}} into Mandala or Rashtras (provinces). A Rashtra was ruled by a Rashtrapathi who on {{occasion}} was the emperor himself. Amoghavarsha I's empire had sixteen Rashtras. Under a Rashtra was a Vishaya (district) overseen by a Vishayapathi. Trusted ministers sometimes ruled more than a Rashtra. For example, Bankesha, a commander of Amoghavarsha I headed Banavasi-12000, Belvola-300, Puligere-300, Kunduru-500 and Kundarge-70, the suffix designating the number of villages in that territory. Below the Vishaya was the Nadu looked after by the Nadugowda or Nadugavunda; <b>sometimes</b> <b>there</b> were two such officials, one assuming the position through heredity and another appointed centrally. The lowest division was a Grama or village administered by a Gramapathi or Prabhu Gavunda.|$|E

5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua {{brought from the}} recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>there</b> were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly decisive. In at least one case, encomienda rights were granted to one of the Tlaxcalan leaders who came as allies, and land grants and exemption from being given in encomienda were given to the Mexican allies as rewards for their participation in the conquest. In practice, such privileges were easily removed or sidestepped by the Spanish and the indigenous conquistadors were treated in a similar manner to the conquered natives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sometimes</b> <b>there</b> {{is a third}} lobe present {{called the}} {{pyramidal}} lobe. When present, this lobe often stretches up the hyoid bone from the thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise {{from the left side}} and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as Lalouette's pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland's descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the position of the thyroid in the adult. A small horn {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called Zuckerkandl's tubercle.|$|E
5|$|The costa (C) is {{the leading}} {{marginal}} vein on most insects, although <b>sometimes</b> <b>there</b> is a small vein above the costa called the precosta, although in almost all extant insects, the precosta is fused with the costa; The costa rarely ever branches because {{it is at the}} leading edge, which is associated at its base with the humeral plate. The trachea of the costal vein is perhaps a branch of the subcostal trachea. Located after the costa is the third vein, the subcosta, which branches into two separate veins: the anterior and posterior. The base of the subcosta is associated with the distal end of the neck of the first axillary (see section below). The fourth vein is the radius (R), which is branched into five separate veins. The radius is generally the strongest vein of the wing. Toward the middle of the wing, it forks into a first undivided branch (R1) and a second branch, called the radial sector (Ra), which subdivides dichotomously into four distal branches (R2, R3, R4, R5). Basally, the radius is flexibly united with the anterior end of the second axillary (2Ax).|$|E
