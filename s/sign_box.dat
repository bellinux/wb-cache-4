2500|$|One of {{the unusual}} {{characteristics}} of SignWriting is {{its use of}} two-dimensional layout within an invisible 'sign box'. [...] The relative positions of the symbols within the box iconically represent {{the locations of the}} hands {{and other parts of the}} body involved in the sign being represented. [...] As such, there is no obvious linear relationship between the symbols within each <b>sign</b> <b>box,</b> unlike the sequence of characters within each word in most scripts for spoken languages. [...] This is also unlike other sign language scripts which arrange symbols linearly as in spoken languages. [...] However, since in sign languages many phonetic parameters are articulated simultaneously, these other scripts require arbitrary conventions for specifying the order of different parameters of handshape, location, motion, etc. [...] Although SignWriting does have conventions for how symbols are to be arranged relative to each other within a sign, the two-dimensional layout results in less arbitrariness and more iconicity than other sign language scripts.|$|E
50|$|The R16s, {{like the}} older Arnines, R10s, and R11s, {{featured}} {{three sets of}} mid-carbody passenger windows on each side. One set contained an illuminated rollsign box {{in lieu of a}} second window. This <b>sign</b> <b>box</b> had three readings arranged vertically - the top two being the train's terminals, and the bottom being the route. This window and signbox pattern became standard for later cars until the R40s. The R16 would also be the last car class delivered with cross wise seating until the R44 order in 1972.|$|E
5000|$|Among the {{innovations}} of the [...] "D's" [...] {{were the first}} New York rolling stock to include front destination signs with a route designation. These signs introduced the route numbering to the BMT system. The numbers started to be replaced in 1960 with the current letters on all subsequent equipment to be delivered. They also featured inside the cars a <b>sign</b> <b>box</b> which included large dual destination signs which could be keyed by the train operator to light up in the direction the train was traveling. There were also lighted signs to indicate whether a train was traveling via the Montague Street Tunnel or the Manhattan Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2016, the {{interiors}} {{of the electronic}} <b>sign</b> <b>boxes</b> on many cars were retrofitted with LCD screens, replacing the MTA Arts for Transit cards that are usually located there. These <b>sign</b> <b>boxes</b> differ from the FIND screens in that the new LCD screens are wider and can display advertisements, public safety announcements, and other information, whereas the FIND screens can only display PSAs and the route designation. These screens {{are similar to the}} interior LED screens on the R143s, except that the R160s' screens have the capabilities to display multiple colors instead of only red, orange, and green.|$|R

Shortly after, as talks began {{for a potential}} Duran Duran reunion, Taylor decided to create a retrospective package called Retreat Into Art demonstrating his development over the previous five years. A limited edition of 999 <b>signed</b> <b>boxes</b> contained two CDs, a poster, postcards, and more. After the <b>signed</b> <b>boxes</b> were sold out, the two-CD set was marketed on its own.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for generating VRML animation sequences from Sign Language notation, based on MPEG- 4 Body Animation. Sign Language notation, in the well-known SignWriting system, is provided as input and is initially converted to SWML (SignWriting Markup Language), an XML-based format which has recently been developed for the storage, indexing and processing of SignWriting notation. Each <b>sign</b> <b>box</b> (basic sign) is then converted to a sequence of Body Animation Parameters (BAPs) of the MPEG- 4 standard, corresponding to the represented gesture. These sequences, which can also be coded and/or reproduced by MPEG- 4 BAP players, are then used to animate H-anim compliant VRML avatars, reproducing the exact gestures represented in sign language notation. Envisaged applications include producing signing avatars for interactive information systems (Web, E-mail, info– kiosks) and TV newscasts for persons with hearing disabilities. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new Web tool for converting text to Sign Language notation and corresponding VRML animation sequences for H-anim compliant avatars. The tool {{can be used}} both as a sign language dictionary {{as well as a}} text to sign language translator. It is based on a Sign Language dictionary written in the well-known Sign-Writing system. More specifically, the entries of the dictionary are in SWML (SignWriting Markup Language), an XML-based format, which has recently been developed for the storage, indexing and processing of SignWriting notation. For sign synthesis, each <b>sign</b> <b>box</b> (basic sign) is first converted to a sequence of Body Animation Parameters (BAPs) of the MPEG- 4 standard corresponding to the represented gesture. These sequences, which can also be coded and/or reproduced by MPEG- 4 BAP players, are then used to animate H-anim compliant VRML avatars, reproducing the exact gestures represented in sign language notation.

50|$|The first numbers {{used were}} {{implemented}} with Hunter <b>sign</b> <b>boxes,</b> approximately from 1911 to 1917. Numbers were three digits, {{with the first}} referring to the division. In 1918, the network was substantially reorganized, and numbers were no longer used. However, from then until 1967, a similar four-digit system was used internally.|$|R

50|$|Outside of each sign, {{however, the}} script is linear, {{reflecting}} the temporal order of signs. Signs are most commonly now written in vertical columns (although formerly {{they were written}} horizontally). <b>Sign</b> <b>boxes</b> are arranged {{from top to bottom}} within the column, interspersed with punctuation symbols, and the columns progress left to right across the page. Within a column, signs may be written down the center or shifted left or right in 'lanes' to indicate side-to-side shifts of the body.|$|R
