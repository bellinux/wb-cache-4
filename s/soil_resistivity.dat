In the past, {{most of the}} conventional geotechnical site investigation required bulky and heavy equipment to determine the geotechnical parameters necessary for design and construction purposes. Consequentially, time and cost of the project is increased especially when dealing with some difficult site such as on mountainous terrain. This study is based on laboratory <b>soil</b> box <b>resistivity</b> meter observations made on soils mixed with additions of consistent increments of 1 - 5 % of water to 1500 gram of remolded soils in loose condition. At least 24 repetitive resistivity test observations were made and the moisture content and soil density was determined concurrently {{for each of the}} tests. The observations showed that the electrical resistivity variation decreased in a curvilinear manner with increasing percentage of moisture content. A regression equation and coefficient of determination, R 2 for moisture content against <b>soil</b> electrical <b>resistivity</b> value was established by moisture content, w = 152. 87 ρ- 0. 312 (ρ = <b>soil</b> electrical <b>resistivity)</b> and R 2 = 0. 7718 respectively.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of soil electrical and thermal resistivities {{is essential for}} several engineering projects such as laying of high voltage buried power cables, nuclear waste disposal, design of fluidized thermal beds, ground modification techniques etc. This necessitates precise determination of these resistivities, and relationship between them, which mainly depend on the soil type, its origin, compaction density and saturation. Such a relationship would also be helpful for determining one of these resistivities, if {{the other one is}} known. With this in view, efforts were made to develop artificial neural network (ANN) models that can be employed for estimating the <b>soil</b> electrical <b>resistivity</b> based on its <b>soil</b> thermal <b>resistivity</b> and the degree of saturation. To achieve this, measurements of electrical and thermal resistivities were carried out on different types soils compacted at different densities and moisture contents.

40|$|Levee {{foundation}} soils in New Orleans, USA, {{are composed}} of unconsolidated Holocene deltaic sediments. Traditionally, geotechnical tests at point locations can identify the more unstable zones, but cannot predict accurately the laterally heterogeneous facies of the Mississippi delta. Together, electrical resistivity and seismic shear wave studies can aid {{in the interpretation of}} different soil types between geotechnical sites. In such highly conductive, coastal <b>soils,</b> <b>resistivity</b> measurements are limited to shallow depths, but remain useful for describing variations in saturation and the presence of clays. Similar studies conducted in Japanese fluvial and Australian calcrete environments do not consider the influence of brackish water in coastal settings. The London Avenue Canal levee flank of New Orleans, which failed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, 2005, presents a suitable site in which to pioneer these geophysical relationships in a coastal setting. Shear wave velocity and resistivity are related to soil properties through Hertz-Mindlin Theory and Archie’s Law. Preliminary cross-plots show electrically resistive, high-shear-wave velocity areas interpreted as low-permeability, resistive silt. In brackish coastal environments, low-resistivity and low-shear-wave-velocity areas may indicate both saturated, unconsolidated sands and low-rigidity clays. Published polynomial approximations to similar cross-plots must be modified for use in the near-surface sediments of the Mississippi River Delta.

The minimum test of in-situ <b>soil</b> <b>resistivity</b> is measured using the wenner 4 pin method if often performed to judge a site's corrosivity, but if the test is performed during a dry period, the soil's actual corrosivity may not be properly reported since underground condensation can occur on buried metals leaving the soil touching the metal surfaces in a more moist status.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present a {{strategy}} to interpret the hydraulic functioning of a small field area by using measurements of the <b>soil</b> electrical <b>resistivity.</b> The spatial <b>soil</b> electrical <b>resistivity</b> was recorded at a high resolution on a 2 ha area by the MultiContinous Electrical Profiling (MuCEP) device at two dates. These apparent electrical resistivity measurements were firstly interpreted in terms of local electrical resistivity by I D inverse modelling to estimate the real <b>resistivity</b> of the <b>soil.</b> These interpreted electrical resistivity data were then transformed into soil water content values and soil water potential values by the use of independent punctual data of water content and the use of the water retention curve determined by laboratory data. Our analysis has permitted us to describe the spatial variability and temporal evolution of the hydraulic functioning at high resolution from electrical resistivity data. The interpretation of the water content and matric potential maps demonstrated that some soil hydraulic processes, such as lateral overland flow, can occur in the studied zone. They would never have been detected by local measurements of soil characteristics or by the use of the soil map. To cite this article: L Cousin et al., C R. Geoscience 341 (2009).
