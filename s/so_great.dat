5|$|As {{a symbol}} of {{national}} pride, an example from the BA fleet made occasional flypasts at selected Royal events, major air shows and other special occasions, sometimes in formation with the Red Arrows.

5|$|Because the 1995 Sugar Bowl was Virginia Tech's {{first major}} bowl game in school history, tickets and travel {{packages}} {{were in high}} demand. Prior to {{the first day of}} ticket sales, the price of travel packages skyrocketed due to demand. In Virginia, travel agencies hired temporary workers to meet demand, and in New Orleans, the demand for hotel rooms was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that many hotels instituted a three-night minimum stay.|$|E

5|$|Honey {{bees are}} not {{native to the}} Americas, {{therefore}} their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in monoculture situations—where the pollination need is <b>so</b> <b>great</b> at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).|$|E

5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole {{to rise to}} the pinnacle of government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E
5|$|On the tour's {{opening night}} at the Odeon in Cheltenham, the volume of sound created by the {{screaming}} crowds was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that The Beatles' amplification equipment proved unequal to it, {{so much so that}} the band members were unable to hear any sounds they were making themselves, whether speaking, singing, or playing their instruments. As a result, they were unable to count songs in or perform in unison.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> {{a person}} by reason {{both of his}} {{excessive}} haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself {{seemed to be the}} emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.|$|E

50|$|Malet {{was the son}} of William Malet, and {{inherited}} his father's great honour of Eye in 1071. This {{made him}} one of the dozen or <b>so</b> <b>greatest</b> landholders in England.

He also inherited the family property in Normandy.|$|R

5|$|Traditionally Padarn {{was said}} to come {{originally}} from Brittany, but he {{may have come from}} south-east Wales.

5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air {{near the center of}} the area into greater density – and <b>so</b> <b>greater</b> weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|R
50|$|The Edwards-Nunnally {{method of}} calculating {{clinical}} significance {{is a more}} stringent alternative to the Jacobson-Truax method. Reliability scores are used to bring the pre-test scores closer to the mean, and then a confidence interval is developed for this adjusted pre-test score. Confidence intervals are used when calculating the change from pre-test to post-test, <b>so</b> <b>greater</b> actual change in scores is necessary to show clinical significance, compared to the Jacobson-Truax method.|$|R
5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days before the game, tickets were still readily available. In terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending money at New Orleans businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud {{is only a small}} part of the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, {{and the office}} received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed {{large amounts of money}} to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E

5|$|George's {{distrust}} of the Tories aided the passing of power to the Whigs. Whig dominance would grow to be <b>so</b> <b>great</b> under George that the Tories would not return to power for another half-century. After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the Septennial Act 1715, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in power could remain in such a position for a greater period of time.|$|E
5|$|In dry tall grasslands in monsoonal areas, {{the change}} in {{vegetation}} may be <b>so</b> <b>great</b> due to either fires or wet season growth that birds may be more nomadic and change territories more than other fairywrens. They form more stable territories elsewhere, such as in coastal areas. Cooperative breeding is less common with this species than with other fairywrens; helper birds have been sporadically reported, but the red-backed fairywren has been little studied.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{prior to the}} {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the Fairbanks economy was unsteady. The News-Miner planned to expand its printing plant, but many in the company were unsure if the economy could support the added capacity. Over the objections of the News-Miner newsroom, Snedden decided to expand the Aurora Building by adding a second floor at a cost of $2 million. In 1974, as construction of the pipeline got under way, demand for office space in Fairbanks was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that Alyeska Pipeline Company rented several News-Miner offices in the newly expanded building. About this time, the News-Miner replaced its Associated Press teletypes with a satellite connection.|$|E
