5|$|HTC One {{variants}} were unveiled {{for release}} in China in late-April 2013 with HTC TD101 802w for China Unicom, HTC TD101 802d for China Telecom, and HTC TD101 802t for China Mobile. Unlike the international version, the Chinese models feature a removable back cover, exposing a microSD slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Complementing this feature, {{a special edition}} with a Wang Leehom-autographed back cover was also released. HTC stated that {{it was able to}} include an <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> <b>slot</b> in the Chinese model because its radio hardware did not take up as much internal space as that of the international models.|$|E

40|$|Using Charles and Ray Eames's famous 1950 <b>s</b> House of <b>Cards</b> <b>slotting</b> toy as both design {{metaphor and}} {{structural}} precedent provides {{the starting point}} for a novel building logic (utilising three existing Swedish timber systems) that allows volumetrically slotted units to stack inside of and support each other. Contemporary computer-aided fabrication techniques based on evolutionary algorithms and CNC manufacturing strategies are used to produce a methodology for designing a kit-of-parts system at the scale of the skyscraper, based on the slotting together of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels. A catalogue of novel slotting methods is produced, and a number of alternative slotted joint treatments identified that hold promising potential for further development, parametrically design and control volumes, understand the fabrication workflow and constructional sequence on site, and build prototypes of the chosen slotting configurations at scales ranging between 1 : 50 and 1 : 1.

500|$|Despite being {{hailed by}} Slashgear as [...] "one {{of the best}} {{entry-level}} notebooks Apple have produced," [...] the unibody MacBook has received criticism for its lack of a FireWire port and <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> <b>slot.</b> Nilay Patel of Engadget added that the USB ports were easily dented and {{the bottom of the}} laptop became worn and discolored after a few days.

500|$|At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was {{announced}} that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro, leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line. It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery first introduced in the 17-inch MacBook Pro. The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity. Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use, while others reported around six hours. Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80percent of their capacity. Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, although the 13-inch and the base model 15-inch, came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU. The screens were also improved, gaining a claimed 60percent greater color gamut.
