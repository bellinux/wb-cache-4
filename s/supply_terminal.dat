40|$|AbstractA {{thermal flow}} sensor with smart {{electronic}} interface is presented. The sensor {{is based on}} four germanium thermistors embedded in a thin membrane. The thermistors form a Wheatstone bridge supplied with a constant current. Both bridge output voltage and voltage at the bridge <b>supply</b> <b>terminals</b> are functions of the flow offering high initial sensitivity and wide measurement range, respectively. The signal interface {{is based on a}} relaxation oscillator. The circuit provides a rectangular-wave output whose frequency is related to the bridge unbalance, whereas the duty cycle {{is a function of the}} voltage at the bridge <b>supply</b> <b>terminals.</b> Hence, both sensor signals are simultaneously and independently carried on the same output signal, featuring non-monotonic characteristic over a wide flow range accompanied with a very high sensitivity at low flow velocities.

The first supply voltage (UL) is offered between a first <b>supply</b> <b>terminal</b> (VSS) and a second <b>supply</b> <b>terminal</b> (VDDL). The second supply voltage (UH) is offered between the first <b>supply</b> <b>terminal</b> (VSS) and a third <b>supply</b> <b>terminal</b> (VDDH).; The {{digital to analog converter}} (DAC) comprises conversion resistors (RCNV 0 - RCNVn) and coupling means (CPL) for coupling a number of said conversion resistors (RCNV 2 - RCNVn) in between the first <b>supply</b> <b>terminal</b> (VSS) and an output terminal (OUT), and for coupling the remainder of said conversion resistors (RCNV 0 - RCNV 1) in between the third <b>supply</b> <b>terminal</b> (VDDH) and the output terminal (OUT).

Often circuits implemented in new IC processes {{have to be able to}} interface with ICs processed in less modern processes which are generally operated on higher supply voltages.; In the modern process, therefore, circuits designed in modern ICs have to cope with voltages which are above the maximum specification for their transistors or other components. The DA-converter (DAC) mentioned above fulfils this requirement by the fact that material, such as polycrystalline silicon, is used for the conversion resistors (RCNV 2 - RCNVn), which material can cope with relatively high voltages, and furthermore by the fact that only the coupling means (CPL) have to be designed to cope with relatively high voltage...|$|E

40|$|Transmitters {{for high}} peak-to-average power ratio {{communication}} are increasingly using supply modulation to improve efficiency. In {{addition to a}} dc component, the dynamic supply may contain ac components up to 500 MHz. The signal envelope dynamic impedance of the <b>supply</b> <b>terminal</b> of a power amplifier (PA) is often unknown and available nonlinear transistor models are unable to predict dynamic low frequency effects required for design of wideband efficient supply modulators. This thesis investigates envelope frequency effects on nonlinear behavior of microwave transistors and PAs under supply-modulated conditions. A measurement setup is created to characterize multi-frequency large-signal excitation of GaN transistors and PAs at carrier frequencies in the 10 GHz range with 1 - 500 MHz low frequency excitation on the drain terminal. A novel method for multi-frequency analysis of nonlinear circuit components based on describing functions is developed.
