25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{remembers how}} {{he got a job}} at the local {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and left to do some work in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle for a quiet life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would never have happened if he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{composed}} the gospel-influenced ballad [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] with James Wright. The lyrics {{are in the}} form of a prayer that conveys a message of unconditional love for God. The song features a verbal recording of Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, who reads two verses from the Bible. The singer wrote the album's fifth cut [...] "Say Somethin, which features rap verses from Snoop Dogg and was produced by The Neptunes. Vibe writer Dimitri Ehrlich described it as [...] "a musical oddity", and characterized the production as [...] "strange instrumentation, weird melodic shifts, hectic drum patterns and a bed of synths." [...] Lyrically, the protagonist makes sexual advances to a romantic interest with the line [...] "If it's worth your while, do something good to me." [...] When interpreting the lyrics in the female role, Cummings noted [...] "a shy woman who doesn't need to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to get a man's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), Jozen Cummings from PopMatters {{described}} the song's production and instrumentation: [...] "The track is vintage Neptunes with big drums and intergalactic sound effects, and Carey {{adds to the}} breezy, easygoing feel of the song with a voice that is sexy, but subtle, like a shy woman who doesn’t need to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to get a man’s attention." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] recalls an encounter in which a male expresses interest in having a sexual affair in a bathroom with a female, while she agrees and responds [...] "If its worth you're while / Say somethin' good to me". In an interview with Newsweek, Carey described how she felt regarding the song: [...] "You're right. It is a totally different approach for me musically. When I heard it at first I {{thought it was a}} cool and interesting track, but I didn't know if it was very me." [...] Additionally, Carey outed the lines [...] "Something like volcanic / You and me seems organic / Just like stars and planets" [...] as [...] "nonesense", but claimed she [...] "loved it".|$|E
50|$|Through his {{university}} friendships, Sydney-Turner {{became a member}} of the Bloomsbury Group where his intellectual erudition could be intimidating. However, he sometimes would spend many hours at their discussion meetings without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> In 1917 he joined in a scheme to purchase The Mill House, Tidmarsh, the place lived in by Lytton Strachey, Dora Carrington and Ralph Partridge and which he occasionally visited.|$|R

To interpret this as <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> about our relationship with the U.S. is nonsense." ...|$|R
2500|$|Generally men aged 50 years, and on some islands men aged 60 years, {{do most of}} {{the talking}} and {{decision}} making at meetings of the community councils (Falekaupule), which are organised according to the law and custom of each island. Although women have the vote in meetings of the Falekaupule on [...] 7 of the 9 islands, but most do no exercise their voting rights. Milikini Failautusi, young Tuvaluan activist, has argued that cultural issues in Tuvalu are preventing women from working in equal partnership with men. For example, women cannot be appointed as an aliki (chief). Ms Failautusi is quoted as saying [...] "hen it comes to cultures, women they don't [...] to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> They don't have a say.

50|$|The {{great thing}} about this band is that each member was coming from a {{different}} place musically, where we started introducing one another to different bands and artists, and I think this is reflected {{in what is now}} our signature sound. Before long we were being asked by local press and just people in general how we'd describe our music, which at the time was a vague mixture of folk, country and Americana. None of these seemed to accurately define us though, so 'Cymrucana' was originally a tongue-in-cheek comment that became our standard response to the question, and a way of defining the band without really <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> The truth is that the 'Cymrucana' scene consists solely of Climbing Trees. We're quite open to other bands and artists joining us though, if they so wish….|$|R

5000|$|Much of {{the crowd}} itself was {{extremely}} emotional, with victims' family members and colleagues holding up portraits of the dead. Three speakers were booed: actress Susan Sarandon (for plugging New York mayoralty candidate Mark Green), actor Richard Gere (for speaking about non-violent tolerance), and New York Senator Hillary Clinton before <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Hillary Clinton did not overtly acknowledge the reaction, and spoke over the noise {{of the crowd}} by raising her voice.

40|$|The {{increasingly}} ubiquitous {{notion of}} ‘patient centredness’ often causes confusion; indeed instruction received {{on this subject}} often left trainees with only the vaguest notion of {{how it could be}} put into practice, sometimes leading to bizarre interpretations of this idea. For example, one colleague described how he, in an attempt at ‘real’ patient centredness, had attempted a whole surgery without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> for as long as possible, presumably just nodding and gesticulating to compensate. Although we readily agree that non-verbal expression accounts for a considerable content of communication, this is perhaps taking things just too far. Patient centredness remains a central plank of clinical learning, teaching and assessment and nowadays is also central of policy development in the health service. But what do we mean by patient centredness? Is it really important? How important is it compared to other aspects of the consultation? Does it make a difference...|$|R

5000|$|As a corollary, {{in these}} {{conditions}} workers will increasingly treat the paid work they do as something distinct or separate from their personality, {{a means to an}} end rather than an end in itself. Work becomes [...] "just work", it no longer necessarily <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> about the identity, creativity or personality of the worker. With the development of an average skill level in the workforce, the same job can also be done by many different workers, and most workers can do many different jobs; nobody is necessarily tied to one type of work all his life anymore. Thus we can talk of [...] "a job" [...] as an abstract function that could be filled by anybody with the required skills. Managers can calculate that with a certain budget, a certain number of paid working hours are required or available to do the work, and then divide up the hours into different job functions to be filled by suitably qualified personnel.|$|R

6000|$|There {{had been}} a promise given by Nora, when she left London, {{that she would not}} {{correspond}} with Hugh Stanbury while she was in Italy, and this promise had been kept. It may be remembered that Hugh had made a proposition to his lady-love, that she should walk out of the house one fine morning, and get herself married without any reference to her father's or her mother's wishes. But she had not been willing to take upon herself as yet independence so complete as this would have required. She had assured her lover that she did mean to marry him some day, even though it should be in opposition to her father, but that she thought that the period for filial persuasion was not yet over; and then, in explaining all this to her mother, she had given a promise neither to write nor to receive letters during the short period of her sojourn in Italy. She would be an obedient child for so long;--but, after that, she must claim the right to fight her own battle. She had told her lover that he must not write; and, of course, she had not written a word herself. But now, when her mother threw it in her teeth that Stanbury would not be ready to marry her, she thought that an unfair advantage was being taken of her,--and of him.

6000|$|All infants {{appear to}} have an impertinent and disagreeable fashion {{nowadays}} of saying [...] "smart" [...] things on most occasions that offer, and especially on occasions when they {{ought not to be}} <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Judging by the average published specimens of smart sayings, the rising generation of children are little better than idiots. And the parents must surely be but little better than the children, for in most cases they are the publishers of the sunbursts of infantile imbecility which dazzle us from the pages of our periodicals. I may seem to speak with some heat, not to say a suspicion of personal spite; and I do admit that it nettles me to hear about so many gifted infants in these days, and remember that I seldom said anything smart when I was a child. I tried it once or twice, but it was not popular. The family were not expecting brilliant remarks from me, and so they snubbed me sometimes and spanked me the rest. But it makes my flesh creep and my blood run cold to think what might have happened to me if I had dared to utter some of the smart things of this generation's [...] "four-year-olds" [...] where my father could hear me. To have simply skinned me alive and considered his duty at an end would have seemed to him criminal leniency toward one so sinning. He was a stern, unsmiling man, and hated all forms of precocity. If I had said some of the things I have referred to, and said them in his hearing, he would have destroyed me. He would, indeed. He would, provided the opportunity remained with him. But it would not, for I would have had judgment enough to take some strychnine first and say my smart thing afterward. The fair record of my life has been tarnished by just one pun. My father overheard that, and he hunted me over four or five townships seeking to take my life. If I had been full-grown, of course he would have been right; but, child as I was, I could not know how wicked a thing I had done.|$|R
