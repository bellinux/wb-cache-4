40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} the use of <b>structured</b> <b>methods</b> on the quality of education for students in primary public school in Brazil. <b>Structured</b> <b>methods</b> encompass a range of pedagogical and managerial instruments applied in the educational system. In recent years, several municipalities in the state of Sao Paulo have contracted out private educational providers to implement these <b>structured</b> <b>methods</b> in their schooling systems. Their pedagogical proposal involves structuring of curriculum content, development of teacher and student textbooks, and the training and supervision of teachers anti instructors. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that the 4 th- and 8 th-grade students in the municipalities with <b>structured</b> <b>methods</b> performed better in Portuguese and mathematics than did students in municipalities not exposed to these methods. We find no differences in passing rates. A robustness test supports the assumption that there is no unobserved municipal characteristics associated with proficiency changes over time that may affect the results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Evaluation is a {{vital part}} of any {{educational}} activity. A valid evaluation method can reflect the truly important outcomes of educational instruction. In visual arts and communication, the roles and function of evaluation are unclear. There is a lack of sufficient consideration concerning the appropriate method to evaluate student work. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the judgments of student and professional evaluators when evaluating graphic design projects by using structured and non-structured evaluation methods. A comparison was also made between the judgments of student and professional evaluators employing the same method;Two instruments were developed and validated by a knowledgeable panel of experts, and then pilot-tested prior to being utilized. The instruments were then used to evaluate 10 posters emphasizing typographic design. A simple evaluation form was used for the non-structured method whereas an evaluation matrix was used for the structured method;The population of the study was comprised of evaluators in central Iowa including college teachers, graphic designers, graduate students, and college students. The evaluation instruments were used by 32 student evaluators and 20 professional evaluators to examine 10 posters. A total of 520 (100 %) usable evaluation results were returned;The major findings of the study were: (a) significant differences were found between <b>structured</b> and non-structured <b>methods,</b> the rating scores of the <b>structured</b> <b>method</b> were lower than using the non-structured method, and standard deviations of the <b>structured</b> <b>method</b> were larger than the non-structured method; (b) significant differences were found between student and professional evaluators using the <b>structured</b> <b>method</b> while no significant differences were found using the non-structured method, and professional evaluators gave higher scores than did student evaluators using structured and non-structured methods; (c) no significant differences were found between <b>structured</b> and non-structured <b>methods</b> by professional evaluators, although, significant differences were found by student evaluators; (d) the relationship between subscores and total score was found to be highly correlated when both student and professional evaluators used the structured method;Recommendations for teachers and students were: (a) the <b>structured</b> <b>method</b> is strongly suggested for use when evaluating graphic design projects; (b) the <b>structured</b> <b>method</b> helps inexperienced teachers to establish confidence and gain experience in instruction; and (c) the <b>structured</b> <b>method</b> helps students to achieve the requirements and to enhance the judgment of the quality of design work. Recommendations for further study were: (a) research should be conducted to explore the <b>structured</b> <b>method</b> in detail (e. g., ranking and weight); (b) an investigation should be conducted to ascertain whether the whole of a work is greater than the sum of its parts; and (c) an investigation should be established to gather different perceptions of judgment between professional and student evaluators...|$|R
