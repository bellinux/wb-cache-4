5|$|To be clear, {{not one of}} us heard Justin use any slur or <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{justified}} Mychal Bell attacking Justin nor did any of us see Justin {{do anything}} that would cause Mychal to react.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Warner Brothers shifted Eisley {{from the}} Reprise to the Sire label. Throughout {{most of the}} summer of 2009, the band worked on their follow up album. They {{finished}} recording most of the album in August of that year, but complications with WB delayed the release. However, the band went on tour with Dupree-Bemis' husband's band <b>Say</b> <b>Anything</b> <b>that</b> fall and released the Fire Kite E.P. as a teaser for the upcoming album.|$|E
500|$|Florence Seymour was {{the first}} person called to the witness box. She said that her {{statement}} was false, and that she had only made it because Edgar Power had told her that she would be charged with murder if she did not. This immediately disrupted the case for the prosecution; Frederick Low had made it clear in his opening statement that their case rested primarily on Seymour's testimony. Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would incriminate Williams. [...] Hastings did not cross-examine her, only asking if what she had said in court was true; she said that it was and then burst into tears.|$|E
60|$|NICOLA. I am sure Miss Raina is {{incapable}} of <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> is not true, sir.|$|R
60|$|She felt, as I felt, the {{imperative}} necessity of <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might soothe him. At a sign from me {{she gave him}} her promise to return.|$|R
60|$|Roswell {{could have}} knocked his {{companion}} down, for he perfectly understood {{the character of}} the allusion; but he had sufficient self-command to forbear <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might betray how much he felt.|$|R
500|$|After Khia {{was given}} a diminished role in the music video, {{she went to her}} MySpace account to say she was not pleased with her scenes being {{displayed}} in a TV during the music video, and criticized Jackson. Despite that, Khia said years later that the situation was calmed down, and wrote a song with Jackson in mind. However, she did not regret the feedback she gave the singer, stating, [...] "I don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I don't mean. I meant every word that I said. People mix the truth with hate, but no I didn't appreciate her putting me on the television. A lot of people blew that out of proportion like, 'Oh my god, Khia's hating on Janet,' but she called me and we were okay. It's just me voicing the situation to my fans".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then," [...] said Amyas, [...] "do you recollect, Ayacanora--do you recollect--what shall I <b>say?</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{happened}} {{when you were a}} little girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|PRESS. Oh! you {{can trust}} me--I shan't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you'll regret. Now, do you {{consider}} that a religious revival would help to quiet the country? ...|$|E
6000|$|To this, on her side, {{she gave}} no heed. Making out his light {{was a little}} a light for herself. [...] "Don't say, don't try to <b>say,</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that's</b> impossible. There are much better things you can do." ...|$|R
25|$|Don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> online <b>that</b> you wouldn't say in person.|$|R
5000|$|On the Carpathia, Lightoller is told by Rostron {{that only}} 705 have survived, {{and the ship}} has only passed one body. The {{wireless}} operator comes on deck to inform Rostron that the Californian has just heard about Titanics sinking and wants to help. Rostron <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> was humanly possible has been done.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, no, for I don't {{think you}} have the face to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would {{distress}} her, or disturb the friendship which has been her greatest benefit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{wait till}} you're placed as he is, and you'll find that you'll <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> comes uppermost. But {{what are we}} to do with him, George?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes, I dare say! We {{all know}} that. He means {{to give you}} some present worth having, I hope. Did he <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> looked like it?' ...|$|E
60|$|Dick, perceiving by {{her look}} {{that she would}} adhere to her statement, charitably forbore <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could make her prevaricate. The sight of Shiner, too, had {{recalled}} another branch of the subject to his mind; that which had been his greatest trouble till her company and words had obscured its probability.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no; {{nothing like}} <b>that.</b> She never <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you can remember; nothing in flashes or ripples; nothing the least literary. But it's {{a sort of}} droll {{way of looking at}} things; or a droll medium through which things present themselves. I don't know. She tells what she's seen, and mimics a little." ...|$|R
25|$|State law {{specifies}} (by not <b>saying</b> <b>anything)</b> <b>that</b> minors between 13 and 15 {{years old}} may, in general, {{engage in a}} consensual sexual relationship with someone up to four years older. Therefore, for example, it is legal for a 14-year-old male or female to engage in consensual sex with a person up to 18 years of age.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will {{you give}} me your word of honour that if I'm killed you won't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> will lead anyone to suspect how I came by my death.' ...|$|E
6000|$|FROME. What I {{want to ask}} you, Mr. Cokeson, is this. In {{the course}} of her appeal to see Falder, did the woman <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you {{specially}} remember? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{say to you}} {{but what}} she does, Twentyman. As far as I know her she isn't a girl that would ever <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> she didn't mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You don't understand,' said Agravaine. 'I don't want to {{seem to be}} <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{might be}} {{interpreted}} as in the least derogatory to your father in any way whatever, but without prejudice, surely he is just a plain, ordinary brigand? I mean it's only a question of a ransom? And I don't in the least object--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just that;--something {{peculiar}} to American ladies. They don't like--well; I don't want to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>that</b> {{can be called}} fierce." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about <b>that.</b> As {{you wish}} it, of course I'll speak to Gresham. Monk, I believe, has {{resigned}} already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I retract the word. I {{would not}} for the world <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> should annoy you;--but pray, pray do not go on with it." [...] Then again he left her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not {{wishing to}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might sound offensive," [...] she {{observed}} slowly, [...] "but if it's a case of trouble of any sort with the police, Mr. Craig--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t {{want any}} of your nonsense," [...] said Mr. Jenkins. [...] "I’m not on duty now, but I warn you not to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> may be used against you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think {{everybody}} {{has reason to}} praise him {{that has to do}} with him. And I'll tell you why I think it is. Whenever he thinks <b>anything</b> he <b>says</b> it;--or, at least, he never <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> he doesn't think. If he spent a thousand pounds, everybody would know that he'd got it to spend; but other people are not like that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may depend}} upon my not <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> will be disagreeable to you, Mr. Halleck," [...] said Bartley, {{touched by the}} old man's trusting friendliness. When his inquisition ended, he slipped his {{notebook}} back into his pocket, and said with a smile, [...] "We usually {{say something about the}} victim's private residence, but I guess I'll spare you that, Mr. Halleck." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to <b>that,</b> either; {{there were very}} few {{openings}} for me, it appeared, in the conversation, which remained one-sided as before.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} forget {{what you have}} done," [...] Fred answered. [...] "I can't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> seems worth saying--only I will try that your {{goodness}} shall not be thrown away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not silly, Mabel; no, not in {{the least}} silly. The Sergeant's {{daughter}} would do discredit to her worthy father, were she to do or <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could be called silly." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, {{there are}} moments, certainly. But was it {{something}} very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did? Did he become angry with you, and <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> was unkind or true? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not till I took Najdolene. Then I {{told her}} it was my heart. There's no need to <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> now <b>that</b> I'm {{practically}} over it, is there?' ...|$|R
50|$|Milla is {{introduced}} when she accidentally walks {{in front of}} an oncoming truck and is rescued by Daredevil. After getting her to help, Daredevil realizes she is blind. Milla later visits Matt Murdock (whose secret identity as Daredevil has been publicized) to thank him and asks him out on a date. While Matt is hesitant on <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would implicate him, he agrees to go out with her.|$|R
6000|$|... “‘It isn’t that,’ says Daniel, {{putting his}} hand {{very hard on}} my shoulder; ‘and I don’t wish to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that’s</b> against you, for no other living man would have {{followed}} me and made me what I am as you have done. You’re a first-class Commander-in-Chief, and the people know you; but—it’s a big country, and somehow you can’t help me, Peachey, in the way I want to be helped.’ ...|$|R
