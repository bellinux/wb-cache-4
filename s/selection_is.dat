5|$|Finally, {{selection}} can {{be classified}} according to the resource being competed for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. Ecological <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> natural selection via any means other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> considered a separate mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Background <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> the {{opposite}} of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E

5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> strong enough to allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E

40|$|A two-locus, two-allele metric trait was {{submitted}} to artificial truncation selection and to {{three types of}} opposing natural selection (two-locus extensions of directional selection, overdominance and underdominance) by numerical simulation in a large random-mating population. Limits to <b>selection</b> <b>were</b> generally reached by generation 100. Intermediate <b>selection</b> plateaus <b>were</b> found, with minor genes, for all three modes of opposing natural <b>selection,</b> but they <b>were</b> least frequent with underdominance. Multiple outcomes were common. In particular, fixation of the genotype favored by artificial <b>selection</b> <b>was</b> often associated with fixation of another genotype and/or with a central equilibrium; the end point actually reached depended on the genetic starting point of the simulation. In general, when the alleles favored by truncation <b>selection</b> <b>were</b> combined (positive linkage disequilibrium) in the base population, or when the trait was determined by major genes, artificial selection would prevail. Limitations inherent {{to this type of}} work are discussed, and possible avenues for further work on the antagonism between artificial and natural <b>selection</b> <b>are</b> proposed...|$|R

5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does not imply that natural <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{may have}} played a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> not a valid explanation.|$|E

5|$|A {{special case}} of natural <b>{{selection}}</b> <b>is</b> sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success {{by increasing the}} attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E
5|$|Artificial <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> the {{intentional}} selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
