50|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s changed the focus of military space capabilities from strategic to operational and tactical applications and began an unprecedented growth in demand for military space capabilities. Operation Desert Storm demonstrated the far reaching applications and benefits of space capabilities in joint military operations. At the same time, defense budget reductions, industry consolidation, government and industry workforce reductions, and projected growth in commercial <b>space</b> <b>investment</b> led the national security space community to institute a series of acquisition reforms. Ultimately, these reforms proved to be flawed, and the community experienced a series of launch failures, serious program delays, and cost overruns in the late 1990s. All these factors led to a “perfect storm” within the space enterprise and {{a call to action}} to fix systemic problems.|$|E

Real estate involvements include {{citizenship}} responsibility, {{personal and}} business <b>space</b> use, <b>investment,</b> {{and for those}} whose work involvement is directly or indirectly dependent upon real estate markets, employment. Real estate strategies guide participants’ decisionmaking in their multiple roles, and both highlight the issues and concerns common to these multiple roles as well as isolate those unique to particular roles. Although {{certain aspects of the}} decision processes for different participants in their multiple roles reflect the actions, circumstances and objectives unique to that participant, a meaningful part of everyone’s real estate decisionmaking process is subject to common market forces. Strategic decision models provide a means to connect the micro-level tasks of property operations, the negotiation process of real estate transactions, and the larger forces that define space use and place decisions. Each real estate participant employs distinctive strategies, sometimes explicitly articulated but most often implicitly understood, for the multiple roles embracing real estate involvements. These involvements include citizenship responsibility, personal and business <b>space</b> use, <b>investment,</b> and for those whose work involvement is directly o...|$|R

40|$|The {{resolution}} of {{problems related to}} the saturation of traffic intersections usually consists {{in the construction of}} infrastructure such as bridges or tunnels. These represent the most costly type of solutions. As such, it becomes necessary to ponder other types of solution, of lower cost. Thus, this paper intends to provide a way to significantly improve the performance of a traffic intersection, by using pre-signals, on its approaches. For this purpose, a traffic micro simulation model was developed, using Simio. The simulation experiments show that the implementation of pre-signals result in an increase of the intersection flow's upper ceiling in over 10 %, a decrease in the average waiting time per vehicle in 1 minute and a decrease of the queues average size. In addition, it was also found that there is always gain in the space occupied by the queues, taking into consideration the <b>space</b> <b>investment</b> needed to implement pre-signals.

40|$|In {{the article}} the system {{processes}} of investment and construction activities (ISA) are {{considered as a}} set of economic space and time. The concept of economic space contains a generalized representation of the properties of technical and economic system in the initial state of its development. The space of investment and construction activities is a techno-economic system, the space, in which the movement is possible within the framework of sustainable development. A characteristic feature of economic space is its unity and indivisibility. The concept of economic space is closely related to the concept of economic time. The transition from one state of techno-economic system to another is described by the input and output variables. The task of ISA is to achieve optimal conditions for the rational use of system resources. The article identifies and discusses ISA subsystems and their interaction in the coordinate system. The <b>space</b> <b>investment</b> and construction activities encompasses a set of core and auxiliary processes, the behavior of techno-economic system, its mode of functioning in the context of sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} various elements {{to appreciate the}} situation of the Udmurt people in contemporary Udmurtia. First, the author focuses on the main measures of linguistic and cultural preservations initiated after the collapse of communism : he analyzes the role and function of the Ministry of national politics, the Comity for language modernization, the actions of national associations and the place of teaching and research in Udmurtia today. Then, the author focuses on the situation in the main city in Udmurtia : Izhevsk. The Udmurt culture being mainly rural, it is paradoxical that Izhevsk should gather the large majority of the institutions and actors promoting the Udmurt language and culture. As a complement, the study deals with the way Udmurt people occupy the city, and the negative and positive effects of this new <b>space</b> <b>investment</b> (folkloriza- tion vs. contemporary Udmurt creation).

40|$|Dynamic {{modes of}} {{political}} economic regulation impact provision for the parks system in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Green spaces during Milwaukee’s first liberal era consisted mostly of private properties accessible {{only to the}} city’s elite and/or to those {{willing to pay a}} fee to drink in its boisterous bier gartens. Collective open <b>space</b> <b>investment</b> {{at the turn of the}} 19 th century signaled the beginning of a second, decades-long era of Keynesian state provision for parks. A steady decline in that investment for Milwaukee’s parks since the 1980 s has provided the context for a set of new, yet seemingly liberalized governance experiments to emerge from the now defunct managerialist system. In this paper I employ regulation and regime theories in conjunction with thirty-six in-depth interviews to argue that these new parks experiments hail the beginning of a third era in parks provision. The new era is marked by an apparently neo liberal shift in regulation for open space on the basis of state actions to market public parks provision to a multiplicity of private actors. It is different from the first liberal era because the state withdraws its fiscal commitment to parks but still employs them to continue its active role in environmental and—by extension—social regulation. A multiplicity of local parks governances are promoted in the name of environmental citizenship but are problematic because they form new and localized geographies of social reproductive discipline in the benevolent rhetoric of responsibility, choice, and empowerment. ...|$|E
