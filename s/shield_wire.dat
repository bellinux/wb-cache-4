50|$|There are two {{variants}} of wrapped {{optical fibre cable}} systems for installation on overhead electricity power lines: they differ {{in the nature of}} the host conductor. When the host conductor is a phase-wire, one of the conductors that carry the electric current in the electricity network, a phase-to-ground insulator is required at every location where the wrapped cable leaves the conductor. The phase-to-ground (PTG) insulator is a device that provides electrical isolation whilst allowing optical continuity. This means that the fibre optic cable and joint closures on the grounded side of the PTG can be accessed and worked on safely, even if the overhead line is energised to full system voltage. The simpler system is designed to be installed on the earth-wire (also known as ground-wire or <b>shield</b> <b>wire)</b> of the overhead line. Because earth-wires are not energised in service, this type of installation does not require a phase-to-ground insulator.|$|E
50|$|Overhead {{power lines}} are often {{equipped}} with a ground conductor (<b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> or overhead earth wire). The ground conductor is usually grounded (earthed) {{at the top of}} the supporting structure, to minimize the likelihood of direct lightning strikes to the phase conductors. In circuits with earthed neutral, it also serves as a parallel path with the earth for fault currents. Very high-voltage transmission lines may have two ground conductors. These are either at the outermost ends of the highest cross beam, at two V-shaped mast points, or at a separate cross arm. Older lines may use surge arresters every few spans in place of a shield wire; this configuration is typically found in the more rural areas of the United States. By protecting the line from lightning, the design of apparatus in substations is simplified due to lower stress on insulation. Shield wires on transmission lines may include optical fibers (optical ground wires/OPGW), used for communication and control of the power system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This {{paper has}} {{proposed}} a modeling method to simulate steady-state and transient induced voltages to an underground gas pipeline from an overhead transmission line. The simulation results of the steady-state ac induced voltages agree well with analytical results obtained from a well-known formula. The induced voltages are significantly dependent on the configuration of an overhead line. A hori-zontal line induces the largest voltage to a gas pipeline, and an induced voltage by a vertical twin-circuit line is smaller by about 20 % than that by a vertical single-circuit line. The simulation method is applied to investigate the effect of <b>shielding</b> <b>wires</b> and plates on reduction of the induced volt-age, and the simulation results agree well with analytical re-sults. It {{has been found that}} the induced voltage can be re-duced by about 10 % by one <b>shielding</b> <b>wire</b> and by about 25 % by five <b>shielding</b> <b>wires,</b> and an iron plate can reduce the in-duced voltage by about 50 % assuming the <b>shielding</b> <b>wires</b> and the plate are ideally grounded...|$|R

40|$|Lightning strokes to {{transmission}} lines causes {{a majority of}} the power quality issues that are so severe that sensitive industrial loads are disturbed. Historically Vattenfall concluded that it is too expensive to use shield wires for the 132 kV grid due to the high soil resistivity in Sweden. Today the situation is different with sensitive industrial loads and the current Vattenfall standard is to build portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire.</b> The <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> is however not used {{to reduce the amount of}} lightning faults, it is used to ground the cross arm and reduce the amount of short circuits. In this project the lightning performance of different tower configurations used in the 132 kV grid is investigated using statistical insulation coordination in the softwares LPE and PSCAD. The optimal placement of the shield wires on towers located on flat ground is determined. Furthermore, the <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> configuration of a new portal tower with two shield wires and typical Swedish conditions is proposed and compared to a portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire.</b> The demand is that the amount of lightning faults should be reduced by half compared to the case with a portal tower without shield wires. It is concluded that in order to achieve this decrease in the amount of faults a portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> requires a tower foot resistance of 16. 5 while a portal tower with two shield wires requires a tower foot resistance of 35. 1. The distribution between single line to ground faults and short circuits for both configurations is estimated, where a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> proved to reduce the amount of short circuits. Furthermore, it is concluded that every cross arm needs to be grounded properly in order to achieve the desired lightning performance. A cost estimation based on an average 132 kV line with average loading showed that a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> could not cover its own costs. It is important to remember that the cost estimation is based on an average 132 kV line and it does not consider important industries or costs of groundings. If this would be included a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> could be profitable in some cases. Therefore it is recommended to consider the local conditions when deciding if a new transmission line is built with one or two shield wires...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. ADLash® is {{the trade}} name for an {{optical fibre cable}} {{attached}} to a transmission line <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> using aramid-reinforced bands. The installation {{of this type of}} optic fibre cable has been considered for the HVDC line from the Songo hydroelectric scheme at Cahora Bassa in Mozambique, to Apollo substation in South Africa. The impact that installation of this cable will have on the onset of corona is examined. The <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> with and without ADLash attached is modelled for both the actual line configuration and for corona cage studies. The electric field is calculated using the Method of Images and the Boundary Element Method to predict the electric field enhancements and to estimate the corona onset gradient. Corona onset gradients and phenomena for smooth and stranded conductors are researched to aid the prediction of voltage onset magnitudes for the corona cage. Estimated values are compared with observed values for both AC and DC applied voltages. Different patterns of corona and different corona onset voltages are observed for AC and negative DC applied voltages. The relative permittivity of the ADLash is higher than the surrounding air and this is shown to lead to greatly enhanced electric fields at the air/ dielectric/ <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> interfaces that are significant enough to cause corona at the rated operating voltage. The corona will bombard the ADLash and probably damage it. Some alternative methods of installing fibre optic cables are reviewed for further research because the use of ADLash cannot be recommended...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{propagation}} delay across long on-chip buses is increasingly becoming a limiting factor in high-speed designs. Crosstalk between adjacent wires {{on the bus}} may create {{a significant portion of}} this delay. Placing a <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> between each signal wire alleviates the crosstalk problem but doubles the area used by the bus, an unacceptable consequence when the bus is routed using scarce top-level metal resources. Instead, we propose to employ data encoding to eliminate crosstalk delay within a bus. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of the theory behind “self-shielding codes”, and gives the fundamental theoretical limits on the performance of codes with and without memory. Specifically, we find that a 32 -bit bus can be encoded with 40 wires using a code with memory or 46 wires with a memoryless code, in comparison to the 63 wires required with simple shielding. 1...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{describes}} new methodology in {{the current}} unbalance calculations in meshed grids. The meshed grids, mainly the transmission ones, consist of more parts connected together which are formed using different conductor types, phase sequence arrangements, tower constructions, and various number of lines on the same tower. Therefore several computational challenges arise {{in comparison with the}} widely discussed point-to-point configuration. The methodology divides the grid into a number of impedance matrices respecting all the self and mutual impedances among all conductors and all parallel lines. Another challenging issue for the lines impedance description is changing the number of <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> along the line if the line is composed of several sections with different tower configurations. For the current unbalance calculation, <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> must also be included in the algorithms, and matrices of various dimensions can be obtained. For the overall matrix description to be used, dimensions of all matrices in final equations must be equal, and therefore the virtual <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> are created. To compare more conductor transposition cases with each other, the line loadings caused by voltage sources should be equal. This is necessary mainly in case of meshed grids where the supplying sources on different lines can have strong mutual couplings. This can be achieved by an appropriately designed optimization of the connected voltage sources.|$|R

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of different alternative protection schemes using surge arresters for a 132 kV unshielded overhead line.

40|$|Lightning-induced overvoltages have a {{considerable}} {{impact on the}} power quality of overhead distribution and telecommunications systems, and various models {{have been developed for}} the computation of the electromagnetic transients caused by indirect strokes.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{lightning}} overvoltages in Medium Voltage (MV) {{lines are}} thoroughly investigated. The other {{goal is to}} propose new protection schemes for the designs. The lines consist of overhead lines, underground cables and covered conductors. These overvoltage problems range from direct and indirect strokes to lightning arcs. All the models and simulations are developed using the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) and Finite Element Method (FEM), while MATLAB is used for post-processing the results and identification of the model parameters. Improvement in the surge protection of MV overhead lines is demonstrated {{with a combination of}} surge arresters and a <b>shield</b> <b>wire.</b> Using the IEEE 34 -node feeder injected with multiple lightning strokes, the feeder is simulated using EMTP. The response of the line is modeled both with and without the surge protection devices. The simulation study extends to the performance of a MV underground cable due to a nearby lightning discharge using FEM. The use of <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> for limiting the overvoltage stress in the cables is proposed. A numerical analysis and simulations are performed to determine the outage rate of MV covered conductors due to lightning strokes of different characteristics. The optimum distance for surge protective devices on the conductors is also assessed. An enhancement in the surge analysis of distribution lines with the shielding effect of trees is proposed. An experimental study shows that a tree can intercept a lightning stroke in the vicinity of a distribution line. This study also analyzes experimental results of the shielding effectiveness of a tree and the induced voltages existing between the tree and the distribution line. The study is extended to evaluate the induced voltage on a distribution line for larger clearances using a Rusck model. This work investigates the lightning arc between an overhead line and a nearby tree under artificial rainfall. A full-scale laboratory experiment confirms that a direct stroke to a tree can cause severe damage to nearby power lines by initiating an arc channel through air to the conductors. A complete model of this phenomenon is developed by combining the existing static and dynamic arc equations. The model is accomplished by the bilateral interaction between the EMTP and Transient Analysis Control System (TACS) field. The experimental results have been reproduced by the computer simulations. The performance of the arc phenomenon is examined using a typical Finnish distribution network design. Using the modified arc model, the lightning arc performance of the MV/ LV network under the influence of nearby trees and the network characteristics is evaluated...|$|E
