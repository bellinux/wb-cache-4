5|$|I reckon {{it really}} sums up just what I felt {{as far as}} the {{competition}} goes. It's a very overwhelming process to go through and you really do feel that there's something else that got you there. Especially with how I didn't feel confident before and then <b>something</b> <b>just</b> clicked and I could look people in the eyes and really try and deliver a song.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was <b>something</b> <b>just</b> not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
25|$|Hero Points allow {{characters}} {{to perform the}} unlikely or cinematic stunts from the genre. Characters earn a Hero Point every time they get a Quality 1 result on a skill other than combat, also when the GM chooses to award one for a clever or dramatic action. A Hero Point may be spent to change the Quality Rating of any result by one level, whether for or against the character, also to change the environment, such as having <b>something</b> <b>just</b> show up by coincidence - the more fantastic, the more expensive in terms of Hero Points.|$|E

500|$|Squidward's {{voice has}} been {{compared}} to that of Jack Benny's. Kenny said, [...] "To me, there's <b>something</b> <b>just</b> so funny about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass does such a great job of playing [...] Squidward". Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!, said that Squidward [...] "sounds a lot like Jack Benny". Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying [...] "Jack Benny, no. Although he does have this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out." ...|$|E
500|$|Matheos {{originally}} intended the first OSI album as a [...] "project" [...] which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore {{wanted to use}} a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They {{did not want to}} give the impression that the guests on the first album were part of the band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was [...] "focused less on the progressive elements or the metal elements that were on the first record. We thought we could do <b>something</b> <b>just</b> a little more groove oriented." [...] Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him [...] "perfect" [...] for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album.|$|E
500|$|Slant writer Ed Gonzalez {{gave the}} film a two- out of four-star rating, saying the characters' actions {{do not feel}} [...] "appropriately warped" [...] while the {{interactions}} between the teachers and students is not [...] "at all rife with the what-are-they-thinking-about-us mystery of the book". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com wrote that Romanek [...] "does so many difficult things beautifully in this movie". He thought the film carried a reminder that life is short regardless of how long it lasts rather than a [...] "lecture about the horrors of human history". Tom Preston from The Guardian described Mulligan and Garfield's acting as solid, while commenting that Knightley's emotional performances are occasionally jarring. He further wrote that although Never Let Me Go finely demonstrated subtlety, its screenplay could have been written with less compression in some parts. Writing in Newsweek, Louisa Thomas praised the film for its beauty and its performances but declared that [...] "there's <b>something</b> <b>just</b> missing here." ...|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] rating. He {{felt that the}} episode worked {{extremely}} well on a visual and character-based level. Handlen felt that, because the show was [...] "often scariest when it’s implying, rather than flat out stating," [...] its [...] "mythology only really works as <b>something</b> <b>just</b> out of sight". For this reason, {{he felt that the}} episode mixed [...] "the compelling with the absurd" [...] with [...] "mixed results". Handlen concluded that the episode [...] "has its moment," [...] but is ultimately hurt {{by the fact that it}} refuses [...] "to come to any serious conclusions," [...] as well as [...] "the inherent limitations of the [...] form". Not all reviews were glowing. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the death scene of the Syndicate, noting that it was [...] "clumsily contrived, allowing [...] and Fowley to escape, but not because it makes sense, but because the show needs them to return at some point".|$|E
500|$|... "The song {{has kind}} of an old school vibe to it, {{so we wanted to}} be really {{stripped}} down and really simple with the video. Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do <b>something</b> <b>just</b> really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} the Foo Fighters' first instrumental, [...] "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners". [...] It {{was written by}} Grohl after meeting {{with one of the}} miners involved in the Beaconsfield mine collapse who requested an iPod with In Your Honor in it during the incident. As Grohl was moved by this action, he decided to [...] "write <b>something</b> <b>just</b> to dedicate to him that night because he definitely seemed like a hero", and later promised to include the instrumental on the album. The album version features Kaki King, whom Grohl invited to record the song as she was visiting Studio 606. Grohl later said that [...] "I showed it to her once, and she shredded 10 times better than I ever played it". Another guest was guitarist Pat Smear, who had been a bandmember from 1995 to 1998, and a guest musician on the tour for In Your Honor. Smear, who has since been reinstated as a full-on member, described his participation as [...] "the oddest recording experience I had with Foo Fighters" [...] given he had no input in composition and was [...] "going in and playing on a song that was already written".|$|E

500|$|Bradley Joseph {{was born}} in Bird Island, Minnesota and raised in Willmar, Minnesota, graduating from Willmar Senior High School in 1983. [...] He learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench. [...] One morning his father {{taught him how to}} play a boogie-woogie blues tune and by nightfall he could play the entire piece. [...] He started playing {{classical}} piano at age eight, taking lessons {{for a year and a}} half but was self-taught thereafter. [...] While in junior high, he took a concert field trip where he saw Buddy Rich perform. He recalls, [...] "I sat in the first row and when Buddy's sax player stood up to take his first solo <b>something</b> <b>just</b> clicked — the world closed in around me. I felt the power of music and knew that it was something special, a gift to be shared." [...] Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school, and trombone through high school and college. [...] When he picked up the horn, he got a whole new perspective on music, gaining insight into all the different timbres available, which was invaluable to him when he started working with orchestras. [...] The first band he was in was a wedding dance band which allowed him to gain experience in every different style of music from polkas to rock and roll to jazz classics. [...] After attending Moorhead State University as a music major, he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs. [...] He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards. Later, he started performing with guitarist Dugan McNeill, whose U2-like group was signed to Polygram. [...] McNeill and Yanni had once played together in the technopop band Chameleon in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Since 2004, the SpongeBob crew has {{periodically}} {{collaborated with}} the LA-based animation studio Screen Novelties to create stop-motion sequences for special episodes. The studio produced a brief claymation scene for {{the climax of the}} first theatrical film and was re-enlisted in 2009 to create an exclusive opening for the series' tenth anniversary special. The abominable snow mollusk, an octopus-like creature made of clay who acts as the antagonist of the double-length episode [...] "Frozen Face-Off," [...] was also animated by the company. Animation World Network reported that [...] "within the SpongeBob creative team, there was always talk of doing a more involved project together" [...] with Screen Novelties. As a result, the group was asked to create an episode animated entirely in stop motion in 2011. This project became [...] "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!”, which reimagined the show's characters as if {{they were part of a}} Rankin/Bass holiday film. Tom Kenny, who is not normally involved in the writing process, contributed to the episode's plot; he said in 2012 that he and Nickelodeon [...] "wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>just</b> like those old school, stop-motion Rankin-Bass holiday specials...which I watched over and over again when I was a kid growing up in Syracuse." [...] Unconventional materials such as baking soda, glitter, wood chips and breakfast cereal were used in mass quantities to create the special's sets. Members of the Screen Novelties crew received one win and two nominations at the 30th Annie Awards, a nomination at the 2013 Golden Reel Awards, and a nomination at the 2013 Annecy International Animated Film Festival for animating the episode. The team built a dolphin puppet named Bubbles, voiced by Matt Berry, for [...] Sequences involving Bubbles included a blend of stop motion and traditional animation. A second special animated in stop motion, themed around Halloween and using the same Rankin/Bass-inspired character models, is currently being produced for season 11.|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} there was very little {{connecting}} its two parts, aside from ferries and a circuitous journey via Goole (a road journey from Grimsby to Beverley, the headquarters, being <b>something</b> <b>just</b> under 100 miles). It was promised by the government that the Humber Bridge would make it a more viable unit. [...] By 1975 the bridge was planned to open in 1977. [...] The bridge was finally opened on 24 June 1981, providing a permanent link between North and South, and cutting the journey from Grimsby to Beverley to a mere 30 or so miles, but it did not secure Humberside's future.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} Ramblin' Jack Elliott studied {{extensively}} under Guthrie, visiting {{his home and}} observing how he wrote and performed. Elliott, like Bob Dylan later, idolized Guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of Guthrie's Huntington's disease, Dylan and Guthrie's son Arlo later claimed they learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about Arlo's claim, Elliott said, [...] "I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, If {{you want to learn}} <b>something,</b> <b>just</b> steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Friend Danny Hutton {{highlighted}} Brian's studio proficiency, citing what {{he believed}} to be an extraordinary talent at harnessing several different studio spaces while piecing together discrete instrumental patterns and timbres cohesively. He noted, [...] "Somebody could go in right after Brian's session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got. There {{was a lot of}} subtle stuff he did. ... People don't talk that much about it. They always talk about his music. He was fabulous in the studio, in terms of getting sounds. You'd sit there, and that was him. He was just hands-on. He would change the reverb and the echo, and all of a sudden, <b>something</b> <b>just</b> – whoa! – got twice as big and fat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Levy {{and many}} others have {{supported}} Dylan {{in the context of}} a larger, older blues and folk tradition of songwriters evolving old songs into new ones, which Dylan was no stranger to in the 1960s. Pete Seeger himself has previously expressed the view that Dylan is a link in this chain of folk and blues songwriters. Seeger has spoken many times about the folk process, often recounting that his friend Woody Guthrie once said to him [...] "That guy stole that from me, but I steal from everybody". Ramblin' Jack at one time expressed similar sentiments: [...] "Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, 'If you want to learn <b>something,</b> <b>just</b> steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly'".|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1917, Marcel Janco began taking his {{distance}} from the movement he had helped to generate. His work, in both woodcut and linocut, continued {{to be used as}} the illustration to Dada almanacs for another two years, but he was more often than not in disagreement with Tzara, while also trying to diversify his style. As noted by critics, he found himself split between the urge to mock traditional art and the belief that <b>something</b> <b>just</b> as elaborate needed to take its place: in the conflict between Tzara's nihilism and Ball's art for art's sake, Janco tended to support the latter. In a 1966 text, he further assessed that there were [...] "two speeds" [...] in Dada, and that the [...] "spiritual violence" [...] phase had eclipsed the [...] "best Dadas", including his fellow painter Hans Arp.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be <b>something.</b> <b>Just</b> the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E
5000|$|Hall {{considers}} himself both Buddhist and agnostic. On his MySpace page, he summarizes his faith as follows: [...] "I don't believe in God, but I {{do believe in}} <b>something.</b> I'm <b>just</b> not sure what." ...|$|R
