5|$|Pickersgill died on October 4, 1857, and {{is buried}} in Loudon Park Cemetery in {{southwest}} Baltimore. Her daughter Caroline erected a monument for her, and later the genealogical heritage organization United States Daughters of 1812 and the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner Flag House Association, which had organized to save and preserve the Flag House in 1927, placed a bronze plaque {{at the foot of}} her grave.|$|E
5|$|Although the willie wagtail is an {{aggressive}} defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young. About {{two thirds of}} eggs hatch successfully, and a third leave the nest as fledglings. Nestlings may be preyed upon by both pied butcherbirds, (Cracticus nigrogularis) black butcherbirds (C. quoyi), the <b>spangled</b> drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus), and the pied currawong (Strepera graculina), {{as well as the}} feral cat (Felis catus), and rat species. The proximity of nesting to human habitation has also left nests open to destruction by children.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great <b>spangled</b> fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{discovers that}} the ring is {{operated}} by the <b>Spangled</b> Mob, a ruthless American gang run by the brothers Jack and Seraffimo Spang. He follows the trail from London to New York. To earn his fee for carrying the diamonds he is instructed by a gang member, Shady Tree, to bet on a rigged horse race in nearby Saratoga. There Bond meets Felix Leiter, a former CIA agent working at Pinkertons as a private detective investigating crooked horse racing. Leiter bribes the jockey to ensure {{the failure of the}} plot to rig the race, and asks Bond to make the pay-off. When he goes to make the payment, he witnesses two homosexual thugs, Wint and Kidd, attack the jockey.|$|E
5|$|Still {{other animals}} seem to thrive {{regardless}} of the maturity of the forest or {{the presence of the}} understory. Common animals found in Quehanna include chipmunks, porcupine, and beaver, omnivores such as the black bear and raccoon, and predators like bobcat, red fox, and coyote (which has been in Pennsylvania since the 1930s). Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known for trout (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association. The wild area is also home to timber rattlesnake, eastern garter snake, and spring peeper (a type of frog), as well as butterflies like great <b>spangled</b> fritillary, monarch, red-spotted purple, and black, eastern tiger, and spicebush swallowtails. Any of these mammals, especially the white-tailed deer, can carry ticks, and such tick-borne diseases as Lyme disease are a health concern for hikers.|$|E
5|$|Bond calls Tree to enquire further {{about the}} payment of his fee and is told {{to go to the}} Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas. The Tiara is owned by Seraffimo Spang and {{operates}} as the headquarters of the <b>Spangled</b> Mob. Spang also owns an old Western ghost town, named Spectreville, restored to be his own private holiday retreat. At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany. After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble in the casino and wins heavily. Spang suspects that Bond may be a 'plant' and has him captured and tortured at Spectreville. With Tiffany's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway push-car with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train. Bond changes the points and re-routes the train onto a dead-end, and shoots Spang before the resulting crash. Assisted by Leiter, Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York, where they board the RMS Queen Elizabeth to travel to London, a relationship developing between them as they go. Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board. They kidnap Tiffany, planning to kill her and throw her overboard. Bond rescues her and kills both gangsters; he makes it look like a murder-suicide.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} quagga {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, <b>spangled</b> with hues the most brilliant and diversified.|$|E
25|$|Replicas of the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner Flag (15 stars, 15 stripes) are flown at {{two sites}} in Baltimore, Maryland: Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine and Flag House Square.|$|E
25|$|At Boston's NewCon convention, in October 1975, {{the first}} Carl Barks oil {{painting}} auctioned at {{a comic book}} convention ("She Was <b>Spangled</b> and Flashy") sold for $2,500. Subsequent offerings saw an escalation in the prices realized.|$|E
25|$|As {{the snow}} was squeegeed off the field (via Zamboni loaned {{to them by the}} Toronto Maple Leafs), the 48th Highlanders marched onto the field to perform the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner. Canadian country music star Murray arrived to sing O Canada while wearing a red parka.|$|E
25|$|The {{family of}} Rebecca Young claimed that she sewed the first flag. Young's {{daughter}} was Mary Pickersgill, {{who made the}} Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner Flag. According to rumor, the Washington family coat of arms, shown in a 15th-century window of Selby Abbey, was {{the origin of the}} stars and stripes.|$|E
25|$|The {{flag that}} flew over Fort McHenry, the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner Flag, has {{deteriorated}} to an extremely fragile condition. After undergoing restoration at the National Museum of American History, {{it is now}} on display there in a special exhibit that allows it to lie at a slight angle in dim light.|$|E
25|$|Star <b>Spangled</b> Springfield: {{annually}} on July 4, Springfield stages {{an evening of}} patriotism, pageantry and pyrotechnics. The evening begins in Court Square with a patriotic concert by the Springfield Symphony Orchestra and concludes with an elaborate fireworks display from the Memorial Bridge. Numerous hills and bluffs in Springfield afford views of the fireworks.|$|E
25|$|Platt also {{returned}} to comics around this time, writing occasional stories for the DC Comics titles G.I. Combat, Our Army at War and Star <b>Spangled</b> War Stories in 1964. His final known comics credit is a 48-page adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Marvel Classics Comics #1 (1976).|$|E
25|$|Deming was {{the author}} of Quality Productivity and Competitive Position, Out of the Crisis (1982–1986) and The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education (1993), and books on {{statistics}} and sampling. Deming played the flute and drums and composed music throughout his life, including sacred choral compositions and an arrangement of The Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner.|$|E
25|$|A half-dozen Panamanian students, {{carrying}} their flag, approached the flagpole. In response, the Zonians surrounded the flagpole, sang the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner, and rejected the deal between {{the police and}} the Panamanian students. Scuffling broke out. The Panamanians were driven back by the Zonian civilians and police. In the course of the scuffle, Panama's flag was torn.|$|E
25|$|Paramount {{put her in}} a thriller, This Gun for Hire (1942); {{her love}} {{interest}} was Robert Preston but she shared more scenes with Alan Ladd {{and the two of them}} would be so popular together they would be reteamed in lead roles for three more films. Both had cameos in Star <b>Spangled</b> Rhythm (1942), an all-star Paramount movie.|$|E
25|$|The Director of Bands is {{in charge}} of the Department of Bands at the university, teaches/conducts the Oregon Wind Ensemble, and assists with all of the bands in the department. Dr. Rodney Dorsey, former University of Michigan Associate Director of Bands, was hired to the {{position}} in 2013 following a year-long, nationwide search. Dr. Dorsey will conduct the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner at all home football games.|$|E
25|$|After the Shaw trial, Garrison wrote {{three books}} on the Kennedy assassination, A Heritage of Stone (1970), The Star <b>Spangled</b> Contract (1976, fiction, but based on the JFK assassination), and his best-seller, On the Trail of the Assassins (1988). A Heritage of Stone, {{published}} by Putnam, places responsibility for the assassination on the CIA and says the Warren Commission, the Executive Branch, members of the Dallas Police Department, the pathologists at Bethesda, and various others lied to the American public. The book does not mention Shaw or Garrison's investigation of Shaw.|$|E
25|$|Lake's career faltered {{with her}} unsympathetic role as Nazi spy Dora Bruckman in The Hour Before the Dawn (1944). Scathing reviews of The Hour Before the Dawn {{included}} criticism of her unconvincing German accent. She had begun drinking more heavily during this period, {{and a growing}} number of people refused to work with her. Lake had a number of months off work, during which time she lost a child and was divorced. She was brought back in Bring on the Girls (1945), Lake's first proper musical (although she had sung in This Gun for Hire and Star <b>Spangled</b> Rhythm). There were two more movies with Bracken, Out of This World and Hold That Blonde (both also 1945).|$|E
25|$|Goldfinger {{plans to}} {{contaminate}} {{the water supply}} at Fort Knox using the nerve agent GB (also known as Sarin), killing everyone at the base. Then, using an atomic bomb designed for an MGM-5 Corporal intermediate-range ballistic missile that he had purchased for $US1 million in Germany, Goldfinger would blow open Fort Knox's impregnable vault, before removing roughly $15 billion in gold bullion by truck and train {{with the help of}} American criminal organizations, including the Mafia; the Purple Gang (an organization that existed in real life); the <b>Spangled</b> Mob (a fictional gang that would later appear in other Bond novels); and the Cement Mixers, an all-female gang led by lesbian and former trapeze artist Pussy Galore. They would then escape to the Soviet Union on a cargo boat. Goldfinger bribes the syndicate leaders with $15,000 in gold apiece to secure their attendance at the meeting and promises that each group will receive at least $1 billion, while he will keep $5 billion.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese in 1941, St. Louisans began {{preparing}} for an attack in the area by sending soldiers to protect local military and munitions installations, including the St. Louis Army Ammunition Plant at Goodfellow and Bircher, Lambert Field, and the Curtiss-Wright aircraft factory. St. Louis police were employed to protect bridges, while workers at military factories were checked to protect against sabotage. Other security measures included the interrogation or arrest of German, Italian, and Japanese persons, including naturalized citizens. Several local Japanese restaurants were closed, and at the Bridlespur Hunt Club in Huntleigh, Missouri, the manager (a Japanese man {{who had lived in}} the United States since 1904) was arrested. St. Louis labor leaders organized boycotts of products made by the Axis powers, and bonfires were lit of Japanese-made products. In {{the spring and summer of}} 1942, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) made several high-profile arrests or investigations in St. Louis, including one into a pastor in Chesterfield, Missouri who was accused of sedition for condemning lynchings and openly opposing the playing of the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner in church.|$|E

500|$|A 2003–04 {{survey of}} the {{monument}} found 55 species of butterflies such as the common sootywing, orange sulphur, great <b>spangled</b> fritillary, and monarch. The monument's other insects have not been completely inventoried.|$|E
500|$|Although certain {{songs were}} {{identified}} with one particular {{side of the}} war, sometimes the other would adapt the song for their use. [...] A Southern revision of the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner was used, entitled [...] "The Southern Cross". [...] In {{an example of the}} different lyrics, where the Banner had [...] "O say does that Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner yet wave", the Cross had [...] "'Tis the Cross of the South, which shall ever remain". [...] Another Confederate version of the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner, called The Flag of Secession, replaced the same verse with [...] "and the flag of secession in triumph doth wave". [...] Even a song from the American Revolutionary War was adapted, as the tune Yankee Doodle was changed to [...] "Dixie Doodle", and started with [...] "Dixie whipped old Yankee Doodle early in the morning". [...] The Union's Battle Cry of Freedom was also altered, with the original lines of [...] "The Union forever! Hurrah, boys, hurrah! Down with the traitor, up with the star" [...] being changed to [...] "Our Dixie forever! She's never at a loss! Down with the eagle and up with the cross!" ...|$|E
500|$|The United States did {{not have}} a {{national}} anthem at this time (Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner would not be recognized as such until the twentieth century). [...] Union soldiers frequently sang the Battle Cry of Freedom, and the Battle Hymn of the Republic was considered the north's most popular song.|$|E
500|$|An Israeli children's {{band played}} Hatikva, the Israeli {{national}} anthem, {{along with the}} U.S. anthem, the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner. [...] The New York Times reported that the children [...] "tried valiantly" [...] to play the U.S. song, playing very slowly, but then many strong voices from among the crowd helped out until the music [...] "swept the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack album for Captain America: The First Avenger {{includes}} the original score by Alan Silvestri, {{as well as}} an original song [...] "Star <b>Spangled</b> Man" [...] with music composed by Alan Menken and lyrics by David Zippel.

500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the episode, several {{explicit}} references are made to the Olympic Games. When Jim starts the Office Olympics by lighting the [...] "Torch", he hums [...] "Olympic Fanfare and Theme" [...] by John Williams, one of the themes for the actual Olympic games. When the games are finished, the employees play a recording of [...] "The Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner".|$|E
500|$|The {{small family}} rented a house at 44 Queen Street (later 844 East Pratt Street, {{which became the}} Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner Flag House and 1812 Museum), where Pickersgill took in {{boarders}} and [...] opened a flag-making business, selling [...] "silk standards, cavalry and division colours of every description." [...] Her customers included the United States Army, United States Navy, and visiting merchant ships.|$|E
500|$|Of Pickersgill's five siblings, {{her oldest}} brother, William Young, {{was also a}} flag maker, {{and it is likely}} that his two daughters were Pickersgill's nieces that {{assisted}} in making the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner flag. [...] Her sister, Hannah Young, married Captain Jesse Fearson, a privateer ship commander during the War of 1812 who was captured by the British, imprisoned in Havana, Cuba, and later escaped.|$|E
500|$|Such a {{comeback}} {{could not be}} {{under the auspices of}} the Whig Party, with its remnants divided by the Kansas-Nebraska legislation (which passed with the support of Pierce). Many northern foes of slavery, such as Seward, gravitated towards a new party, the Republicans, but Fillmore saw no home for himself there. There was in the early 1850s considerable hostility towards immigrants, especially Catholics, who had recently arrived in the United States in large numbers, and several nativist organizations, including the Order of the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner, sprang up in response. By 1854, the Order had morphed into the American Party, which became known as the Know Nothings, for in its early days, members were sworn to hold private its internal deliberations, and if asked were to say they knew nothing about them. Many from Fillmore's [...] "National Whig" [...] faction had joined the Know Nothings by 1854, and influenced the organization to take up causes besides nativism. The success of the Know Nothings in the 1854 midterm elections, in which they won in several Northeastern states and showed strength in the South encouraged Fillmore, and on January 1, 1855, he sent a letter for publication, warning against immigrant influence in American elections, and soon thereafter joined the Order of the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner.|$|E
500|$|On September 8, 1909, the Army and Navy Union {{began its}} fourteenth {{biennial}} convention in Erie, Pennsylvania, {{at the local}} Chamber of Commerce. There were over 200 delegates that attended the opening session, among who were veterans of the American Civil War. The assembly sang The Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner at the beginning. There were some women that attended, that {{were members of the}} Auxiliary to the Army and Navy Union. It was proposed at this assembly that Congress be petitioned for the raising and restoration of Perry's old ship Niagara.|$|E

The game was played January 1, 2011 between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals. Pittsburgh native Jackie Evancho sang the Star <b>Spangled</b> Banner before local sports legends Franco Harris, Jerome Bettis and Mario Lemieux dropped the ceremonial puck. The Capitals won, 3–1. The game was the highest rated NHL contest since 1996 and the highest rated regular season game since 1975.
