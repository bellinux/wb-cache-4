[...] Another study conducted in Bellevue, Washington found that various types of radar speed signs installed in thirty-one locations resulted in 85th percentile speed reductions generally ranging from about 2-6 mph, with a few exceptions; Where four locations measured a reduction of less than 1 mph, and one other location had actually increased by 0.3 mph. However, another location had measured the maximum reduction of 6.8 mph. In spite of the small average speed reduction, the city considers the signs to be successful because they have resulted in a dramatic reduction in the speed of those vehicles that were traveling in excess of the limit, while not interfering with the progress of the majority of traffic that is already traveling at or below the speed limit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} control of quadrupedal {{bounding}} {{in the presence of}} torso flexibility and non-trivial leg inertia, and it proposes a method for <b>speed</b> <b>transitioning</b> based on the sequential composition of locally stable bounding gaits corresponding to different running speeds. First, periodic bounding motions are generated simply by positioning the legs during flight via suitable (virtual) holonomic constraints that are imposed on the evolution of the leg angles; at this stage, no control effort is developed on legs that are in contact with ground, resulting in efficient, nearly passive, bounding gaits. The resulting motions are stabilized by a hybrid control law which coordinates the movement of the torso and the legs in continuous time, and updates the leg touchdown angles in an event-based fashion. Finally, through sums-of-squares (SOS) programming, formally verified estimates of the domain of attraction of stable fixed points are used to realize <b>speed</b> <b>transitions</b> by switching among different bounding gaits in a sequential fashion...|$|R

40|$|IT {{outsourcing}} {{transition is}} {{the implementation of}} the new way of operating and it is part of any IT outsourcing relationship. It may follow initial outsourcing of in-house IT, switching outsourcing providers, or in-housing outsourced IT back from the provider. Transition sets the tone for the outsourcing relationship and researchers have suggested that failed transitions are the root cause of unsuccessful outsourcing relationships in majority of the cases. Furthermore, if the transition is planned and executed unsuccessfully, it may even endanger the business continuity of the client. Despite of the significance of the transition in the outsourcing relationship it has received limited academic attention. No research has especially focused on how the different outsourcing settings and the decisions made in the pre-delivery phase of IT outsourcing lifecycle contribute {{to the success of the}} transition. During the pre-delivery phase of the transition with the new IT outsourcing provider, important foundations for the whole outsourcing relationship are laid which often cannot be changed later. This thesis aims to provide a fresh viewpoint to the switching of IT outsourcing providers discussing how different outsourcing settings and external factors affect transition planning and how these decisions affect transition success when client is switching outsourcing providers. Further, this thesis aims to clarify what is high speed switching of outsourcing providers and when this type of transition should be used. To clarify the planning process when the client is switching outsourcing providers, the literature covers information technology outsourcing, different forms of IT outsourcing settings and how they affect the success of the transition. Further, the IT outsourcing lifecycle, project management and IT outsourcing transition management are discussed. To elaborate on the IT outsourcing lifecycle and moreover, the transition planning process, a traditional view of the IT outsourcing lifecycle model is developed from earlier studies. This model is then compared to a suggestive high <b>speed</b> <b>transition</b> model supported by the findings of a single case study. The results of the study indicate that the complexity of the outsourcing setting is not directly related to the success of the transition and that the use of high <b>speed</b> <b>transition</b> model for switching outsourcing providers is beneficial under certain conditions. To succeed with the high <b>speed</b> <b>transition</b> model, it is vital that there is high level of trust between the involved parties, the outsourced activities are not related to the core business of the client and there is no extensive transformation needed between the two settings. Thus, the cost of delaying the start of the transition without a final plan, agreement on the success measures and the service contract is considered as a higher the risk than starting the work without having them finalized. This view links transition management to agile practices and adds to the traditional view of switching IT outsourcing providers where the success measures and the service contract result from thorough planning in the pre-delivery phase that includes lengthy negotiations and extensive due diligence and the transition execution only starts after the contract is well defined and signed...|$|E

Small animal PET is a logical technique for validating new tracers relevant to human diseases. However, interspecies differences in the handling of chemicals may significantly influence the handling of novel tracers.

Then, we study the general aligned jobs and obtain an O(n 2) algorithm to compute the optimal schedule by using the algorithm for the common arrival time case as a building block. Because our algorithm relies on the computation of the optimal schedule in the ideal model (K=∞), in order to achieve O(n 2) complexity, we improve the complexity of computing the optimal schedule in the ideal model for aligned jobs from the currently best known O(n 2 logn) to O(n 2) ...|$|E

Currently, there is no general theory that can completely describe the transition-to-turbulence process. However, transition research has led to the identification of the predominant pathways by which this process occurs. For a truly physics-based model of transition to be developed, the individual stages in the paths leading to the onset of fully turbulent flow must be well understood. This requires that each pathway be computationally modeled and experimentally characterized and validated. This may also lead to the discovery of new physical pathways. This document is intended to describe molecular based measurement techniques that have been developed, addressing the needs of the high-speed transition-to-turbulence and high-speed turbulence research fields. In particular, we focus on techniques that have either been used to study high <b>speed</b> <b>transition</b> and turbulence or techniques that show promise for studying these flows. This review is not exhaustive. In addition to the probe-based techniques described in the previous paragraph, several other classes of measurement techniques that are, or could be, used to study high <b>speed</b> <b>transition</b> and turbulence are excluded from this manuscript. For example, surface measurement techniques such as pressure and temperature paint, phosphor thermography, skin friction measurements and photogrammetry (for model attitude and deformation measurement) are excluded to limit the scope of this report. Other physical probes such as heat flux gauges, total temperature probes are also excluded. We further exclude measurement techniques that require particle seeding though particle based methods may still be useful in many high speed flow applications. This manuscript details some of the more widely used molecular-based measurement techniques for studying {{transition and}} turbulence: laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), Rayleigh and Raman Scattering and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). These techniques are emphasized, in part, because of the prior experience of the authors. Additional molecular based techniques are described, albeit in less detail. Where possible, an effort is made to compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various measurement techniques, although these comparisons can be subjective views of the authors. Finally, the manuscript concludes by evaluating the different measurement techniques in view of the precision requirements described in this chapter. Additional requirements and considerations are discussed to assist with choosing an optical measurement technique for a given application...|$|E
40|$|South Africa's {{pedestrian}} {{accident rate}} {{is one of}} the highest in the world. The percentage of pedestrian accidents to total road accidents is approximately 33 % (RTMC, 2011) far greater than the world average of 22 % (World Health Organisation, 2013). The problem is more acute in rural areas where 1 in 3 pedestrian accidents results in pedestrian fatalities. The ratio on urban roads is 1 in 10. The sobering pedestrian safety statistics describing South Africa's rural roads have prompted the need to research functional and effective traffic engineering solutions that can improve pedestrian safety on rural high order roads located near human settlements. This investigation is conducted using the R 71 Polokwane -a road with a history of pedestrian safety problems- as a case study. Pedestrian safety risk factors and an assessment methodology for pedestrian risk on rural high order roads are derived from a review of local and international literature. The pedestrian risk assessment methodology is applied to the R 71 study area. This process highlights the shortcomings of the current accident data collection process. Critical information such as accident cause and location; driver and pedestrian characteristics such as age and gender; important information such as vehicle type and age, injuries, fatalities, etc. are not recorded. The limited data minimises the depth of the analysis however a reasonable high level understanding of the pedestrian safety risk factors and the risk in the study area is attained. The R 71 study area is characterised by villages, farms and an urban settlement. The prevalence of pedestrian accidents is higher in villages and lowest in the urban settlements. This is attributed to the infrastructure provision in the urban settlement. The causes of pedestrian risk on the R 71 are concluded as: ● Lack of integrated land use and transport planning; ● Lack of pedestrian infrastructure. ● Poor design of <b>speed</b> <b>transition</b> zones between rural areas and villages and urban areas. A literature review of effective pedestrian safety measures that are being implemented locally and abroad is compiled. Some of the solutions are impractical for the rural South African context particularly because they are dependent on consistent energy sources and may require routine maintenance. A solution framework based on the pedestrian safety risk identified on the R 71 is designed to guide countermeasure selection and design in rural contexts. In the end, solutions deemed suitable for the rural context are: effective high to low <b>speed</b> <b>transition</b> zones; the provision of fenced-off service roads and strategic crossing points; and the removal and enforcement of land use in the road reserve of high order roads. These solutions must be complemented with community training and consistent law enforcement...|$|E

Small active flaps {{of this type}} can be actuated using smart materials. A comprehensive aeroelastic analysis is used to model a helicopter with multiple trailing-edge flaps. The objective function containing the hub vibratory loads and flap control effort is minimized by an optimal controller. The control effort is differentially weighted for different flaps, such that all trailing-edge flaps are exploited to their full authority and limited to ± 2 degrees peak deflection. Numerical results are obtained for one, two and three flaps and their optimal locations identified. A reduction of 76 % in the hub vibration level is achieved at an advance ratio (nondimensional forward speed) of 0. 3 using three flaps. For the four-bladed, soft-inplane, hingeless rotor considered in this work, {{it is observed that}} the extent of hub vibration reduction {{is directly related to the}} effect of trailing-edge flap motion on the contribution of the second flapwise bending mode to blade motion.
