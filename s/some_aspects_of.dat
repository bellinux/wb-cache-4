5|$|Douglas Seale as The Sultan, the pompous, but kind {{ruler of}} Agrabah, who desperately {{tries to find}} a suitor for his {{daughter}} Jasmine. <b>Some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the character were inspired by the Wizard of Oz, to create a bumbling authority figure. The Sultan's supervising animator was David Pruiksma.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's sarcastic, foul-mouthed parrot assistant. Much like Robin Williams, Gottfried {{was given}} freedom to improvise his lines. Iago's supervising {{animator}} Will Finn tried to incorporate <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Gottfried's appearance into Iago's design, especially his semi-closed {{eyes and the}} always-appearing teeth.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the Brown {{decision}} {{are still}} debated. Notably, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, himself an African American, wrote in Missouri v. Jenkins (1995) {{that at the}} very least, Brown I has been misunderstood by the courts.|$|E
5|$|A {{special unit}} of the Stasi secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular border guards, between 1968 and 1985, to weed out {{potential}} defectors. One in ten officers and one in thirty enlisted men {{were said to have}} been recruited by the Stasi as informers. The Stasi regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> security; passport control stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements had a real life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. <b>Some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
5|$|Conceived by series creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels, Ron {{has been}} a central {{character}} since the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for woodworking and 16-year-old Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch. The traits of the character were also partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in Burbank, California.|$|E
5|$|He {{seemingly}} rejected <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> van Eyckian realism, {{notably in}} his depictions of shadows, and his unwillingness to apply transparent glazes. As a colourist, Lochner was more inclined towards the International Gothic style, {{even if this}} inhibited realism. He did not utilise the newly developed Netherlandish techniques of representing perspective, but rather indicated distance through the diminution of parallel objects.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, {{another son}} of Merthyr Tydfil, Jack Jones, based his novel, Off to Philadelphia in the Morning , {{on the events}} in the life of Joseph Parry. The book became a BBC three-part {{presentation}} of the same name in 1978. Jones never offered the book as anything except a work of fiction; despite this, <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the novel have been misconstrued as fact.|$|E
5|$|In Computer Gaming World, L.S. Lichtmann {{wrote that}} {{development}} of <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> {{the game was}} left incomplete.

5|$|Initially, the {{graphical}} BitLocker interface in Windows Vista {{could only}} encrypt {{the operating system}} volume. Starting with Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008, volumes other than the operating system volume could be encrypted using the graphical tool. Still, <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the BitLocker (such as turning autolocking on or off) had to be managed through a command-line tool called manage-bde.wsf.|$|E

Using the cursed plasm that {{shapes the}} Underworld, a sin-eater can remove <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the target, or force <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{the world to}} ignore him. Unlocking this manifestation is a level 7 synergy sin. Also, only Underworld plasm can fuel this ability. If the Sin-eater wants to use an Archetypal manifestation, he must be within one yard of an Avernian Gate.|$|R
5|$|Lastly, {{he played}} {{at least some}} part in the {{establishment}} of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, passing the cipher manuscripts from which it was founded to his friend William Wynn Westcott shortly before his death. He had already made a strong case that the mystic and philosophical elements which allowed Freemasonry to evolve from a purely operative to a speculative society were likely to have been imported from <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the Hermeticism practised during the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|More {{recently}} still, Trollope {{scholars have}} looked upon it with increasing favour, describing it {{as a powerful}} work that has suffered undeserved neglect. Present-day critics have focussed increasingly on the Carry Brattle subplot; it has been suggested, {{supported in part by}} the similarity of passages from The Vicar, from the Autobiography, and from The Small House at Allington referring to Johnny Eames, that <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> her portrayal are based on the novelist's own early adulthood in London.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E

5|$|The aediles were {{in charge}} of various {{municipal}} tasks, e.g. the upkeep of temples, streets, and the water-supply. They were also responsible for public games, and <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> police work in the city. The quaestors were elected administrators, which could be put in charge of the treasury, the granaries, or various administrative postings in Italy, with the consuls, or in the provinces. In the late Republic, election to the quaestorship became the basis for a life appointment to the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{film version}} of the novel {{has not been the}} only movie to have a {{character}} borrowing <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Wintour. Edna Mode's similar hairstyle in The Incredibles has been noted, Johnny Depp said he partially based the demeanour of Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on Wintour. Fey Sommers in the Ugly Betty television series was also likened to Wintour, from the trademark bob and sunglasses, to Wintour's last name homophonous with 'Winter', while Sommers' is homophonous with 'Summer'.|$|E
