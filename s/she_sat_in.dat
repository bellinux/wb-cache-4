Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, {{the first in}} May 2007 and the second in January 2008. While she {{did not participate in}} the discussions, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the front row and listened as the men vying to become the nation's 44th president claimed to be a rightful successor to her husband. Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid, nothing came of it. On March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the presumptive Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose the election to Barack Obama.|$|E
25|$|After {{a series}} of {{appearances}} at public and private venues, the Queen invited Camilla to her Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the royal box behind the Queen {{for one of the}} concerts at Buckingham Palace. Although she maintained her residence, Ray Mill House, which she purchased in 1995 at Lacock, Wiltshire, she then moved into Clarence House, Charles's household and official residence since 2003.|$|E
25|$|Nearing {{completion}} of her degree in French, Davis realized her major interest was in philosophy instead. She became {{particularly interested in}} the ideas of Herbert Marcuse. On her return to Brandeis, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> on his course. Marcuse, she wrote, turned out to be approachable and helpful. She began making plans to attend the University of Frankfurt for graduate work in philosophy. In 1965 she graduated magna cum laude, a member of Phi Beta Kappa.|$|E

25|$|A half-hour series {{produced}} for primetime Sunday evening viewing on ITV found then Big Breakfast presenter Gaby Roslin on location to introduce film {{of some of}} the natural world's most successful predators. Each of six shows focused on a particular species; Roslin went on African safari to focus on lions, leopards and African hunting dogs and to North America where <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> a snake-pit with 50 serpents, sailed alongside killer whales and {{came face to face with}} a grizzly bear.|$|E
25|$|The Queen {{died in the}} {{presence}} of her eldest son, the Prince Regent, who was holding her hand as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> an armchair at the family's country retreat, Dutch House in Surrey (now known as Kew Palace). She was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. Her husband died just over a year later. She is the second longest-serving consort in British history (after the present Duke of Edinburgh), having served as such from her marriage (on 8 September 1761) to her death (17 November 1818), a total of 57 years and 70 days.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E

25|$|Over the {{following}} days, Chikatilo confessed to a further 22 killings {{which had not}} been connected to the case, either because the murders had been committed outside the Rostov Oblast, because the bodies had not been found, or, {{in the case of}} Yelena Zakotnova, because an innocent man had been convicted and executed for the murder. (Aleksandr Kravchenko received a posthumous pardon for Yelena Zakotnova's murder.) As had been the case with the victims compiled upon the initial list of charges, Chikatilo was able to provide details of these additional killings only the perpetrator could have known: one of these additional victims, 14-year-old Lyubov Volobuyeva, had lived in south-western Siberia, and had been killed in a sorghum field near Krasnodar Airport on 25 July 1982. Chikatilo recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field, and that he had approached the girl as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport. Volobuyeva, Chikatilo stated, had informed him she lived in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, and was awaiting a connecting flight at the airport to visit relatives.|$|E
500|$|The opening musical {{introduction}} of the song served as a brief twenty-six seconds musical interlude on the Drowned World Tour in 2001.

The musical intro for [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] would start with a dancer in a Japanese costume dancing behind her on a raised podium. As the music ends, Madonna starts singing [...] "Nobody's Perfect" [...] from her 2000 album Music. In 2008, Madonna sang the first verse and chorus at two dates—Las Vegas and East Rutherford—of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna forgot the lyrics at the Vegas show and refused to sing the song in Boston; she performed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate has}} {{inspired}} {{at least two}} satirical Internet urban legends. In 2001, The Onion, an American satirical newspaper, published an article entitled [...] "Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism Among Children," [...] which said that the [...] "High Priest of Satanism" [...] had described Harry Potter as [...] "an absolute godsend to our cause." [...] This article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as [...] "proof" [...] of their views. The following year the Canadian daily the National Post released a similar spoof article in its satirical column Post Morten, saying that [...] "Rowling—or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan—said that as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> a coffee shop one grey day, {{wondering what to do}} with her empty, aimless life, it hit her, 'I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!'"

500|$|In 1910, Alexandra {{became the}} first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a {{remarkable}} departure from precedent, for two hours <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, a bill to remove {{the right of the}} House of Lords to veto legislation, was debated. Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill. Shortly afterward, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe. She told Frederick Ponsonby, [...] "I feel as if I had been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all." [...] Later that year, she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham. The new king, Alexandra's son George, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son's reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.|$|E
500|$|Missouri {{returned}} {{to be part}} of the United States Navy reserve fleet at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, until 12 January 1995, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. [...] She remained in Bremerton, but was not open to tourists as she had been from 1957 to 1984. [...] In spite of attempts by citizens' groups to keep her in Bremerton and be re-opened as a tourist site, the U.S. Navy wanted to pair a symbol of the end of World War II with one representing its beginning. On 4 May 1998, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton signed the donation contract that transferred her to the nonprofit USS Missouri Memorial Association (MMA) of Honolulu, Hawaii. She was towed from Bremerton on 23 May to Astoria, Oregon, where <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> fresh water at the mouth of the Columbia River to kill and drop the saltwater barnacles and sea grasses that had grown on her hull in Bremerton, then towed across the eastern Pacific, and docked at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor on 22 June, just [...] from the Arizona Memorial. Less than a year later, on 29 January 1999, Missouri was opened as a museum operated by the MMA.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 September 1989 German {{civilian}} Heidi Hazell, {{the wife}} of a British soldier, was shot dead as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> a car outside a British Army married quarter in Unna.

2500|$|Lucas {{became the}} first African American to play Uncle Tom in a serious production. Nevertheless, the show fared poorly in Richmond, Virginia, and not even a change of venue to Lucas's home state of Ohio could save the production. The {{problems}} {{seem to have been}} many. One critic remarked that [...] "little" [...] Eva was so large that she nearly flattened St. Clair when <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> his lap. Lucas had to hawk his stash of diamonds to pay the troupe's transport back to Cincinnati.|$|E
2500|$|De Beauvoir first {{worked with}} Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude Lévi-Strauss, when all three {{completed}} their practice teaching requirements {{at the same}} secondary school.

It was while studying for the agrégation that she met École Normale students Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, and René Maheu (who gave her the lasting nickname [...] "Castor", or beaver). [...] The jury for the agrégation narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.|$|E

Of the birth scenes, actress Eden Riegel, Bianca's portrayer, stated, [...] "I had done so much research. I read books [...] What to Expect When You're Expecting. I watched the TLC series A Baby Story. It felt like I watched hundreds of episodes! As soon as I got home I'd be watching women give birth on TV."
