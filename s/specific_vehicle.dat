25|$|The {{emission}} standards for vehicles for trucks (lorries) and buses {{are defined by}} engine energy output in g/kWh; this is unlike the {{emission standards}} for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, which are defined by vehicle driving distance in g/km - a general comparison to passenger cars is therefore not possible, as the kWh/km factor depends (among other) on the <b>specific</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} plans {{since before the}} Second World War for a {{motorway}} network in the United Kingdom. Lord Montagu formed a company to build a 'motorway like road' from London to Birmingham in 1923; however it was a further 26 years before the Special Roads Act 1949 was passed which allowed {{for the construction of}} roads limited to <b>specific</b> <b>vehicle</b> classifications, and the 1950s when the country's first motorways were given the government go-ahead.|$|E

500|$|The game {{revolves}} around vehicle construction, {{in which the}} player must design their own vehicles ranging from automobiles, motorbikes, boats and aeroplanes. Gameplay itself is centred on completing a series of challenges depending on the <b>specific</b> <b>vehicle,</b> although {{some parts of the}} game retain platforming traits. Development of the game first began as a remake of the original Banjo-Kazooie, although a game which involved [...] "more traditional platforming" [...] was conceptualised. Eventually, the project evolved into a construction-oriented game which was inspired by connecting Lego blocks.|$|E
500|$|Lexus {{design has}} {{traditionally}} placed {{an emphasis on}} targeting <b>specific</b> <b>vehicle</b> development standards. Since the marque's inception, design targets have ranged from aerodynamics and ride quality to interior ergonomics. The backronym [...] "IDEAL" [...] ("Impressive, Dynamic, Elegant, Advanced, and Lasting") {{is used in the}} development process. Each vehicle is designed according to approximately 500 specific product standards, known as [...] "Lexus Musts," [...] on criteria such as leather seat stitching. Design elements from the marque's concept vehicle line, the LF series (including the 2003 LF-S and 2004 LF-C), have been incorporated in production models.|$|E

In contrast to its predecessors, there are no conventional [...] "moves" [...] for Banjo and Kazooie to use, apart from melee attacks Kazooie performs with her spanner. The game's hub world is Showdown Town, which contains various portals that lead to six worlds. Each world contains three levels, one boss level, {{and a series of}} various challenges, although exploration of these worlds are optional. The key part of the game is to earn [...] "Jiggies" [...] in order to unlock new worlds, and accumulate enough Jiggies to unlock the final world, which contains the final boss.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{method of}} {{transportation}} {{within the city}} is by small gasoline or electric powered motorcars referred to as [...] "autoettes". These include numerous golf carts and similarly-sized vehicles. Vehicles under [...] wide, [...] long, and less than [...] may qualify as an autoette. [...] Any resident may acquire an autoette permit with the restriction of one permit per household. It {{is very difficult for}} a private citizen to get a permit to have a full-size vehicle in Avalon. The permit is issued to the individual as opposed to a <b>specific</b> <b>vehicle,</b> is surrendered when residency on the island ends, and is not transferable except through petition before the city council. Only one new vehicle permit is issued for every two permits that become ineligible to be renewed or are voluntarily surrendered. For purposes of vehicle registration, Catalina Island is divided into two classifications: within Avalon and [...] "Interior" [...] (areas outside the city limits). The city has its own strict permit program with which local vehicle owners must comply, in addition to the usual requirements imposed by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Because of these restrictions, there is no regular vehicle ferry service for visitors to take their car to Avalon and the rest of Catalina Island.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} main reasons {{commercial}} VIO data differs from {{data from the}} US government. The first is due to variation when data is reported by states to the US government. States are required to report registrations using form FHWA-561 once per calendar year or fiscal year. Forty six states end their fiscal year on June 30 and four end in March, August or September. This data {{is due to the}} FHWA by January 1 of the following year, creating a lag time of about six months and thereby not accounting for half a year of changes. Second, the government's definitions of vehicle classifications change over time. A footnote added to FHWA datafiles states, [...] "...Data for 2007-10 were calculated using a new methodology developed by FHWA. Data for these years are based on new categories and are not comparable to previous years". Third, the government can include vehicles not in use, or double-count vehicles that have been transferred across two states. According to the FHWA Office of Highway Policy Information], [...] "Although many States continue to register <b>specific</b> <b>vehicle</b> types on a calendar year basis, all States use some form of the [...] "staggered" [...] system to register motor vehicles. Registration practices for commercial vehicles differ greatly among States. The FHWA data include all vehicles which have been registered at any time throughout the calendar year. Data include vehicles which were retired during the year and vehicles that were registered in more than one State. In some States, {{it is also possible that}} contrary to the FHWA reporting instructions, vehicles which have been registered twice in the same State may be reported as two vehicles".
