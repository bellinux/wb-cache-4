5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to <b>such</b> <b>questions</b> from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. <b>Such</b> <b>questions</b> are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E

Maxwell was put in charge of the {{development}} of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus. One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, <b>such</b> <b>questions</b> as the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E

5|$|On 12 July Ward {{reported}} on the weekend's events to MI5. He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler. Ward also stated {{that he had been}} asked by Ivanov for information about the future arming of West Germany with atomic weapons. This request for military information did not greatly disturb MI5, who expected a GRU officer to ask <b>such</b> <b>questions.</b> Profumo's interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in their plans to use her in a honey trap operation against Ivanov, to help secure his defection. Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5's director-general, Sir Roger Hollis.|$|E
5|$|The Smuts {{family were}} {{traditional}} Afrikaner farmers. As <b>such,</b> <b>questions</b> {{of property and}} family affairs were extensively governed by custom. Custom dictated that it was upon the first son that family expectations fell; the family would strive, so far as their means allowed, to provide him with the best possible education {{with the goal of}} paving the way for his entry into one of the professions. As for the others, they would be put to work on the farm, {{while at the same time}} receiving a rudimentary home education. As the second son this was to be Jan's role. While he remained at the farm, his elder brother, Michiel, was sent to begin his schooling in Riebeek West, destined, like his uncle Boudewyn, for a future as a predikant in the Dutch Reformed Church.|$|E
25|$|Key {{questions}} for mitigation are {{the viability of}} methods, the roles of government and private sector and how early these solutions are implemented.

25|$|The {{classification}} theorem has {{applications in}} many branches of mathematics, as {{questions about the}} structure of finite groups (and their action on other mathematical objects) can sometimes be reduced to questions about finite simple groups.

25|$|The {{asserted}} {{claim to}} privilege should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between {{freedom of the press}} and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct.

25|$|Although the Chinese Room {{argument}} was originally presented {{in reaction to}} the statements of AI researchers, philosophers have come to view it as {{an important part of the}} philosophy of mind.

25|$|The {{founders of}} the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith commented {{on issues such as}} {{evolution}} that were seen as a dispute between science and religion at the time. Most science-related statements are in harmony with current scientific conclusions, but some are considered questionable. Statements by BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h of a cosmological nature remain unconfirmed, but given the relative absence of material cosmological assertions, and the prevalence of writings that direct the believers to science to resolve <b>such</b> <b>questions,</b> these issues are far less controversial in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community than in many other faiths.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on {{the complexity and}} exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require Î©(NlogN) (i.e., order NlogN or greater) operations, even for the simple case of power of two sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of <b>such</b> <b>questions,</b> although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as cache or CPU pipeline optimization.|$|E

How do the formalisms for infinite-dimensional spaces and finite-dimensional spaces differ, or do they differ? Can these ideas be extended to a broader class of spaces? Answering <b>such</b> <b>questions</b> is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra.|$|E
25|$|Previously, {{under section}} 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act ("SCA"), when a {{constitutional}} question arose in proceedings before the Subordinate Courts, the Courts could refer {{the question to}} the High Court and, meanwhile, stay the proceedings. However, this {{did not mean that}} the Subordinate Courts could not decide constitutional questions at all. In Johari bin Kanadi v. Public Prosecutor (2008), the High Court held that the Subordinate Courts may decide <b>such</b> <b>questions</b> where the relevant constitutional principles have already been set out by superior courts. Where the principles have not been decided, the question should be referred to the High Court.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek {{philosophers}} took <b>such</b> <b>questions</b> very seriously. Indeed, many {{of their}} general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. Plato (424/423BC 348/347BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic Ideas (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, {{in a world of}} mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is discovered by humans. In the Meno Plato's teacher Socrates asserts {{that it is possible to}} come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval.|$|E
