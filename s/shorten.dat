40|$|Whether a <b>shortened</b> {{dental arch}} {{needs to be}} {{extended}} depends {{on the degree of}} the <b>shortening.</b> Four categories of <b>shortened</b> dental arches can be distinguished: 1. slightly <b>shortened</b> dental arches; 2. moderately <b>shortened</b> dental arches; 3. extremely <b>shortened</b> dental arches; and 4. asymmetrical extremely <b>shortened</b> dental arches. Decision-making on extending a <b>shortened</b> dental arch should be based on oral function and the patient's perceived impact on oral health-related quality of life. According to this principle, there is no evidence for extending slightly <b>shortened</b> dental arches. Extending moderately <b>shortened</b> dental arches is indicated in exceptional cases, especially for aesthetic reasons. In the case of (asymmetrical) extremely <b>shortened</b> dental arches there are reasons for extension. The extension can be restricted to restoring the arch {{to the level of a}} moderately <b>shortened</b> dental arch.

40|$|Active muscle <b>shortening</b> {{reduces the}} {{isometric}} force potential of muscle. This observation {{indicates that the}} isometric length-force characteristics are altered during muscle <b>shortening.</b> Post-shortening decrease in isometric force depends on starting length, <b>shortening</b> amplitude and <b>shortening</b> velocity. In the present study, post-shortening decrease in isometric force was determined after isokinetic contractions with various <b>shortening</b> amplitudes initiated from different lengths of rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. For a given target length post-shortening force decrease increased linearly with <b>shortening</b> amplitude. We found that the quotient of post-shortening force decrease and <b>shortening</b> amplitude depended linearly on muscle length.

40|$|Background—Postsystolic <b>shortening</b> in ischemic {{myocardium}} {{has been}} proposed as a marker of tissue viability. Our objectives were to determine if postsystolic <b>shortening</b> represents active fiber <b>shortening</b> or passive recoil and if postsystolic <b>shortening</b> may be quantified by strain Doppler echocardiography (SDE). Methods and Results—In 15 anesthetized dogs, we measured left ventricular (LV) pressure, myocardial long-axis strains by SDE, and segment lengths by sonomicrometry before and during LAD stenosis and occlusion. Active contraction was defined as elevated LVP and stress during postsystolic <b>shortening</b> {{when compared with the}} fully relaxed ventricle at similar segment lengths. LAD stenosis decreased systolic <b>shortening</b> from 10. 41. 2 % to 5. 90. 9 % (P 0. 05), whereas postsystolic <b>shortening</b> increased from 1. 10. 3 % to 4. 20. 7 % (P 0. 05). In hypokinetic and akinetic segments, LV pressure–segment length and LV stress–segment length loop analysis indicated that postsystolic <b>shortening</b> was active. LAD occlusion resulted in dyskinesis, and postsystolic <b>shortening</b> increased additionally to 8. 21. 0 % (P 0. 05). After 3 to 5 minutes with LAD occlusion, the dyskinetic segment generated no active stress, and the postsystolic <b>shortening</b> was attributable to passive recoil. Elevation of afterload caused hypokinetic segments to become dyskinetic, and postsystolic <b>shortening</b> remained partly active. Postsystolic <b>shortening</b> by SDE correlated well with sonomicrometry (r 0. 83, P 0. 01). Conclusions—Postsystolic <b>shortening</b> is a relatively nonspecific feature of ischemic myocardium and may occur i...|$|R

Methods: In 24 pigs (27 – 82 kg), temporal <b>shortening</b> by sonomicrometer crystals was recorded. The ECG evaluated rhythm, and Millar pressure transducers measured intraventricular pressure and dP/dt. Results: The predominant <b>shortening</b> sequence proceeded {{from right to left}} in basal loop, then down the descending and up the ascending apical loop segments. In muscle surrounded by the basal loop, epicardial muscle predominantly <b>shortened</b> before endocardial muscle.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the stability of the distal radioulnar joint after an ulnar <b>shortening</b> osteotomy and to quantify longitudinal resistance to ulnar <b>shortening</b> when the osteotomy was proximal or distal to the ulnar attachment of the distal interosseous membrane. These relationships were characterized for forearms with or without a distal oblique bundle. Methods: Ten fresh-frozen cadavers were used. A transverse osteotomy and ulnar <b>shortening</b> was performed proximal (proximal <b>shortening)</b> and distal (distal <b>shortening)</b> to the ulnar attachment of the distal interosseous membrane. Distal radioulnar joint laxity was evaluated as the volar and dorsal displacements of the radius relative to the fixed ulna with 20 N of applied force. Testing was performed under controlled 1 -mm increments of ulnar <b>shortening</b> up to 4 mm, with the forearm in neutral alignment, 60 of pronation, and 60 of supination.

30|$|The axial <b>shortening</b> {{analysis}} of a concrete tall building essentially requires a construction sequence analysis and a creep {{analysis of}} the concrete structure. The construction sequence analysis {{is a series of}} static analyses, where new construction activities are applied to an already deformed and stressed structure (Kurc and Lulec 2013). Before defining the geometry of the newly added structure for the construction sequence analysis, it is necessary to determine what type of <b>shortening</b> is considered. Total <b>shortening</b> in a tall building can be divided into pre-installation and post-installation <b>shortening</b> (Fintel et al. 1987). Pre-installation <b>shortening</b> and post-installation <b>shortening</b> are sometimes called up-to-slab <b>shortening</b> and subsequent <b>shortening,</b> respectively. In cast-in-place concrete building structures, pre-installation <b>shortening,</b> which is the amount of <b>shortening</b> developed before slab installation, is meaningless since it is automatically compensated by leveling the forms. On the other hand, in steel building structures where columns are prepared to exact lengths, the total <b>shortening,</b> which is the sum of the pre-installation and the post-installation shortenings, is of significance because the slabs are built at a predetermined position. In this study, the analysis models are reinforced concrete tall buildings and the post-installation shortenings are calculated. In an analysis model, the displacement of each node is assumed to be zero until the node is generated. The incremental displacements are calculated for each construction step. The incremental vertical displacements at the columns and walls are accumulated to yield the post-installation <b>shortening</b> at the target time.|$|R
5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also <b>shorten</b> the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. This {{study of}} {{hypertensive}} {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} 1) assessed myocardial <b>shortening</b> in both the circumferential and long-axis planes, and 2) investigated the relation between geometry and systolic function. Background. In hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy, whole-heart studies have suggested normal systolic function {{on the basis of}} ejection fraction-systolic stress relations. By contrast, isolated muscle data show that contractility is depressed. It occurred to us that this discrepancy could be related to geometric factors (relative wall thickness). Methods. We studied 43 patients with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy and normal ejection fraction (mean ± SD 69 ± 13 %) and 50 clinically normal subjects. By echocardiography, percent myocardial <b>shortening</b> was measured in two orthogonal planes; circumferential <b>shortening</b> was measured at the endocardium and at the midwall, and long-axis <b>shortening</b> was derived from mitral annular motion (apical four-chamber view). Circumferential <b>shortening</b> was related to end-systolic circumferential stress and long-axis <b>shortening</b> to meridional stress. Results. Endocardial circumferential <b>shortening</b> was higher than normal (42 ± 10 % vs. 37 ± 5 %, p 2 SD of normal relations, indicating depressed myocardial function. There was no significant relation between long-axis <b>shortening</b> and meridional stress, indicating that factors other than afterload influence <b>shortening</b> in this plane. Conclusions. High relative wall thickness allows preserved ejection fraction and normal circumferential <b>shortening</b> at the endocardium despite depressed myocardial <b>shortening</b> in two orthogonal planes...|$|R

40|$|Despite higher neural {{activation}} during {{active as}} compared to passive muscle <b>shortening,</b> Hoffman reflexes (H-reflexes) are similar. This {{may be explained by}} homosynaptic post-activation depression (HPAD) of Ia-afferents being present during active <b>shortening.</b> Accordingly, it was investigated whether conditioning electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve reduced the H-reflex less during active than passive <b>shortening.</b> The effects of two conditioning modes (0. 2 and 1 Hz) were compared to a control mode without conditioning. H-reflexes and M-waves were elicited as the ankle passed 90 degrees with the soleus muscle undergoing passive or active (20 % MVC) lengthening or <b>shortening.</b> Conditioning had no effect during active <b>shortening.</b> In contrast, during passive <b>shortening,</b> the H:M of the I Hz mode was significantly less than that of the 0. 2 Hz and control modes. In lengthening, H:M was unaffected by conditioning. These findings support that HPAD reduces the synaptic efficacy of Ia-afferents during active <b>shortening,</b> active and passive lengthening, but not passive <b>shortening.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
