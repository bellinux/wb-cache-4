5000|$|During the 1870s, all the British railway {{companies}} standardised {{on the use}} of semaphore signals, {{which were}} then invariably all of the lower quadrant type. From the 1920s onwards, upper quadrant semaphores almost totally supplanted lower quadrant signals in Great Britain, except on former GWR lines. The advantage of the upper quadrant signal is that should the signal wire break, or the signal arm be weighed down by snow (for instance), gravity will tend to cause the signal to drop to the safe [...] "danger" [...] position. In a lower quadrant signal, the opposite may happen, sending the signal to [...] "off" [...] when in fact it should be illustrating [...] "danger".

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{provide a}} {{consistent}} {{standard for the}} evaluation of different types of presbyopic correction. SETTING: Eye Clinic, School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom. METHODS: Presbyopic corrections examined were accommodating intraocular lenses (IOLs), simultaneous multifocal and monovision contact lenses, and varifocal spectacles. Binocular near visual acuity measured with different optotypes (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and words) and reading metrics assessed with the Minnesota Near Reading chart (reading acuity, critical print size [CPS], CPS reading speed) were intercorrelated (Pearson product moment correlations) and assessed for concordance (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC]) and agreement (Bland-Altman analysis) for indication of clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Nineteen accommodating IOL cases, 40 simultaneous contact lens cases, and 38 varifocal <b>spectacle</b> <b>cases</b> were evaluated. Other than CPS reading speed, all near visual acuity and reading metrics correlated well with each other (r> 0. 70, P<. 001). Near visual acuity measured with uppercase letters was highly concordant (ICC, 0. 78) and in close agreement with lowercase letters (+/- 0. 17 logMAR). Near word acuity agreed well with reading acuity (+/- 0. 16 logMAR), which in turn agreed well with near visual acuity measured with uppercase letters 0. 16 logMAR). Concordance (ICC, 0. 18 to 0. 46) and agreement (+/- 0. 24 to 0. 30 logMAR) of CPS with the other near metrics was moderate. CONCLUSION: Measurement of near visual ability in presbyopia should be standardized to include assessment of near visual acuity with logMAR uppercase-letter optotypes, smallest logMAR print size that maintains maximum reading speed (CPS), and reading speed.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} challenges, {{attitudes and}} practices among spectacle wearers to effect positive change when necessary, and determine positive change in a resource-limited economy. Materials and Methods: A multi-hospital descriptive, cross sectional survey of spectacle wearers was conducted between May 2007 and December 2008 in Nigeria. Results: A total of 214 wearers comprising 43. 5 &#x 0025; males and 56. 5 &#x 0025; females aged 18 - 84 years were surveyed. The majority of subjects (92. 6 &#x 0025;) had at least secondary education. The wearers&#x 2032; challenges included expensive spectacles (43. 0 &#x 0025;), falling/ scratched/broken lenses (29. 4 &#x 0025;) and fear that spectacles would damage the eyes (23. 8 &#x 0025;). The wearers&#x 2032; attitudes were comprised of consultations with &#x 2032;road side dispensers&#x 2032; (7 &#x 0025;) and permitting other individuals to select spectacle frames for them (26 &#x 0025;). Care and maintaince practices included use of handkerchief, tissue paper, fingers and water to clean spectacles (49. 5 &#x 0025;) and placing <b>spectacles</b> inside <b>spectacle</b> <b>cases</b> (30. 4 &#x 0025;). There were no associations (P > 0. 05) between gender or literacy levels and who selected the frames for the subjects, caregivers consulted for spectacles, and cleaning materials for spectacles. The placement of spectacles {{when not in use}} was significantly associated (P < 0. 05) with the wearers&#x 2032; gender and literacy levels but not with the length of spectacle wear. Conclusion: Attitudes and practices requiring positive change crossed gender and educational levels among spectacle wearers. The cost of spectacles should be regulated and availability of standard eye care practices would reduce challenges including lens-related defects and quackery. During consultation with a recognized eye care professional, counseling of wearers on positive attitudes/practices as well as allaying fear of spectacle wear is required...|$|R

Otherwise, again, the signal could fail to return to danger. These counterweights are used just as commonly on upper- as on lower-quadrant signals.) ...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{systematic}} review {{the effectiveness of}} refractive multifocal intraocular lens(MIOL) ReZOOM vs diffractive MIOL ReSTOR {{in the treatment of}} cataract. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing refractive MIOL ReZOOM with diffractive MIOL ReSTOR were identified by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMbase, WANFANG MED ONLINE, CMJD, SinoMed, and CNKI. Related journals also were hand-searched. Methodological quality of randomized controlled trials(RCTs) was evaluated by simple evaluate method that recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. Data extracted by two reviewers with designed extraction form. RevMan software(release 5. 2) was used for data management and analysis. RESULTS:A total of 7 trials(846 eyes) were included for {{systematic review}}. Subgroup analyses were used according to different model comparison of ReSTOR MIOL. The results showed {{a significant difference in the}} mean of the best distance corrected intermediate visual acuity(BDCIVA) in the ReZOOM MIOL group with WMD= - 0. 11, 95 % CI (- 0. 16, - 0. 06) (P CI (0. 05, 0. 14) (P CI (1. 76, 3. 91) (P CI (1. 15, 1. 60) (P = 0. 0004) and WMD= 1. 29, 95 % CI (1. 09, 1. 53) (P = 0. 003). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the mean of the uncorrected distance visual acuity(UCDVA), the uncorrected intermediate visual acuity(UCIVA), the best corrected distance visual acuity(BCDVA) and the best distance corrected near visual acuity(BDCNVA) with WMD - 0. 03, 95 % CI (- 0. 06, 0. 01) (P = 0. 15), WMD= - 0. 04, 95 % CI (- 0. 09, 0. 01) (P = 0. 10), WMD= - 0. 01, 95 % CI (- 0. 04, 0. 02) (P = 0. 55) and WMD= 0. 06, 95 % CI (- 0. 06, 0. 17) (P = 0. 32).

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} distinctions between bankrupt firms and equally leveraged firms that avoid bankruptcy. Building upon the systemic incentives of bankruptcy law, and specifically those applicable to Chapter 11 reorganizations, the study argues that the firmâs governance and capital structure characteristics moderate {{the relationship between the}} firmâs financial condition and the filing decision. The results of this study indicate that, contrary to agency theoretical predictions, firms with high levels of inside equity ownership and secured indebt-edness file in poorer financial condition than peer firms with low levels of these variables.

40|$|The core {{function}} of optometrists is the prescribing of spectacles {{in order to}} alleviate symptoms and improve visual function. Most commonly, the spectacles are used to correct refractive errors and, less frequently, they are also used to correct a decompensated heterophoria. Whilst identifying and diagnosing a marked refractive error or decompensated heterophoria is relatively straightforward, the management of marginal or borderline cases is much more difficult, for {{there is no clear}} cut-off point between normality and abnormality. The literature search in this thesis reveals a lack of evidence-based research on the criteria for determining when a refractive or prismatic correction is required. The aim of the present research was to investigate at what point optometrists currently decide to prescribe <b>spectacles</b> in borderline <b>cases,</b> and to see if current prescribing habits relate to the advice given in the literature. Further aims were to investigate whether the correction of borderline refractive errors and decompensated heterophoria improves reading performance, and to investigate any association between an improvement in reading performance and symptoms. A practitioner survey was given to practitioners attending CET events during 2001 and to the UK Optometry E-mail discussion list.

40|$|Culture-led {{regeneration}} {{and creativity}} policies {{appear to have}} achieved broad societal acceptance in many cities in North America and Europe. This research explores how a discursive articulation of culture with entrepreneurial notions of âcreativity has contributed to {{a new set of}} policies, forms of policy coordination, sectoral partnerships and growth coalitions. This is illustrated by the case of MontrÃ©al, Canada, a city that places culture and creativity at the heart of its local accumulation strategy, and has secured a soft hegemonic presence. This research largely draws on geographical political economy literature that views urban neoliberalism as a contingent process that requires consent from disparate constituencies, and not as something predeterminedby changes in the economy. The first line of inquiry traces key events and policy documents i. e. âkey moments of conjuncture that have helped to repackage culture as a competitive asset.

6000|$|<b>Spectacle</b> in any <b>case</b> broke out, <b>spectacle</b> accumulated, by our then measure, many {{thicknesses}} deep, flushing in {{the sovereign}} light, as one felt it, of the waning Rhode Island afternoons of August and September {{with the most}} [...] "evolved" [...] material civilisation our American world could then show; the vividest note of this in those years, unconscious, even to an artless innocence, of the wider wings still to spread, being the long daily corso or processional drive (with cavaliers and amazons not otherwise than conveniently intermixed,) which, with a different direction for different days, offered doubtless as good {{an example of that}} gregarious exercise at any cost distinguishing [...] "fashionable life" [...] as was anywhere on the globe to be observed. The price paid for the sticking together was what emphasised, I mean, the wondrous resolve to stick, however scant and narrow and unadjusted for processional effect the various fields of evolution. The variety moreover was short, just as the incongruities of composition in the yearning array were marked; but the tender grace of old sunset hours, the happier breadth of old shining sands under favour of friendly tides, the glitter quand mÃªme of [...] "caparisoned" [...] animals, appointed vehicles and approved charioteers, {{to say nothing of the}} other and more freely exchanged and interrelated brightnesses then at play (in the softer ease of women, the more moustachio'd swagger of men, the braver bonhomie of the social aspect at large), melted together for fond fancy into a tone, a rhythm, a representational virtue charged, as to the amenities, with authority. The amenities thus sought their occasion to multiply even to the sound of far cannonades, and I well remember at once reflecting, in such maturity as I could muster, that the luckier half of a nation able to carry a huge war-burden without sacrifice of amusement might well overcome the fraction that had to feed but on shrinkage and privation; at the same time that the so sad and handsome face of the most frequent of our hostesses, Mary Temple the elder as she had been, now the apt image of a stern priestess of the public altar, was to leave with me for the years to come the grand expression and tragic irony of its revulsion from those who, offering us some high entertainment during days of particular tension, could fiddle, as she scathingly said, while Rome was burning. Blest again the state of youth which could appreciate that admirable look and preserve it for illustration of one of the forms of ancient piety lost to us, and yet at the same time stow away as part of the poetry of the general drama just the luxury and pride, overhanging summer seas and projecting into summer nights great shafts of light and sound, that prompted the noble scorn. The [...] "round of pleasure" [...] all this with a grand good conscience of course--for it always in the like case has that, had it at least when arranging performances, dramatic and musical, at ever so much a ticket, under the advantage of rare amateur talent, in aid of the great Sanitary Commission that walked in the footsteps and renewed in various forms the example of Florence Nightingale; these exhibitions taking place indeed more particularly in the tributary cities, New York, Philadelphia, Boston (we were then shut up to those,) but with the shining stars marked for triumphant appearance announced in advance on the Newport scene and glittering there as beauties, as Ã©lÃ©gantes, as vocalists, as heroines of European legend. Hadn't there broken upon us, under public stress, a refluent wave from Paris, the mid-Empire Paris of the highest pitch, which was to raise our social water-mark to a point unprecedented and there strikingly leave it? We were learning new lessons in every branch--that was the sense of the so immensely quickened general pace; and though my examples may seem rather spectral I like to believe this bigger breathing of the freshness of the future to have been what the collective rumble and shimmer of the whole business most meant. It exhaled an artless confidence which yet momently increased; it had no great sense of a direction, but gratefully took any of which the least hint was given, gathering up by the way and after the fact whatever account of itself a vague voice might strike off. There were times when the account of itself as flooding Lawton's Valley for afternoon tea was doubtless what it would most comfortably have welcomed--Lawton's Valley, at a good drive's length from the seaward quarter, being the scene of villeggiatura of the Boston muse, as it were, and the Boston muse having in those after all battle-haunted seasons an authority and a finish of accent beyond any other Tyrtaean strain. The New York and perhaps still more the Philadelphia of the time fumbled more helplessly, even if aspiringly, with the Boston evidences in general, I think, than they were to be reduced to doing later on; and by the happy pretext, certainly, that these superior signs had then a bravery they were not perhaps on their own side indefinitely to keep up.|$|R
