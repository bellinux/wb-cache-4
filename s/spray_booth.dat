50|$|The word lacquer {{refers to}} quick-drying, {{solvent-based}} varnishes or paints. Although their names may be similarly derived, lacquer {{is not the}} same as shellac and is not dissolved in alcohol. Lacquer is dissolved in lacquer thinner, which is a highly flammable solvent typically containing butyl acetate and xylene or toluene. Lacquer is typically sprayed on, within a <b>spray</b> <b>booth</b> that evacuates overspray and minimizes the risk of combustion.|$|E
50|$|Spray {{applications}} {{can be one}} of {{the most}} cost effective ways of applying conformal coating as it can be done on the bench top if necessary for small rework and repair jobs, or scaled up to be done in <b>spray</b> <b>booths</b> for medium scale production.|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{regulations}} on liquid-paint spraying required all large manufacturing companies {{to convert to}} a high-solids paint. This {{was to be a}} costly and troublesome changeover. After researching all potential alternatives, in 1993 the company purchased and installed four powder-coating <b>spray</b> <b>booths</b> in a newly constructed paint building. The powder coating process eliminated all air pollution and hazardous waste, while increasing product appearance and durability.|$|R

5000|$|For garage-scale jobs, small [...] "rattle can" [...] {{spray paint}} is less {{expensive}} and complex than powder coating. At the professional scale, the capital expense and time required for a powder coat gun, booth and oven are similar to a spray gun system. Powder coatings have a major advantage in that the overspray can be recycled. However, if multiple colors are being sprayed in a single <b>spray</b> <b>booth,</b> this may limit the ability to recycle the overspray.|$|E

50|$|Paint {{spray booths}} for {{vehicles}} are typically 100-300 {{feet in length}} and usually contain many robotic and manual spray zones. The temperature and humidity are rigorously controlled in these systems. As items are painted in these booths, {{a certain amount of}} paint does not contact the article being painted and forms a fine mist of paint in the air space surrounding the article. This paint must be removed from the air. To accomplish this, the contaminated air is pulled through the paint <b>spray</b> <b>booth</b> by exhaust fans. A curtain of circulating water is maintained across the path of the air {{in such a way that}} the air must pass through the water curtain to reach the exhaust fans. As the air passes through the water curtain, the paint mist is “scrubbed” from the air and carried to a sump basin (sludge pit), usually located below the paint <b>spray</b> <b>booth.</b> In this area, the paint particles are separated from the water so that the water may be recycled and the paint particles disposed of as paint sludge. The paint detackifiers commonly added to these systems are either melamine-formaldehyde based, based upon acrylic acid chemistry, or chitosan.|$|E

5000|$|This coating can be {{completed}} with a spray aerosol or dedicated <b>spray</b> <b>booth</b> with spray gun and is suitable for low and medium volume processing. The quality of the surface finish can be superior to all other methods when a trained skilled operator completes the process, {{as long as the}} circuit board is clean and the coating has no adhesion issues. The coating application may be limited due to 3D effects but masking requirements are more [...] "shield" [...] than [...] "barrier" [...] since the penetration is less effective. However, the lack of penetration can be an issue where coating is desired to penetrate under devices.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spray</b> <b>booth</b> is a {{pressure-controlled}} closed environment, originally used {{to paint}} vehicles {{in a body}} shop. To ensure the ideal working conditions (temperature, air flow, and humidity), these environments are equipped with ventilation, consisting of mechanical fans driven by electric motors, and optionally burners to heat the air to speed paint drying. Toxic solvents and paint particles are exhausted outside, possibly after filtering and treatment to reduce air pollution. Prevention of fires and dust explosions is also a high priority. In order {{to assist in the}} removal of the over sprayed paint from the air and to provide efficient operation of the down-draft, water-washed paint spray booths utilize paint detackifying chemical agents.|$|E
50|$|Combustion {{spraying}} equipment produces an intense flame, {{which may have}} a peak temperature more than 3,100 °C, and is very bright. Electric arc spraying produces ultra-violet light, which may damage delicate body tissues. <b>Spray</b> <b>booths,</b> and enclosures, should be fitted with ultra-violet absorbent dark glass. Where this is not possible, operators, {{and others in the}} vicinity should wear protective goggles containing BS grade 6 green glass. Opaque screens should be placed around spraying areas. The nozzle of an arc pistol should never be viewed directly, unless it is certain that no power is available to the equipment.|$|R

5000|$|Spray {{painting}} with solvent-based or water-based paint creates paint overspray, a waste material {{that must be}} effectively neutralized, or [...] "detackified", and collected for disposal. In order {{to assist in the}} removal of the oversprayed paint from the air and to provide efficient operation of the down-draft, water-washed paint spray booths utilize paint detackifying chemical agents. The detackification products are commonly introduced into the water that is recirculated in the paint <b>spray</b> <b>booth</b> system. The first purpose is to render the paint non tacky so it does not stick to the booth equipment and foul the paint system. The second purpose is to efficiently collect the paint solids that were sprayed into the system and remove them from the water for disposal.|$|E
40|$|The procedures, performance, {{and results}} {{obtained}} from the M- 52 <b>spray</b> <b>booth</b> qualification test are documented. The test was conducted at Thiokol Corporation, Space Operations, M- 52 Inert Parts Preparation facility.

40|$|Abstract — The {{industries}} {{that are involved}} in the production of dangerous chemicals requires Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV) for separating employees to hazards. LEV purpose is to separate contaminants from the source it generated. The objective {{of this paper is to}} look at a number of studies related to the LEV and its applications. The discussions are divided to several parts such as application in construction industries, buildings, manufacturing industries, workshops and paint manufacturers. Ongoing monitoring, maintenance and effective personal protective equipment (PPE) are necessary to ensure the <b>spray</b> <b>booths</b> can be managed properly and avoid employee exposure to contaminants. Ventilation design in buildings, equipment selection and use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is highly suggested in that application. There are no exposures to hazardous materials to the building users in the construction of hospitals and others. Use of push-pull ventilation method is an efficient. The future phase of ventilation system in airplanes and hawker centre will be the consumer's attention...|$|R
