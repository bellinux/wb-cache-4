The Ruhr region was hardest hit, as its easy-to-reach coal mines petered out, and expensive German coal was no longer competitive. Likewise the Ruhr steel industry went into sharp decline, as its prices were undercut by lower-cost suppliers such as Japan. The welfare system provided a <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> <b>for</b> {{the large number of}} unemployed workers, and many factories reduce their labor force and began to concentrate on high-profit specialty items.

This paper {{begins with a}} treatment of {{some aspects of the}} theory. The author's approach draws more on institutional economics, and more precisely on the approach taken by Kindleberger (1978), {{in the sense that he}} believes the design of good financial <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> <b>for</b> Latin America depends upon an understanding of the way that formal ex-ante <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> have broken down during times of crisis over the past one hundred years. In this paper then author explores issues surrounding <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> <b>for</b> financial systems in small open economies like those in Latin America. The starting point in Section 2 is the idea that asymmetric information will generally restrict the scope for lending to potential borrowers. Section 3 shows that government regulation of financial intermediaries can frequently lower the cost of lending. Section 4 discusses the creation of central banks in Latin America in the 1920 s as an innovation to promote financial deepening. Section 5 shows that the extension of the <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> to depositors is a relatively new and untested development. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of the design of <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> that takes into account the principles developed in the paper.

This car was entered as a <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> <b>for</b> the team's primary driver Joe Nemechek in the 78, should his car not make the race. Nemechek locked the 78 in on pole day, giving Wallace the opportunity to race. Wallace finished eighth in the first Duel at Daytona, making the 50th Daytona 500. Wallace was black flagged in the 500 for failure to maintain the NASCAR-required speed, allowing him to finished dead-last. Wallace drove for Armando Fitz early in the 2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series season before switching to the No. 28 for Jay Robinson. Between the 2008, 2009, and 2010 seasons, Wallace finished in the top ten three times. He left Jay Robinson and joined RAB Racing, driving without a paycheck in exchange for getting to drive competitive equipment. Wallace recorded eleven top ten finishes in 2011, with a best finish of fifth at Richmond. In October, he announced that he would return to the team in 2012. However, Wallace only ran the first five races before sponsorship issues forced him to move to a partial schedule. In addition to driving both RAB's Nos. 09 and 99, Wallace also drove at Indianapolis with Benny Gordon's SR2 Motorsports team.|$|E
