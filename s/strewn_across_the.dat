25|$|As {{everything}} {{had been done to}} help the passengers, and when nothing else could be done to save them, Mr Russell and people from all over Kilkee took in survivors from the disaster for the night. The next morning the extent of the disaster became apparent with bodies and wreckage <b>strewn</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> whole beach. As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed up on the beach and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it. In the end over £300 was raised, all going to the survivors and to the next of kin of the dead.

Most of the town of Slane were quick on the scene, vans and truck were seen spiriting away from the wreck of the truck in the dead of night. Several prosecutions followed, the actual quantity of whiskey taken away is still known only to the management of Bushmills and perhaps to the Insurance Company that followed up the claim. The following day five Irish Divers, Brian Cusack, Sean Sheridan, Joe Murray, Fergus McKenna and Sean Donohoe arrived and while the local people of Slane were still dredging for bottles they collected 408 bottles in total, the local butcher in Slane at the time was apparently still drinking Bushmills Whiskey four years later.|$|E

The model is in qualitative agreement with the behavior of real ants. The model ants operate according to local strategic rules and possess only local perceptual capacities. Nonetheless, {{they are able to}} impose global order. What is the mechanism underlying this phenomenon? We hypothesize that it is the combination of two processes, one which decreases smallscale complexity, and another which couples small-scale decreases in complexity to larger scales. To test this hypothesis, we introduce variant ants which have a complexity-seeking strategy. These ants can "see" local complexity, and tend to perform actions (picking up and putting down objects) in regions of highest local complexity. Using this strategy, they are able to accomplish their task more efficiently than the basic ants. For both basic and co [...] ...|$|R

Up to [...] {{of water from the}} Pungo River flooded most of the city of Belhaven, and similar flooding occurred in Washington, entering dozens of buildings and houses. Across the region, the combination of high winds, tides, and flooding closed several bridges and roads, including a portion of U.S. Highway 70. The winds also destroyed several mobile homes, although coastal damage was less than expected. During Ginger's passage, the Salvation Army and Red Cross provided more than 3,000people with food assistance.|$|E

500|$|Damage {{from the}} {{hurricane}} was widespread. Fort Walton Beach, {{where hundreds of}} structures were damaged or destroyed, was hit particularly hard. In some areas, the storm surge washed away buildings demolished by the strong winds. The winds cleared certain locations of trees and buried properties and roads under sand. Throughout northwest Florida, an estimated 8,000 people suffered storm-related losses, and 500 businesses were completely destroyed. An article in the Tallahassee Democrat reported that [...] "Cottages, motels, restaurants, convenience stores and other beach businesses were <b>strewn</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> highway in a tangle of down power poles, lines and busted mains." [...] A [...] shrimp farm at Panama City, {{the first of its}} kind, was effectively lost.

500|$|Soon {{after the}} torpedo plane attacks, American carrier dive bombers arrived over the Japanese {{carriers}} almost undetected and began their dives. At 10:22, 25 SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from Enterprise, led by C. Wade McClusky, hit Kaga with one [...] bomb {{and at least}} three [...] bombs. The first landed near her rear elevator and set the berthing compartments on fire, and the next bomb hit the forward elevator and penetrated the upper hangar, setting off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck. Captain Okada {{and most of the}} ship's senior officers were killed by the third bomb, which hit the bridge. The 1000-pound bomb hit amidships and penetrated the flight deck to explode on the upper hangar. The explosions ruptured the ship's avgas lines, damaged both her port and starboard fire mains and the emergency generator powering her fire pumps, as well as knocking out the carbon dioxide fire suppression system. Fueled by the avgas pouring onto the hangar deck, the fires detonated the [...] of bombs and torpedoes <b>strewn</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> hangar deck in a series of catastrophic multiple fuel-air explosions that blew out the hangar sides.

500|$|Called [...] "a {{cemetery}} for the living", it {{was reported}} in 2007 that between 30 and 135 homeless people were squatting in the Grove Church Cemetery. An investigation had been brought on by a sexual assault of a woman, who was near the Bergenline Avenue Station of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail, and by knife-point was brought into the cemetery and assaulted. Upon searching the grounds, police found remnants of living activity, namely mattresses, pillows, and blankets, as well as garbage <b>strewn</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> lawn. Also, small shacks had been built along the perimeter. To the dismay of neighbors, who had complained about the noise and feeling unsafe, {{there was not much}} that the police could do to remove the people off of the premises; there is no law against loitering in public places. One victim, however, claimed that there were bronze urns stolen from his relative's tomb, and Reverend Douglas Shepler, the pastor of the Grove Reformed Church, reported a woman visiting a grave had her necklace ripped off and stolen by one of the men. In addition, the Reformed Grove Church had been supporting the homeless by providing them with meals, as it is within their rights and devotion to charity that they will not turn away anyone seeking help.

50|$|The {{fascinating}} {{result on}} {{the dependence of}} the network's robustness to its node mixing may be explained as follows. According to their definition, high-degree nodes in assortative networks tend to form a core group among them. Such a core group provides robustness to the network by concentrating all the obvious target nodes together in one portion of the graph. Removing these high-degree nodes {{is still one of}} the most effective ways to destroy network connectivity, but it is less effective (compared to neutral networks) because by removing them all from the same portion of the graph we fail to attack other portions. If these other portions are themselves percolating, then a giant cluster will persist even as the highest degree nodes vanish. On the other hand, the disassortatively mixed network is particularly susceptible to removal of high-degree nodes because these nodes are <b>strewn</b> far apart <b>across</b> <b>the</b> network, so that attacking them is like attacking all parts of the network at once.|$|R

Along the coastline, heavy rainfall and strong waves caused extensive property damage. In Gulf Shores, 251 houses, 16 apartment buildings, and 70 businesses experienced significant damage. On Dauphin Island, the hurricane damaged 80 houses and left around 40 uninhabitable. Many waterfront homes on the western side of the island were pushed into other homes or <b>strewn</b> into pieces <b>across</b> <b>the</b> sand. Some roads were completely washed away.

Lewis and Haynes are seen sat at opposite ends of the sofa looking into the distance, spliced with more scenes of Lewis on the rooftop. The couple are seen during an awkward dinner before switching to images of the couple in bed together, seemingly happy. As the chorus kicks in for the first time, the couple are seen arriving at a party, with Lewis wearing an aqua-coloured dress with a portion of her midriff revealed, meanwhile Haynes wears a plaid shirt and jeans. Initially the couple are content, embracing guests but socialising separately and avoiding contact with each other.

This show included stills from one of my video pieces - ‘Domain of formlessness’, which was inspired by Steve Dutton whom I met whilst doing my Masters. The video relates (quite literally) to the notion of ‘avalanches’ in the title of this exhibition and the film stems from a conversation that started between Steve and myself (and continues to this day) about the catastrophes that result from trying to deal with landslides of material from abandoned artistic activities which often end up <b>strewn</b> chaotically <b>across</b> <b>the</b> studio. Dutton and Peacock made a film called ‘Plague-Orgy-Time’ in 1997 and I first saw it in their exhibition ‘Apocatropes’ at the Mappin Gallery in the same year.

2500|$|In {{the account}} of the deuteronomic history, Ephraim is portrayed as domineering, haughty, discontented, and jealous, but in {{classical}} rabbinical literature, the biblical founder of the tribe is described as being modest and not selfish.

[...] Nevertheless, other classical rabbinical texts mock the tribe for the character it has in the deuteronomic history, claiming that Ephraim, being headstrong, left Egypt 30 years prior to the Exodus, and on arrival in Canaan was subjected to a disastrous battle with the Philistines; in the Midrashic Jasher this is portrayed as a rebellion of Ephraim against God, resulting in the slaying of all but 10, and the bleached bones of the slaughtered being <b>strewn</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> roads, {{so much so that the}} circuitous route of the Exodus was simply an attempt by God to prevent the Israelites from having to suffer the sight of the remains.|$|E
