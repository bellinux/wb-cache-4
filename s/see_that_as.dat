25|$|The {{collection}} {{at that time}} went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling Orohippus from the Eocene through three-toed species such as Miohippus to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he could <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes {{could be explained by}} a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, it is now known, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum). The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line.|$|E

500|$|In January 2009, Jill Berry, {{president}} of the Girls' Schools Association and head teacher at the Dame Alice Harpur School in Bedford, cited medical dramas such as Holby City as an inspiring force in increasing numbers of female students deciding to pursue careers in medicine. Berry explained: [...] "The girls <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> an exciting and dynamic way of life. They see it as making a difference to people's lives. It gives them a sense sometimes of the pressures, responsibility and adrenaline. Such TV programmes can be good, {{as long as they}} give a realistic impression." [...] Similarly, consultant surgeon Andrew Raftery uses clips from Holby City as part of the University of Sheffield Outreach and Access to Medicine Scheme, to inspire pupils from under-represented social and educational backgrounds to pursue careers in medicine.|$|E
500|$|Marge is {{generally}} a stereotypical sitcom mother, {{and she also}} plays the [...] "long-suffering wife" [...] who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in [...] "Homer Alone" [...] (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a mental breakdown. After spending time at [...] "Rancho Relaxo", during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often. Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she [...] "put {{up with a lot}} in [...] marriage," [...] and has left Homer or thrown {{him out of the house}} on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an adult education class on how to build a successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is [...] "complete and utter dependence." [...] At first, Marge does not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a benefit, but eventually admits that he [...] "really [...] make a gal feel needed." [...] Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show. Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in [...] "Life on the Fast Lane" [...] (season one, 1990), where she resists the charming Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.|$|E

But Sprecher did not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> even possible. [...] "his ordinance is impermissibly vague on its face," [...] he wrote. [...] "Therefore, it does not provide an administrative body with adequate standards to guide and limit the administrators' discretion in drawing guidelines."

[...] Although once the Rebbe died, he didn’t <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a possibility. Lamm also argued that messianists had misinterpreted Schneerson's {{statements}} to create a [...] "distortion" [...] leading to [...] "moral nihilism." [...] According to Lamm open efforts to declare Schneerson the messiah were not been tolerated before his death: [...] "When he was alive, {{no one would have}} dared to discuss this. But now it is easy for the messianically-oriented to distort the Rebbe's teachings".|$|E

[...] Several city council members spoke up against the [...] "quick fix" [...] mentality inherent in the Times editorial; council member Peter Steinbrueck added he was [...] "really incredulous over young teenaged girls going out all night unsupervised and mixing with much older people," [...] but didn't <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> an issue over the nature of the place where they had socialized. Sandra Williamson, mother of shooting victim Christopher [...] "Deacon" [...] Williamson, announced, [...] "I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that those raves continue… That is what I am going to do for Chris." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer added that [...] "even… former City Attorney Mark Sidran", whom they described as [...] "Seattle's best-known defender of underage dance restrictions," [...] said that [...] "Some tragedies defy any sort of rational response in terms of regulation because they're completely irrational events you can't really predict or prevent." ...|$|E
2500|$|STV {{differs from}} all other {{proportional}} representation systems in actual use in that representatives are [...] by the voters, and candidates of one party can be elected on transfers from voters for other parties. Hence, the use of STV may reduce the role of political parties in the electoral process and correspondingly partisanship in the resulting government. Unlike proportional representation systems employing party lists, voters in STV are not explicitly constrained by parties {{even when they do}} exist; voters may ignore candidate party labels and mix their preferred candidate rankings between parties. Similarly, candidates may achieve electoral success by obtaining a quota of voters not generally within their own party, perhaps by winning transfers from moderates or by championing a specific issue contrary to party doctrine. STV advocates argue that, by requiring a candidate to appeal to the supporters of other candidates for their second and further preferences, it reduces adversarial confrontation, and indeed, gives a substantial advantage to candidates that broaden their appeal by being not only collegial but as open-minded and flexible in their principles as they can manage. STV detractors <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a flaw, arguing that political parties should be able to structure public debate, mobilize and engage the electorate, and develop policy alternatives.|$|E
