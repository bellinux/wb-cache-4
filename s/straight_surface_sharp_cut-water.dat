40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a geometric model {{to be used}} as a framework for the description and analysis of threedimensional(3 D) elongated shapes. Elongated shapes can be decomposed into two different parts: a 3 D curve (the central axis) and a 3 D <b>surface</b> (the <b>straight</b> <b>surface).</b> The central axis is described in terms of curvature and torsion. A novel concept of torsion image is introduced which allows the user to study the torsion of some relevant 3 D structures such as the medulla of long bones, without computing the third derivative. The description of the <b>straight</b> <b>surface</b> is based on an ordered set of Fourier Descriptors (FDs), each set representing a 2 D slice of the structure. These descriptors possess completeness, continuity and stability properties, and some geometrical invariancies. A polar diagram is built which contains the anatomical information of the <b>straight</b> <b>surface</b> and can be used as a tool for the analysis and discrimination of 3 D structures. A technique for the reconstruction of the 3 D surface from the model's two components is presented. Various applications to the analysis of long bone structures, such as the ulna and radius, are derived from the model, namely, data compression, comparison of 3 D shapes, segmentation into 3 D primitives, and torsion and curvature analysis. The relevance of the method to morphometry and to clinical applications is discussed...|$|R

50|$|STM {{is based}} on the concept of quantum tunneling. When a {{conducting}} tip is brought very near to the surface to be examined, a bias (voltage difference) applied between the two can allow electrons to tunnel through the vacuum between them. The resulting tunneling current is a function of tip position, applied voltage, and the local density of states (LDOS) of the sample. Information is acquired by monitoring the current as the tip's position scans across the surface, and is usually displayed in image form. STM can be a challenging technique, as it requires extremely clean and stable <b>surfaces,</b> <b>sharp</b> tips, excellent vibration control, and sophisticated electronics, but nonetheless many hobbyists have built their own.|$|R
40|$|This work {{considers}} the adhesion of cells to a nanorough titanium implant <b>surface</b> with <b>sharp</b> edges. The basic {{assumption was that}} the attraction between the negatively charged titanium surface and a negatively charged osteoblast is mediated by charged proteins with a distinctive quadrupolar internal charge distribution. Similarly, cation-mediated attraction between fibronectin molecules and the titanium surface {{is expected to be}} more efficient for a high surface charge density, resulting in facilitated integrin mediated osteoblast adhesion. We suggest that osteoblasts are most strongly bound along the sharp convex edges or spikes of nanorough titanium surfaces where the magnitude of the negative surface charge density is the highest. It is therefore plausible that nanorough regions of titanium <b>surfaces</b> with <b>sharp</b> edges and spikes promote the adhesion of osteoblasts...|$|R

Real impact-response was captured using a suitable data acquisition system and fed into a standard finite element model. The solution was done using transient dynamic analysis. It was observed that crack with notch has a lower DSIF than that with <b>straight</b> <b>surface</b> crack. The efficacy of the model was validated by checking with the experimental results of DSIF available in literature...|$|R

The morphology, composition and sheet resistance of the germanosilicide layers are investigated as a function of Al percentage and annealing temperature.

50|$|Burrs in {{drilled holes}} cause {{fastener}} and material problems. Burrs cause more stress to be concentrated {{at the edges}} of holes, decreasing resistance to fracture and shortening fatigue life. They interfere with the seating of fasteners, causing damage to fastener or the assembly itself. Cracks caused by stress and strain can result in material failure. Burrs in holes also increase the risk of corrosion, which may be due to variations in the thickness of coatings on a rougher <b>surface.</b> <b>Sharp</b> corners tend to concentrate electrical charge, increasing the risk of static discharge. Burrs in moving parts increase unwanted friction and heat. Rough surfaces also result in problems with lubrication, as wear is increased at the interfaces of parts. This makes it necessary to replace them more frequently. Electrical charge buildup can cause corrosion.|$|R
