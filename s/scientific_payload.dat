25|$|The rover was {{scheduled}} to launch in 2018 and land on Mars in early 2019, but in May 2016 ESA announced that the launch would occur in 2020 due to delays in European and Russian industrial activities and deliveries of the <b>scientific</b> <b>payload.</b>|$|E

25|$|Icebreaker Life is a lander {{mission that}} {{proposed}} for NASA's Discovery Program for the 2021 launch opportunity, {{but it was}} not selected for development. It would have had a stationary lander that would be a near copy of the successful 2008 Phoenix and it would have carried an upgraded astrobiology <b>scientific</b> <b>payload,</b> including a 1-meter-long core drill to sample ice-cemented ground in the northern plains to conduct a search for organic molecules and evidence of current or past life on Mars. One of the key goals of the Icebreaker Life mission is to test the hypothesis that the ice-rich ground in the polar regions has significant concentrations of organics due to protection by the ice from oxidants and radiation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} smaller {{exposure}} facilities mounted directly to laboratory modules; the Kibō Exposed Facility {{serves as an}} external 'porch' for the Kibō complex, and a facility on the European Columbus laboratory provides power and data connections for experiments such as the European Technology Exposure Facility and the Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space. A remote sensing instrument, SAGE III-ISS, was delivered to the station in 2014 aboard a Dragon capsule, and the NICER experiment {{is scheduled to be}} delivered in 2016. The largest such <b>scientific</b> <b>payload</b> externally mounted to the ISS is the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), a particle physics experiment launched on STS-134 in May 2011, and mounted externally on the ITS.

25|$|Rosetta was {{launched}} on 2 March 2004 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana on an Ariane 5 rocket and reached Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 7 May 2014. It performed {{a series of}} maneuvers to enter orbit between then and 6 August 2014, when it became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet. (Previous missions had conducted successful flybys of seven other comets.) It was one of ESA's Horizon 2000 cornerstone missions. The spacecraft consisted of the Rosetta orbiter, which featured 12 instruments, and the Philae lander, with nine additional instruments. The Rosetta mission orbited Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko for 17 months and was designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted. The spacecraft was controlled from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. The planning for {{the operation of the}} <b>scientific</b> <b>payload,</b> together with the data retrieval, calibration, archiving and distribution, was performed from the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), in Villanueva de la Cañada, near Madrid, Spain.

40|$|One of {{the major}} tasks of Science Operation Centres of the European Space Agency is {{planning}} and coordinating the operational activities of the <b>scientific</b> <b>payloads</b> of ESA planetary missions such as Rosetta, SMART- 1 and Venus Express. To achieve the scientific objectives of these missions, {{it is necessary to}} analyse the availability of science opportunities in each phase of the mission and to select and prioritize the operations of the <b>scientific</b> <b>payloads</b> with respect to their corresponding scientific goals. The Science Operations Planning System (SOPS) is a set of new software tools, which is being developed at the Research and Scientific Support Department of ESA, {{in the context of a}} new generic and mission-independent concept for science operations planning. The reference implementation of this new system is, however, based on the ongoing ESA Moon mission, SMART- 1.

40|$|One of {{the major}} tasks of the SMART- 1 Science and Technology Operation Coordination of the European Space Agency is {{planning}} and coordinating the operational activities of the <b>scientific</b> <b>payloads</b> on SMART- 1. To fulfil the scientific objectives of this mission and to achieve an optimal scientific output, {{it is necessary to}} analyse the possible science opportunities in each phase of the mission and to select and prioritize the operations of the <b>scientific</b> <b>payloads</b> with respect to the corresponding scientific goals. The Science Operations Planning System, SOPS, is the name of a set of new, generic software tools, which is being developed at the Research and Scientific Support Department of ESA for this purpose and is being currently used on Smart- 1. It will help the science operation engineers and the payload teams by providing them with tools and information to ease and speed the process of decision making and planning. SOPS is composed of two major groups of components: The first group, the so called science operations knowledge base, provides the infrastructure to store all the relevant information about the operations of <b>scientific</b> <b>payloads</b> and various sophisticated interfaces to access this information through remote computers. The second group consists of a number of tools and clients, which access and use the information, contained in the knowledge base, to carry out different tasks such as analyzing/visualizing the possible science opportunities for <b>scientific</b> <b>payloads,</b> planning the communication passes and payload observations, archiving performed payload operations and generating interface documents and files for other existing planning tools at RSSD and for the flight control team. © 2006 by European Space Agency, ESA.
