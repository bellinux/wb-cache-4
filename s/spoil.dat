A time-varying gradient spoiler scheme compatible with RF <b>spoiling</b> is defined, in which spoiler gradients cycle through the vertices of a hexagon, which we call hexagonal <b>spoiling.</b> The method is compared with a traditional constant <b>spoiling</b> gradient both in the transition to and in the steady state.
