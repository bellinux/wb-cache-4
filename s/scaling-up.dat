25|$|Failures in <b>scaling-up</b> HIV {{prevention}} programmes {{have not}} been caused by an absence of policy, but rather, as with other countries, by there being no policy enforcement and timely scale-up. Although China has a strong central government, provincial {{and lower levels of}} government enjoy a great deal of autonomy, which has resulted in a mixed response and inconsistent enforcement of HIV/AIDS policy. For example, Yunnan province has shown strong support for implementation and advocacy of harm-reduction strategies that reduce HIV transmission in its many drug users, whereas Henan province had been slower to respond to the needs of former plasma donors {{in the early stages of}} the epidemic. Moreover, the distribution of HIV in China is not even, and is concentrated in areas with high drug use (e.g., Yunnan, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Sichuan) and in areas where people were infected through unsafe blood or plasma donation (e.g., Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, and Hubei). The number of cases ranges dramatically between provinces, with, for example, just 20 cases reported from Tibet but well over 40,000 in neighboring Yunnan. In provinces with an extremely low prevalence, it can be difficult for officials to see the need for HIV prevention and control.|$|E
500|$|Supermarionation, a {{technique}} {{in which the}} movement of the marionette puppet's mouth is electronically synchronised with character dialogue, had been formulated by Gerry Anderson for Four Feather Falls in 1960. Until production for Captain Scarlet, the head of the puppet had been disproportionately large in comparison to its body, as the head contained a solenoid that formed the key component of the lip-synch mechanism. The production team was not able to scale up the body to match the head, as this would have made the puppets hard to operate and have necessitated a proportionate <b>scaling-up</b> {{in the size of the}} puppet sets. Since Gerry Anderson had expressed frustration with this caricatured design during the production of earlier Supermarionation series, and wished that the puppets would more accurately reflect human biology, before production commenced on Captain Scarlet the producer, Reg Hill, and his associate, John Read, designed a new type of puppet in which the solenoid was instead placed inside the chest, to permit a head of realistic proportion. The costume designer for Captain Scarlet was Sylvia Anderson, who was influenced by the work of French fashion designer Pierre Cardin, in particular his 1966 [...] "Cosmonaut" [...] collection, in designing the Spectrum uniforms.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the final}} parts of the {{heuristics}} would be the <b>scaling-up</b> of the vibrating fluidized bed from laboratory scale to industrial scale. There are some factors which {{should be taken into}} consideration when proceeding with the <b>scaling-up.</b> One would be the energy consumption of an industrial scale vibrating fluidized bed. This is because a potential customer would want to know the requirements of the process. Therefore, individual energy consumption for each part of the vibrating fluidized bed should be taken into account. The same can be said about the vibrating fluidized bed when we look at it from an economical perspective. Most buyers of the vibrating fluidized bed would most likely use it for a process to achieve an income profit. Hence, a detail cost analysis should be done,. From an environmental point of view, there is not much to be worried off except for possible safety issues, because the vibrating fluidized bed itself is generally considered to be environmentally friendly due the fact that the waste produced are already treated in the process. Lastly, not forgetting the characteristics which may cause an effect when <b>scaling-up</b> such as voidage behaviour on particle size as mentioned earlier.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} battles with the Spaniards Mapuches had little success but with time the Mapuches of Arauco and Tucapel adapted by using horses and massing the large {{quantities}} of troops necessary to defeat the Spanish. Mapuches learned from the Spanish to build forts in hills, they also begun digging traps for Spanish horses, use helmets and wooden shields against arquebuses. Mapuche warfare evolved toward guerrilla tactics {{including the use of}} ambushes. The killing of Pedro de Valdivia in 1553 marked a rupture with the earlier ritual warfare tradition of the Mapuches.By the late 16th century a handful of Mapuche warlords had emerged near La Frontera as result of the constant Mapuche-Spanish warfare. Mapuche organization changed in response to the war and the aillarehue, a new macro-scale political unit consisting of several rehue, appeared in the late 16th century. This <b>scaling-up</b> of political organization continued until the early 17th century when the butalmapu emerged, each of these units grouped several aillarehues.

5000|$|Shugart (1997) {{was one of}} the ﬁrst authors {{that used}} the term EFT as “aggregated {{components}} of ecosystems whose interactions with one another and with the environment produce differences in patterns of ecosystem structure and dynamics”. Walker (1997) [...] proposed the use of a similar term, vegetation functional types, for groups of PFTs in sets that constitute the different states of vegetation succession in non-equilibrium ecosystems. The same term was applied by Scholes et al. (1997) [...] in a wider sense for those areas having similar ecological attributes, such as PFTs composition, structure, phenology, biomass or productivity. Several studies have applied hierarchy and patch dynamic theories [...] for the definition of ecosystem and landscape functional types at different spatial scales, by <b>scaling-up</b> emergent structural and functional properties from patches to regions. Valentini et al.
