50|$|For {{high speed}} and high power machines, {{a loss of}} {{lubricant}} can result in rapid bearing heating and damage due to friction. Also in dirty environments the oil can become contaminated with dust or debris that increases friction.

40|$|Thermal {{energy flow}} within the piston {{of an air}} cooled engine was {{investigated}} by measuring the heat flux in the engine cylinder liner {{in the region of}} travel of the piston rings. Engine sump oil temperature and oil viscosity were varied to change the piston ring heat flow by altering the oil film between the cylinder wall and piston ring. Engine load was varied to change heat flow into the piston. Also, the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>splash</b> cooling of the piston was varied to change heat flow leaving the piston. When sump oil temperature was reduced, more heat flowed to the cooler sump. Changes in oil viscosity had little effect on the cylinder wall heat flow but increased cylinder wall temperature due to an increase in frictional heating with lower oil viscosity. It was thus determined that this change in heat flow was due to the change in sump oil temperature and was not due to a change in oil film characteristics. A decrease in engine load decreased the average temperature and heat flux in the cylinder wall. The largest decrease in heat flux was on the exhaust side of the engine where the largest fraction of cylinder heat is convected to the external airflow. It was found that the change in heat flux caused by the decrease in engine load was likely due to a change in the piston ring pack heat flow. For changes in the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>splash</b> cooling of the piston, there were only small changes in average temperature and no changes in the heat flux. Although the piston was still believed to lose heat to the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>splash,</b> its percentage of piston heat loss was too small to affect piston ring pack heat flow. Superposition was evaluated for sump oil temperature and engine load as well as sump oil temperature and oil viscosity. In both cases, significant error was found with the linear superposition assumption. Linear superposition was assumed not to hold for these complex heat flows...|$|R

40|$|Long haul trucks spend (almost) 80 % {{of their}} time {{cruising}} from one destination to another. This means that they drive mostly at a constant speed and use their top gear most of the time. Depending on the gearbox, the top gear of long haul trucks is usually direct drive gear. With the direct drive gear losses mainly come from the interaction between lubricant and rotating gear (churning losses). It is obvious that using {{a small amount of}} low viscosity lubricant will reduce the churning losses dramatically. Unfortunately the solution is not as simple as that. This is because, besides lubrication, the lubricant is also there as a cooling agent. Hence, too little oil will affect the heat dissipation and the lifetime of the gear. Studies of oil flow inside the gearbox are needed to find ways to reduce churning losses and good heat dissipation. A simplified version of a gearbox is built to study the flow, due to the complexity of the real gearbox. The new gearbox consists of a gear pair and has transparent rectangular walls to ensure good optical access. Velocity measurements with particle image velocimetry (PIV) are made to get the velocity field around the gear. Flash photography is done, as additional data, to study the flow distribution. Finally, torque measurements are made to measure the losses. It was found in the PIV study that oil flow is dominated by a recirculation region. The recirculation is suspected to be the source of viscous losses. The oil flow inside the gearbox is highly three dimensional. Stereo-PIV has successfully revealed the third components of the flow. PIV measurements also reveal that the squeezing of the oil at the gear contact is considered minor compare to the losses due to recirculation. From flash photography, the <b>splash</b> pattern and <b>oil</b> distribution is studied. The oil distribution inside the gearbox is governed by a gear with a larger diameter. The larger diameter gear <b>splashes</b> more <b>oil</b> compared to the smaller one. This is most probably because the larger diameter gear is more immersed compared to the smaller diameter gear. Hence, the larger diameter gear drags more oil upward. Torque measurements show that the torque is dependent on the rotational speed, the immersion depth, and the oil properties. The oil properties are suspected to be changed when the oil is aerated, resulting in a higher torque reading...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The {{metalworker}} can {{be exposed}} to cutting oils during application by two basic routes of entry: skin contact and inhalation. The higher risk jobs tend to be those with high cutting speeds, heavy oil flow, and continuous contact, which may result in the worker being <b>splashed</b> with <b>oil</b> on the skin or clothing. The oil may remain on the skin {{for some time and}} oil-soaked clothing may be worn all shift. Cutting oils may be applied manually, by an air-carried mist, or by a continuous flood. When flooding is used, the oil is delivered by a pump, piping, and nozzle to the cutting zone. With this method the tool, work, and chip are flooded. (Used fluid is then collected in the chip pan and returned by gravity to the pump sump.) Inhalation of cutting oil mists may occur {{because of the nature of}} coolant delivery or because of the high temperatures and speeds generated at the cutting tool 2 ̆ 7 s working edge. When the mist stream method of coolant delivery is used, much of it evaporates on contact with the hot tool, workpiece or chip. In addition to the intentional production of oil mists, vaporized oil can also be generated by the forces of the rapidly spinning workpiece or tool, or by the vaporization of the fluid from the heat of the cutting process...|$|R
5000|$|Increased engine {{horsepower}} due to reduced viscous and air friction. In a wet-sump engine the crank shaft and other moving parts <b>splash</b> through the <b>oil</b> at thousands of RPM causing a [...] "hurricane that whips {{the oil in}} a wet-sump engine into an aerated froth like a milkshake in a blender". Additionally, in a wet-sump, each revolution generates minute amounts of parasitic power loss caused by viscous drag and air drag (or 'windage') as the parts move rapidly through the oil and air in the lower engine. At high RPM these small sources of drag compound dramatically, resulting in significant power loss. In a dry-sump, the scavenger pump removes the oil and therefore the source of viscous friction, but also creates an air vacuum that significantly reduces air-friction, thus freeing the moving parts of much viscous and air friction and allowing engine power output to increase.|$|R
50|$|By 1925 the {{vertical}} {{arrangement of the}} engine had been taken advantage of to improve steam porting and access for maintenance. The Super-Sentinel engine used two camshafts: inlet and exhaust, placed near the crankshaft in the crankcase and operating the poppet valves through long pushrods. In the original waggon engine, all four valves were mounted {{at the far end of}} the cylinder from the crankshaft, requiring long narrow ports to the other end of the cylinder. With the locomotives the easily accessed vertical engine allowed a pair of these valves to be moved to the lower end of the cylinder, allowing for a short, efficient port with less 'dead space'. The crankcase of the engine, together with the crosshead trunk guide, was enclosed and provided with <b>oil</b> <b>splash</b> lubrication. A small plenum was left exposed between the cylinder's piston rod stuffing box and another gland seal into the crankcase. This allowed any steam that did leak past the seals to be vented to the atmosphere, rather than condensing within the crankcase.|$|R
