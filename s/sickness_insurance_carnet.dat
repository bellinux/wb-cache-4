Furthermore, there is an analysis of the indicators of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance,</b> mainly temporary incapacity for work, which shows that despite the reduction of the average length of one case, the average percentage of incapacity for work is increasing.

25|$|Pupils, {{students}} {{and children in}} kindergartens were incorporated into the accident insurance scheme, which benefited 11 million children. Free medical checkups were introduced that same year, while the Farmers' <b>Sickness</b> <b>Insurance</b> Law (1972) introduced compulsory <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> for independent farmers, family workers in agriculture, and pensioners under the farmers' pension scheme, medical benefits for all covered groups, and cash benefits for family workers under compulsory coverage for pension insurance.

This law also introduced a new type of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefit, namely facilities for the early diagnosis of disease. Apart from the discretionary service of disease prevention which had existed since 1923, insured persons now had a right in certain circumstances to medical examinations aimed at the early diagnosis of disease.

Insurance utilization is in both cases defined as being ill for more than 14 days. The results indicate, in general, that individuals do not use <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> because of their commuting time. However, commuting time seems to increase the risk of being on sick leave among females with relatively low annual wage earnings.

40|$|The {{area of a}} <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance,</b> I {{have chosen}} for my diploma thesis, is not only {{important}} for me {{in terms of my}} working life, but as well as for my private life, because a temporary working incapacity and a title for <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits accompanies a life of each of us, either directly in our family circle or among friends or colleagues. The working incapacity, as a social event, is familiar to all of us. Someone meets it more often, someone less often, however it always influences our private as well as working life from a financial perspective, it has an impact on our working duties and it strikes our family groove. At the same time it has a very human dimension, since it concerns the most valuable we have ? it is our health. It deepens solidarity among people, mutual support and empathy. I have chosen the above topic also for the reason that I had already been working {{in the area of the}} <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> for five years. I am interested whether there have been met the main objectives from the new legislation especially in terms of savings in financial means, a decrease of a number of temporary incapacities and a prevention of a misusage of the temporary working incapacities. The main aim of this thesis is to analyze individual areas of an implementation of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> and on the basis of obtained results and statistical data to evaluate whether the main objectives of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> legislation from January 1 st, 2009 in the region of Jindřichův Hradec were met. Three hypotheses were presented in the thesis. The first premise said that with the effectiveness of this law financial means had spent on the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits had been saved. The second premise was a decrease of the temporary incapacities and the third proven one was the meeting of the main objectives of the legislation in the whole implementation range of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> in the region of Jindřichův Hradec. Two research methods were chosen; an analysis of documents, a technique of a secondary analysis and a content analysis. The second method was a semi-structured interview with professionals in the area of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance.</b> Defined hypotheses were confirmed by the carried out research. Financial means spent on the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits were saved very dramatically already in the first half of the effectiveness of this law and the number of temporary incapacities decreased by one third of cases in that period. The third hypothesis was also confirmed by both chosen research methods and defined objectives of the new legislation were met in the region of Jindřichův Hradec. The defined aims of the diploma thesis were achieved, hypotheses were verified, there were mentioned important remarks and changes and provisions, which would lead to another streamlining of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> system, were proposed.
