The proteins exhibit high thermal and thermodynamic stability (denaturation midpoint: usually equilibrium unfolding: ∆G > 9.5 kcal/mol) increasing with increasing repeat number.

5000|$|Oxygenation {{and mixing}} of liquid {{cultures}} further depend on {{rotation of the}} liquid [...] "in-phase", meaning the synchronous movement of the liquid with the shaker table. Under certain conditions the shaking process leads to a breakdown of liquid motion - called [...] "out-of-phase phenomenon". This phenomenon has been intensively characterized for <b>shake</b> <b>flask</b> bioreactors. Out-of-phase conditions {{are associated with a}} strong decrease in mixing performance, oxygen transfer, and power input. Main factor for out-of-phase operation is the viscosity of the culture medium, but also the vessel diameter, low filling levels and/or a high number of baffles.|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of the culture vessel on the glycosylation profile of the mAb produced by CHO cells in microcarriers was also considered in this work, by comparing vented conical tubes with <b>shake</b> <b>flasks.</b> The culture vessel was highly influential particularly in the sialylation levels of the mAb, which abruptly decreased to practically absent sialylation in <b>shake</b> <b>flasks,</b> predicting a positive outcome on mAb biological activity. Additionally, <b>shake</b> <b>flasks</b> seem to provide a less heterogeneity of glycoforms, {{as demonstrated by the}} lowest number of peaks obtained (11 peaks, Table[*] 3). Since cell concentrations are highly improved in <b>shake</b> <b>flasks</b> when compared to the vented conical tube cultures, it is possible that these improved levels, or the factors that led to them (e.g. better oxygenation and mass transfer), have caused these modifications on sialylation and heterogeneity.|$|R
30|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the effect of}} pH on biomass formation and mycotoxin production experiments were performed in <b>shaking</b> <b>flasks</b> and in a bioreactor. In <b>shaking</b> <b>flasks</b> pH cannot be controlled and it varies over cultivation time but biomass formation can be monitored because each sample consists of a completely harvested <b>shaking</b> <b>flask.</b> In contrast to this, experiments in a bioreactor are highly reproducible with very low standard deviations between single experiments but biomass formation cannot be monitored due to inhomogeneous dispersion of fungal mycelium in the culture broth. The pH was kept constant in bioreactor fermentations due to titration with NaOH and H 3 PO 4.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} about the scaling up for {{production}} of poly-βhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from <b>shake</b> <b>flask</b> to 20 liter stirred tank fermenter. This scale-up operation used the method of constant volumetric transfer coefficient (K L a) of oxygen. K L a values were derived by fitting the dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) versus time on computer with two unknowns, namely K L a and the electrode mass transfer coefficient (Kap) of oxygen. The stirrer speed (RPM) and the air flow rate (A) in the 20 liter fermenter that produce the value of K L a found in the <b>shake</b> <b>flask</b> was approximated using {{trial and error method}} which is 200 rpm for both scale. A fermentation run in 20 liter fermenter using these values of rpm and A gave a PHB yield comparable to that achieved in <b>shake</b> <b>flask.</b> From the research work, the K L a for 500 ml <b>shake</b> <b>flask</b> and 20 l stirred tank fermenter were 0. 2809 and 0. 2564 respectively.

The <b>shake</b> <b>flask</b> method was used for extremely hydrophilic or hydrophobic compounds with a Kpart values greater than 100 and less than 0. 01.
