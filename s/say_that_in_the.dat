25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today, which makes purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations very difficult; however, some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century BC a drachma had a rough value of 25 U.S. dollars (in the year 1990 – equivalent to 46.50 USD in 2015), whereas classical historians regularly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heyday of ancient Greece (the fifth and fourth centuries) the daily wage for a skilled worker or a hoplite was one drachma, and for a heliast (juror) half a drachma since 425BC.|$|E
25|$|May we not <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fortuitous {{combination}} of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures could survive in whose organizations {{a certain degree of}} adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to give even rough comparative values for money from before the 20th century, as the range of products and services available for purchase was different. Classical historians often <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire (~27BC) the daily wage for an unskilled laborer and common soldier was 1 denarius (with no tax deductions) or about US$2.8 in bread. During the republic (509–27 BC), legionary pay was 112.5 denarii per year (0.3/day), later doubled by Julius Caesar to 225 denarii (0.6/day), with soldiers having {{to pay for their}} own food and arms. Centurions received considerably higher pay; under Augustus, the lowest rank of centurion was paid 3,750 denarii and the highest rank, 15,000 denarii.|$|E
25|$|According to the temple's own records, Sugimoto-dera {{was founded}} in 734 by priest Gyōki on orders by Emperor Shōmu, and is {{therefore}} the oldest of Kamakura's temples, predating the shogunate by half a millennium. The records <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 8th century priest Gyōki was crossing the Kantō region on foot when he saw Kamakura from Mount Taizō (the Taizōzan in the temple's name) and decided to leave there a statue of goddess Kannon. He then carved and enshrined it himself. Later in 734, Emperor Shōmu {{was told by the}} goddess herself to build here a temple (the Hon-dō). Later, the temple was restored by Ennin (794–864), and Eshin Sōzu Genshin (942–1017) enshrined in it a statue of Eleven-faced Kannon, an event that made the temple surge to Number one of the Sanjusankasho pilgrimage circuit.|$|E
25|$|One {{could even}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years before 1780 the {{prospects}} of the economy were improving: {{because of the economic}} growth in the German hinterland there were possibilities of growth in distributional trade in colonial commodities, and industrial products (Dutch or other European). Such possibilities were indeed realized in the 20th century, when the Netherlands again became a major distributional hub. The agricultural sector still enjoyed high productivity, whereas the nearby British markets for dairy products and produce offered opportunities for increased exports (which were indeed soon realized). Only, the high-cost structure of the labor market, high taxes, structural overvaluation of the guilder, all militated against most forms of industrial production, let alone export industries. Without the necessary reforms to remedy these problems the Netherlands were unlikely to participate in the industrial renaissance that Great Britain, and later other neighboring countries, started to experience {{in the latter part of}} the 18th century.|$|E

500|$|England's next match pitted {{them against}} the United States—an {{opponent}} {{they were expected to}} easily overcome—at the Estádio Independência in Belo Horizonte, [...] inland. The selectors again picked Ramsey, but left star winger Stanley Matthews out on the grounds that England could beat the Americans without him, ignoring Winterbottom's protests. England dominated the first half. [...] "I'm not making excuses when I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 45 minutes we had a year's bad luck," [...] Ramsey wrote in 1952. [...] "Shots which appeared certain to score missed by the width of a coat of paint. The American goalkeeper, much to his astonishment, found himself stopping the ball with his body, and on occasions his face, without really knowing what it was all about." [...] The US grabbed a shock lead on 37 minutes when a long shot towards England's penalty area flew into the net off the head of American forward Joe Gaetjens.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} , author J.

[...] He {{goes on to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> song Madonna tells the subject of her unrequited love to take a bow for [...] "rendering a great, transparent performance in life and love." [...] Alongside the betrayal of her lover, the lyrics also talk about Madonna {{trying to understand the}} reasons behind adultery. As the song progresses, the listener realizes that through the lyrics the singer was talking about herself—"One lonely star and you don't know who you are". According to Musicnotes.com, the song has a moderate calypso feel and is set in the time signature of common time and progresses in 80 beats per minute. The composition is set in the key of A major with Madonna's vocal ranging from E3 to C5. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] contains a basic sequence of A–Bm7/E–A–Fmaj7 during the opening strings, and A–A/G–Fm7 during the verses as its chord progression.|$|E

This was a reference to increasing pressure from the Gauleiters (regional Nazi Party leaders) in Germany for the Jews {{to be removed from}} their areas to allow accommodation for Germans made homeless by Allied bombing, as well as to make space for laborers being imported from occupied countries. The [...] "evacuated" [...] Jews, he said, would first be sent to [...] "transit ghettos" [...] in the General Government, from which they would be transported eastward. Heydrich said that to avoid legal and political difficulties, it was important to define who was a Jew for the purposes of [...] "evacuation". He outlined categories of people who would not be killed. Jews over 65 years old, and Jewish World War I veterans who had been severely wounded or who had won the Iron Cross, might be sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp instead of being killed. [...] "With this expedient solution," [...] he said, [...] "in one fell swoop many interventions will be prevented." ...|$|E
500|$|Montgomery {{went on to}} {{say that}} the video is full of [...] "temptation, love and lust," [...] and [...] "about {{distance}} and the effect it has on all those things."

The only problem is he can't." [...] At the end of the video, Lenoir has enough, and walks out. Montgomery notes that it is not clear whether Usher even makes it home, or if the song was even referring to the wife character, and not [...] "someone special stashed in a nearby suite." [...] In resolving the video's review, Montgomery said, [...] "Distance may make the heart grow fonder, but there are limits to everything. Usher may want to be no place but home, but there's a big, wide world out there with pitfalls aplenty. He's a superstar, a businessman, a father and an (ex-) husband, but at the end of the day, Ush is also human, and [...] "Hey Daddy" [...] is proof of that."
