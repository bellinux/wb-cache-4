5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, <b>semi-desert</b> regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
5|$|Mecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments {{although}} a few species are found in <b>semi-desert</b> habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like fleas. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. They mostly breed among mosses, in leaf litter and other moist places, but their reproductive habits have been little studied, {{and at least one}} species, Nannochorista philpotti, has aquatic larvae.|$|E
5|$|N. nigricollis usually inhabits savanna and <b>semi-desert</b> {{regions of}} Africa. However, {{they can be}} found at altitudes up to , as well as in {{tropical}} and subtropical regions of central Africa in moist savanna and cleared former forest regions, particularly near rivers and streams. Adaptable snakes, Naja n.nigricollis occurs in southeastern Nigeria where their habitat has been transformed from rainforest to man-made farmlands, plantations, suburban areas, and a few fragmented forests. This species of cobra has found advantages in the drastic changes which have taken place in Nigeria's rainforests. A study by herpetologist Luca Luiselli suggests this snake now forages in much drier microhabitats.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts {{in the spring}} and early summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% of the flow above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered <b>semi-desert.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Santa Ana {{drainage}} basin has {{a diversity of}} terrain, ranging from high peaks of inland mountains {{in the north and}} east, to the hot, dry interior and <b>semi-desert</b> basins of the Inland Empire, to the flat coastal plain of Orange County. Although it includes areas of alpine and highland forest, the majority of the watershed consists of arid desert and chaparral environments. Due to low regional rainfall, the river carries only a small flow except during the brief winter season, when it is prone to massive flash floods. The San Jacinto River, which drains the southern half of the watershed, rarely reaches the Santa Ana except in extremely wet years. However, a wide variety of animal and plant communities depend on the riparian zones and remnant wetlands along the Santa Ana River.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River {{watershed}} {{includes a}} diversity of vegetation zones both past and present. A majority of the watershed was once covered with shrub-steppe grassland, most common in the Snake River Plain and also the Columbia Plateau in southeastern Washington. Riparian zones, wetlands and marshes once occurred {{along the length of}} the Snake River and its tributaries. In higher elevations, conifer forests, of which ponderosa pine is most common, dominate the landscape. The basin ranges from <b>semi-desert</b> to alpine climates, providing habitat for hundreds of species of plants. In the lowermost part of the watershed, in southeastern Washington, the Snake River is surrounded by an area called the Columbia Plateau Ecoprovince, which is now mostly occupied by irrigated farms. The rest of the Plateau area is characterized by low hills, dry lakes, and an arid, nearly desert climate.|$|E

50|$|Athrips kostjuki is a moth of the Gelechiidae family. It {{is found}} in Russia (Tuva). The habitat {{consists}} of <b>semi-deserts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} habit is dry {{open country}} including <b>semi-deserts.</b> The nest {{is on the}} ground, with 4-6 eggs being laid.|$|R
5|$|The species dwells in semi-deserts, savannah, open woodland, dense dry woodland, and mountainous forests up to 4,000m in altitude. It {{is scarce}} or absent in {{tropical}} rainforests and coastal areas. Its preferred habitats in west Africa include the Guinea and Sudan savannahs, and is absent in the belt of dense coastal forest. In the Namib Desert, {{it occurs in}} riverine growth along seasonal rivers, the sub-desertic pro-Namib and the adjoining inland plateau. In ideal habitats, the spotted hyena outnumbers other large carnivores, including other hyena species. However, the striped and brown hyena occur at greater densities than the spotted species in desert and <b>semi-desert</b> regions. Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per km2.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are divided}} over whether climate change, hunting, or a {{combination}} of the two, drove the extinction of the Columbian mammoths. According to the climate change hypothesis, warmer weather led to the shrinking of suitable habitat for Columbian mammoths, which turned from parkland to forest, grassland and <b>semi-desert,</b> with less diverse vegetation. The overkill hypothesis, on the other hand, attributes the extinction to hunting by humans. This idea was first proposed by Paul S. Martin in 1967; more recent research on this subject have varied in their conclusions. A 2002 study concluded that the archaeological record did not support the overkill hypothesis, given that only 14 Clovis sites (12 with mammoth remains and two with mastodon remains) out of 76 examined provided strong evidence of hunting. In contrast, a 2007 study found that the Clovis record indicated the highest frequency of prehistoric exploitation of proboscideans for subsistence in the world, and supported the overkill hypothesis. Whatever the actual cause of extinction, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} boobook {{is found}} across Australia, although is scarce in more arid regions such as western New South Wales, southwestern and western Queensland, much of South Australia {{away from the}} coast and interior Western Australia and Northern Territory. In drier areas it is generally found along watercourses such as the Darling and Paroo Rivers, and Lake Eyre basin. It is found on numerous offshore islands such as Groote Eylandt, Melville Island, Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and many islands off eastern Australia. It is found in southern New Guinea, Roti, Timor and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is found {{in a wide range}} of habitats, from forest and open woodland to scrubland and <b>semi-desert</b> areas. In Australia it resides in mainly Eucalypt forests. It has adapted to landscapes altered by human activity and is found in farmland and suburban areas as long as there are some scattered trees. In fact, it can adapt to any habitat as long as there are some trees present.|$|E
