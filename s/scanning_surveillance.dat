40|$|AbstractPurpose: In {{this study}} we {{assessed}} the costs and clinical outcomes of duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> {{during the first year}} after infrainguinal autologous vein bypass grafting surgery and compared duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance,</b> ankle-brachial index surveillance, and clinical follow-up. Methods: In a clinical study, 293 patients (mean age, 70. 1 years; 58. 7 % men) with peripheral arterial disease were observed in a duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> program after infrainguinal autologous vein bypass grafting surgery. Costs were calculated from the health care perspective for surveillance and subsequent interventions from 30 days to 1 year postoperatively. All costs are presented in 1995 US dollars per patient. In a simulation model, we estimated the costs and amputations of duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance,</b> ankle-brachial index surveillance, and clinical follow-up conditional on the indication for surgery. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost per major amputation per patient avoided during the first postoperative year. Results: Duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> was the least expensive ($ 2823) and resulted in the fewest major amputations (17 per 1000 patients examined), compared with ankle-brachial index surveillance ($ 5411 and 77 amputations per 1000 patients) and clinical follow-up ($ 5072 and 77 amputations per 1000 patients). In patients treated for critical limb ischemia, duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> was the least expensive ($ 2974) and resulted in the fewest major amputations (19 per 1000 patients). Under all surveillance programs, 13 major amputations per 1000 patients treated for intermittent claudication were performed, and clinical follow-up had the lowest costs ($ 1577). In a sensitivity analysis that assumed that duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> could have avoided six major amputations per 1000 patients treated for intermittent claudication compared with the other programs, duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> had an incremental cost of $ 80, 708 per major amputation per patient avoided compared with clinical follow-up. Conclusion: Duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> is highly effective for patients treated for critical limb ischemia, leading to a reduction of major amputations and consequently to a reduction in costs compared with other surveillance programs. In patients treated for intermittent claudication, the evidence supporting duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> is less firm, but if duplex scan can avoid six major amputations per 1000 patients examined, the incremental costs are justified.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) is {{a common}} disease in cattle and wildlife, with an impact on animal and human health, and economic implications. Infected wild animals have been detected in some European countries, and bTB reservoirs in wildlife have been identified, potentially hindering the eradication of bTB from cattle populations. However, the surveillance of bTB in wildlife involves several practical difficulties and is not currently covered by EU legislation. We report here the first assessment of {{the sensitivity of the}} bTB surveillance system for free-ranging wildlife launched in France in 2011 (the Sylvatub system), based on scenario tree modelling. Three surveillance system components were identified: (i) passive <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> for hunted wild boar, red deer and roe deer, based on carcass examination, (ii) passive surveillance on animals found dead, moribund or with abnormal behaviour, for wild boar, red deer, roe deer and badger and (iii) active surveillance for wild boar and badger. The application of these three surveillance system components depends on the geographic risk of bTB infection in wildlife, which in turn depends on the prevalence of bTB in cattle. We estimated the effectiveness of the three components of the Sylvatub surveillance system quantitatively, for each species separately. Active surveillance and passive <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> by carcass examination were the approaches most likely to detect at least one infected animal in a population with a given design prevalence, regardless of the local risk level and species considered. The awareness of hunters, which depends on their training and the geographic risk, was found to affect surveillance sensitivity. The results obtained are relevant for hunters and veterinary authorities wishing to determine the actual efficacy of wildlife bTB surveillance as a function of geographic area and species, and could provide support for decision-making processes concerning the enhancement of surveillance strategies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background New and {{emerging}} diseases of livestock may impact animal welfare, trade and public health. Early detection of outbreaks {{can reduce the}} impact of these diseases by triggering control measures that limit the number of cases that occur. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether prospective spatiotemporal methods could be used to identify outbreaks of new {{and emerging}} diseases in <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> data. SaTScan was used to identify clusters of unusually high levels of submissions where a diagnosis could not be reached (DNR) using different probability models and baselines. The clusters detected were subjected to a further selection process to reduce the number of false positives and a more detailed epidemiological analysis to ascertain whether they were likely to represent real outbreaks. Results 187, 925 submissions of clinical material from cattle were made to the Regional Laboratory of the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) between 2002 and 2007, and the results were stored on the VLA FarmFile database. 16, 925 of these were classified as DNRs and included in the analyses. Variation in the number and proportion of DNRs was found between syndromes and regions, so a spatiotemporal analysis for each DNR syndrome was done. Six clusters were identified using the Bernoulli model after applying selection criteria (e. g. size of cluster). The further epidemiological analysis revealed that one of the systemic clusters could plausibly have been due to Johne's disease. The remainder were either due to misclassification or not consistent with a single diagnosis. Conclusions Our analyses have demonstrated that spatiotemporal methods can be used to detect clusters of new or emerging diseases, identify clusters of known diseases that may not have been diagnosed and identify misclassification in the data, and highlighted the impact of data quality on the ability to detect outbreaks. Spatiotemporal methods should be used alongside current temporal methods for analysis of <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> data. These statistical analyses should be followed by further investigation of possible outbreaks to determine whether cases have common features suggesting that these are likely to represent real outbreaks, or whether issues with the collection or processing of information have resulted in false positives. </p...|$|E

40|$|After {{arterial}} reconstruction, {{patients have}} traditionally been followed up in clinic in the long term. We have pursued a policy of limited clinic follow-up, with an 'open access' service for suspected graft failure (and latterly duplex <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> for vein grafts). This policy was assessed by measurement {{of the success of}} self-referral, graft patency and patient satisfaction after operation for lower limb ischaemia in 173 patients. At median follow-up of 50 months, 61 (35 %) patients had died and 45 (25 %) had required amputation. Of those with salvaged limbs and available for follow-up, 55 (86 %) patients reported continuing symptomatic improvement with a graft patency rate of 80 %. During the review period, 27 (42 %) patients had presented themselves on suspicion of graft occlusion and 14 (52 %) of these had required surgical intervention. Of the patients, 45 (70 %) found a single postoperative clinic visit helpful, and the majority thought that further visits would not have been helpful to them. Limited clinic appointments seem especially desirable for elderly patients for whom journeys are an imposition, as well as reducing travel costs, and giving surgeons more time to deal with new referrals. These results suggest that properly educated patients present themselves when signs of graft occlusion occur, and there is little to be gained by regular long-term clinic follow-up in vascular surgical practice...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeWe {{compared}} {{outcome and}} durability of carotid stent-assisted angioplasty (CAS) with open surgical repair (ie, repeat carotid endarterectomy [CEA]) to treat recurrent carotid stenosis (RCS). MethodsA retrospective review of anatomic and neurologic outcomes {{was carried out}} after 27 repeat CEA procedures (1993 - 2002) and 52 CAS procedures (1997 - 2002) performed to treat high-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) RCS after CEA. The incidence of intervention because of symptomatic RCS was similar (repeat CEA, 63 %; CAS, 60 %), but the interval from primary CEA to repeat intervention was greater (P. 1). All duplex ultrasound scans obtained within 3 months after CEA and CAS demonstrated patent ICA and velocity spectra of less than 50 % stenosis. During follow-up, no repeat CEA (mean, 39 months) or CAS (mean, 26 months) repair demonstrated ICA occlusion, but two patients (8 %) who underwent repeat CEA and 4 patients (8 %) who underwent CAS required balloon or stent angioplasty because of 80 % RCS. At last follow-up, no patient had ipsilateral stroke and all ICA remain patent. At duplex scanning, stenosis-free (< 50 % diameter reduction) ICA patency at 36 months was 75 % after repeat CEA and 57 % after CAS (P =. 26, log-rank test). ConclusionsCarotid angioplasty for treatment of high-grade stenotic ICA after CEA resulted in similar anatomic and neurologic outcomes compared with open surgical repair. Most lesions are amenable to endovascular therapy, and CAS enabled treatment in patients judged not to be suitable surgical candidates.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis or M. caprae has recently (re-) emerged in livestock and wildlife in all countries bordering Switzerland (CH) and the Principality of Liechtenstein (FL). Comprehensive data for Swiss and Liechtenstein wildlife {{are not available}} so far, although two native species, wild boar (Sus scrofa) and red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus), act as bTB reservoirs elsewhere in continental Europe. Our aims were (1) to assess the occurrence of bTB in these wild ungulates in CH/FL and to reinforce <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> in all wild mammals; (2) to evaluate {{the risk of a}} future bTB reservoir formation in wild boar and red deer in CH/FL. Tissue samples collected from 2009 to 2011 from 434 hunted red deer and wild boar and from eight diseased ungulates with tuberculosis-like lesions were tested by direct real-time PCR and culture to detect mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Identification of suspicious colonies was attempted by real-time PCR, genotyping and spoligotyping. Information on risk factors for bTB maintenance within wildlife populations was retrieved from the literature and the situation regarding identified factors was assessed for our study areas.

40|$|<b>Scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency {{revealed}} {{the emergence of}} suspected botulism in ruminants in 2003, presented as flaccid paralysis. From 2003 to 2009, 168 cattle and 19 sheep incidents were recorded, with mortality between 5 and 80 per cent. All sheep incidents and 95 per cent of cattle incidents had proximity to broiler litter. From July 2006, the gut contents collected from 74 affected cattle and 10 affected sheep were tested for Clostridium botulinum toxins using mice bioassays and for organisms by culture. Type D toxin was identified in 32 per cent of cattle and 18 per cent of sheep samples. C botulinum type D organisms were identified in 40 per cent of cattle and 30 per cent of sheep samples, but broth from one sample reacted with C and D antisera. Type C botulism has previously been reported more commonly than type D in the UK and {{has been associated with}} the use of poultry litter as fertiliser, bedding or feed. The almost exclusive association with C botulinum type D toxins or organisms in the gut contents in this survey suggests a change in the source or epidemiology of botulism in the UK. The source of C botulinum type D was uncertain. Broilers may carry C botulinum type D in their gut flora subclinically. The emergence of a new type D strain, or changes in broiler husbandry and nutrition, medication and other enteric infections may have affected colonisation with C botulinum.

A total of 2, 753 incidents of 57 different serovars were reported. The five most prevalent serovars were S. Typhimurium (20. 8 %), S. Newport (14. 7 %), S. Derby (10. 6 %), S. Indiana (8. 3 %) and S. Agona (6. 4 %). S. Typhimurium reports peaked {{in the mid to}} late 1990 s; this occurred in parallel with the S. Typhimurium DT 104 epidemic in other livestock species. S. Enteritidis reports peaked in mid to late 1990 s, followed by a considerable decrease after 2000, which was also noted in flocks of domestic fowl. S. Newport, S. Montevideo, S. Senftenberg and S. Binza occurred in marked clusters indicating that they were introduced into one or more flocks at a certain time, i. e. via contaminated feed or infected day old chicks. A proportion of 43. 1 % of the reported Salmonella isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial while 17. 7 % were multi-resistant. No isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin or to the third generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime. Resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamide compounds and tetracycline was common and it was mainly a characteristic of S. Typhimurium DT 104 compared to S.

40|$|Surveillance for new {{emerging}} {{animal diseases}} from a European perspective {{is complicated by}} the non-harmonised approach across Member States for data capture, recording livestock populations and case definitions. In the summer of 2011, a new vector-borne Orthobunyavirus emerged in Northern Europe and for the first time, a coordinated approach to horizon scanning, risk communication, data and diagnostic test sharing allowed EU Member States to develop early predictions of the disease, its impact and risk management options. There are many different systems in place across the EU for syndromic and <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> and the differences in these systems have presented epidemiologists and risk assessors with concerns about their combined use in early identification of an emerging disease. The emergence of a new disease always will raise challenging issues around lack of capability and lack of knowledge; however, Schmallenberg virus (SBV) gave veterinary authorities an additional complex problem: the infection caused few clinical signs in adult animals, with no indication of the possible source and little evidence about its spread or means of transmission. This paper documents the different systems in place in some of the countries (Germany and the Netherlands) which detected disease initially and predicted its spread (to the UK) and how information sharing helped to inform early warning and risk assessment for Member States. Microarray technology was used to identify SBV as a new pathogen and data from the automated cattle milking systems coupled with farmer-derived data on reporting non-specific clinical signs gave the first indications of a widespread issue while the UK used meteorological modelling to map disease incursion. The coordinating role of both EFSA and the European Commission were vital as are the opportunities presented by web-based publishing for disseminating information to industry and the public.

Food Standards Agency (FSA) data in Great Britain are not currently used for surveillance purposes. There are concerns that the sensitivity of detection, combined with other issues, may make the outputs unreliable. In this study we postulate that FSA data could be used for surveillance purposes. To test this we compared FSA data with BPHS (a targeted surveillance system of slaughtered pigs) and laboratory diagnostic <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> (FarmFile) data, from mid- 2008 to mid- 2012, for respiratory conditions and tail bite lesions in pigs at population level. We also evaluated the agreement/correlation at batch level between FSA and BPHS inspections in four field trials during 2013. Temporal trends and regional differences at population level were described and compared using logistic regression models. Population temporal analysis showed an increase in respiratory disease in all datasets but with regional differences. For tail bite, the temporal trend and monthly patterns were completely different between the datasets. The field trials were run in three abattoirs and included 322 batches. Pearson's correlation and Cohen's kappa tests were used to assess correlation/agreement between inspections systems. It was moderate to strong for high prevalence conditions but slight for low prevalence conditions. We conclude that there is potential to use FSA data as a component of a surveillance system to monitor temporal trends and regional differences of chosen indicators at population level. At producer level and for low prevalence conditions it needs further improvement. Overall a number of issues still need to be addressed in order to provide the pig industry with the confidence to base their decisions on these FSA inspection data. Similar conclusions, at national level, may apply to other livestock sectors but require further evaluation of the inspection and data collection processes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: We {{undertook}} this prospective evaluation {{to define}} the direct hemodynamic impact of vein graft stenoses and to correlate intraoperative hemodynamic findings with the preoperative duplex scan. Methods: Twelve consecutive isolated vein graft stenoses were identified in the vascular laboratory during our routine duplex <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> protocol over 10 months. Peak systolic flow velocity ratios (PSFVRs; velocity within stenosis/velocity proximal to the stenosis) at the stenoses ranged from 2. 7 to 10 (mean, 5. 5), and ankle-brachial indexes ranged from 0. 47 to 0. 94 (mean, 0. 68) Preoperative arteriograms were obtained and confirmed the isolated stenoses, which radiographically ranged from 20 % to 83 % diameter reduction (mean, 64 %). At the time of surgery the stenotic graft segment was isolated, and simultaneous pressure measurements proximal and distal to the graft stenosis were measured, along with ultrasound transit-time blood flow measurements. Pressure and flow wave forms were recorded for 10 seconds at 200 Hz and were stored on a personal computer–based digital acquisition system. The graft stenoses were then repaired with either a vein patch or short interposition graft, and the hemodynamic measurements were repeated. Fourier transformation of the pressure and flow curves was performed, and the resistance and longitudinal impedance were calculated for each graft segment. Results: Before repair, mean pressure gradients across the stenotic graft segments (ΔP) ranged from 1. 0 to 74. 6 mm Hg (mean, 20. 4 mm Hg), and vein graft flow ranged from 4. 9 to 140 ml/min (mean, 45. 2 ml/min). After repair of the stenotic segments, the mean pressure gradient was decreased to a mean of 1. 3 mm Hg, and vein graft flow increased to a mean of 104. 8 ml/min. The PSFVR recorded in the vascular laboratory correlated significantly with ΔP (r = 0. 71; p = 0. 01) and allowed prediction of ΔP as: ΔP = 7. 4 (PSFVR) – 19. 8. PSFVR also correlated with measured resistance across the stenosis (r = 0. 79; p = 0. 004). Conversely, the angiographic measurement of stenosis did not correlate significantly with these parameters. The angiographic measurement of stenosis showed a moderate correlation with the PSFVR (r = 0. 58; p = 0. 046). Conclusions: The PSFVR, as measured in the laboratory, is an accurate and useful indicator of the hemodynamic impact of vein graft stenosis. Revision of stenotic vein graft segments resulted in a significant improvement in graft hemodynamics. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 25 : 1016 - 22. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} appropriate timing and frequency of duplex ultrasound scanning after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) {{for the detection of}} high-grade stenosis caused by recurrent carotid stenosis or contralateral atherosclerotic disease progression. Methods: In 221 patients who underwent 242 CEAs, duplex scanning was performed before, during, and after operation (in 3 -month to 6 -month intervals). High-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (peak systolic velocity, > 300 cm/s; diastolic velocity, > 125 cm/s; ICA/common carotid artery ratio, > 4) prompted the recommendation for repair. An average of four postoperative scanning procedures was performed during a mean follow-up period of 27. 4 months. Results: Intraoperative duplex scan results prompted the immediate revision of 12 repairs (4. 9 %), and one perioperative stroke (50 % diameter-reduction [DR]; systolic velocity, > 125 cm/s) develop. Only one of six patients had > 75 % DR stenosis develop and underwent reoperation (75 % DR stenosis was five times as frequent (P =. 002) in patients with > 50 % DR stenosis initially. All patients but one who required contralateral endarterectomy for disease progression had > 50 % ICA stenosis when first seen. During the follow-up period, no disabling strokes ipsilateral to an operated carotid artery occurred, but three strokes occurred in the hemisphere of the contralateral unoperated ICA. Conclusion: The yield of duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> after CEA was low. Only 13 patients (5. 9 %) had severe disease develop to warrant additional intervention. Progression of contralateral disease rather than restenosis was the most common abnormality that was identified.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Duplex {{surveillance}} of lower extremity reversed vein bypass grafts (LERVG) {{is a means}} of identifying patients at risk for occlusion. The perceived accuracy of duplex scan as a means of identifying stenoses has led many surgeons to perform graft revision on the basis of duplex scan alone. This may result in missing additional lesions that are threatening patency. To assess the role of duplex scan as the sole imaging method before revision of LERVGs, we reviewed consecutive patients undergoing revisions who underwent preoperative arteriography after identification of duplex scan abnormalities. Methods: Duplex scan results, operative reports, and preoperative arteriograms for patients undergoing LERVG revision from January 1990 to December 1997 were reviewed. A standard duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> protocol was followed, and attempts were made to survey the entire graft, including inflow and outflow. Duplex scan results were compared with the results of preoperative arteriograms and the operation performed to determine if all significant lesions were identified by means of duplex scan alone. Results: Two hundred five LERVG revisions were performed. The 5 -year assisted primary patency rate was 91 %. In 119 cases (58 %), arteriography did not contribute significantly to duplex scan findings. Arteriography significantly contributed to operative planning in 86 cases (42 %). In 38 cases (19 %), only a low-flow state was identified by means of duplex scan, and a correctable stenosis was identified by means of arteriography. In 48 cases (23 %), additional significant lesions corrected at operation were identified by means of arteriography. These included 26 inflow, 16 graft, and 8 outflow lesions. Arteriography was most useful as a means of determining the revision procedure performed when there were inflow lesions (P <. 05) or when the proximal anastomosis was to the profunda or superficial femoral arteries (P <. 05). All frequently performed bypass graft configurations had some discrepancy between arteriographic and duplex scan findings. Conclusion: Available data do not permit prediction of which LERVG are immune from missed lesions in a duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> protocol. This suggests to us that arteriography is mandatory before LERVG revisions. (J Vasc Surg 1999; 29 : 270 - 81. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The typical leg bypass {{surveillance}} program {{begins with}} a duplex scan evaluation of the vein graft 3 months after surgery; studies are repeated every 3 months {{during the first year}} of follow-up and are fully reimbursed by our Medicare carrier. Some authors have recommended early (before discharge or first postoperative visit) duplex scanning to identify high-risk grafts. However, the natural history of velocity disturbances detected with early scans is unclear, and furthermore, such studies are not reimbursed by Medicare. Methods: We reviewed all infrainguinal vein bypass grafts prospectively entered into a surveillance protocol that included an early (200 cm/s) in 58 grafts (26 %). Six grafts of the 58 (10. 3 %; 2. 7 %) with an early abnormal duplex scan and unrepaired defects occluded during the follow-up period. Thirty grafts were revised on the basis of the initial early scan; 23 of these revisions were performed for critical or rapidly progressive lesions in the first 3 postoperative months. Seven lesions progressed more slowly and were repaired at a mean of 8 months after surgery. Interestingly, 22 flow abnormalities (37 %) resolved or stabilized despite a PSV of more than 300 cm/s in six cases (27 %). Clear duplex scan evidence of regression or progression of these early flow abnormalities occurred within 3 months in 51 / 58 cases (88 %). A total of 68 grafts (30 %) were revised during the entire study period; 30 of these (44 %) were on the basis of the early abnormal scan. Conclusion: Despite normal completion arteriography, early graft velocity abnormalities are strikingly common and were detected in 26 % of the 224 infrainguinal vein grafts in this series. These lesions were clinically important because 52 % necessitated revision. Surprisingly, however, 38 % of these early flow disturbances resolved, despite a PSV of more than 300 cm/s in 27 % of cases. Early duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> singularly detects a clinically significant subgroup of grafts that need revision. The possible origin of these early lesions deserves further inquiry, but on the basis of its clinical yield, we recommend that early duplex <b>scan</b> <b>surveillance</b> of infrainguinal bypass grafts should be routine and should be considered for Medicare reimbursement.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveAlthough the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the A{{symptomatic}} Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) {{have helped}} to define the role of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for both symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions, the role of surveillance of the contralateral carotid artery remains unclear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the progression of contralateral carotid artery disease with serial duplex ultrasound scans after CEA compared with the recurrent stenosis rate for the carotid artery ipsilateral to the CEA. MethodsFrom January 1990 to December 2000, 473 CEA procedures were performed at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. From this group we identified 279 patients who had undergone first-time CEA, as well as preoperative duplex scanning and postoperative duplex scanning at least once, in the vascular laboratory. At each visit stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) was categorized as none (0 %- 14 %), mild (15 %- 49 %), moderate (50 %- 79 %), severe (80 %- 99 %), or occluded. Analysis of probability of freedom from progression was determined. Progression was defined as an increase in ICA stenosis 50 % or greater or increase to a higher category of stenosis if baseline was 50 % or greater. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for data analysis. ResultsMean patient age was 65. 7 years (range, 33 - 100 years). The 1024 carotid duplex ultrasound scanning examinations performed (mean, 3. 7; range, 2 - 13) included the last study done before the index CEA and all studies done after the CEA. Mean follow-up was 27 months (range, 1 - 137 months). Forty-six patients were found to have contralateral carotid occlusion at initial duplex scanning, and were therefore excluded from the contralateral progression analysis. Contralateral progression was more frequent than ipsilateral recurrent stenosis at long-term follow-up (P <. 01). Annual rates of “any progression” and “progression to severe stenosis or occlusion” were 8. 3 % and 4. 4 %, respectively, for contralateral arteries, and 4. 3 % and 2. 4 %, respectively for ipsilateral arteries. As a result of surveillance, 43 contralateral CEAs (19 % of initial cohort) were performed. Carotid stenosis regressed in 25 arteries (10. 7 %). Baseline clinical and demographic factors did not predict disease progression. Baseline contralateral stenosis did not predict time to “any progression,” but was a strong predictor of “progression to severe stenosis or occlusion” (P <. 001). ConclusionsAfter CEA, we identified an 8. 3 % annual rate of progression of contralateral carotid artery stenosis and a 4. 4 % annual rate of progression to severe stenosis or occlusion. Baseline contralateral stenosis was significantly predictive of progression to severe stenosis or occlusion. Clinical and demographic factors were not helpful in predicting which patients would have disease progression. These data may help in assessing the cost effectiveness of duplex <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> after CEA...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Reversed lower-extremity vein grafts (LEVGs) {{frequently}} require operative {{revisions to}} maintain patency. Identifying grafts {{that are at}} risk, however, requires an intensive duplex scanning-based surveillance program. Excellent 5 -year graft patency and limb-salvage rates have previously been reported in patients undergoing graft revisions, but results beyond 5 years are essentially unknown, a factor that is of importance in an increasingly aging population. This study was performed to determine the results of surgical revisions of LEVGs after a follow-up as long as 10 years. Methods: All patients undergoing placement of a LEVG were observed in a program of duplex scanning-based surveillance {{as long as the}} patient remained a candidate for graft revision. Grafts were considered for revision {{on the basis of the}} presence of focal areas of increased velocity, a prestenotic to intrastenotic velocity ratio more than 3. 0, or uniformly low velocities throughout the graft. All lesions were confirmed with preoperative arteriography before revision. Assisted primary patency, limb-salvage, and survival rates were determined by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis in all patients who underwent LEVG revision from January 1990 to December 2000. Results: A total of 1498 LEVG procedures were performed during the study period. A total of 330 surgical graft revisions were performed on 259 extremities in 245 patients. The median follow-up period was 38 months. The assisted primary patency rate of all grafts, the limb-salvage rate for patients undergoing surgery for limb-salvage indications, and the survival rate of all patients were 87. 4 %, 88. 7 %, and 72. 4 %, respectively, 5 years after the original bypass grafting procedure, 85. 7 %, 83. 4 %, and 67. 8 %, respectively, 7 years after the original bypass grafting procedure, and 80. 4 %, 75. 4 %, and 53. 4 %, respectively, 10 years after the original bypass grafting procedure. A total of 180 revisions (55 %) were performed during the first year, 110 (33 %) between the first year and the fifth year, and 40 revisions (12 %) were performed on grafts older than 5 years. LEVGs revised within the first year after bypass grafting had lesions within the graft in 78 %, in the native arterial inflow in 10 %, and in the native arterial outflow in 12 %. This differed significantly from the location of lesions in revisions performed between 1 and 5 years and after 5 years (graft, 63 % and 62 %; inflow, 20 % and 19 %; outflow, 17 % and 19 %; P >. 05, Chi-square). Conclusion: Excellent assisted primary patency and limb-salvage rates can be achieved for as long as 10 years in LEVGs that require revision, with only a 7 % drop in overall patency and limb-salvage rates between the fifth and 10 th years. Although most revisions were required within the first year, 34 % were performed between the first year and the fifth year, and 11 % after 5 years. These data support the growing body of evidence that favors an aggressive regimen of duplex <b>scanning</b> <b>surveillance</b> of LEVGs for the life of the graft. Revised grafts have excellent patency through 10 years.  (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 56 - 63. ...|$|E
