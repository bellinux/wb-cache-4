The non-linear effects come from the amplitude-dependent stiffness of the engine mounts. First, the Harmonic Balance Method is presented. A condensation process on the non-linear degrees-of-freedom is also proposed. This processreduces the original non-linear system by focusing only on {{the solution of the}} non-linear equations associated with the system's non-linear components. Secondly, the engine mount stiffness dependency with amplitude is measured on a test bench to estimate a polynomial <b>stiffness</b> <b>law.</b> Finally, the numerical analysis is performed to analyze the non-linear response of the whole vehicle using the Harmonic Balance Method algorithm with appropriate condensation located only on the non-linear coordinates of the system in order to minimize computer time...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to deal with the {{simulation}} of intralaminar fatigue damage in unidirectional composite under multi-axial and variable amplitude loadings. The variable amplitude and multi-axial loading is accounted for by using the damage hysteresis operator based on Brokate method [6]. The proposed damage model for fatigue is based on <b>stiffness</b> degradation <b>laws</b> from Van Paepegem combined with the ‘damage’ cycle jump approach extended to deal with unidirectional carbon fibres. The parameter identification method is here presented and parameter sensitivities are discussed. The initial static damage of the material is accounted for by using the Ladevèze damage model and the permanent shear strain accumulation based on Van Paepegem’s formulation. This approach is implemented into commercial software (Siemens PLM). The validation case is run on a bending test coupon (with arbitrary stacking sequence and load level) in order to minimise the risk of inter-laminar damages. This intra-laminar fatigue damage model combined efficient methods with a low number of tests to identify the parameters of the <b>stiffness</b> degradation <b>law,</b> this overall procedure for fatigue life prediction is demonstrated to be cost efficient at industrial level. This work concludes on the next challenges to be addressed (validation tests, multiple-loadings validation, failure criteria, inter-laminar damages…) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{aerospace}} positioning actuators, gear efficiencies of 85 % {{as well as}} breakout {{forces as}} high as 50 % of the stall load of the actuator are observed at very low temperature conditions. Due to the low efficiency and high loading, stiction in these actuators is common {{which can lead to}} limit cycles or problems with controlling the actuators. To be able to correctly predict and assess these effects using simulations, a complete actuator, including motor, inverter, load and controller is needed. This article presents an object based, numerically efficient gear contact in a planar environment with user-defined friction- and <b>stiffness</b> <b>laws.</b> The emphasis of the modeling is not a fully detailed contact model, but the description of a gear contact model which can be used for system simulations like complete aircraft electro-mechanical actuators including control surfaces. The presented model is suitable for complex gearing configurations (e. g. compound planetary gears). This is enabled by breaking down the transmission into the basic gear contacts. By adding masses and constraints from an existing component library, a complete transmission can be modeled. The generated model can be used for standalone simulations or can be used in multi-domain simulations like actuator modeling, in order to analyze the complete actuator model including parts such as drives, controllers and mechanical systems. The presented models have been validated using a gear test rig for a single stage spur gear...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} effects of {{changing}} the effective damping and stiffness coefficients on the dynamic operating characteristics of a single degree of freedom direct-drive robot during "making" contact with a rigid environment. Altering these two coefficients ultimately implies changing the compliance of the robot/environment interaction. Since the compliance is changed dynamically and in real-time, the approach {{is referred to as}} Active Compliance. The thesis provides insight into the fundamental contact dynamics of a single robotic link such that the results can be used to describe the dynamics of more complex multi-degree of freedom manipulator architectures. [...] Active compliance requires real-time control of the damping and stiffness characteristics and is fundamentally a dynamic force control scheme allowing the robot to conform to the natural constraints imposed by the environment. To investigate this interaction in this thesis a software simulation program and a single degree of freedom direct-drive robot arm are developed. The thesis also clearly defines five distinct phases associated with the process of making contact. These contact phases are generic and apply to both mobile and fixed robots. [...] This study highlighted the following conclusions (1) Both mobile and fixed robots can benefit from controlled active compliance, (2) Altering these coefficients in real-time during the contact process is achievable, (3) The distance from the environment is not a necessary piece of information for contact under a force controlled contact scheme, (4) Compliance can be implemented based on a force constraint imposed upon the robot and the environment, (5) Sensors provide control information and must be strategically selected and mounted, (6) Ideal Damping and <b>Stiffness</b> <b>laws</b> are developed and proven functional, (7) Friction is a significant impedance factor which effects all aspects of the contact cycle...|$|R

In this paper, a 3 -dof Parallel Wire Driven (PWD) manipulator configuration is presented, and the modeling and the tracking control of this kind of robot is studied. In PWD manipulators, the elastic units (wires) which are in parallel make the coupling and the nonlinearity of the model increased. So a singular perturbation theory, based on which the two-time scale control law can be obtained, is chosen as the control strategy. Then, according to the stiffness analysis results([15]), a <b>stiffness</b> control <b>law</b> which can separate stiffness control from position control is designed to realize a variable manipulator.

As a discrete element code, it allows finite displacements and rotations of discrete bodies (including complete detachment), and recognizes new contacts automatically as the calculation progresses. The setup is composed of distinct particles that displace independently of one another, and interact only at contacts or interfaces between them. The calculations performed in the DEM alternate between the application of Newton’s second law to the particles and a force–displacement law at the contacts, characterized by normal and tangential <b>stiffnesses.</b> Newton’s second <b>law</b> is {{used to determine the}} motion of each particle arising from the contact and body forces acting upon it, while the force–displacement law is used to update the contact forces arising from the relative motion at each contact (Itasca Consulting Group Inc. 2008 a).|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} limit HCF damage {{due to high}} {{vibration}} amplitudes of thin-walled gears for aeronautical applications, the damping {{of the system is}} increased by means of friction ring dampers, placed into a groove and kept in contact with its base by means of the centrifugal force. In this paper, a method for the calculation of the forced response of gears for aeronautical application coupled to ring dampers is proposed. Both the gear and the ring damper are modelled by means of FEM. The two components are coupled by contact elements characterized by tangential and normal contact <b>stiffness,</b> Coulomb friction <b>law</b> and one dimensional relative motion. Due to the non-linear contact forces, the problem must be solved iteratively by using a limited set of non-linear equations. The harmonic excitation is calculated by means of Fourier analysis of the periodic force profile acting on the loaded teeth. The methodology is applied to a case of industrial interest.

40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{influence}} of masonry infills within RC frames structures has been widely investigated in the last decades by several researchers. The large interest addressed to this topic depends on the actual observation that when in presence of seismic events, the response of framed structures is strongly conditioned by the interaction with the infill walls, which however are considered as non-structural elements and not included in the models. The influence of masonry infills role in structural response is so much relevant to affect not only the overall strength and the stiffness but it may also radically change the possible collapse mechanisms of the overall structural complex under the effect of strong ground motions. Infill panels may have a beneficial effect on the structural response, being able in some cases to supply the lack of resistance of structures to lateral actions, or an adverse contribution inducing unexpected and dangerous non-ductile collapse mechanisms. However, the studies carried out on this topic have demonstrated that, independently from the beneficial or adverse contribution of masonry infills on structural response, their presence cannot be neglected in structural modelling both in design and verification phases. The paper provides a large literature review regarding the modelling techniques developed in the last decades, going from refined nonlinear FE micromodel approaches to simplified equivalent single or multiple strut macromodels including also different technical code statements. The reliability of these approaches is discussed highlighting advantages and weakness points. Macromodelling approach is particularly pointed out since it constitutes the most attractive technique to perform complex nonlinear analyses (static and dynamic). A state of the art of the main issues regarding equivalent strut identification (<b>stiffness,</b> constitutive <b>law</b> and cyclic behaviour) across scientific literature is provided describing in detail noteworthy aspects of some approaches...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{experimental}} {{tests to determine}} the compressive strength of masonry stack prisms has been numerically simulated using a combined plasticity-smeared crack constitutive law employed in three-dimensional analysis. Supported by an experimental campaign for the mechanical characterization of lime mortar masonry, a series of finite element analyses was performed {{in an attempt to}} assess the capacity of the model to reproduce the results obtained in terms of capacity, failure mode and global <b>stiffness.</b> The constitutive <b>law</b> used for the non-linear analysis of the masonry is a combination of a smeared cracking model in tension and a pressure dependent plasticity model in compression, which is capable of accounting for all failure mechanisms that may arise in concentric compression of masonry, both in the units and in the mortar. The purpose of this investigation is to establish whether a numerical approach based on the micro-modeling method is suitable for the simulation of the salient features encountered in masonry under compression as well as highlighting the main material properties necessary to be determined in order to properly model such experiments.

40|$|Closed-form {{solutions}} for laterally loaded free and fixed-head piles in elastic-plastic media {{have been developed}} and implemented into a spreadsheet program called GASLFP. Underpinned by a generic limiting force profile (LFP), the solutions offer an expeditious and sufficiently accurate method for predicting response of lateral piles. They also allow parameters to be deduced using measured pile response, as {{is evident in the}} study to date on - 70 test (elastic) piles. The solutions also well capture the impact of structure nonlinearity of pile body by employing reduced pile bending <b>stiffness</b> (EpIp). The <b>law</b> of the reduction in EpIp, however, needs to be verified. In this paper, the solutions are utilised to examine the response of four test-piles exhibiting structural nonlinearity.

40|$|Use {{of carbon}} fiber {{textiles}} in complex manufacturing methods creates new implementations of structural components by increasing performance, lowering manufacturing costs, and making composites overall more attractive across industry. Advantages of textile composites include high area output, ease of handling during the manufacturing process, lower production costs per material used resulting from automation, and provide post-manufacturing assembly mainstreaming because significantly more complex geometries such as stiffened shell structures can be manufactured with fewer pieces. One significant challenge with using stiffened composite structures is stiffener separation under compression. Axial compression loading conditions have frequently observed catastrophic structural failure due to stiffeners separating {{from the shell}} skin. Characterizing stiffener separation behavior is often costly computationally and experimentally. The objectives of this research are to demonstrate unitized stiffened textile composite panels can be manufactured to produce quality test specimens, that existing characterization techniques applied to state-of-the-art high-performance composites provide valuable information in modeling such structures, that the unitized structure concept successfully removes stiffener separation as a primary structural failure mode, and that modeling textile material failure modes are sufficient to accurately capture postbuckling and final failure responses of the stiffened structures. The stiffened panels in this study have taken the integrally stiffened concept to an extent such that the stiffeners and skin are manufactured at the same time, as one single piece, and from the same composite textile layers. Stiffener separation is shown to be removed as a primary structural failure mode for unitized stiffened composite textile panels loaded under axial compression well into the postbuckling regime. Instead of stiffener separation, a material damaging and failure model effectively captures local post-peak material response via incorporating a mesoscale model using a multiscaling framework with a smeared crack element-based failure model in the macroscale stiffened panel. Material damage behavior is characterized by simple experimental tests and incorporated into the post-peak <b>stiffness</b> degradation <b>law</b> in the smeared crack implementation. Computational modeling results are in overall excellent agreement compared to the experimental responses...|$|R
40|$|Mastication is {{responsible}} for food breakdown {{with the aid of}} saliva in order to form a cohesive viscous mass, known as the bolus. This influences {{the rate at which the}} ingested food nutrients are later absorbed into the body, which needs to be controlled to aid in epidemic health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and dyspepsia. The aim of our work is to understand and improve food oral breakdown efficiency in both human and pet foods through developing multi-scale models of oral and gastric processing. The latter has been a challenging task and the available technology may be still immature, as foods usually exhibit a complex viscous, compliant, and tough mechanical behaviour. These are all addressed here through establishing a novel material model calibrated through experiments on starch-based food. It includes a new criterion for the onset of material <b>stiffness</b> degradation, a <b>law</b> for the evolution of degradation governed by the true material’s fracture toughness, and a constitutive stress-strain response, all three being a function of the stress state, i. e., compression, shear, and tension. The material model is used in a finite element analysis which reproduces accurately the food separation patterns under a large strain indentation test, which resembles the boundary conditions applied in chewing. The results lend weight to the new methodology as a powerful tool in understanding how different food structures breakdown and in optimising these structures via parametric analyses to satisfy specific chewing and digestion attributes...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of a jointed rock mass is strongly, and sometimes dramatically, {{affected by the}} behaviour of the discontinuities present in jointed rock mass. In many cases, preferential failures are dominated or defined by the natural discontinuities present {{in the neighborhood of}} engineering engineering works. Closed form solutions rarely exist in general problems and numerical methods must therefore be used. The constitutive models for discontinuities, therefore, play an essential part in the successful application of any numerical techniques. In this thesis, two new constitutive models, one twodimensional and one three-dimensional, for the {{mechanical behaviour}} of rock discontinuities are developed according to the experimental results obtained from shear tests under cyclic shear sequences. Fifty concrete replicas of natural rock joints are made and tested in different shear directions under different constant normal stresses. The results obtained confirm that the anisotropy in both the angle of friction and shear stiffness are significant properties of rough joints which have been ignored in the past time. In addition, the shear stiffness and friction angle depend on the normal stress. Based on these results, the behaviour of rock joints under two or three-dimensional loading conditions and undergoing cyclic shear sequences was generalized. This generalized behaviour forms the physical background {{for the development of the}} new constitutive models. The two-dimensional constitutive model for rock joints is a generalization of Plesha's original model. The theory of non-associated plasticity was used to formulate the model in which both pre- and post-peak shear stress regions are considered, by using empirical laws for workhardening and work-softening. The most basic aspects of the rock discontinuities, for example, the appearance of peak and residual shear stresses during shearing, the increase in the magnitudes of both shear, and normal stresses under constant normal displacement condition, nonlinear dilatancy during shearing under constant normal stress condition, surface roughness degradation and the dependence of stiffness parameters on the normal displacement and normal stress are reflected in the model. The second law of thermodynamics is used to restrict the values of some of the model parameters so that entropy production of the system is non-negative. The three-dimensional model is formulated in the same manner as its two-dimensional counterpart with special interest in the anisotropic nature of both the angle of friction and shear <b>stiffness.</b> Empirical <b>laws</b> for work - hardening, surface degradation, stiffness changes due to normal stress and normal displacement, are all considered. The path dependence of the shear stress components in the shear plane is highlighted. An asperity ellipse and a shear stiffness ellipse are constructed to represent the anisotropy in the friction angle and shear <b>stiffness.</b> The second <b>law</b> of thermodynamics is also used to restrict some model parameters to secure a non-negative entropy production of the system during shearing. The newly developed constitutive models are validated against well known test results published in the literature and the test results obtained by the author's own test results. The predictions from the models concurs well with the test results. The models are implemented into existing distinct element method programs, UDEC and 3 DEC, respectively. Three examples of application of the new joint models are presented. The first is a simulation for plate movements in the Earth's crust to investigate the mechanisms of intraplate earthquakes with the new two-dimensional constitutive model. The second is an equilibrium analysis of three-dimensional rock slope with anisotropic friction angle and the third one is a study on sensitivity of stability of underground mining stopes on the anisotropy of friction angle. The new three-dimensional constitutive model is used in the last two examples and a large computational model is used in the third example to test the performance of the new model under complex geometrical and mechanical loading conditions. It is concluded in this thesis that the behaviour of rock joints under cyclic shear tests is more complex than that under monotonic shear tests and contraction becomes important. Under three-dimensional loading conditions, the anisotropy in friction and stiffness properties of rock discontinuities should be considered. The path dependence in the shear plane is significant feature which has not been studied adequately in previous time. In order to deepen our understanding of the mechanical behaviour of rock joints under three-dimensional loading conditions, a truly threedimensional test machine is needed. Recommendations for future research are provided at the end of the thesis. Godkänd; 1990; 20070429 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuum}} modelling of the {{macroscopic behaviour}} of metallic sheets and {{the identification of}} corresponding material parameters for models selected are {{dealt with in the}} thesis. Thermodynamics with internal variables provides a framework for the derivation of the models. Inelastic effects, such as mixed plastic hardening, and either isotropic or anisotropic ductile damage are included in the models. For isotropic damage, represented by a scalar variable, the effective stress concept is combined with the principle of strain equivalence. The extension to anisotropy is affected by replacing the strain equivalence principle with the elastic energy equivalence. A second-order damage tensor is shown to give rise to a degradation of elastic <b>stiffness.</b> The elasticity <b>law</b> assumes material isotropy, since there is no damage in the initial undamaged state. The concept of small elastic and large plastic deformations is applied to Belytcshko shell elements. The plastic yield criterion is evaluated in the space of the real stresses, which simplifies the numerical algorithm. A limitation of the model is that damage propagates only during plastic hardening. Since cyclic loading causes opening and closing of microcracks, the microcrack reopening and closing mechanism is intended to model the corresponding damage growth. Accordingly, damage propagates mainly in the tensile state. The incorporation of the dynamic yield surface ensures an upper asymptotic limit to the viscoplastic stress state. The time integration of the constitutive models is done by using the Backward Euler method in combination with the Newton-Raphson iteration technique. These algorithms are later implemented as user material subroutines in the explicit Finite Element program LS-DYNA. Three experimental methods are used to identify material parameters: uniaxial tension tests at different strain rates, a three-point cyclic bending test, and continuous uniaxial tension loading and unloading of metal sheets. Since steel alloys exhibit strain-rate dependence, stress-strain curves from uniaxial tension tests at different strain rates are used for calibration of the viscoplastic material parameters. The three-point cyclic bending test methodology is assessed for identification of material hardening parameters. Continuous uniaxial loading and unloading of metal sheets was performed with the objective of identifying the isotropic growth of damage. This identification technique is based on the coupling between damage propagation and degradation of the elastic properties of a material...|$|R
