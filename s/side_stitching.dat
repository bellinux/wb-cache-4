50|$|Most of the time, <b>side</b> <b>stitches</b> {{occur on}} the right side of the body. This may be because the largest organ in the {{abdominal}} cavity, the liver, is on that side. Certain athletes also report a pain in the tip of their shoulder blade. This is believed to be because this is a referred site of pain for the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve. When the <b>side</b> <b>stitch</b> is {{on the right side}}, published advice is to try to exhale when the left foot lands.|$|R
50|$|Of {{clinical}} relevance, {{one cause}} of exercise-induced pain in one's left <b>side</b> (a <b>side</b> <b>stitch)</b> is stretching of this ligament and the peritoneum when the spleen swells from exertion.|$|R

50|$|There {{are other}} {{theories}} regarding <b>side</b> <b>stitches</b> than simple stretching of the visceral ligaments due to repeated vertical translation and jolting. Such theories include diaphragmatic ischemia, imbalances of the thoracic spine, irritation of the parietal peritoneum and strain on visceral ligaments by a fluid-engorged gut.|$|R

40|$|Exercise-related {{transient}} {{abdominal pain}} or « <b>side</b> <b>stitch</b> » {{is a very}} common problem among athletes, whatever their level of participation. This pain may be present in {{different areas of the}} abdomen, even in the shoulder, usually well localized, and described as cramping or stabbing depending on the severity. The etiology is still debated, with many possible theories. It is a benign problem but other pathologies, often more severe, must be excluded in case of any atypical presentation. There are simple preventive measures recommended. This pain usually disappears within minutes by slowing or stopping the effort and / or using different methods without scientific validation until now...|$|R
50|$|<b>Side</b> <b>stitch</b> (also {{called a}} side ache, a side cramp, a side crampie, a side sticker {{or simply a}} stitch) is an intense {{stabbing}} pain under the lower edge of the ribcage that occurs while exercising. It is {{also referred to as}} exercise-related transient abdominal pain (ETAP). Some people think that this abdominal pain may be caused by the internal organs (like the liver and stomach) pulling downwards on the diaphragm, but that theory is inconsistent with its frequent occurrence during swimming, which involves almost no downward force on these organs. If the pain is present only when exercising and is completely absent at rest, in an otherwise healthy person, it is benign and does not require investigation.|$|R

5000|$|Harveys SeatbeltBags {{first started}} using solid colors of seatbelts with names including, {{but not limited}} to, Limo Black, SUV Navy, and Stainless Steel. They {{introduced}} their first print bag {{in the summer of}} 2006. The SeatbeltBug design was a print of different insect silhouettes on a green or pink background with matching interior lining. Since then, the development and ability to print on seatbelt webbing has been a creative outlet for the company and allows them to design unique patterns. Print collections in the past have included many floral designs, geometric patterns, camo, animal prints, plaid, argyle, polka dots. The Treecycle collection has been a popular collection for Harvey's and features 100% reclaimed seatbelts in a variety of natural tones, with a hemp lining using organic dyes. Collections also feature different silhouettes, including a ruffled [...] "Lola" [...] design, a horizontally <b>side</b> by <b>side</b> <b>stitched</b> [...] "Boat Tote" [...] collection, a mini seatbelt woven [...] "Madison" [...] collection, a vertically stitched [...] "Stella" [...] collection as well as bags with wool and leather accents.

Your grandmothers did not realize that. You do. You know. In that recognition and a certain nobility I find in you, I put my hope, much more than in any dreadful memories of 1789 and those vindictive pikes. Your class is a strangely mixed assembly of new and old, of base and fine. But through it all, in Great Britain and Western Europe generally, soaks a tradition truly aristocratic, a tradition that transcends property; you are aware, and at times uneasily aware, of duty and a sort of honour. You cannot bilk cabmen nor cheat at cards; there is something in your making forbids that as strongly as an instinct. But what if it is made clear to you (and it is being made clear to you) that the wealth you have is, all unwittingly on your part, the outcome of a colossal--if unpremeditated--social bilking? ...|$|R

The experimental {{results have been}} reproducible within plus or minus 10 % or better for identical blankets and less than plus or minus 5 % for the same blanket. Good blanket performance can be obtained using short interleaving for joints, eliminating stitched seams, and using small patches, particularly over the hot <b>side</b> of <b>stitches.</b> The heat loss through stitching is excessive but highly localized. Analytical models matched to thermocouple test results are presented. The manner in which radiation and conduction participate in heat transfer adjacent to discontinuities is indicated.

40|$|Until recently, {{very large}} focal plane arrays (> 1 K x 1 K pixels) {{could only be}} {{fabricated}} using low density ≥ 2 µm CMOS processes employing full wafer projection lithography. Higher density processes use steppers to expose the patterns on the wafer which have limited the die size to the area able to be exposed in a single step.

50|$|In flat knitting, {{generally}} stockinette stitch, the hand-knitter knits from right-to-left on {{one side}} of the fabric, turns the work (over), and then purls right-to-left back to the starting position. Usually the smooth side of the fabric is considered the right side, the one facing outwards for viewing; and the side that faces inwards, towards the body, the ridged side, is known as the wrong side. Thus, flat knitting involves knitting each row on the right side, then purling each row on the wrong side, etc. If each row is knit (no purls) this creates garter stitch, which has the same appearance on both sides and creates horizontal ridges offset by valleys, rather than a knit and purl <b>side.</b> Patterned <b>stitching,</b> such as cables, can be accomplished with either flat knitting, or in the round, however the technique must follow the desired pattern.|$|R

5000|$|Most bead crochet {{is created}} by {{stringing}} beads onto uncut crochet thread prior to crocheting. Most artists either use a beading needle or apply clear nail polish {{to the end of}} the thread to create an anchor point for beading. At predetermined stitches, the crocheter slides one bead down and incorporates it into the fabric. Pre-stringing requires both the bead sequence and the crochet pattern to be fully planned in advance of manufacture. This technique aligns beads on one <b>side</b> of the <b>stitch.</b> So crocheting in rounds naturally yields a bead side and a crochet side. Projects that are worked in rows would either have beads on both sides of the fabric or have alternating bead and non-bead rows.|$|R
40|$|AbstractStitched fabrics {{have been}} widely studied for {{potential}} application in aircraft structures since stitch yarns offer improvements in the out-of-plane mechanical properties and also can save time in the lay up process. The down <b>side</b> of <b>stitch</b> yarns {{came up in the}} manufacturing process of fabric in which defects introduced by the needle movement creating fiber-free-zones, fiber breakage and misalignment of fibers. The dry stitched carbon fabric preform has mainly been used in the Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) process which high fiber content is aimed, those defects influence negatively the injection behavior reducing the mechanical properties of final material. The purpose of this research work focused on testing in quasi-static mechanical mode (in-plane tension) of a monocomponent resin CYCOM® 890 RTM/carbon fiber anti-symmetric quadriaxial fabric stitched by PE 80 Dtex yarn processed by RTM. The evaluation consisted in comparing the scatter of the quasi-static test with the attenuation of ultrasonic maps, which show the path of the resin and possible dry spots considering that interference of yarn in resin flow is detectable in ultrasonic measurement. Microscopic analysis was also considered for further evaluation in case of premature failure...|$|R

30|$|Another {{thing to}} note {{is that there}} is a strain peak on the valve <b>side</b> below the <b>stitch.</b> This point shows the {{influence}} of the corner control point on the valve lip. The control point is fixed while pressure is applied, so there is an increase of strain here due to the control point keeping the valve up. If this stitch boundary condition were applied to a single point rather than through a control point with loading patch, a much higher strain peak would be seen along with excessive localized deformation. Other than the corners, the second highest strain is located at the base of the valve. Like the corner, strains higher than those allowed by the material are found here. It should be noted that the fixed boundary conditions at the base are probably stiffer than the actual valve. One row of sutures holds the valve to the stent, and the suture probably behaves somewhere in between a fixed and a pinned boundary.|$|R
40|$|NASA {{has been}} a leader in {{development}} of composite materials for aircraft applications during the past 25 years. In the early 1980 's NASA and others conducted research to improve damage tolerance of composite structures through the use of toughened resins but these resins were not cost-effective. The aircraft industry wanted affordable, robust structures that could withstand the rigors of flight service with minimal damage. The cost and damage tolerance barriers of conventional laminated composites led NASA to focus on new concepts in composites which would incorporate the automated manufacturing methods of the textiles industry and which would incorporate through-the-thickness reinforcements. The NASA Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) Program provided the resources to extensively investigate the application of textile processes to next generation aircraft wing and fuselage structures. This paper discusses advanced textile material forms that have been developed, innovative machine concepts and key technology advancements required for future application of textile reinforced composites in commercial transport aircraft. Multiaxial warp knitting, triaxial braiding and through-the-thickness stitching are the three textile processes that have surfaced as the most promising for further development. Textile reinforced composite structural elements that have been developed in the NASA ACT Program are discussed. Included are braided fuselage frames and window-belt reinforcements, woven/stitched lower fuselage <b>side</b> panels, <b>stitched</b> multiaxial warp knit wing skins, and braided wing stiffeners. In addition, low-cost processing concepts such as resin transfer molding (RTM), resin film infusion (RFI), and vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) are discussed. Process modeling concepts to predict resin flow and cure in textile preforms are also discussed...|$|R
60|$|She had {{intended}} throwing {{herself at the}} feet of the King, who had never been unkind to her, and imploring his succour; but Sir Patrick brought word that the King and Dauphin were going forth together to visit the Abbot of a shrine at no great distance, and as soon as she heard that the Dauphin was with his father, she shrank together, and gave up her purpose for the present. Indeed, Sir Patrick thought it advisable for him to endeavour to discover what had really become of the princesses before applying to the King, or making their loss public. Nor was the Dauphiness in a condition to repair to Court. Dame Lilias longed to keep her and nurse and comfort her that evening; but while the spiteful whispers of De Tillay were abroad, it was needful to be doubly prudent, and the morning's escapade must if possible be compensated by a public return to Chateau le Surry. So Margaret was placed on Lady Drummond's palfrey, and accompanied home by all the attendants who could be got together. She could hardly sit upright by the time the short ride was over, for pain in the <b>side</b> and <b>stitch</b> in her breath. Again Lady Drummond would have stayed with her, but the Countess de Craylierre, who had been extremely offended and scandalised by the expedition of the Dauphiness, made her understand that no one could remain there except by the invitation of the Dauphin, and showed great displeasure at any one but herself attempting the care of Madame la Dauphine, who, as all knew, was subject to megrims.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} didactical {{approach and}} strategies, including didactical {{work out of}} foam rubber products suitable for lower elementary school. Foam rubber is relatively new material and is usually available only in specialized shops with products for creative work. That is why teachers rarely include foam rubber in their teaching program, even though it offers wide variety of technical creativity and opportunities for design and construction. In the thesis are presented three most common types of class work out at design and technology class and those are work, construction and project assignment. It is followed with a chapter of appropriateness and usefulness of synthetic materials in schools, with focus on foam rubber (technically is this EVA material, made from foamed polyethylene) and description of tools (scissors, scalpel blade, the ear tag pliers, punches, etc.), accessories and techniques of merging foam rubber (sticking with glues and double <b>sided</b> tape, <b>stitching,</b> riveting, etc.) that we need while making new products. The following chapter describes different options of work out based on celebrating and tradition theme, with pre-made/defines criteria that helps teacher decide with which product the students will reach their learning goal. The thesis presents 14 relevant foam rubber products with a goal to improve learning and teaching of design and technology. Because of its content the thesis targets on lower level elementary school teachers as a didactical manual while making foam rubber products at technical contents in classes of environmental sciences and natural sciences and technique, on technical days, art and technology class or during extra-curricular-activities and extra time activities. As well as for those who enjoy in technical creativity with new materials. Class work with foam rubber gives students many new ideas and develops their technical creativity which brings technique and technology of everyday life even closer to school curriculum. ...|$|R
