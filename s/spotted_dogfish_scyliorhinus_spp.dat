40|$|International audienceThe basic {{anatomy of}} the elasmobranch brain has been {{previously}} established after studying {{the organization of the}} different subdivisions in the adult brain. However, despite the relatively abundant immunohistochemical and hodologic studies performed in different species of sharks and skates, the organization of some brain subdivisions remains unclear.

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that elasmobranch fish respond differently to metal exposure than marine teleosts. Accumulation rates can be high, which {{despite the fact that}} normal background levels for metals in the marine environment are low, is worrying due to the long life span and late fecundity of most shark. The goals of the present study were to examine differences in accumulation rates and toxicity of a range of metals at equimolar concentrations (10 mu M) in the Mediterranean or <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish,</b> <b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula. For this purpose, we exposed the dogfish to Ni (587 mu g/L), Cd (1124 mu g/L), Pb (2072 mu g/L), Cu (635 mu g/L), and Ag (1079 mu g/L and two additional exposures at 10 mu g/L and 1 mu g/L) for one week and measured total metal accumulation, metallothionein induction, and parameters related to osmoregulation. Our study confirms the high toxicity and accumulation rates of Ag for elasmobranch fish, even at levels 100 to 1000 times lower than exposure levels of other metals. Also Pb accumulated readily in all organs, but did not cause any osmoregulatory disturbance at the exposure levels used. Ni and Cd seem to accumulate primarily in the kidney while Cu mainly accumulated in liver.

Mesh size and other characteristics of the trawls used suggested {{that some of these}} data were comparable, and could be used to describe changes in {{demersal fish}} assemblages over the last 80 years. In Start Bay (NW English Channel) and the Irish Sea, species diversity was the same in both periods, although the most abundant species in each period were not the same. In English coastal regions of the southern North Sea, fish populations became more diverse, as plaice Pleuronectes platessa and whiting Merlangius merlangus became less abundant, and the relative abundance of several non-target species such as dragonet Callionymus spp., bib Trisopterus luscus, and bull-rout Myoxocephalus scorpius increased. The proportion in the catch of small fish species (maximum body length 30 cm) in catches decreased in all regions during the time period, except in the Irish Sea where plaice replaced grey gurnard Eutrigla gurnardus as a dominant species. There was a decline in abundance of large sharks, skates and rays, including the common skate, Raja batis, white skate R. alba and the angel shark Squatina squatina.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to most vertebrate species that possess one oxytocin-like hormone and one vasopressin-like hormone, a few groups, such as marsupials or cartilaginous fishes, are endowed with two peptides of {{either or both}} types, suggesting possible gene duplications. We have now isolated two oxytocin-like hormones from the pituitary of the <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> <b>Scyliorhinus</b> caniculus (suborder Galeoidei). Microsequencing as well as chromatographic and pharmacological comparisons with synthetic peptides show that these peptides are [Asn 4,Val 8]oxytocin (asvatocin) and [Phe 3,Asn 4,Val 8]-oxytocin (phasvatocin). Asvatocin and phasvatocin display oxytocic activity on rat uterus, about 80 and 5 milliunits per nmol, respectively, and virtually no pressor activity on anesthetized rats. They occur in roughly equal molar amounts in the gland; vasotocin is also present in a proportional amount that is lower by about a factor of 20. In addition to the duality, conservative amino acid substitutions are observed in the two oxytocic peptides in positions 4 (Gln- 4 [...] >Asn) and 8 (Leu- 8 [...] >Val), when compared with oxytocin. Furthermore, replacement of the isoleucine residue found in position 3 of all other oxytocin-like hormones by phenylalanine in phasvatocin is exceptional; it determines a dramatic decrease of the oxytocic activity. Preservation of the C-terminal-amidated nonapeptide pattern in the 12 vertebrate neurohypophysial hormones known to date suggests that both precursors and processing enzymes have coevolved tightly. On the other hand, whereas the great evolutionary stability of the mature hormones (generally observed in vertebrates) suggests a strict messenger-receptor coevolution, the exceptional diversity found in cartilaginous fishes (six oxytocin-like peptides identified out of eight known) {{might be due to}} a looseness of selective constraints, perhaps in relationship with their specific urea osmoregulation...|$|R
40|$|Like many elasmobranches, {{the lesser}} <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> (<b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula) appears to sexually segregate. The reasons behind this {{behaviour}} {{are not fully}} understood, The possibility that in S. canicula the sexes segregate due to the males and females having different energy requirements which dictate their differing behavioural strategies was investigated by examining the diets {{of male and female}} S. canicula. This was done by examining stomach contents of line caught specimens to examine if any differences existed in the prey items consumed. The energy value of stomach contents was also examined using a bomb calorimeter to determine if any difference existed between the sexes. All the fish sampled were sexually mature, Crustaceans were found {{to be the most important}} group for both sexes, followed by teleost fish, molluscs and then polychaetes. There were however differences between the relative importance of prey items between the sexes, with decapods having the highest frequency of occurrence in the males and unidentified teleosts having the highest frequency of occurrence in the females. However, unidentified teleosts had the highest weight contribution for both sexes. There was no significant difference between the energy value of stomach contents between male and female S. canicula. This indicates that different energy requirements do not dictate sexual segregation in this species. It is proposed that future studies should focus on the effects of temperature. The energy per unit mass of fish decreased with increasing body mass, reflecting the relationship between body mass and weight-specific metabolic rate. This indicates that smaller dogfish are using more energy per unit mass than larger animals as predicted by weight specific metabolic rate.

40|$|Specimens of {{the larger}} <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> (<b>Scyliorhinus</b> stellaris) were {{electrically}} stimulated to exhaustion in a closed seawater recirculation sys-tem. The production of large quantities of lactic acid by anaerobic metabol-ism and the resultant efflux of the dissociation products, H+ and lactate, from the white musculature resulted in severe acid-base disturbances and in increases in plasma lactate concentration, the two effects having extremely different time courses. Plasma pH and bicarbonate were maximally depressed 15 - 30 min after exercise, whereas peak lactate concentrations of up to 30 mM were not attained before 4 - 8 h after exercise. The acid-base status was restored to normal 10 — 14 h after exercise, long before the aerobic processing of surplus lactic acid was complete 22 — 30 h after exercise. This behaviour can be explained {{on the basis of}} an interaction of transfer rates, buffer values and equilibria between intracellular and extracellular compartments with the transient net transfer of surplus H+ ions to the environmental water. About half of the original quantity of H+ was trans-ferred net to the environment via the branchial epithelium during the first 8 - 10 h, and it was later taken up again at the rate of aerobic lactic acid processing in the metabolism of the fish, whereas a transfer of lactate was not observed {{at any time during the}} experiment. As a result, the distribution patterns of H+ and lactate differed from each other and varied with time elapsed after anaerobic exercise, leading to the apparent 'H+ ion deficit' which has been observed in the blood of several fish species during lactacidosis. Net transfer of H+ ions to the environment facilitates rapid normalization of the acid-base status long before the original stress, lactic acid, is removed from the organism and thus represents an effective regulatory mechanism for the defence of the internal milieu in fish...|$|R

40|$|Finfish pots {{have emerged}} as a “responsible” gear, when used in {{combination}} with conservational and technical measures to sustain fisheries. Previous trials in Irish waters have offered no published reported data and so three designs tested {{in the current study}} provide new information on this gear. The most successful traps in terms of fish catch were rigid steel framed rectangular pots used to target Conger eel. Although commercial yield was low (0. 2 per trap haul), potential existed for a viable pot fishery. Deployment and storage of Norwegian floating pots was conducted with relative ease but performance in the water was poor resulting in loss of gear. Catch returns were notable even though effort was restricted as mega-faunal by-catch was a problem, which lead to ending this trial. From these initial trials it was evident that catch rates were low compared to established Norwegian fisheries (3. 6 cod per pot), which resulted in the utilisation of pots, already established in the crustacean fishery, to find species readily accessible to pot capture. Although fished and designed differently, these gears provided an opportunity to establish the benefits of pot fishing to fish quality and to determine the effects on by-catch. The fishing effects of three catching methods (pots, angling and trawl) and the effects of air exposure on the physiological status of a common by-catch, the lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> <b>Scyliorhinus</b> canícula (L.) were examined using a range of physiological biomarkers (plasma catecholamine, glucose, lactate, muscle pH and muscle lactate). Physiological responses of fish to an emersion stress regime resulted in a significant metabolic disturbance in groups, but may not have weakened the overall health of these fish, as signified in the revival of some metabolites. Plasma glucose and lactate concentrations did not however recovery to baseline levels indicating that to achieve an accurate profile, responses should be determined by a suite of biomarkers. Responses did not demonstrate that samples from the pots were significantly less stressed than for the other two methods; angling and trawling, which are in contrast to many other studies.

40|$|In {{order to}} gain a deeper {{understanding}} of bone development and regeneration {{it will be necessary to}} learn more about the genes involved in these processes by clinical and basic-science research. Evolutionary biology can also provide us with valuable hints about skeletal biology. In the present work cDNA libraries from different stages of sheep fracture callus tissue were constructed from which over 47, 000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced. The EST distribution for genes in the different cDNA libraries was analyzed, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis was additionally performed for 87 genes with a potential function during fracture healing. Among these were 53 genes, for which a function in skeletal devlopment or in fracture repair had not been previously reported. Besides the identification of novel candidate genes for fracture healing, the EST sequences are an important resource for research using the sheep as model organism. In a developmental approach, expression profiles of E 14. 5 Runx 2 wildtype and knockout mouse humeri were compared in order to find genes with relevance for skeletogenesis. Runx 2 encodes a transcription factor that is essential for skeletogenesis. In this screen, 71 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed and were confirmed by real-time PCR. For 31 of these genes, a role in skeletogenesis has not yet been described. After determination of the expression patterns of the candidate genes, an evolutionary biology approach was used to identify potential direct Runx 2 target genes. Promoter regions of candidate genes were screened for Runx 2 binding sites that are conserved between different species. Using this approach five novel potential Runx 2 target genes were identified. Furthermore the analysis of Runt gene family evolution led to novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of skeletogenesis. Cloning and phylogenetic analysis of three Runt homologous genes of the lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> <b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula showed that the dogfish Runt genes are orthologs of the mammalian Runx 1 - 3 genes. Expression analysis of the Runt homologous genes of dogfish, hagfish and amphioxus as well as the amphioxus Sox 9 indicates, that these genes have an evolutionarily conserved function in development of the skeleton and its precursor structures. It could be shown, that this molecular machinery, which is essential for skeletogenesis, is also present in cephalochordates and not only in vertebrates and is thus approximately 100 million years older than previously thought. 1.

40|$|International audienceThe {{acquisition}} of jaws constitutes a landmark event in vertebrate evolution, one that {{in large part}} potentiated their success and diversification. Jaw development and patterning involves an intricate spatiotemporal series of reciprocal inductive and responsive interactions between the cephalic epithelia and the cranial neural crest (CNC) and cephalic mesodermal mesenchyme. The coordinated regulation of these interactions is critical for both the ontogenetic registration of the jaws and the evolutionary elaboration of variable jaw morphologies and designs. Current models of jaw development and evolution have been built on molecular and cellular evidence gathered mostly in amniotes such as mice, chicks and humans, and augmented by a much smaller body of work on the zebrafish. These have been partnered by essential work attempting to understand the origins of jaws that {{has focused on the}} jawless lamprey. Chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fish) are the most distant group to amniotes within extant gnathostomes, and comprise the crucial clade uniting amniotes and agnathans; yet despite their critical phylogenetic position, evidence of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of jaw development in chondrichthyans is still lacking. Recent advances in genome and molecular developmental biology of the lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> shark, <b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula, make it ideal for the molecular study of chondrichthyan jaw development. Here, following the ‘Hinge and Caps' model of jaw development, we have investigated evidence of heterotopic (relative changes in position) and heterochronic (relative changes in timing) shifts in gene expression, relative to amniotes, in the jaw primordia of S. canicula embryos. We demonstrate the presence of clear proximo-distal polarity in gene expression patterns in the shark embryo, thus establishing a baseline molecular baüplan for branchial arch-derived jaw development and further validating the utility of the ‘Hinge and Caps’ model in comparative studies of jaw development and evolution. Moreover, we correlate gene expression patterns with the absence of a lambdoidal junction (formed where the maxillary first arch meets the frontonasal processes) in chondrichthyans, further highlighting the importance of this region for the development and evolution of jaw structure in advanced gnathostomes...|$|R
40|$|During the {{development}} of the central nervous system (CNS), neurogenesis gives rise to neurons and glia at different times and locations. Identifying progenitor cells from which these neurons and glia derived, is essential to understand the heterogeneity of the different cell types produced and how to use them for CNS repair. One of the most exciting and recent advances in this field has been the recognition of the radial glial cells as neurogenic glial progenitors for both neurons and glial cells. However, radial glia are mostly transient in mammals, and postnatal progenitors appear incapable of endogenous reparation. Contrasting with the situation in mammals, radial glia are maintained in the adult CNS of many anamniote vertebrates, where they contribute to CNS regeneration. Recent studies have focused on how these vertebrates activate progenitor cells, regenerating particular cell types and integrate them into the mature CNS. However, many questions remain unsolved concerning these cellular hierarchies. Among all neurogenic systems in the CNS, the neural retina constitutes an excellent system to study key events regarding constitutive and regenerative neurogenesis {{because of the presence of}} high rates of cell proliferation in the adult (from the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) in the peripheral retina and from adult radial glia), and because of the occurrence of reparation processes involving radial glial cells (Müller cells). Most of the investigations examining the presence of adult neurogenesis were focused in tetrapod vertebrates (especially in mammals) and teleost fishes (particularly in zebrafish). With respect to fishes, the fast development of zebrafish, including the retina, as well as the small size of the embryos, might cause some processes to remain unnoticed. Instead, the retina of the lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> <b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula, belonging to the cartilaginous fishes, offers an exceptional model to approach the study of embryonic and adult neurogenesis. Since neurogenesis includes not only proliferation and differentiation processes, but also migration and synaptogenesis that are necessary for the correct function of the CNS, here we have extended the knowledge about neurogenesis using the retina of S. canicula as a model. Chapter 1 includes the study of the distribution pattern of the microtubule associated protein doublecortin (DCX), which is involved in regulating cytoskeletal arrangement during migration processes. This study has allowed us to differentiate three regions within the peripheral retina of the shark: a peripheral CMZ, a middle non-layered CMZ, and a transition zone bordering it. Chapter 2 was aimed to explore DCX immunoreactivity and its co-localization with proliferation and neuronal differentiation markers. We also studied its relation with glial cells and characterized the distribution of DCX-immunoreactive cells in mature areas. Our results suggest that DCX is an early marker of differentiation of specific cells and were compatible with previous suggested roles for DCX in nuclear stabilization and continuous neurite remodeling through late development and adulthood. We additionally suggest that DCX in the adult retina could reflect neuronal plasticity, not found in teleosts. In Chapter 3 we analyzed changes in radial glia during neurogenesis using the retina of S. canicula to study the processes underlying the transition from neuroepithelial cells to radial glial cells, and radial glia differentiation from development to the adulthood. To explore the relationship between radial glia and neurogenesis events in the retina, we analyzed the distribution pattern of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) during the lifespan of S. canicula and explored its localization with respect to other cell markers, including glutamine synthetase (GS), specifically expressed by mature Müller cells.

Lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> are not a commercial by-catch, and are discarded immediately after sorting. During 1994 the contents of 1094 dogfish stomachs were analysed.

The {{acquisition}} of jaws constitutes a landmark event in vertebrate evolution, one that {{in large part}} potentiated their success and diversification. Jaw development and patterning involves an intricate spatiotemporal series of reciprocal inductive and responsive interactions between the cephalic epithelia and the cranial neural crest (CNC) and cephalic mesodermal mesenchyme. The coordinated regulation of these interactions is critical for both the ontogenetic registration of the jaws and the evolutionary elaboration of variable jaw morphologies and designs. Current models of jaw development and evolution have been built on molecular and cellular evidence gathered mostly in amniotes such as mice, chicks and humans, and augmented by a much smaller body of work on the zebrafish. These have been partnered by essential work attempting to understand the origins of jaws that {{has focused on the}} jawless lamprey. Chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fish) are the most distant group to amniotes within extant gnathostomes, and comprise the crucial clade uniting amniotes and agnathans; yet despite their critical phylogenetic position, evidence of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of jaw development in chondrichthyans is still lacking. Recent advances in genome and molecular developmental biology of the lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> shark, <b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula, make it ideal for the molecular study of chondrichthyan jaw development. Here, following the 'Hinge and Caps' model of jaw development, we have investigated evidence of heterotopic (relative changes in position) and heterochronic (relative changes in timing) shifts in gene expression, relative to amniotes, in the jaw primordia of S. canicula embryos. We demonstrate the presence of clear proximo-distal polarity in gene expression patterns in the shark embryo, thus establishing a baseline molecular baüplan for branchial arch-derived jaw development and further validating the utility of the 'Hinge and Caps' model in comparative studies of jaw development and evolution. Moreover, we correlate gene expression patterns with the absence of a lambdoidal junction (formed where the maxillary first arch meets the frontonasal processes) in chondrichthyans, further highlighting the importance of this region for the development and evolution of jaw structure in advanced gnathostomes.
