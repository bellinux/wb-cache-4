40|$|Nikhil Nanavati, Marcus Walker Scunthorpe General Hospital, Scunthorpe, North East Lincolnshire, UK Abstract: Locking plates {{can be used}} in a {{bridging}} mode {{to treat}} fractures by means of secondary bone healing. This requires stimulation by interfragmentary micromotion. Recent data suggest that up to 20 % of fractures fixed with locking plates may encounter suboptimal fracture healing. Three main systems have been developed to improve bone healing, thereby reducing the risks of delayed or nonunion: overdrilling the near cortex; far cortical locking (FCL) screw; and dynamic locking screw (DLS). Overdrilling the near cortex offers a cheap alternative to screw technology by reducing construct stiffness; overdrilling potentially causes repetitive loading and thus has consequences postoperatively such as failure and fatigue. FCL screws reduce construct stiffness and maintain construct strength but cannot be used in dynamic compression mode and therefore, require adequate fracture reduction. DLS is a new generation of locking screw, amalgamating locking technology with dynamic motion with the aim of improving interfragmentary motion at the near cortex.

40|$|Background: Proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> {{deformation}} {{and screw}} fracture is a frequently seen problem for femur interlocking nailing that affects fracture healing. We {{realized that there}} is lack of literature for the right level for the proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw.</b> We investigated the difference of <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> bending resistance between the application of screws on different proximal femoral levels. Materials and Methods: We used a total of 80 proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> for eight groups, 10 screws for each group. Three-point bending tests were performed on four types of screws in two different trochanteric levels (the lesser trochanter and 20 mm proximal). We determined the yield points at three-point bending tests that a permanent deformation started in the <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> using an axial compression testing machine. Results: The mean yield point value of 5 mm threaded <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> applied 20 mm proximal of lesser trochanter was 1022 ± 49 (range 986 – 1057) (mean ± standard deviation, 95 % confidence interval). On the other hand, the mean yield point value of {{the same type of}} <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> applied on the lesser trochanteric level was 2089 ± 249 (range 1911 – 2268).

40|$|Introduction: In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a low-level laser on bone regeneration in rapid maxillary expansion procedures. Methods: Twenty-seven children, aged 8 to 12 years, took part in the experiment, {{with a mean age of}} 10. 2 years, divided into 2 groups: the laser group (n= 14), in which rapid maxillary expansion was performed in conjunction with laser use, and the no-laser group (n= 13), with rapid maxillary expansion only. The activation protocol of the expansion screw was 1 full turn on the first day and a half turn daily until achieving overcorrection. The laser type used was a laser diode (TWIN Laser; MMOptics, Sao Carlos, Brazil), according to the following protocol: 780 nm wavelength, 40 mW power, and 10 J/cm(2) density at 10 points located around the midpalatal suture. The application stages were 1 (days 1 - 5 of activation), 2 (at <b>screw</b> <b>locking,</b> on 3 consecutive days), 3, 4, and 5 (7, 14, and 21 days after stage 2). Occlusal radiographs of the maxilla were taken with the aid of an aluminum scale ruler as a densitometry reference at different times: T 1 (initial), T 2 (day of locking), T 3 (3 - 5 days after T 2), T 4 (30 days after T 3), and T 5 (60 days after T 4). The radiographs were digitized and submitted to imaging software (Image Tool; UTHSCSA, San Antonio, Tex) to measure the optic density of the previously selected areas. To perform the statistical test, analysis of covariance was used, with the time for the evaluated stage as the covariable. In all tests, a significance level of 5 % (P< 0. 05) was adopted. Results: From the evaluation of bone density, the results showed that the laser improved the opening of the midpalatal suture and accelerated the bone regeneration process. Conclusions: The low-level laser, associated with rapid maxillary expansion, provided efficient opening of the midpalatal suture and influenced the bone regeneration process of the suture, accelerating healing.

40|$|Zur Diagnostik von Rupturen der Rotatorenmanschette wird häufig die im Vergleich zur Sonografie deutlich kostenintensivere Magnetresonanztomografie durchgeführt. Ein Grund hierfür ist, dass es zum Teil schwierig ist, standardisierte statische Sonografie-Bilder zu gewinnen, was die reproduzierbare, untersucherunabhängige diagnostische Information verringert. Ziel des ersten Teils der Arbeit war es einerseits, zu analysieren, ob mit der 3 D-Sonografie diese Probleme verringert werden könnten und andererseits die Sensitivität mit dem 2 D-Ultraschall zur Diagnostik von Komplett- und Partialrupturen zu vergleichen. Bei der Untersuchung von 114 Patienten konnten mit dem 3 D-Ultraschall Rupturen der Rotatorenmanschette gut dargestellt werden. Der Vergleich zwischen 2 D- und 3 D-Ultraschall ergab keinen statistisch signifikanten Unterschied zwischen beiden Verfahren für die Diagnostik von Komplett- und Partialrupturen. Ein Vorteil war die Möglichkeit der untersucherunabhängigen simultanen Auswertung von drei standardisierten Schnittebenen zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt. Bei der Verwendung biodegradierbarer Anker zur Fixierung von Weichteilen können ossäre Reaktionen auftreten. Ziel war es, die frühen Reaktionen des umgebenden Gewebes auf einen Poly-(L-co-D/L-Lactid) 70 / 30 Anker im Vergleich zu einem Titananker im Schafsknochen zu analysieren. Innerhalb von 20 Wochen nach Implantation zeigte sich keinerlei Verlust von Knochensubstanz im Bereich des distalen Schafsfemur bei Ankern aus Titan oder aus Polylactid. Vielmehr zeigte sich eine ausgeprägte Neuformation von spongiösem Knochen in die Implantathohlräume vor allem für das biodegradierbare Material. Daher sollten neben materialbedingten Ursachen auch biomechanische Ursachen wie zyklische Belastungen für mögliche Osteolysen in Betracht gezogen werden. Die arthroskopische subacromiale Dekompression (ASD) ist ein häufig durchgeführtes Verfahren zur Therapie von Subachromialsyndromen. Es sollten die eigenen Ergebnisse seit 1993 unter Berücksichtigung von Nebendiagnosen sowie die Möglichkeit, verschiedene Scores und VAS auch telefonisch erheben zu können, analysiert werden. Die Untersuchung von 422 Schultern zwischen 1, 5 und 9, 5 Jahren (durchschnittlich 4, 8 Jahre) nach der Operation zeigte, dass die ASD mit überwiegend guten und sehr guten subjektiven und objektiven Resultaten (ca. 75 %) ein zuverlässiges {{operatives}} Verfahren ist. Im Gegensatz zu einem laufenden Rentenverfahren hatten Rupturen der Rotatorenmanschette zum Zeitpunkt der Operation keinen negativen Einfluss auf das Operationsergebnis. Bei Nichtbeachtung der Pathologie des superioren Labrums und bei Rezidivoperation kam es zu einem erhöhten Anteil an Therapieversagern. Die telefonische Erhebung verschiedener Schulter-Scores (ausgenommen Constant-Score) und der VAS lieferte valide Resultate, die eine klinische Untersuchung entbehrlich machen und insbesondere bei Langzeitstudien eine wesentlich höhere Nachuntersuchungsrate ermöglichen. Das Konzept der winkelstabilen Osteosynthese ermöglicht eine weichteilschonende, minimal-invasive Frakturstabilisierung. Um eine sichere Verankerung von winkelstabilen Schrauben zu erreichen, ist eine korrekte Positionierung der Schraube in der Platte erforderlich. In biomechanischen Testungen konnte gezeigt werden, dass bei einer geringen Abweichung des Insertionswinkels winkelstabiler Schrauben von bis zu 5 ° vom optimalen Winkel immer noch eine hohe Stabilität der Schrauben-/Plattenverbindung gewährleistet war. Ab einem Winkel von über 5 ° kam es zu einer signifikanten Abnahme der Festigkeit dieser Verbindung. Um eine optimale Festigkeit der Verbindung Schraube/Platte zu erreichen und das Risiko der Schraubenlockerung zu minimieren, ist die konsequente Benutzung eines Zielgerätes zu empfehlen. Die klinische Nachuntersuchung von 53 Patienten mit winkelstabiler Osteosynthese bei proximaler Humerusfraktur zeigte eine mit der Literatur vergleichbare Komplikationsrate bei verringertem sekundären Dislokationsrisiko. Es zeigte sich aber auch die Problematik dieser Fakturen mit langer Nachbehandlungsdauer und dem Risiko einer Humeruskopfnekrose im Verlauf. Winkelstabile Implantate ermöglichten eine sichere Stabilisierung von proximalen Humerusfrakturen, konnten jedoch eine insuffiziente Anwendung - wie eine fehlerhafte Verankerung der Kopfverriegelungsschrauben - nicht kompensieren. Erhöht war das Risiko einer Schraubenperforation durch die Sinterung des Kopfes auf das rigide Implantat. Goal of {{the study}} was evaluation of advantages and limitations of shoulder diagnosis and different techniques of minimal invasive shoulder surgery. MRI has become the standard for diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions, since {{it can be difficult to}} obtain standardized ultrasound images. Goal {{of the study}} was analysis of sensitivity of 3 D- in comparison to 2 D-ultrasound. Examination of 114 patients showed excellent visualization of rotor cuff defects with 3 D-ultrasound. Comparison to 2 D-ultrasound showed no statistical significant difference between both methods for diagnosis of full- and partial thickness defects of the rotator cuff. Advantage of 3 D-ultrasound was the possibility of simultaneous visualization of three standardized planes. For the reattachment of ligaments and tendons biodegradable implants are increasingly used today. However, with the use of biodegradable implants early and late osteolysis has been reported. Goal of this study was to analyze the early osseous integration of a newly designed suture anchor in comparison to a titanium implant. The implants made of Poly-(L-co-D/L-lactide) 70 / 30 or titanium were inserted into the cancellous bone of the distal femoral condyle in four sheep. The animals were followed radiographically over a period of 20 weeks in which no final implant degradation was anticipated. After sacrifice new bone formation was quantitatively and local tissue response qualitatively analyzed from microradiographs and histological sections were examined. New bone formation was seen around both implant materials within 20 weeks. Inside the recess of the polylactide suture anchor there was significantly higher bony ingrowth (p = 0. 026) as compared to the titanium implant. Histologically non of the materials did show any inflammatory reaction. These data indicate that early osteolysis around Poly-(L-co-D/L-lactide) 70 / 30 suture anchors in cancellous bone may not be attributable to the material properties but rather to other reasons such as the mechanical situation at the implant-bone interface. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) has become a well established procedure to treat chronic subacromial impingement syndrome. Goal {{of the study was}} to retrospectively evaluate the outcome and to evaluate the validity of data collection by telephone interview. The examination of 422 patients average 4. 8 years after peration showed in 75 % goog and excellent results. The average Constant score (raw score) improved from 46 to 80 Pts. Patients who had a second ASD had good results in only 25 %. Patients with running workers compensation application showed no satisfying outcome. Lesions of the rotator cuff were shown to have no significant influence on the outcome in comparison to patients with intact rotator cuff. Additionally, it was shown that the assessment of various shoulder scores (except Constant Score) by telephone interview is possible. Internal fixators with angular stability have been developed in order to provide high stability without compression of the plate on to the bone. The insertion angle of the screw must correspond precisely to the axis of the screw hole. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the stability of the locked screw-plate on the insertion angle of the <b>screw.</b> <b>Locking</b> screws were inserted in a isolated or combined locking hole with the use of an aiming device. The screws were inserted with an axis deviation of 0 °(optimal condition), 5 ° and 10 °. The samples were tested under shear or axial (push out) loading conditions until failure occurred. Locking screws inserted in the isolated locking hole (PC-Fix) showed a significant decrease of failure load if inserted at 5 ° and 10 ° angle. Screws inserted in the combined locking hole (LCP) also showed a significant decrease of push-out force of 77 % with 10 ° axis deviation. A locking head screw exhibits a high stability with a moderate axis deviation in the angle of insertion of up to 5 °. However there is a significant decrease in stability with increasing axis deviation (> 5 °). A aiming device is recommended to provide an optimal fixation with angular stability. Clinical Examination of 53 patients with angular stable osteosynthesis of proximal humeral fractures showed a rate of complications, which can be compared with literature with lower risk of secondary dislocation.

The [...] "Scandinavian" [...] design was so successful that JHW Climax & Co. of Newark, New Jersey continued to make these padlocks until the 1950s. Today, other countries are still manufacturing this style of padlock.|$|R
40|$|Premature {{failure of}} either the nail and/or <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> with {{unstable}} fracture patterns may lead to angulation, shortening, malunion, and IM nail migration. Up to thirty percent of all unreamed nail <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> can break after initial weight bearing is allowed at 8 – 10 weeks if union has not occurred. The primary problem this presents is hardware removal during revision surgery. The purposes of our study was to evaluate the relative fatigue resistance of distal <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> and bolts from representative manufacturers of tibial IM nail systems, and develop a relative risk assessment of screws and materials used. Evaluations included quantitative and qualitative measures of the relative performance of these screws...|$|R

A unique feature that distinguishes this implant from other double-axis systems is the alternative configuration of the cephalic screws, with either two parallel sliding screws or two convergent <b>screws</b> <b>locked</b> to the nail. This design allows the surgeon to select, depending {{on the degree of}} stability present once the fracture is reduced, the configuration of screws to use. It was hypothesized that the full range of pertrochanteric fractures could be treated satisfactorily with an intramedullary device that offers either a double-axis sliding or locked converging pattern of screws into the femoral neck.|$|R
