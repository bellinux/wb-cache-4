5|$|The Bulls {{were led}} offensively by the triple threat of quarterback Drew Willy, running back James Starks, and wide {{receiver}} Namaan Roosevelt. The three combined to break 14single-season school records, including most points scored in a season (404). Willy, heading into his final game as a Buffalo Bull, had already surpassed the 3,000-yard mark in passing on the season, throwing for 25touchdowns against only fiveinterceptions. Starks, while not <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> same caliber of player as UConn's Donald Brown, had run for over 1,300yards and caught 41passes for 340yards, scoring 16touchdowns on the year. Roosevelt was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> top playmaker, going over the 100-yard mark in each of Buffalo's last fivegames and scoring {{at least once in}} his last seven.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is now <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} Confucian ethics, elite and cultured scholar-officials viewed {{themselves}} as the pinnacle members of society (second only to the imperial family). Rural farmers were <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> essential pillars that provided food for all of society; they were given more respect than the local or regional merchant, no matter how rich and powerful. The Confucian-taught scholar-official elite who ran China's vast bureaucracy viewed their society's growing interest in commercialism {{as a sign of}} moral decay. Nonetheless, Song Chinese urban society was teeming with wholesalers, shippers, storage keepers, brokers, traveling salesmen, retail shopkeepers, peddlers, and many other lowly commercial-based vocations.|$|E
