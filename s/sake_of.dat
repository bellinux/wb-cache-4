At traditional formal meals, it is considered an equivalent to rice and is not simultaneously taken with other rice-based dishes, although this notion is typically no longer applied to modern, refined, premium ("ginjo") sake, which bear {{little resemblance to the}} <b>sakes</b> <b>of</b> even 100 years ago.

In the drama, after acquiring Aravan's approval, Krishna approaches Aravan's mother, Ulupi—Nagakanni or Nakakanni ("Serpent maiden") in Tamil, for her consent.

50|$|Having taken what {{he needs}} from the marionettes, he allows them to escape from his ship as he prepares for launch. However, the massive {{energies}} released by the Neo-Mesopotamia cause an earthquake that starts to rip apart the surface of Terra 2. The marionettes decide that they cannot allow Doctor Hess to get away, both for the <b>sakes</b> <b>of</b> the lives he has destroyed on Terra 2, and for the <b>sakes</b> <b>of</b> those on Earth who will die if he succeeds. They manage to re board the ship and confront Doctor Hess, {{only to discover that}} it does not matter if they defeat him: the Neo-Mesopotamia has been rigged with a massive nuclear device, capable of wiping out an entire planet. The undaunted marionettes continue to fight against Doctor Hess, but are interrupted as the ship leaves the wormhole’s exit to the solar system and are struck by the massive chunks of icy debris that make up the rings of Saturn. In the near distance, they see the derelict of another ship, which Doctor Hess is shocked to realize is all that remains of the original Frontier Project ship. Doctor Hess is overcome with the horrifying realization that all of his plans for revenge were based on a misunderstanding: instead of being abandoned as he had thought, it turns out he was the only survivor.|$|R
60|$|Why, then, you may ask, do I {{say that}} I am bound to Germany by {{the ties that}} hold my nature most strongly? Very simply because I should have perished of despair in my youth but for the world created for me by that great German dynasty which began with Bach and will perhaps not end with Richard Strauss. Do not suppose {{for a moment that}} I learnt my art from English men of letters. True, they showed me how to handle English words; but if I had known no more than that, my works would never have crossed the Channel. My masters were the masters of a {{universal}} language: they were, to go from summit to summit, Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Wagner. Had the Germans understood any of these men, they would have hanged them. Fortunately they did not understand them, and therefore only neglected them until they were dead, after which they learnt to dance to their tunes with an easy conscience. For their sakes Germany stands consecrated as the Holy Land of the capitalist age, just as Italy, for its painters' sakes, is the Holy Land of the early unvulgarized Renascence; France, for its builders' <b>sakes,</b> <b>of</b> the age of Christian chivalry and faith; and Greece, for its sculptors' <b>sakes,</b> <b>of</b> the Periclean age.|$|R
