5|$|In 2003, the Little Butte Creek Watershed Council {{rated the}} health of the Little Butte Creek {{watershed}} on a scale of 1 (slightly degraded) to 5 (<b>severely</b> <b>degraded).</b> Overall, the watershed received 2.95, or moderately degraded. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for Little Butte Creek at RM 1.4 (RK 2.3) between 1998 and 2007 was 72 (poor) in the summer and 82 (fair) in the fall, winter, and spring.|$|E
5|$|While the golden-crowned sifaka faces few {{biological}} threats, such as predation, {{it faces}} many significant human-caused (anthropogenic) threats. Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> grasslands. By 1985 {{it was estimated}} that 34% of the entire eastern rainforest of the island had disappeared, and by extrapolation it is predicted that at this rate of deforestation there will be no eastern rainforest left by 2020. Illegal logging practices, slash-and-burn agriculture (known as tavy), uncontrolled grass fires, gold mining, poaching, and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant deforestation witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species.|$|E

30|$|When TCP {{downlink}} {{traffic is}} the dominant type of traffic in the RoF-based and legacy WLANs, TCP-DATA frames transmitted by the RoF AP could suffer from the frame collisions. Accordingly, this <b>severely</b> <b>degrades</b> the TCP throughput performance of the RoF-based WLAN.|$|R
50|$|The first {{proof-of-concept}} SAFCs {{were developed}} in 2000 using cesium hydrogen sulfate (CsHSO4). However, fuel cells using acid sulfates as an electrolyte result in byproducts that <b>severely</b> <b>degrade</b> the fuel cell anode, which leads to diminished power output after only modest usage.|$|R
5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and standing water in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is <b>severely</b> <b>degraded.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} of railway infrastructure in Vietnam, although improving, is still poor enough overall to require rehabilitation. Rail transport only {{became a national}} priority for the Vietnamese government around the mid-1990s, at which point most of the railway network was <b>severely</b> <b>degraded,</b> having received only temporary repair from damages suffered during decades of war.|$|E
25|$|The March 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq produced further degradation of Iraq’s water supply, sewerage and electrical supply systems. Treatment plants, pumping stations and generating stations were {{stripped of their}} equipment, supplies and electrical wiring by looters. The once-capable cadre of engineers and operating technicians were scattered or left the country. Reconstruction efforts faced a nation with a <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|Until 1988, {{the park}} land had been privately owned. However, {{the area had}} been <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> with lakes and canals going dry and the {{salinity}} and pollution of the remaining water making farming nearly impossible. The pollution was primarily coming from the Buenaventura River, with carried with it dirty water from other rivers {{in the south of}} the city. By the 1980s, these chinampa farmers had been prohibited from growing any edible plants on their lands.|$|E
25|$|Historic logging {{activity}} in the South Fork watershed has stripped steep hillsides bare of vegetation, resulting in chronic erosion problems. Historically, South Fork Eel River water had an unusual translucent blue-green hue {{for most of the}} year. Increased turbidity levels caused by erosion has transformed the river into a generally brownish or tannish color. The South Fork is an important Northern California habitat for anadromous fish (see section below) and sediment has <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> conditions for these fish as well as other aquatic life forms.|$|E
25|$|After the Second World War, there {{began to}} be an {{unprecedented}} demand for telephone services. In addition, there was {{the need to make}} comprehensive repairs, and upgrades to a network which had been <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> by war, and lack of investment. Waiting lists for new telephone lines quickly emerged, and persisted for several decades. To alleviate the situation, the Post Office began to provide shared service lines, each known as a party line. Most of the line was shared between two subscribers usually splitting off to each within sight of the houses, and both lines attracted a small discount; however, this arrangement had its disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|When using a port {{multiplier}} in {{a scenario}} where {{the availability of}} the connected drives is an issue, overall reliability can be severely impacted by a single failing drive locking up the host port, inhibiting or <b>severely</b> <b>degrading</b> access to all drives connected through that port.|$|R
30|$|Polymer {{solution}} {{must maintain}} high viscosity to mobilize oil in reservoir. However, high shearing, high temperature, high salinity and hardness often exist in oil reservoirs and production systems. The polymer can <b>severely</b> <b>degrade</b> under these harsh conditions, {{which is the}} major issue facing polymer flooding operation (Gao 2011).|$|R
30|$|For {{commercial}} EOR projects, HPAM is {{the most}} commonly injected polymer. However, HPAM is rather sensitive to salinity and temperature (Gao 2013, 2014). As a result, HPAM <b>severely</b> <b>degrades</b> when injected into high temperature reservoirs containing high salinity water. This indeed limits the industrial adoption of polymer EOR method.|$|R
25|$|The outer trough zone has {{the radius}} of 1500 to 1900km; its outer {{boundary}} {{is not well}} defined. It consists of wide double walled sinuous lineaments (troughs), which like inner troughs appear to be graben. Although these grabens are wider (up to 30km) {{than those in the}} inner trough zone, they are <b>severely</b> <b>degraded,</b> and are made of a series of small knobs, much like their inner counterparts. There are no indications of volcanic flows or other signs of endogenic activity associated with the graben on the high resolution Galileo images as was suggested based on the lower resolution Voyager images. So, all structures within Valhalla basin have impact or tectonic origin.|$|E
25|$|In North America the {{situation}} is comparable. There is a significant problem with light pollution ranging from the Canadian Maritime Provinces to the American Southwest. The International Dark-Sky Association works to designate areas that have high quality night skies. These areas are supported by communities and organizations that are dedicated to reducing light pollution (e.g.Dark-sky preserve). The National Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division has measured night sky quality in national park units across the U.S. Sky quality in the U.S. ranges from pristine (Capitol Reef National Park and Big Bend National Park) to <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> (Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and Biscayne National Park). The National Park Service Night Sky Program monitoring database is available online (2015).|$|E
25|$|In the Indian subcontinent, tigers inhabit {{tropical}} moist evergreen forests, {{tropical dry}} forests, tropical and subtropical moist deciduous forests, mangroves, subtropical and temperate upland forests, and alluvial grasslands. Latter habitat once covered a huge swath of grassland, riverine and moist semi-deciduous forests along the major river {{system of the}} Gangetic and Brahmaputra plains, but has now been largely converted to agricultural land or <b>severely</b> <b>degraded.</b> Today, {{the best examples of}} this habitat type are limited to a few blocks {{at the base of the}} outer foothills of the Himalayas including the Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs) Rajaji-Corbett, Bardia-Banke, and the transboundary TCUs Chitwan-Parsa-Valmiki, Dudhwa-Kailali and Shuklaphanta-Kishanpur. Tiger densities in these TCUs are high, in part because of the extraordinary biomass of ungulate prey.|$|E
30|$|FAR can <b>severely</b> <b>degrade</b> PUs {{performance}} {{and reduce the}} overall system resource utilization. However, with increasing PU interference tolerance, PUs performance improves as well. SU residual interference was found to decrease the detection probability resulting in a low PU performance. Extensive simulations validate the analytical model, demonstrating excellent agreement with the theoretical results.|$|R
30|$|Typically, {{the quality}} of service offered over a DVB-S 2 channel is subject to tropospheric phenomena, such as rain and clouds, {{as well as the}} {{influence}} of atmospheric gas. Both can <b>severely</b> <b>degrade</b> {{the quality of}} the transmission channel. These effects can have an influence on the long-term distribution of the channel attenuation statistics.|$|R

As non-zeros CFOs introduce ICI and MUI, which <b>severely</b> <b>degrade</b> the overall system performance, CFO estimation and compensation must be performed before channel estimation, equalization, and subsequent receiver processes as shown in Figure 1.|$|R
25|$|The Discovery {{quadrangle}} {{lies within}} the heavily cratered part of Mercury {{in a region}} roughly antipodal to the 1550-km-wide Caloris Basin. Like {{the rest of the}} heavily cratered part of the planet, the quadrangle contains a spectrum of craters and basins ranging in size from those at the limit of resolution of the best photographs (200 m) to those as much as 350km across, and ranging in degree of freshness from pristine to <b>severely</b> <b>degraded.</b> Interspersed with the craters and basins both in space and time are plains deposits that are probably of several different origins. Because of its small size and very early segregation into core and crust, Mercury has seemingly been a dead planet for a long time—possibly longer than the Moon. Its geologic history, therefore, records with considerable clarity some of the earliest and most violent events {{that took place in the}} inner Solar System.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to poor states of preservation, the poor impression modern listeners may get of wax cylinders is from their early date, which can compare unfavorably to recordings made even {{a dozen years}} later. Other than a single playable example from 1878 (from an experimental phonograph-clock), the oldest playable preserved cylinders are from the year 1888. These include a <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> recording of Johannes Brahms, Handel's Israel in Egypt and a short speech by Sir Arthur Sullivan in fairly listenable condition. Somewhat later are the almost unlistenable 1889 amateur recordings of Nina Grieg. The problem with the wax cylinders is that they readily support the growth of mildew which penetrates throughout the cylinder and, if serious enough, renders the recording unplayable. The earliest preserved rubber disc recordings are children's records, featuring animal noises and nursery rhymes. This means that the earliest disc recordings most music lovers will hear are shellac discs made after 1900, after {{more than ten years}} of development.|$|E

500|$|The panel {{consists}} of a single [...] oak board, cut vertically down close to the painted surface. It has a small unpainted area at the upper left. The support's encasing was probably changed in the 19th century; today four of the eight supports are fixed {{to the edges of}} the interior borders, forming inner mouldings. The other four act as inner pins. The varnish is <b>severely</b> <b>degraded,</b> with key areas of paint and ground either removed or overpainted. Infrared photography of the reverse reveals traces of short vertical hatching and underdrawings, but no hint as to the identity of the sitter. Its ground is mostly chalk-based; the pigments are predominantly blacks, red lake, and blues. The final portrait differs in many ways from the underdrawing– the fingers are shorter, the right thumb and the parapet are lower, and the right arm once extended over a larger area. In the final portrait, the ear is elevated, and the scroll occupies a larger pictorial space. Analysis of the pigment shows that the flesh of his face is painted with whites and vermilion, and traced with greys, blacks, blues, and some ultramarine over a red-lake glaze.|$|E
2500|$|... yields impact: Recent {{increases}} in the human population have placed a great strain on the world's soil systems. More than 6 billion people are now using about 38% of the land area of the Earth to raise crops and livestock. Many soils suffer from various types of degradation, that can ultimately reduce their ability to produce food resources. Slight degradation refers to land where yield potential has been reduced by 10%, moderate degradation refers to a yield decrease from 10-50%. <b>Severely</b> <b>degraded</b> soils have lost more than 50% of their potential.
