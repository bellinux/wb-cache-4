The main road bent south along the east {{bank of the river}} to Pugong-ni and then turned {{northeast}} to Changnyong. A northern <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> curved around marshland and lakes, the largest of which was Lake U-p'o, to Changnyong. In effect, the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach routes to Changnyong.|$|E

25|$|Withdrawal {{seemed to}} be the Chinese intention. The 3d Division met only light {{resistance}} when it resumed its attack from the south on March 25 and advanced two miles (3km) beyond the hills where strong Chinese positions had delayed it the day before. The tank company of the 65th Infantry meanwhile moved ahead on Route 3X, a <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> angling northwest off Route 33 to Sinch'on, in an attempt to contact the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team. Mines along the road disabled four tanks and kept the company from reaching its destination, but it encountered no enemy positions.

25|$|At 5:30am, Croatian special police {{moved through}} {{a gap in}} the RSK defences, between the 98th Infantry Brigade facing Novska and the Tactical Group 1 (TG1) {{defending}} Jasenovac, disrupting the integrity of RSK positions, and outflanking the 98th Brigade on the Novska–Okučani axis of the HV attack, where a battalion of the 1st Guards advanced along a <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> parallel to the motorway, while one battalion from the 2nd Guards and the 3rd Guards Brigades each advanced east on the motorway itself, crushing the RSK defence. At 1pm, the commanding officer of the RSK 98th Infantry Brigade left the unit and reported to the Corps commander that the brigade was in disarray, citing heavy losses. The HV attack aimed at capturing Jasenovac was a two-pronged advance of the 125th Home Guard Regiment supported by the special police south and east from Bročice and Drenov Bok. The TG1 offered no significant resistance, and the HV captured Jasenovac between noon and 1pm. In the afternoon, the RSK authorities in Okučani permitted the evacuation of civilians; however, the civilians were quickly joined by retreating elements of the 98th and the 54th Brigades. The TG1 retreated south across the Sava River. After capture of Jasenovac, the HV 125th Home Guards Regiment and the special police advanced eastward along the Sava River.|$|E
25|$|In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, {{the highway}} {{followed}} {{what is now}} M-129 from Sault Ste. Marie to Pickford and then west to follow a short portion of former U.S. Route 2, replaced by Mackinaw Trail. It crossed the Straits of Mackinac and then used what is now U.S. Route 23 and old U.S. Route 10 to Detroit. Currently it still exists in Michigan as {{the name of a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> from Saginaw southeast to the county line (as an alternate route to Flint), from southeast Flint to northwest Pontiac, and from Flat Rock southwest to Monroe ending at the state line. A short section of the Dixie Highway in northwest lower Michigan running north from Eastport in Antrim County to the village of Norwood in Charlevoix County is named Old Dixie Highway—U.S. Route 31 parallels this road to the east. In Ohio, it was old U.S. Route 25 to Cincinnati, current U.S. Route 25 and U.S. Route 25W to Knoxville, and U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 27 to Chattanooga. The eastern division took a more direct route than the western between Chattanooga and Atlanta, following the modern U.S. Route 41 all the way, but it followed a more circuitous path south of Atlanta. Traffic left Atlanta to the east on U.S. Route 278, following U.S. Route 441, Georgia State Route 24, a short section of U.S. Route 301, and Georgia State Route 21 to Savannah. There, the route turned south along the coast via U.S. Route 17 to Jacksonville and U.S. Route 1 to Miami. It is today (2016) a major street in towns and cities along the Florida East Coast.|$|E

500|$|North Carolina Highway 2A (NC 2A) was a {{state highway}} located in {{southern}} Moore County, in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The highway traveled from an intersection with U.S. Route 1 (US 1), now May Street, northward through portions of Manly and Southern Pines to an intersection with NC 22 (now US 1). The highway was first listed {{as part of the}} Moore County road system by at least 1930. The route was improved to a paved surface by 1936. NC 2A was numbered sometime between 1945 and 1949.

Hambleton was concealed by a low fog bank as he landed in a dry rice paddy, unseen by the NVA troops. As Jankowski observed Hambleton land, his aircraft came under heavy antiaircraft fire. He was astonished at the huge number of NVA troops, equipment, and heavy weapons in the area. Hambleton found refuge in a group of bushes {{in the middle of the}} rice paddy.
