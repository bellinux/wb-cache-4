The effects of {{grain size reduction}} on the inhibition performance of sodium phosphate were investigated using polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The crystal grain <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> brushed surface was analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The electrochemical tests were conducted in artificial sea water (ASW) in the presence and absence of 250 mg/lit sodium phosphate (SP). The wire brushed surface indicated considerable deformed plastic flows and high surface roughness. Due to the accumulated strains, a deformed layer with thickness of 20 ± 5 μm was produced and the crystal grain size of severe deformed zone was about 28 nm. Wire brushed surface increased uniform corrosion rate of mild steel due to enhanced surface roughness and preferential sites to adsorption of corrosive ions. However, the wire brushed surface showed {{a positive effect on}} inhibition performance of sodium phosphate. The electrochemical results revealed that average inhibition efficiency increased from 65 to about 80 percent in ASW solution containing 1. 5 mM Na 3 PO 4 for coarse grained samples in comparison to that of ultra-fined grain samples respectively.

(2) To establish clinical guidelines for an orthodontist to produce high quality resistance spot-welded joints of a beta titanium wires. Materials and methods : The samples {{of this study}} constituted of TMA wires welded in a T-joint configuration. The TMA wires procured were 0. 018 inch, 0. 032 inch round wires and 0. 016 × 0. 025 inch and 0. 019 inch × 0. 025 inch rectangular wires, four samples of each <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> were made for each level of power setting of the welder: Level I, level II, level III and level IV. The welded specimens were tested to failure in a torsional loading mode thought to {{be representative of the}} T-joint failure observed clinically. A torque gauge with a range of 0 to 30 (×) gm/mm was used, angular deflections were read directly from a 3600 protractor built into the equipment. Results : All five-wire size combinations in the present study exhibited similar behavior. Ultimate moment and the maximum angular deflection at failure site showed it {{is a function of the}} weld voltage setting for 0. 018, 0. 032, 0. 016 × 0. 022, 0. 017 × 0. 025, 0. 019 × 0. 025 and 0. 018 and 0. 017 × 0. 025 inch TMA wires. Voltage settings below optimal resulted in low strengths and separation of the wires, whereas higher than optimal gave good strength values but low ductility with failure occurring in the wire adjacent to the joint. The least torque value for 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch, 0. 017 × 0. 025 inch, 0. 019 × 0. 025 inch was observed in level I and maximum torque was seen in level IV. Conclusion : Resistance spot-welding (RSW) of various sizes of TMA wire results in weld joints having strengths and ductilities comparable to those for the unwelded base material.

An empirical {{investigation into}} the transfer of prestress force from wire tendons to concrete in the end zones of pretensioned prestressed concrete beams was accomplished in this project. The experimental tests featured 56 small scale prestressed concrete beams. Some of the factors influencing prestress transfer which were considered in the current tests are as follows:(a) type of release - gradual, sudden or shock(b) surface condition of the wire - plain or indented(c) size of the wire(d) concrete compressive strength {{at the time of}} transfer(e) time dependent effectsMost of the tests involved gradual release of steel tendons with the prestressing force transferred in approximately ten equal increments. Sudden release in a single step was achieved by allowing the supporting abutments to retract rapidly. Shock release was implemented in some beams by angle grinding the wires. The type of release which gave the best quality of prestress transfer was gradual release. This was followed by sudden and shock releases respectively. There were four types of wires used in the laboratory tests: namely the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron indented, 7 mm dia. Plain and 7 mm dia. Belgian indented wires. Transmission lengths were determined from strain distributions for these wires. Pull-ins of the wire tendons at the ends of the beams were also measured. There was significant scatter in the experimental data. Different ranges of transmission lengths and pull-ins were obtained for the various types of wires used. Three equations were derived for the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron and 7 mm dia. Plain wires, which linearly correlated pull-ins to the transmission lengths. ++These relationships provide a qualitative and quantitative method of indirectly monitoring for the transmission lengths through the measurements of pull-in. Statistical inference tests proved that indented wires were superior in performance compared to plain wires, but the differences were more apparent for the pull-ins than for the transmission lengths. Comparisons on the influence of tendon size substantiated that greater pull-ins occurred for larger wires but the differences were not significant for the transmission lengths. For concrete strength at the time of transfer of less than 32 MPa, the transmission lengths and pull-ins were significantly larger than those for higher strengths. It is recommended that concrete strength at transfer be at least 32 MPa for pretensioned prestressed concrete. Apart from the maturity and strength of concrete, the quality of a mix also influenced the transmission length and there was limited data to suggest that a better grade mix despite having lower strength at a more tender age could outperform a lower grade mix with greater strength released after a longer curing period. Formulae for plain and indented wires were found by dimensional analysis which correlated the transmission length to the diameter of wire tendon and the stress/strength ratio of the prestressed beams. Pull-ins increased significantly over 6 months but the changes in the transmission lengths were small. Normalised longitudinal strain distributions did not indicate that transmission lengths would remain unchanged over time...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Though sliding {{techniques}} are quite common in orthodontics, the produced friction however hampers ideal movement of teeth. Increased friction not only necessitates a greater orthodontic force but also results in anchorage loss. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate frictional changes of steel brackets on stainless steel wires while sliding. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study a total of 69 stainless steel brackets (Dentaurum) with 0. 018 inch slots were randomly divided into three groups of 23 brackets. With each group either 0. 016 or 0. 016 × 0. 016 or 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch steel <b>wires</b> <b>of</b> the same company (Dentaurum) were used in combination with brackets. There were 5 slots on each piece and every slot was 1 mm apart from the next. Therefore each piece <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> was pulled via Dartec machine in every bracket slot with an average speed of 0. 5 mm/min in five sections. The amounts of friction were recorded. The collected data were then compared with repeated measurement ANOVA and paired sample T-test. (α = 0. 05) Three brackets were randomly examined under scanning electron microscope (SEM) at the beginning and after the first, the third and the fifth tractions. Results: Repeated measurement ANOVA showed statistical significant differences in static and kinetic frictions between first to fifth tractions in three <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires.</b> Based on paired sample t-test, significant differences were seen between first traction and the others. However, differences between the third and the forth, the third and the fifth and the forth and the fifth tractions were not significant between the three <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> and the two kinds of frictions.

It is shown that among all possible orderings <b>of</b> signal <b>wires,</b> a monotonic {{order of the}} signals according to their effective driver resistance yields the smallest weighted average delay. Minimizing weighted average delay is a good approximation for MinMax delay optimization. Three variants of monotonic ordering are proven to be optimal, depending on the MCF ratio between the signals {{at the sides of}} the bundle and that <b>of</b> the internal <b>wires.</b> The monotonic order property holds for a very broad range of VLSI circuit settings arising in common design practice. A simple, yet nearoptimal, setting <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> widths within the bundle to yield the best average weighted delay is proposed. The theoretical results have been validated by numerical experiments on 65 nanometer process technology and industrial design data.
