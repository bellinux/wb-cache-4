5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} there were 600 ships in the Persian fleet, {{provided}} by the Phoenicians (who were most eager to fight), the Egyptians, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued. The Persian fleet may have been commanded by the veteran Median general Datis; Persian records <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that he was sent by Darius to Ionia at around {{about the time of}} Lade. However, Herodotus does not name any Persian commanders in this campaign.|$|E
5|$|While both {{settings}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Madonna's characters live in {{the barrio}} and may be Latina themselves, the portrayal of Madonna in the dancing scenes (lush, flashy, colorful) contrasts with the Latinos in the street (sparsely worn out dresses). She dances around and even flirts but does not get really involved with them as the last scene shows Madonna dancing off the screen. The video symbolizes the link between Latino culture and Catholicism. The two characters symbolize the restrained and passionate sides of Catholicism, which author Rettenmund has described as Madonna's take on the religion.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left his}} command to General Belliard on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty {{was a part}} of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On the road to the capital, they were {{attacked}} by a pulk of Cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made a run for it towards the river Aisne. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, he stood up and swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that his health was not the main reason of his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the Battle of Craonne and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{numerous}} honours and endowments that General Nansouty received {{following the}} Battle of Friedland <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the Emperor's appreciation {{and the fact}} that Napoleon did not regard the early incident during this battle as Nansouty's fault. On 11 July 1807, General of Division Nansouty was named Grand Aigle de la Légion d'Honneur, the fifth and top rank of this order, reserved for the greatest general officers. This also brought an annual revenue of 20,000 Francs. His first endowment of 12,846 Francs was offered on 30 June 1807, and was paid by the Duchy of Warsaw. On 23 September, he received another 5,882 Francs on the Empire's Grand Livre. A count of the Empire from 10 March 1808, Nansouty was offered two additional endowments, one of 25,000 Francs, paid by the Kingdom of Westphalia, and the second of 10,000 Francs, paid by the Zeven domain in Hannover. He also received an endowment of 100,000 Francs for the acquisition of a Parisian Hôtel particulier; Nansouty bought the Hôtel du Président Duret in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a neighbourhood inhabited by the new elite of Imperial France. Indeed, first-rate military figures such as the Viceroy of Italy Eugène, Marshals Davout and Lannes and Generals Rapp and Legrand also acquired residences in Faubourg Saint-Germain.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, these clues would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> Coucher de soleil no. 1 {{was painted}} during the later months of 1905, or early 1906, just before Metzinger and Robert Delaunay began {{painting}} portraits of one another, rather than circa 1908 {{as indicated by}} the Kröller-Müller Museum.|$|E
25|$|Differences in sex {{determination}} {{are controlled by}} sex chromosomes. Sex hormonal releases {{have a significant effect}} on sexual dimorphisms (phenotypic differentiation of sexual characteristics) of the brain. Recent studies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that regulating these dimorphisms has implications for understanding normal and abnormal brain function. Sexual dimorphisms may be significantly influenced by sex-based brain gene expression which varies from species to species.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a common origin for the Negrito and Negrillo, including short stature, dark skin, scant body hair, and occasional steatopygia. The {{claim that the}} Andamanese more closely resemble African pygmies than other Austronesian populations in their cranial morphology {{in a study of}} 1973 added some weight to this theory, before genetic studies pointed to a closer relationship with their neighbours.|$|E

25|$|However, the Dorians {{seem to have}} revered Helios, {{offering}} the central mainland cultus for Helios. The scattering of cults of the sun god in Sicyon, Argos, Ermioni, Epidaurus and Laconia, and his holy livestock flocks at Taenarum, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the deity was considerably important in Dorian religion, compared {{to other parts of}} ancient Greece. Additionally, {{it may have been the}} Dorians to import his worship to Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|Androgynous and {{hermaphroditic}} {{men were}} {{heavily involved in}} the cult of Ishtar. Kurgarrū and assinnu were servants of Ishtar who dressed in female clothing and performed war dances in Ishtar's temples. Several Akkadian proverbs <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that they may have}} also engaged in homosexual intercourse. Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian hijra. In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women.|$|E
25|$|Various brain {{disorders}} implicate {{the role}} of unconscious brain processes in decision making tasks. Auditory hallucinations produced by Schizophrenia <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a divergence of will and behaviour. The left brain of people whose hemispheres have been disconnected has been observed to invent explanations for body movement initiated by the opposing (right) hemisphere, perhaps {{based on the assumption}} that their actions are consciously willed. Likewise, people with 'alien hand syndrome' are known to conduct complex motor movements against their will.|$|E

25|$|However, the Biblical {{quotations}} {{she chose}} {{were for the}} title page were highly provocative. The first, , reports the challenge of David to Goliath. The other was , referring to the Jael, who smashed the skull of {{an enemy of the}} Israelites. Both <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the age of power and authority is to give way to one of rule by consent and the reversal of order may be suggesting specifically that monarchy is giving way to one of more diffuse localised, authority.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} their kings, such as Ambiorix and Catuvolcus, are {{undoubtedly}} Celtic. Also the material culture of the region, has been found by archaeologists to be highly Celtised, clearly {{in contact with the}} Celts of central Gaul, though far less rich in terms of Mediterranean luxury goods. They were not so strongly linked to the east of the Rhine. This would at the very least <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that at least the upper echelons were Celtic or had adopted a Celtic language and culture.|$|E
25|$|Around 80 BC, an Indo-Scythian king named Maues, {{possibly}} a {{general in the}} service of the Indo-Greeks, ruled for a few years in northwestern India before the Indo-Greeks again took control. He seems to have been married to an Indo-Greek princess named Machene. King Hippostratus (65–55 BC) seems to have been one of the most successful subsequent Indo-Greek kings until he lost to the Indo-Scythian Azes I, who established an Indo-Scythian dynasty in 48/47 BC. Various coins <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that some sort of alliance may have taken place between the Indo-Greeks and the Scythians.|$|E

25|$|In electromagnetism, {{permittivity}} or absolute permittivity, usually {{denoted by}} the Greek letter ε (epsilon), {{is the measure}} of resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field in a particular medium. More specifically, permittivity describes the amount of charge needed to generate one unit of electric flux in a particular medium. Accordingly, a charge will yield more electric flux in a medium with low permittivity than in a medium with high permittivity. Thus, permittivity is the measure of a material's ability to resist an electric field, not its ability to ‘permit’ it (as the name ‘permittivity’ might <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest).</b>|$|E
25|$|Some studies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that the}} longer a patient is on {{dialysis}} before the transplant, the less time the kidney will last. It is not clear why this occurs, but it underscores the need for rapid referral to a transplant program. Ideally, a kidney transplant should be pre-emptive, i.e., take place before the patient begins dialysis. The reason why kidneys fail over time after transplantation has been elucidated in recent years. Apart from recurrence of the original kidney disease, also rejection (mainly antibody-mediated rejection) and progressive scarring (multifactorial) play a decisive role. Avoiding rejection by strict medication adherence is of utmost importance to avoid failure of the kidney transplant.|$|E
25|$|Officially, Daniil died at 1 AM on November 17, 1962 (1960 in some sources), at Aiud prison hospital, having {{suffered}} a stroke that left him comatose—afflictions which, in themselves, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that he had been}} severely beaten in confinement. Prison records have it that, since 1959, he had been under medical supervision for hypertonia. However, it is unlikely that he was ever administered the medicine specified in his chart, which appears to have been forged and backdated. The hieromonk's body {{is said to have been}} dumped at the nearby Trei Plopi burial site, an iron spike driven through his heart by prison guards who meant to certify Tudor's death.|$|E
50|$|Recent studies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> vindicate {{its status}} as a stem-loon; {{alongside}} Neogaeornis and some unnamed antarctic spcimens, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a gondwannan origin for this clade, possibly displaced northwards by early penguins.|$|R
