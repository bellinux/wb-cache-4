50|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>harmonic</b> motion {{can serve}} as a {{mathematical}} model for a variety of motions, such as the oscillation of a spring. In addition, other phenomena can be approximated by <b>simple</b> <b>harmonic</b> motion, including the motion of a simple pendulum as well as molecular vibration. <b>Simple</b> <b>harmonic</b> motion is typified by the motion of a mass on a spring when it is subject to the linear elastic restoring force given by Hooke's Law. The motion is sinusoidal in time and demonstrates a single resonant frequency. For <b>simple</b> <b>harmonic</b> motion to be an accurate model for a pendulum, the net force on the object {{at the end of the}} pendulum must be proportional to the displacement. This is a good approximation when the angle of the swing is small.|$|R

40|$|Here {{we develop}} {{a model for}} the {{relativistic}} spring. We examine the effects of revising the <b>simple</b> <b>harmonic</b> oscillator to include relativistic momentum and a delayed force law. These corrections alter two of the most significant features of the <b>simple</b> <b>harmonic</b> oscillator: energy conservation and a constant period independent of initial conditions. The relativistic momentum correction, while preserving energy conservation, does not have period independent of initial conditions. The delayed force law, while preserving period independence, does not conserve energy. Applying both corrections creates a solution with increasing amplitude and increasing period, a result that {{is very different from the}} traditional <b>simple</b> <b>harmonic</b> oscillator.
