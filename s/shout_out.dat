500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would <b>shout</b> <b>out</b> in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E
