The <b>screenshots</b> depicted {{different areas of the}} asylum and victims in their traps. The videos demonstrated the first hour or so of the game and included certain gameplay elements.

By 2009, only 700,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 270,000 in the United States. and the bulk in PAL regions, Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt {{the marketing of}} the game, as {{at the time of}} the game's release, promotion of video games were primarily done through <b>screenshots,</b> and as Ico lacked any heads-up display, it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers.|$|E

5|$|Players can add non-Steam {{games to}} their libraries, {{allowing}} {{the game to}} be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free-of-charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game overlay that can be accessed by a keystroke. From the overlay, the user can access his or her Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a beta version, the overlay also allows players to take <b>screenshots</b> of the games in process; it automatically stores these and allows the player to review, delete, or share them during or after his or her game session. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could share <b>screenshots</b> on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit straight from a user's screenshot manager.|$|E

5|$|Sonic Team began {{development}} {{of the game in}} 2006, after having begun work on the core technology, the Hedgehog Engine, in 2005.

The game was developed internally by Sonic Team in Japan. It was originally intended to be the third installment of the Sonic Adventure series and subsequently, at an early development stage, had the working title Sonic World Adventure, complete with work-in-progress logo. However, the development team began to introduce enough new innovations to separate it from the Sonic Adventure titles, and so a new title, Sonic Unleashed, was decided upon. It was then later revealed that the game's name in Japan would in fact remain Sonic World Adventure for its release there.|$|E
