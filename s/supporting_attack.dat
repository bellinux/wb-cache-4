5|$|The Allied {{army had}} been {{advancing}} on the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires by land, while the Brazilian Army commanded by Caxias planned a <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> by sea. On 29 January at the Battle of Alvarez Field the Allied vanguard defeated {{a force of}} 4,000 Argentines led by two colonels which General Ángel Pacheco had sent {{to slow down the}} advance. Pacheco retreated. Two days later, troops under his personal command were defeated at the Battle of Marques Bridge by two allied divisions. On 1 February 1852, the Allied troops encamped approximately nine kilometers from Buenos Aires. The next day a brief skirmish between the vanguards of both armies ended with a retreat by the Argentines.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Poelcappelle {{was fought}} in Flanders, Belgium, on 9 October 1917 by the British and German armies, during the First World War and {{marked the end}} of the string of highly {{successful}} British attacks in late September and early October, during the Third Battle of Ypres. Only the <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> in the north achieved a substantial advance. On the main front the German defences withstood the limited amount of artillery fire managed by the British after the attack of 4 October. The ground along the main ridges had been severely damaged by shelling and rapidly deteriorated in the rains, which began again on 3 October, turning some areas into a swamp.|$|E

25|$|As Grant {{continued}} {{his attempts to}} maneuver around Lee's right flank and lure him into a general battle in the open, Lee saw an opportunity to attack the advancing V Corps, under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren with the Second Corps of Lt. Gen. Jubal Early. Early's divisions under Maj. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Stephen Dodson Ramseur drove the Union troops back to Shady Grove Road, but Ramseur's advance was stopped by a fierce stand of infantry and artillery fire. Grant ordered his other corps commanders to conduct a <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> along the entire Confederate line, which was entrenched behind Totopotomoy Creek, but only the II Corps of Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock crossed the stream; they were quickly repulsed. After the inconclusive battle, the Union army resumed its moves to the southeast and the Battle of Cold Harbor.|$|E
25|$|In {{the outline}} for Goodwood, VIII Corps, with three {{armoured}} divisions, would attack southwards {{out of the}} Orne bridgehead. The 11th Armoured Division was to advance south-west over Bourguébus Ridge and the Caen–Falaise road, aiming for Bretteville-sur-Laize. The Guards Armoured Division was to push south-east to capture Vimont and Argences and the 7th Armoured Division, starting last, was to aim south for Falaise. The 3rd Infantry Division, supported by elements of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, was to secure the VIII Corps eastern flank by capturing the area around Émiéville, Touffréville and Troarn. The II Canadian Corps would simultaneously launch a <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> on the VIII Corps western flank, codenamed Operation Atlantic, to capture Caen south of the Orne river. The British and Canadian operations were tentatively scheduled for 18 July and Cobra was postponed for two days, to enable the First Army to secure its start line around Saint-Lô.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} June, Joffre {{discussed}} {{strategy with}} the army group commanders and Pétain, who had been promoted to the command of the Second Army. Foch again advocated a series of limited attacks, particularly in Artois where strategically important railways were relatively close behind the German lines. Castelnau {{believed that it was}} still possible to advance through the German defences in one attack and that Champagne was a likely region for such an attempt, if the mistakes made on 9 May could be avoided. Pétain agreed with Foch but doubted that another offensive could quickly be prepared in Artois and was sceptical that any part of the Western Front was free of villages like Souchez and Neuville, which could be fortified and against which, only attacks even more limited than those advocated by Foch were practical. On 8 July, Joffre decided to make the principal attack in Champagne, with a <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> in Artois a few days earlier to attract German reserves.|$|E

25|$|On 1 July 1916, the German first {{defensive}} position ran {{south of}} the village, along the lower slopes of Montauban Spur. The junction of the British Fourth Army and XX Corps of the French Sixth Army ran through Maricourt and {{to the east of}} Montauban. The 30th Division of XIII Corps held the right of the corps area, next to the French 39th Division, which formed the northernmost division of the Sixth Army. Signs of an offensive by the British and French had been seen in May 1916 but German military intelligence anticipated an offensive against the Fricourt and Gommecourt spurs, with a possible <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> in between, rather than an attack further south around Montauban and the Somme river. The 30th Division attacked behind a creeping barrage and captured its objectives of Montauban and the Montauban Ridge, inflicting many casualties on Bavarian Infantry Regiment 6, of the 10th Bavarian Division and Infantry Regiment 62 of the 12th Division.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1943 the 137th {{took part in the}} Voronezh-Kastornoye operation, helping to partly {{encircle}} and destroy both the German and Hungarian 2nd Armies to the west of Voronezh as part of the northern pincer of the operation. After capturing several villages on Feb. 3, the division reached a line between Novofedorovka and Pavlovka. At around this time the division was reassigned to 48th Army; it would remain in this army for the duration, apart from a brief reassignment to Western Front in April, 1944. By Feb. 9, 48th and 13th Armies were splitting German 2nd Army and 2nd Panzer Army apart; the 137th had taken the southwestern outskirts of Smirnye. The offensive slowed in late February due to German forces being evacuated from the Rzhev salient, as well as lax practices on the part of lower-level commands. On Feb. 17, Bryansk Front reported about the 48th Army operations east of Maloarkhangelsk, admonishing lower level HQs against concentrating in the relative warmth and comfort of villages: On Mar. 6 the division was combined with the 143rd Rifle Division to form a shock group, supported by the 28th and 30th Guards Tank Regiments, in a <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> along the Pokrovskoe - Oryol road, but after two days of fighting did not manage to dent the German defenses, while suffering considerable losses. The front soon went over to the defense.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{an injured}} Masséna, leading his IV Corps from a {{conspicuous}} white phaeton, was also executing his orders and approaching the sector {{with three of}} his infantry divisions and his cavalry. In compliance with Napoleon's orders, Masséna's fourth infantry division, under General Boudet, had been left far to the south, defending the village of Aspern. The manoeuvre of IV Corps was hampered {{by the arrival of}} the leading battalions of the d'Aspré's division from the Austrian Grenadier Reserve, which delayed Masséna's rearguard division, under General Legrand. Arriving with his other two divisions in the vicinity of Aderklaa towards 07:30, Masséna was spotted by Napoleon, who got into the Marshal's phaeton to consult with him about the situation they were facing and, after a brief discussion, the Emperor ordered the recapture of Aderklaa. Masséna instructed General Carra Saint-Cyr to storm Aderklaa with his division and, seeing that the General delayed his action, trying to find a weak spot of the solid position, the Marshal hurried him forward for an immediate attack. The assault was led by the 24th Light and 4th Line regiments, which were followed by the excellent Hessian Guard brigade. Further east, the still combat-worthy Saxon Corps, including the Franco-Saxon division of General Dupas also moved forward, in a bid to launch a <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> between Aderklaa and Deutsch-Wagram. The 24th Light and 4th Line successfully drove back the two Austrian battalions positioned before the village, which broke and caused some disorder in the Austrian first line. The French impetuously moved into Aderklaa and then tried to launch a pursuit beyond this position, but, as soon as they moved out of the village, they were met with sustained fire from Bellegarde's second infantry line. The two regiments withdrew to Aderklaa, where they were reinforced by the Hessian Guard brigade and ordered to hold the position. Not far away from this position, the attack of the Saxons also came to a grinding halt and these men were driven back, exposing the flank of the French troops occupying Aderklaa. At this moment, the Austrians enjoyed a substantial, albeit temporary numerical advantage in this sector, 44,000 men to the French 35,000. This was thus the right time for a general attack, but the Austrian military doctrine discouraged commanders from taking too much initiative, and Bellegarde chose to stick to his orders and wait for III Korps, whose leading elements were only just coming up, in line with the Grenadiers.|$|E

500|$|Beginning on 30 July, the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey, {{mounted a}} <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> (code-named Operation Bluecoat) {{on the eastern}} flank of the American armies. Much of the German armored {{reserves}} being rushed west to halt the American breakthrough were diverted to face this new threat. Meanwhile, the U.S. continued its attacks to widen the corridor around Avranches. Although the Germans held the vital road junction of Vire, U.S. VII Corps, under Major General J.

500|$|Buckner's {{division}} {{defended the}} right {{flank of the}} Confederate line of entrenchments that surrounded the fort and {{the small town of}} Dover, Tennessee. On February 14, the Confederate generals decided they could not hold the fort and planned a breakout, hoping to join with Johnston's army, now in Nashville. At dawn the following morning, Pillow launched a strong assault against the right flank of Grant's army, pushing it back [...] Buckner, not confident of his army's chances and not on good terms with Pillow, held back his <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> for over two hours, which gave Grant's men time to bring up reinforcements and reform their line. Buckner's delay did not prevent the Confederate attack from opening a corridor for an escape from the besieged fort. However, Floyd and Pillow combined to undo the day's work by ordering the troops back to their trench positions.|$|E
500|$|Immediately to {{the north}} of the Canadian Corps, the <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> by XVIII Corps {{involved}} one brigade each from the British 63rd and 58th divisions. The British 188th Brigade, 63rd Division quickly captured Varlet Farm and Banff House. The centre of the attack was held up on the road between Bray Farm and the village of Wallemolen and dug-in near Source Trench. As dark fell, Banff House was abandoned and the line reformed at Berks House, leaving Banff House and Source Trench the only part of the first objective not captured. Further north, the 58th Division took three pillboxes at Cameron House, before being stopped at Spider crossroads by German machine-gun fire and exhaustion due to the muddy conditions. From [...] to [...] German counterattacks from the north cut off the foremost troops and then advanced from a sunken road between Papa Farm and Whitechapel, which pushed the rest of the brigade back to the start line, where the Germans were also caught in the mud and pushed back by British reinforcements.|$|E

The Fourth Army attacks were assisted by the Army Detachment of the Vosges, which had also had little success. The armies on supporting fronts had far fewer guns and an attack by the XI Corps of the Second Army on 27 December, had no artillery support. In the Vosges, French artillery did not begin to fire until the two attacking divisions began to advance. All of the <b>supporting</b> <b>attacks</b> were costly failures.|$|R
500|$|However, {{the main}} assault {{aimed at the}} peaks of Chunuk Bair and Hill 971 was less successful. The force {{striking}} for the nearer peak of Chunuk Bair comprised the New Zealand Infantry Brigade. It came within [...] of the peak by dawn on 7 August but {{was not able to}} seize the summit until the following morning. This delay had fatal consequences for another <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> on the morning of 7 August, that of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at the Nek which was to coincide with the New Zealanders attacking back down from Chunuk Bair against the rear of the Turkish defences. The New Zealanders held out on Chunuk Bair for two days before relief was provided by two New Army battalions from the Wiltshire and Loyal North Lancashire Regiments. A massive Turkish counter-attack, led in person by Mustafa Kemal, swept these two battalions from the heights. Meanwhile, the landing at Suvla Bay was only lightly opposed but the British commander, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Stopford, had so diluted his early objectives that little more than the beach was seized. Again the Turks were able to win the race for the high ground of the Anafarta Hills thereby rendering the Suvla front another case of static trench warfare.|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of Flers–Courcelette was {{the third}} and final general {{offensive}} mounted by the British Army, which attacked an intermediate line and the German third line to take Morval, Lesboeufs and Gueudecourt, which was combined with a French attack on Frégicourt and Rancourt to encircle Combles and a <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> on the south bank of the Somme.

2500|$|British {{artillery}} {{had good}} observation over the German defences at Guillemont but the German infantry dispersed into shell-holes, which nullified {{the effect of}} much of the artillery fire. British infantry reached the village several times and were then trapped by fire, from shell-hole positions on both flanks and from ahead. W. Miles the Official Historian, wrote that the attacks on 23 July and 30 July failed, because an attack from west and south-west, with no French <b>supporting</b> <b>attack</b> at Maurepas Ravine to the south, could not succeed.

2500|$|A Canadian success {{could force}} the Germans out of Cristot and ease {{the advance of}} the 50th Division.
