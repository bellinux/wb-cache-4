Until recently, solar concentrator collectors had usually been employed to distill water in compact desalination systems.

This paper describes the results of experimental and theoretical investigations of the operation of a novel small-scale <b>solar</b> water <b>desalination</b> technology using the psychometric humidification and dehumidification process coupled with a heat pipe evacuated tube solar collector with an aperture area of ~ 1. 73 m 2.

A synthetic brackish water solution was used for the tests and its total dissolved solids (TDSs) and electrical conductivity were measured. A mathematical model was developed to describe the system's operation. A computer program was written to solve the system of governing equations to perform the theoretical calculations of the humidification and dehumidification processes. The experimental and theoretical values for the total daily distillate output were found to be closely correlated. The test results demonstrate that, at temperatures of 55 - 60 °C, the system produces ~ 5 - 6 kg/h of clean water with a high desalination efficiency.
