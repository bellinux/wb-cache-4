40|$|Magister Commercii - MComProduct {{innovation}} and its efficient diffusion {{are important to}} enhance factor productivity, market access, job creation and trade. Innovative firms remain competitive in an increasingly global environment. Product innovation add maximum economic value when the new knowledge and technical know-how are spread through the economy. <b>Standardisation</b> of <b>products</b> {{is regarded as a}} vital tool to enable the diffusion of product innovations. The economic rationale for standardisation is based on the theory market failure that requires some sort of correction. Standardisation is regarded as a public good, a form of technical infrastructure. It reduces transaction costs and information asymmetries; increased the willingness of consumers to pay, which in turn increases the success and diffusion of innovation. Lower transaction costs result in reduced production and distribution costs. For consumers it also results in reduced search and testing costs as well as reduced time and effort to evaluate quality. Studies on the impact of standardisation were done for some developed countries, but not for developing countries.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} that a cartel is not necessarily synonymous with a brake on innovation but that, on the contrary, it may become the site of information transfer and technology exchange. The example chosen is the cable industry. Research was based on the archives of two Swiss cable manufacturers and on those of a Swiss and an international cartel (International Cable Development Corporation) from the beginning of the twentieth century until the 1970 s. The cartels studied, which were primarily based on territorial and price protection, fostered various forms of information and technology transfers: exchange of information in order to rationalise production, know-how sharing, transfers or sales of patents or licences, <b>standardisation</b> of <b>products</b> to ensure compatibility between products from various companies. Finally, one of the cartels studied became a key player in Research and Development (R&D) by creating test structures and R&D laboratories and controlling market introduction of innovating products. The historiography of the last 30 years had a tendency to consider cartels as an exception, however, as Jeffrey Fear wrote 'Yet, until the 1980 s, the global story of big business must be told in conjunction with cartels rather than without them' (Fear, October 2006).

40|$|Phacilitate held a Special Interest Group {{workshop}} {{event in}} Edinburgh, UK, in May 2017. The event brought together major leading stakeholders {{in the cell}} therapy bioprocessing field to identify present and future challenges and propose potential solutions to automation in cell therapy bioprocessing. Here, we review and summarise discussions from the event. Deep biological understanding of a product, its mechanism of action, and indication pathogenesis underpin many factors relating to bioprocessing and automation. To fully exploit the opportunities of bioprocess automation, therapeutics developers must closely consider whether an automation strategy is applicable, how to design an ‘automatable’ bioprocess, and how to implement process modifications with minimal disruption. Major decisions around bioprocess automation strategy should involve all relevant stakeholders; communication between technical and business strategy decision-makers is of particular importance. Developers should leverage automation to implement in-process testing, in turn applicable to process optimisation, quality assurance (QA) / quality control (QC), batch failure control, adaptive manufacturing, and regulatory demands, but a lack of precedent and technical opportunity can complicate such efforts. Sparse <b>standardisation</b> across <b>product</b> characterisation, hardware components, and software platforms is perceived to complicate efforts to implement automation. The use of advanced algorithmic approaches such as machine learning may have application to bioprocess and supply chain optimisation. Automation can substantially de-risk the wider supply chain, including tracking and traceability, cryopreservation and thawing, and logistics. The regulatory implications of automation are currently unclear as few hardware options exist and novel solutions require case-by-case validation, but automation can present attractive regulatory incentives. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of Lean Construction research and applications is extensive. Due to this diversity, {{it can be}} argued that Lean Construction theory has been overextended and lost some of its fundamental ideas. Even though much theoretical progress has been achieved, theoretical development shows inadequate relation to practical construction. Therefore, theory development is of limited interest for the construction community. The aim of this paper is to make Lean Construction more accessible for construction participants who are interested in learning more about the advances of Lean Construction theory, but are unable to do so due to the vast availability of associated theories. The view of the engineer, representing such a construction participant, is used to revivify and organise Lean Construction theory  through a classic structural engineering problem, the column-buckling case.

40|$|A {{production}} strategy enables {{companies to}} effectively manage the different challenges that the production function {{face in a}} competitive environment. A production strategy helps a company to make operational and strategic decisions that follow a logical pattern and supports the corporate strategy and the competitive priorities of the company. When no strategy exists the decisions may be arbitrary and unpredictable leading to an under-achieving production system. Production strategy involves decisions that shape the long term capabilities of a producing company. For the traditional production industry {{there are a number}} of production strategy frameworks that facilitates the process of designing production systems. However, these frameworks typically leave project based production out of the scope or treat project based production as one type of production system, when in fact project based production systems can be multifaceted depending on product design and market requirements. This thesis focus on project based manufacturing in a house-building context. Houses can be produced by different types of production systems, and depending on how the production systems are designed they have strengths and weaknesses in different areas of competition. To be able to meet the increasing demand for residential houses, and improve performance in the house-building industry, the way houses are produced have to match different market requirements in a more effective and efficient way. To do this a production strategy has to exist. Typically there is a trade-off between productivity and flexibility, hence a production system designed to meet customer requirements concerning product design is probably not the best process choice if the customer thinks price and delivery time are the most important. A production strategy helps a company to make decisions so that the output of the production system meets customer requirements in the best possible way. Due to the fact that project based production is typically left out of the scope in traditional production strategy literature and that there is a lack of research concerning production strategy in a house-building context, the purpose of this research is: … to extend the production strategy body of knowledge concerning project based production in a house-building context. To fulfil the purpose the following four research questions are studied and answered: RQ 1 : What aspects can be useful in a classification matrix contrasting different production systems for house-building? RQ 2 : Which competitive priorities are important to measure when evaluating different production systems on a production strategy level in a house-building context, and how can they quantitatively be measured? RQ 3 : How does the characteristics of the production system, i. e. the process choice, affect information exchange in a house-building context? RQ 4 : How can a new production strategy be formulated and implemented in an industrialised house-building context and what challenges are important to consider in that process? To answer RQ 1 a classification matrix was developed that classify production systems along two dimensions: a product dimension (degree of <b>product</b> <b>standardisation)</b> and a process dimension (degree of off-site assembly). The two dimensions are related, for example a high degree of standardisation should be matched with a high degree of off-site assembly and consequently a low degree of <b>product</b> <b>standardisation</b> should be matched with a low degree of off-suite assembly. A mismatch, e. g. high degree of off-site assembly and low degree of standardisation, typically leads to poor performance and should hence be avoided. To be able to see how different types of production systems perform in different areas of competition key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed. The KPIs presented in this research can be used to measure quality, delivery (speed and dependability), cost (level and dependability), and flexibility (volume and mix) at a production strategic level (RQ 2). Furthermore, to answer RQ 3, a production strategy perspective was taken on information exchange by relating information exchange to the design of the production system. The results indicate that employing different types of production systems leads to different approaches to information exchange. Employing a production systems using traditional production methods on-site and a low degree of <b>product</b> <b>standardisation</b> lead to a traditional approach to information exchange, e. g. project meetings, telephone and mail. Production systems employing some degree of off-site assembly have less complex and more stable supply chains and use ICT-solutions to a higher extent, which facilitates information exchange. The findings also indicate that a high degree of <b>product</b> <b>standardisation</b> facilitates the use of ICT-solutions such as ERP and BIM. RQ 4 concerns the production strategy process, i. e. formulation and implementation. Failure in this processes can jeopardise the whole business. Based on a longitudinal case study of an industrialised house-builder a suggested production strategy process was developed, including both production strategy formulation and implementation. The study also identified context specific challenges that have to be considered in an industrialised house-building context, e. g. the complexity that comes with using two different production processes (off-site and on-site) in the same production system. The research is case based and a total number of eight different production systems have been studied. Data has been collected through interviews, observations, and review of company documents...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse what rhetoric of {{responsibility}} Swedish corporations presents and the structural determinants fur such presentations. 	Corporate identity is the managerial use of rhetoric and other symbolical means to (re) present the corporation’s values, self-understanding and the interpretations made of the world. 	A returning element in this rhetoric is the idea of responsibility, as in Corporate Social Responsibility. A number of corporations have chosen to explicitly or implicitly include normative aspects in their rhetoric of responsibility. In this study the analyses rests on theories on reflexive modernity and the structural transformation of social orders driven by the implosion of modernity’s dualisms, the increasing threats to organizational operations caused by factual risks or the fear for assumed risks, the medialisation of politics and business, the globalisation of economy, politics and everyday life, the increasing competition and <b>standardisation</b> of <b>products</b> and services and the individualisation of opinions and values often expressed in the realm of sub-politics. 	The empirical study includes all corporations listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange 2004 and content analysis is used to categorise the voluntary sections of the annual reports and the sustainability report if available. 	The results show that economy is the predominate area of responsibility included in corporate rhetoric. A smaller group consisting of large, well known corporations diverges from this by giving ethical aspects greater importance. Two structural dimensions are of greater importance to understand the different strategies; visibility and risks. The more visible the corporation is and the more risks the corporation produces the more ethics it includes in its rhetoric.

PRODUCT-PROCESS MATRIX Schmenner (1990, p. 238 & 253) associates process changes with product changes on a product-process matrix (see Table 1).

Design/methodology/approach – The study is set against the dominant backdrop of deductive reasoning {{in the field and}} adopts a qualitative mode of inquiry that promotes empathy with the setting. Through a multiple case study approach among paradigmatic cases, it sheds light on the aforementioned objective. Findings – The paper conceptualises the term “layers of adaptation” and reveals that firms use multi-dimensional standardisation/adaptation configurations. It explicates sub-contextual variations that move beyond assumptions of intra-national sameness and identifies their influence on unnoticed, more agile forms of adaptation. Research limitations/implications – Findings are limited to the analysis of practices in a specific setting. More studies across diverse contexts are necessary in order to expand the boundaries of relevant investigations and enrich the process of theorising. Practical implications – The findings caution that lack of internal sameness in multicultural markets may necessitate a multi-layered standardisation/adaptation logic that considers varying “depths” and “breadths” of relevant marketing strategies. Originality/value – The paper challenges assumptions that have characterised the standardisation and adaptation discourse, conceptualises the term “layers of adaptation” to denote the need for more considerate market responses and highlights the usefulness of qualitative investigations towards theoretical grounding of the field...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{efficiency}} of Islamic and conventional banks during the period 2004 - 2009 using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and meta-frontier analysis (MFA). The use of the non-parametric MFA allows for the decomposition of gross efficiency (i. e. {{the efficiency of}} banks when measured relative to a common frontier) into 2 components: net efficiency (the efficiency of banks measured relative to their own bank type frontier) and type efficiency (the efficiency which relates to modus operandi). This approach is new to the Islamic banking literature. The analysis is performed in two stages. The first stage employs DEA and MFA to compare banks {{on the basis of}} gross efficiency and its components (net and type). We find that Islamic banks are typically on a par with conventional ones in terms of gross efficiency, significantly higher on net efficiency and significantly lower on type efficiency. Second stage analyses, which account for banking environment and bank-level characteristics, confirm these results. The low type efficiency of Islamic banks could be attributed to lack of <b>product</b> <b>standardisation</b> whereas high net efficiency reflects high managerial capability in Islamic banks. These findings are relevant to both policy-makers and regulators. In particular, Islamic banks should explore the benefits of moving to a more standardized system of banking, while the underperformance of conventional bank managers could be examined {{in the context of the}} on-going remuneration culture...|$|R

As universities transform themselves from social to economic institutions, the exchange value of knowledge, albeit creation, transmission or application, outweighs and overshadows its intrinsic value so that university managers focus on money, markets and efficiencies with the aim of producing the best standard product at the lowest cost. At the same time, governments have adopted the role of consumer protection and watchdog agencies, requiring universities to produce to specified levels and standards, and most importantly account for their actions in doing this. The result has been an increasing similarity between universities and the real McDonald’s, quality rules and regulations, cultures of audit, accreditations and accountability, standardisation of programs, more levels of management and surveillance, and increased reliance on cheap and flexible labour. However, it is in the management of labour that universities and McDonald’s differ the most. Based on previous research, McDonald’s website and results from a case study of casual academic labour, the paper compares McDonald’s management of casual staff with that of a university and finds casual employees have better treatment and prospects at McDonald’s...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: This paper {{describes}} and summarises {{the recent}} results from studies {{carried out at}} VTT concerning the contents of construction product information and its use in different stages of building project and building maintenance from two specific points of view: 1) product model based building, 2) life cycle management of buildings. The objective of the work was to describe and define the contents of building product information needed from the view point of service life and life cycle design and maintenance of buildings considering {{the latest developments in}} building <b>product</b> <b>standardisation</b> especially from the European point of view. The paper also drafts alternative information management solutions for the use of this information considering the challenges of product model based building. The paper discusses the contents, transfer and use of construction product information in different stages of building project and building maintenance. The subject is discussed and dealt with {{based on the premise that}} sustainable building will significantly increase the needs of product specific information both in building processes as well as during the maintenance of buildings. Design for service life and sustainability requires new information including for example service life information, LCA data and information on harmful chemicals and emissions. Design for service life and sustainability may also require detailed information about technical performance of products. Because of the abundance of the needed information, and the different needs in different stages of building projects, efficient information technological solutions are needed...|$|R
40|$|We aim to utilise the {{experiences}} of a marine industry-based design team to determine the need for research into a modular design methodology in an industrial environment. In order to achieve this we couple {{the outcome of a}} current design project with the findings of a recent literature survey with the objectives of firstly, clarifying why a methodology is required and, secondly, defining the key elements which the methodology would have to realise or address. The potential benefits of modularity have long been recognised in the shipbuilding industry. Many shipbuilders adopt a 'module' approach to ship construction whereby the ship structure is separated into a number of large structural 'blocks' to ease manufacture and manoeuvrability during construction. However, as understanding of the capabilities of modularity as a design tool develops there is increased interest in capitalising on the differing life phase benefits of modularity such as reduced design costs and time, increased ease of maintenance, upgrade, re-use, redesign and <b>standardisation</b> across individual <b>products</b> and product families. This is especially pertinent in naval shipbuilding where the maintenance of a class of ship requires that all previously designed ships in that class must be of similar outfitting and must be able to interface with the new ship, in terms of propulsion, weapons, communications and electronics, and thus often require some form of retrofit. Therefore, many shipbuilders are moving from viewing modularity as a purely 'manufacturing' principle to a design centred principle. However, as noted by Chang and Ward 'none of the design theories or tools in the mechanical world serves as an articulate procedure for designers to follow in practising modular design'. Thus, despite the identification of a need to introduce modular principles at an earlier stage than detail design and construction, there is little aid in the form of tools, techniques and methodologies for designers in practice...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} internationalisation and globalisation of competition, companies {{become more and more}} international. The commercialisation of products and services in different countries means, that companies are often confronted with cultural differences. By reason of these cultural differences it can happen, that the advertising remains inefficient, because the target group can’t understand the message. The most failures in international marketing happen because of the neglect of cultural differences. Therefore every international company should carefully think about a differentiation or <b>standardisation</b> of their <b>products</b> and advertising in other countries. The aim of this work is to identify the cultural differences in communication and advertising and therefore show the difficulties which can be connected with international products and advertisement. Furthermore this work should demonstrate how culture can affect advertisement and explore if there is a potential for standardisation in international marketing. The focus of this work is on cultural diversity and the impact on international marketing. To {{find out more about the}} perception of international advertisement an online questionnaire was created. Therefore it was possible to gain important information. This questionnaire and the literature research lead to the conclusion of this work. The questionnaires as well as the literature research are showing that it is very difficult to achieve a total standardisation in international marketing. Although people are using worldwide almost identical products, the cultural differences are still too great for a global market. Advertisement which is created for a specific market seems more often reliable and comprehensible. However for some parts of the marketingmix a standardisation is definitely possible. Therefore the best strategy for companies is to use a mix between differentiation and standardisation. Cultural differences will still remain in the future. The consideration of cultural differences in the future will therefore lead to a competitive advantage. Companies should pay attention to culture diversity, although it can lead to higher costs, to achieve the best results in international markets...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. For the past 20 years, CNC manufacturing has been relying on the proprietary format of G& M codes to control the machining process despite the remarkable advances made in machining and control technologies. This low-level format {{is based on the}} vendor-specific ISO 6983 standard, which provides limited information to the CNC producing a primitive machining process language concentrating mainly on the cutting toolpath. Moreover, the ISO 6983 data interface offers little or no interoperability between the different CAD/CAM systems and CNC's, which is recognised as the key shortcoming of the current NC part programming process. In recent Years, a great deal of research effort has concentrated on {{the development of a new}} data model for the next generation of CNC's entitled ISO 14649 (STEP-NC). It has been strongly argued that STEP-NC has huge implications on the integration of CAD/CAPP/CAM (CAx) systems, giving the opportunity to realise interoperable CAD to CNC manufacturing. This is largely due to the STEP-NC data model offering a bi-directional data interface with a high-level description of both geometrical and manufacturing information, thus providing a revolution over the current state-of-the-art in CNC manufacturing. This research provides an investigation into the programming of wire-cutting electrical discharge machining (WEDM) machines using a high level process planning description based on the evolving STEP-NC standard. At present, part 13 of the standard has been dedicated to the non-conventional material removal process employing the use of a specialised thermal machining technique to machine parts with intricate shapesa nd of varying hardness. The major contribution of this research is the design of a STEP-NC compliant CAx system framework with product and manufacturing information models supporting the WEDM process chain from product design through to machining process planning and CNC manufacturing. The research shows that conventional NC part programming is CAD-centric and can only offer an interim solution of satisfying the need for the WEDM CNC machining applications. STEP-NC strives for total integration of CAx systems with CNC by focusing on the <b>standardisation</b> of the <b>product</b> and manufacturing information for WEDM CNC manufacturing through the application of ISO 10303 standard (STEP). The research builds on such benefits and potentials of exploring STEP-NC to provide the basis for making a major step forward in facilitating interoperable CNC manufacturing for the WEDM process...|$|R
