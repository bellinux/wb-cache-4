50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> incoming <b>calls</b> is handled by relay sets known as incoming trunk circuits. Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the trunk circuit for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind <b>of</b> signalling or <b>call</b> metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|R

[...] In 1904 the couple moved into a luxurious three storey mansion, designed by María Guerrero, with construction managed by an architect called Pablo Aranda.

5000|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the alliance between the Argives, Achaeans, Eleans and Athens, the humiliation of the Spartans in the 420 Olympic Games and the invasion of Epidaurus by the allies, the Spartans were compelled to move against them, fearing an alliance with Corinth and having amassed an army that was, according to Thucydides, 'the best army ever assembled in Greece to that time'. However, the Spartan king Agis (son of Archidamus) instead concluded the first campaign with a truce, without explaining his actions to the army or his allies; the army thus returned home. Immediately afterwards, the Argives denounced the truce and resumed the war, capturing the key town of Orchomenus; as a result, anger at Agis was such that he {{was on the verge of}} being fined 100,000 drachmas and having his house destroyed. Agis managed to forestall this punishment, promising to redeem himself with a victory elsewhere. [...] The ephors consented, but in an unprecedented move, placed Agis under the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> ten advisors, <b>called</b> xymbouloi, whose consent was required for whatever military action he wished to take.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were (1) to explore participant experiences and effects of covision, and (2) to help legitimize covision as a form of scientific research. Traditional family therapy supervision emphasizes the power and expertise of the supervisor, often marginalizing the hard-won knowledges of supervisees. It is thought that an egalitarian form <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>called</b> covision, not only brings marginalized wisdoms to the center, but is highly co-generative of new knowledges. Participants reported profound life-changing experiences through covision, and that these experiences had great positive impact on their work as therapists. Covision was also described as congruent with the democratic model <b>of</b> research <b>called</b> Action Research. The findings are further discussed in terms of the literature, the method, the philosophy, and the six research questions regarding the following themes: experience and effects, accountability, inner expertise and the co-generation of knowledge, transformation, covisee contributions, and participant structuring. ...|$|R
40|$|Supervision {{in school}} often {{discussed}} about the negative opinion of teachers because misunderstanding {{about the process}} and the concept <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> Thus, this descriptive study was conducted through a questionnaire survey on three schools in the Zone City Muar Johor. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the teachers’ opinions towards <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction that has been implemented at schools, identify the practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction carried out at school, identify whether there is a difference teachers’ opinion towards <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on demographic factors (gender, race and experience teaching), identify whether there is a difference practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on demographic factors (gender, race and experience teaching) and determine whether there is a significant relationship between opinion for the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction with practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction. The study sample involved 120 teachers from schools in SJK (C) Zone City Muar Johor. Questionnaires modified from previous studies were used as an instrument. The data were analyzed using SPSS and the results of the analysis were reported in the form of descriptive statistics. The reliability of the instrument using Cronbach Alpha was 0. 644 for part B and 0. 797 for part C. The results showed that teachers had a positive opinion for the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction and practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction was at a high level, the study showed no difference of opinion about the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on gender and race, and found a difference of opinion about the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on experience teaching. The findings showed there was no significant difference in teachers' opinions about practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on gender, race and experience teaching.
