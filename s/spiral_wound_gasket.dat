30|$|Taking the {{advantages}} of low and high temperatures, low and high pressures and corrosion, the metal sealing gaskets are suitable for oil-gas exploitation, chemical industry and nuclear industry, where rubber seals are prohibited [12]. SPMC is a static metal seal without gasket, and the optimal sealing performance is the key technology. Up to now the researches of the pipeline connection are extensive, but few of them focus {{on the design of}} connector without gasket. In the design of a connector with gasket, the gasket factor and minimum gasket seating stress should be determined according to the design codes [13, 14] subject to gasket material and structural. These codes are based on a series of assumptions and might not define calculation procedures for sealing performance in detail [15]. Persson [16] and Kazeminia et al. [17] revaluated the leakage of metallic seal, which was used to design bolted flanged connections. Zhao et al. [18], established the mathematical relationship between the contact stress of metal sealing ring governing the sealing performance, the structural parameters and operating pressure, but did not consider the plastic deformation of metallic gasket. Sawa et al. [19] and Takaki et al. [20] studied the contact pressure on the sealing surface by elastic-plastic finite element analysis with regard of nonlinearity of gasket and internal pressure. However, the analysis is for the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> <b>gasket</b> only. Nitta et al. [21], analyzed the critical contact pressure to eliminate the radial leakage paths by the quantitative analysis of the leakage, but did not discover the critical contact pressure to fully block the leakage paths. Using a finite element analysis approach, Joshi et al. [22], and Abid et al. [23] studied the flange connection without gasket, which concluded surface profiles, thickness of flange and bolt pre-stress had effects on the stress in the flange and bolts as well as flange rotation and displacement, but the effects on sealing performance wasn’t investigated. Guindani et al. [24], studied the deformation recovery of sealing material and optimized the sealing performance of rubber. Bouzid et al. [25] and Wu et al. [26] proved the mean contact pressure and its distribution on sealing surface took important effects on sealing performance. By finite element analysis and experiment, Noga et al. [27] proved the suitable contact pressure and width of plastic deformation were the key parameters to guarantee the sealing performance of flange connection without gasket. However, the critical values of contact pressure and plastic deformation are not investigated. According to the above researches, the right contact pressure will make the plastic deformation happen on sealing surface and block micro leakage paths. Therefore, the contact pressure is essential for the optimal sealing performance of SPMC.|$|E

40|$|Cheese {{is one of}} {{the most}} well known food {{products}} in the world dating back to the 8 th century B. C. There are more than 2000 varieties of cheese that are manufactured all over the world. Feta cheese is a soft white cheese with a salty and slightly acidic taste, which has originated from Greece. Most of the feta cheese manufactured in Greece is consumed locally, the migration of greeks to other parts of the world led to a demand for feta cheese outside of Greece. The spreading of the popularity of feta cheese to other ethnic groups in different parts of the world resulted in the high demand for feta cheese worldwide. The modern and most efficient method of feta cheese production involves a membrane filtration method, known as ultrafiltration. The ultrafiltration process utilises pressure as a driving force to concentrate milk by removal of water and small dissolved molecules. Hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> ultrafiltration membranes are the two types of membranes that are commonly used for cheese production. An extensive amount of research exists on the implementation of ultrafiltration to improve the efficiency of the cheese making process and the performance of the membranes. However, limited research has been conducted on the comparison of the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane performance in the cheese making process. The objective of the research was to determine if the hollow fibre membranes used at Puhoi Valley Cheese can be replaced with <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membranes without compromising the quality of cheese produced. In order to achieve the objective, feta cheese was produced using hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> ultrafiltration pilot plants. The operating performances of the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane units were compared. To ensure that the quality of cheese is maintained, the cheese manufactured on the pilot plant units was analysed in terms of composition, microbiology, texture and sensory properties. The cheese made using the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant was compared with the reference sample from Puhoi Valley Cheese as they use hollow fibre membranes to produce feta cheese. The cheese made from the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane unit was also compared to that made by the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant unit. The operating parameters such as the inlet and outlet pressure, pressure difference along the membrane, transmembrane pressure, flow rate, recycle rate (bleed off rate), temperature and the run time were recorded. The operating parameters of the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> runs were compared with the data from Puhoi Valley Cheese. The quality of cheese made on the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plant units were evaluated in terms of composition, texture, microbiology and sensory properties. The composition was defined by the fat, protein, total solids and salt contents. The fat content was determined by utilising the modified Schmid-Bondzynski-Ratzlaff method, protein by the Kjeldahl method, total solids by using the air drying oven and salt percentage by the volhard method. The texture of the cheese was determined by the fracturability and hardness from the compression curve generated using the single bite compression test. The microbiological testing was performed according to New Zealand testing methods for E. Coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and yeast and mould. The difference from the control method was utilised for sensory evaluation. The acid degree value method was used to determine the lipase activity in feta cheese. It was found from the composition, texture and sensory analysis that the cheese from the hollow fibre pilot plant was different from the cheese manufactured at Puhoi Valley Cheeses (PVC). The <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> cheeses were also found to be different to PVC cheese, however the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> cheeses and the pilot plant hollow fibre cheese were the same. The differences between both the pilot plant cheeses and PVC cheese were in terms of the fat, salt, moisture contents and the lipase activity in the cheeses. The fat content in the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plant cheeses are lower in comparison to the PVC cheese. This difference in fat content is considered to be due to the difference in the fat to protein ratio of the milk concentrated on the pilot plant and the PVC ultrafiltration system. The lower fat content resulted in firmer cheese than PVC due to more cross linking between the protein strands in cheese. The salt content in the cheeses made using the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plants was lower than Puhoi Valley Cheese. This is considered to be due to the low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume used for salting the cheese. The salt content of brine decreases during brining; hence a low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume causes a significant decrease in brine concentration. The decrease in brine concentration decreases the salt intake of the cheese. As salt diffuses in the moisture diffuses out, lower salt content results in higher moisture content in the cheese. As mentioned, the moisture content of the hollow fibre pilot plant cheese was higher than the PVC cheese. The moisture content is inversely proportional to the total solids, hence higher moisture in pilot plant cheeses implies lower total solids than the PVC cheese. The lipase activity results showed that the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plant cheeses had higher lipase activity than the Puhoi valley cheese. The differences in lipase activity of the pilot plant cheeses and Puhoi Valley cheese were considered to be due to the incomplete inactivation of lipase present in milk during pasteurisation. The results from texture and sensory evaluation support the above mentioned differences. The microbiology results for all pilot plant cheeses were within the trigger limits set by Puhoi valley cheeses. The results from monitoring the operating parameters of both the pilot plant data show that the permeate flux decreases while the total solids in milk increase with time, which was also observed from the Puhoi Valley Cheese data. However, the rate of decrease of the permeate flux and the increase of the total solids in milk are dependent on the membrane area, feed volume, transmembrane pressure, pressure drop across the membrane and the flow characteristics. The rate of decrease in permeate flux and the rate of increase in the total solids of the hollow fibre runs and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> runs are slightly different. The difference is due to the availability of larger membrane surface area and processing of larger feed volume of milk in the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> runs. The transmembrane pressure and the pressure drop across the membrane were maintained as close as possible to Puhoi Valley Cheese. In conclusion, <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membranes can be used to achieve the desired total solids concentration and successfully make the same feta cheese as the hollow fibre pilot plant. In order to make the same quality of feta cheese as Puhoi Valley Cheese using the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane pilot plant, the same composition of milk used for concentration at Puhoi Valley Cheese needs to be used on the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plant unit. It is recommended that Puhoi Valley Cheeses should be replaced with <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membranes if they are more economical in terms of cost than the hollow fibre membranes...|$|R

The theoretical principle of process of precipitate removal from membrane surface in <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane module was substantiated. The proposed method of regeneration allows recovering membrane flux without loss of selectivity and mechanical properties. The physical and mathematical models of fouled <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane modules regeneration using of temperature cavitation phenomenon under subatmospheric pressure were developed. The equations of mass transfer kinetics in system liquid ? solid were expanded to marrow conditions in membrane channel. The objective laws of mass transfer during cake layer removal in channel of <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane modules were defined experimentally. The results were generalized in a form of dimensionless equation for mass transportation equations coefficient determination. The proposed equation is reliable in a range of Reynolds from 0, 4 to 60. The proposed mathematical model was solved using numerical methods. The calculations using mathematical model were carried out and influence of hydrodynamic conditions, process temperature and cleaning solutions volume is determinated. The most rational flow regime is corresponding to Reynolds number values in a range from 15 to 25. The impact of process temperature and cleaning solution volume is negligible. It was experimentally defined that using of temperature cavitation phenomenon promote of increasing of intensity of cake layer removal process from membrane surface in <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> module. The regeneration can be carried out using environmentally acceptable cleaning solutions such as desalinated water and solutions of citric acid and sodium hydrocarbonate. The experimental examination of regeneration process effectiveness was carried out. The possibility of membrane flux recover for 90 ? 95 % was proved. It was shown by the experimental determination of total resistance to flux through the membrane of clean membrane module, fouled membrane module and regenerated membrane module that increase membrane flux after regeneration has occurred due to decreasing of cake layer resistance. Those results prove the principles of proposed physical model. The influence of technological parameters on mass transfer effectiveness during cake layer removal using temperature cavitation phenomenon was determinated. The methods of process intensification using periodical operating pressure increasing were substantiated. The effectiveness of periodical operating pressure increasing as an intensification technique which allows increase regeneration coefficient in 1, 5 times was proved. The factors which influence on regeneration process effectiveness were determinated using experiment planning method. The regression equations were obtained.

40|$|Scale {{formation}} of sparingly soluble salts {{has a significant}} effect on flux decline in nanofiltration (NF) system. This study focuses on the elucidation of the different mechanisms of scale formation according to membrane modules in NF system. In unstirred batch NF, flux decline was mainly due to surface (heterogeneous) crystallization, while in crossflow NF, fouling was attributed to both surface and bulk crystallization. However, the extent of contribution of each crystallization to the fouling depended on the NF modules. The bulk (homogeneous) crystallization followed by crystal deposition {{on the surface of the}} nanofilter played a major role in flux decline in the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> module whereas surface blockage due to the surface crystallization does in the tubular module. When an on-line microfiler was introduced to prevent crystal deposition during the concentration run, flux improvement was pronounced only in case of the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> module, whereas it was negligible in case of the tubular module. This was because the microfilter could only remove crystals formed in the retentate through the bulk crystallization which is the dominant fouling mechanism in the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> module. A modified resistance-in-series model was applied to assess the fouling characteristics of each NF module based on the bulk and the surface crystallization. The greatest extent of the fouling due to surface crystallization in tubular module was attributed to its highest concentration polarization modulus compared with the other two modules at the same crossflow rate...|$|R
40|$|Membrane punch autopsy (MPA) is a {{procedure}} for quantitative foulant analysis of hollow fine fiber (HFF) permeators. In the past, quantitative autopsies of membranes were restricted to <b>spiral</b> <b>wound.</b> This procedure was developed at SWCC laboratories and tested on permeators of two commercial Red Sea reverse osmosis plants. For membrane autopsies, stainless steel hollow bore picks were penetrated to membrane cores and fibers extracted for foulant analysis. Quantitative analysis of extracted materials contained inorganic and organic foulants including bacteria. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed {{the presence of}} organic fouling functional groups and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy {{in the presence of}} diatoms and silica most likely not from particulate sand. API analysis revealed the presence of Shewanella and two Vibrio microbial species confirmed by 16 S rDNA sequence library. It was observed that fouling content of HFF cellulose triacetate (CTA) membranes were more than 800 times than polyamide <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membranes...|$|R
40|$|Nanofiltration (NF) {{membranes}} {{have been}} largely developed and commercialised {{over the past decade}} and are currently {{one of the most promising}} technologies for the separation of neutral and charged solutes in aqueous solutions. Sometimes NF is defined as a process between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis; however, the separation mechanisms of this kind of membranes are not clear enough, and even today there are some questions remaining about how NF membranes work. Nowadays, there are many different types of NF membranes commercially available, so the first step before developing a new NF treatment plant is to know which one is going to be the most suitable membrane. There are two main configurations in which NF can be used: flat sheet and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> module. The cross-flow module using flat sheet membranes is the simplest option to test an NF membrane but at the industrial scale, NF is basically used in the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> configuration. Currently, there are no studies available regarding the difference of using both configurations. The objective of this work is to do an experimental study regarding the performance of two different NF membranes, NF 270 (Dow Chemical) and ESNA 1 -LF 2 (Hydranautics), in two different scales, laboratory and pilot plant, using the most typical configurations in each case: flat sheet and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> respectively. Using the same feed water, the operating conditions and the rejections of the membranes in both configurations will be studied in order to check if both operating scales can be comparable.
