5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} <b>stipes,</b> often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused <b>stipes.</b> The flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. The spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending {{down the length of}} the stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, or dark brown in age.|$|E
5|$|With its short stipe {{and sticky}} cap, S.quiescens {{is similar to}} S.brevipes. It may be {{distinguished}} from the latter species {{by the color of}} the young (light-brown) cap, the glandular dots at the top of <b>stipes</b> in mature specimens, and the yellowish color {{at the top of the}} stipe.|$|E
5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, {{occasionally}} with <b>stipes,</b> and {{usually have a}} peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E
40|$|Elongation of the <b>stipe</b> was {{investigated}} in Agaricus bisporus. The cell lengths in premarked regions of the <b>stipe</b> from base to top were compared. They were also compared with total <b>stipe</b> expansion and with the expansion occurring within the premarked regions. Cell elongation accounted for the elongation of the lower and mid-regions of the <b>stipe</b> but could {{not account for the}} elongation of the upper <b>stipe</b> region. Using autoradiography it was shown that there was a non-polar addition of new wall materials in the elongating cells of the <b>stipe</b> and, particularly in the upper <b>stipe,</b> cell division could be seen to occur by the forma-tion of new septa. A model for cell growth in the elongating <b>stipe</b> of A. bisporus is described...|$|R

40|$|TSENG Y. -H., YANG J. -H., LEE CH. -E., MAU J. -L. (2011) : Quality of shiitake <b>stipe</b> steamed bun. Czech J. Food Sci., 29 : 79 - 86. Shiitake [Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Pegler] <b>stipe</b> was {{incorporated}} into steamed bun. Quality attributes including the specific volume, colour and sensory evaluation, and taste components in shiitake <b>stipe</b> steamed buns were analysed and {{compared with those of}} white steamed buns. With 2 % and 5 % additions of shiitake <b>stipe</b> flour, specific volumes of steamed buns increased by 5. 8 % and 5. 0 %, respectively. White steamed buns contained more reducing sugar, fat, and protein whereas fiber and soluble polysaccharide contents were higher in shiitake <b>stipe</b> steamed buns. Furthermore, shiitake <b>stipe</b> steamed buns contained more total soluble sugars and total free amino acids. Shiitake <b>stipe</b> steamed buns showed lower lightness and whiteness index values and became browner with more shiitake <b>stipe</b> flour added. On a seven-point hedonic scale, all sensory results were 4. 07 - 5. 80. Overall, shiitake <b>stipe</b> could be added into steamed bun formula to provide its beneficial health effects...|$|R
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta has a {{wrinkled}} surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G.infula. Gyromitra ambigua {{is very similar}} in appearance, and although it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G.ambigua {{is said to have}} more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G.ambigua has larger spores that are about 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G.infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted <b>stipes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Members of the Sclerodermatineae have {{fruit body}} shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes on the {{underside}} of the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies sometimes have hollow <b>stipes</b> with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with flaky particles), and lack the reticulation (a net-like pattern of interlacing lines) characteristic of some members of the Boletaceae. The pores are merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The flesh is usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface.|$|E
5|$|According to Alexander H. Smith's {{organization}} of the genus Mycena, M.aurantiomarginata is classified in section Calodontes, subsection Granulatae, which contains species with roughened cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges), such as M.rosella, M.flavescens, M.elegans, and M.strobilinoides. In his 1992 study of Mycena, Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus put M.aurantiomarginata in the section Luculentae, characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with bright orange margins, brownish to grayish-olive <b>stipes,</b> white spore deposit, and spiny cystidia. M.aurantiomarginata was included in a 2010 molecular analysis focused on clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between Northern European species in the section Calodontes. The results suggested that, based on the similarity of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences, the fungus {{is closely related to}} M.crocata and M.leaiana. This conclusion was previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several Mycena species can be mycorrhizal partners of the orchid Gastrodia confusa.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Harrya chromapes are readily {{identified}} in the field by their rosy color, bright yellow <b>stipe</b> base, and reddish scabers on the <b>stipe.</b> Tylopilus subchromapes is a similar species found in Australia. Tylopilus ballouii has a more orangish cap and lacks the distinctive chrome-yellow <b>stipe</b> base. Harrya atriceps is a closely related rare species from Costa Rica. In contrast to its more common relative, it lacks reddish color in its <b>stipe</b> scabers and has a black cap, although it has a similar yellow <b>stipe</b> base.|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom <b>stipes</b> and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{colouration}} of Caloboletus calopus, {{with its}} pale cap, yellow pores and red stipe, is not shared {{with any other}} bolete. Large pale specimens resemble Suillellus luridus, and the cap of Rubroboletus satanas is a similar colour but this species has red pores. Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with Xerocomellus chrysenteron but the <b>stipes</b> of this species are not reticulated. Edible species such as B.edulis lack a red stipe. It closely resembles the similarly inedible C.radicans, which lacks the redness on the stipe. Like C.calopus, the western North American species C.rubripes also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish pores that bruise blue, but it lacks reticulation on its reddish stipe. Found in northwestern North America, B.coniferarum lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate stipe, and has a darker, olive-grey to deep brown cap.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the ecology}} and {{genetics}} of Paxillus involutus {{indicate that it}} may form a complex of multiple similar-looking species. In a field study near Uppsala, Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries {{found that there were}} three populations of P.involutus unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe and cap which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker <b>stipes,</b> and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. However, there were only general tendencies and he was unable to detect any consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them. A molecular study comparing the DNA sequences of specimens of Paxillus involutus collected from various habitats in Bavaria found that those collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species P.vernalis, while those from forests were allied with P.filamentosus. The authors suggested the park populations may have been introduced from North America. A multi-gene analysis of European isolates showed that P.involutus sensu lato (in the loose sense) could be separated into four distinct, genetically isolated lineages corresponding to P.obscurosporus, P.involutus sensu stricto (in the strict sense), P.validus, and a fourth species that has not yet been identified. Changes in host range have occurred frequently and independently among strains within this species complex.|$|E

40|$|Shiitake (Lentinula edodes [Berk. ] Pegler) <b>stipe</b> {{was used}} to {{substitute}} wheat flour to make bread. Bread quality including specific volume, color and sensory evaluation, and taste components including proximate composition, soluble sugars, free amino acids and 5 '-nucleotides in shiitake <b>stipe</b> bread were analyzed and {{compared with those of}} white bread. Specific volumes were 4. 02, 4. 00, 3. 89 and 3. 75 cm(3) /g for white bread, 2 %, 5 % and 7 % shiitake <b>stipe</b> breads, respectively. All breads had a comparable profile in proximate composition. Furthermore, 5 % shiitake <b>stipe</b> bread contained more total soluble sugars and total free amino acids. Both breads contained considerately low amounts of monosodium glutamate-like and sweet components of free amino acids. Content of flavor 5 '-nucleotides in 5 % shiitake <b>stipe</b> bread was much higher than that in white bread. Shiitake <b>stipe</b> flour added into the dough resulted in 5 % shiitake <b>stipe</b> bread with lower lightness and whiteness index values. All sensory results exhibited that substituting 5 % of wheat flour in the bread formula with shiitake <b>stipe</b> flour did significantly lower bread acceptability.

Stolze noted that specimens with leaf texture so thick as to obscure the veins may be identified as A.resiliens, as A.heterochroum and A.palmeri very rarely become this leathery.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, scourging preceded crucifixion, {{which would}} cause the {{condemned}} to lose {{a large amount of}} blood, and approach a state of shock. The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (patibulum in Latin) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross. Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding centurion and four soldiers. When it was done in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (<b>stipes)</b> could even be permanently embedded in the ground. It's claimed by certain religious texts that the victims of crucifixion were stripped naked before being put on the cross—all the New Testament gospels describe soldiers gambling for the robes of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of arbori suspendere—hanging on an arbor infelix ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the supplicium more maiorum, punishment {{in accordance with the}} custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death. Tertullian mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion, but Seneca the Younger earlier used the phrase infelix lignum (unfortunate wood) for the transom ("patibulum") or the whole cross. Plautus and Plutarch are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibulum to the upright <b>stipes.</b>|$|E
