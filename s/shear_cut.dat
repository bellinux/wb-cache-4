40|$|Dual-Phase (DP) steels, part of {{the group}} of Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS), are used by car {{manufactures}} due to its large strength to weight ratio. The high strength of the DP steel does {{have a negative impact on}} the formability during sheet metal forming and stretch forming, e. g. fractures often appear in <b>shear</b> <b>cut</b> edges during forming of blanks made of DP steel.   The main objective with this thesis is to develop a new punch for Volvo Cars that concentrates the strain to the sheared edges of a test specimen made from different types of DP steel. This is done to be able to measure and obtain maximum fracture strain during stretch forming tests in a press. The newly developed test method is called CTEST (Concentrated Trim Edge Strain Test).   The tests are performed with DP steel specimens with three different qualities of the <b>shear</b> <b>cut</b> edges; fine cut, medium cut and worn cut. DP steels tested are DP 600 GI, DP 600 UC and DP 800 GI from three different suppliers. 10 different types of DP steels are tested in this study with different thickness. Thickness of specimens tested are 1 mm, 1. 1 mm, 1. 5 mm and 2 mm and all specimens tested have a lengthwise (RD) rolling direction.   The quality of the sheared cut edge has a great impact to the formability and maximum fracture strain of the specimen. A specimen with a fine cut endures higher fracture strain than medium cut and a worn cut for all types of DP steel with different thickness. A 1 mm thick specimen endures a lower fracture strain than 1. 5 mm and 2 mm specimen for all cut qualities.   Further, the impact of the orientation of the burr zone of a <b>shear</b> <b>cut</b> edge is studied. With the burr zone facing upwards from the CTEST punch the formability of the specimens is decreased compared to a burr zone facing downwards, especially for a worn cut specimen with micro cracks and imperfections in the edge surface.   ARAMIS Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system is used to analyze the specimen edges during press experiments. The ARAMIS results unveil that several small fractures appear in the sheared edges of a specimen just before the specimens split into two pieces. This phenomenon was seen for specimen with worn and medium <b>shear</b> <b>cut</b> qualities.   Finite Element (FE) simulations of the CTEST is performed in AutoForm to determine maximum values of the true strain for the three different cut qualities. The simulation in AutoForm does show a slightly higher value of the force and press depth than the value from the press test before maximum fracture strain in reached. The small fractures seen in ARAMIS just before the specimen split into two pieces cannot be seen in the simulation in AutoForm...|$|E

40|$|Following the 1993 Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. {{court case}} and {{continuing}} to the 2010 National Academy of Sciences report, comparative forensic toolmark examination has received many challenges to its admissibility in court cases and its scientific foundations. Many of these challenges deal with the subjective nature in determining whether toolmarks are identifiable. This questioning of current identification methods has created a demand for objective methods of identification - 2 ̆ 2 objective 2 ̆ 2 implying known error rates and statistically reliability. The demand for objective methods has resulted in research that created a statistical algorithm capable of comparing toolmarks to determine their statistical similarity, and thus the ability to separate matching and nonmatching toolmarks. This was expanded {{to the creation of}} virtual toolmarking (characterization of a tool to predict the toolmark it will create). The statistical algorithm, originally designed for two-dimensional striated toolmarks, had been successfully applied to striated screwdriver and quasi-striated plier toolmarks. Following this success, a blind study was conducted to validate the virtual toolmarking capability using striated screwdriver marks created at various angles of incidence. Work was also performed to optimize the statistical algorithm by implementing means to ensure the algorithm operations were constrained to logical comparison regions (e. g. the opposite ends of two toolmarks {{do not need to be}} compared because they do not coincide with each other). This work was performed on quasi-striated <b>shear</b> <b>cut</b> marks made with pliers - a previously tested, more difficult application of the statistical algorithm that could demonstrate the difference in results due to optimization. The final research conducted was performed with pseudostriated impression toolmarks made with chisels. Impression marks, which are more complex than striated marks, were analyzed using the algorithm to separate matching and nonmatching toolmarks. Results of the conducted research are presented as well as evidence of the primary assumption of forensic toolmark examination; all tools can create identifiably unique toolmarks...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of methane gas {{has always been}} a challenging issue for longwall operations. To improve the understanding of methane dispersion and flow characteristics on a longwall face, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling studies were conducted employing the longwall models developed recently. As a prerequisite of the CFD study, the methane emission rate was determined firstly taking advantage of a mathematical model whilst considering the decay of methane emission from different positions along the face, which was capable of estimating the methane emission from individual sources on the longwall face. Taking into account the impact of shearer position and cutting sequence on gas flow behaviour, calculations were carried out on the six CFD models representing six typical longwall operating scenarios respectively. Model results indicate that: 1) the methane concentration around the drums increases gradually as the <b>shearer</b> <b>cuts</b> from the maingate (MG) to tailgate (TG), and decreases as the <b>shearer</b> <b>cuts</b> back towards the MG; 2) the methane concentration at the TG drum is higher than it is at the MG drum in both cutting directions; 3) the monitored methane concentration {{at the tail end of}} the shearer body can be approximately two or three times lower than the maximum concentration around the TG drum; 4) the source of methane causing accumulation at TG is identified, i. e., the majority of methane trapped in the inner TG corner comes from the face emission while the methane accumulated at the upper TG corner is caused by goaf methane emission...|$|R

This paper presents an algorithm for generating optimal two-staged cutting patterns of strips for the cutting process. At the first stage the sheet is divided into segments with parallel cuts. Each segment contains strips with the same length and direction. The segments are cut into strips at the second stage. The algorithm calls a recursion function to determine the optimal strip layouts on segments of various lengths, and calls another recursion function to optimally arrange the segments in the sheet, so {{that the value of}} the pattern reaches maximum.

40|$|Folding is {{a common}} {{response}} to deformation within nappes and thrust sheets and {{a wide variety of}} attitudes of folds can result. Two examples of patterns of variably oriented folds from southwest England are analysed in terms of thrust tectonics. In northern Cornwall, the Millook nappe contains a downward progression from upright to recumbent folding with a zone of oblique or sheath folds at its base. These changes are related to an increasing simple shear component towards the base of the nappe. In southwestern Cornwall, D 1 and D 2 deformations are related to the thrust emplacement of the Lizard complex. F 1 folds in rocks below and {{to the north of the}} Lizard complex have variable axial orientations. Alternating zones of folds trending normal and oblique to the transport direction have been mapped. The oblique folds are interpreted as initiating in zones of differential movement within thrust sheets. Later D 2 <b>shear</b> zones <b>cut</b> up-section ahead of the advancing Lizard complex, in which case they result in refolding of F 1 folds.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} wood-concrete {{structural members}} {{in which the}} interlayer connection is achieved with adhesives, by overlaying the fresh concrete {{over the top of}} a wood layer to which moisture tolerant adhesive coating was applied a short time before the casting. Laminated wood-concrete structural members could be built as beams or slabs. Experimental results presented on eight laminated wood-concrete beam specimens subject to static loading indicate that the load capacity of the laminated wood-concrete beams exceed the performance of the classical wood-concrete beams which use <b>shear</b> notches <b>cut</b> into the wood for the interlayer connection...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the context}} of machining, a cutting tool or cutter is any tool {{that is used to}} remove {{material}} from the workpiece by means of <b>shear</b> deformation. <b>Cutting</b> may be accomplished by single-point or multipoint tools. Single-point tools are used in turning, shaping, planing and similar operations, and remove material by means of one cutting edge. Milling and drilling tools are often multipoint tools. Grinding tools are also multipoint tools. Each grain of abrasive functions as a microscopic single-point cutting edge (although of high negative rake angle), and shears a tiny chip.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that in <b>shear</b> zones, which <b>cut</b> through granitoid rocks or {{granitic}} gneisses, introduced fluids bring in additional water, K, and Na as Fe, Ca, and Mg are subtracted (Beach, 1976; Dipple and Ferry, 1992). Such hydrothermal fluids commonly cause sericitization of plagioclase and may result in loca...|$|R
5000|$|The haircut {{is usually}} done with {{electric}} clippers utilizing the clipper over comb technique, {{though it can}} also be <b>cut</b> <b>shears</b> over comb or freehand with a clipper. Some barbers utilize large combs designed for cutting flattops. Others use wide rotary clipper blades specifically designed for freehand cutting the top of a flattop.|$|R
25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{seven years after}} Queen Victoria's Jublilee, a major {{reconstruction}} took place. A new bellcote was built, retaining the old finials. A new north window was added, matching the south windows. The west window was restored where the doorway had been, and the south door which had been bricked up was re-opened. The old oak box pews were removed and there panels placed against the walls. The east window was redesigned and revealed a coffin lid dated c.1300 used as a memorial to a one time Rural Dean, with <b>shears</b> to <b>cut</b> the tonsure of the priesthood.|$|R
