But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to do something, to help go about creating <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|This [...] "opaque" [...] {{technique}} has been Godard's trademark style for many years. In 1995 Jean-Michel Frodon described the same complexities as Bordwell and wrote that when viewing a Godard film {{there are moments}} when one has the tendency to resist the experience. As the film unfolds you are suddenly confused, you don't quite grasp <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> feel like you are losing your footing. On the point of drowning one is liable to think Godard is vague and obscure but then there is a maritime movement/shift and if one lets oneself be carried by the next wave that comes one soon recovers the drift of the film.|$|E

2500|$|Sharapova {{has made}} varying remarks {{on how long}} she intends to {{maintain}} her tennis career. Following the retirement of 25-year-old Justine Henin in 2008, Sharapova said, [...] "If I [...] 25, and I'd won so many Grand Slams, I'd quit too." [...] In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open, she balked {{at the idea of}} playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a [...] "nice husband and a few kids" [...] by then. However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis {{for as long as she}} enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated, [...] "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement." ...|$|E
