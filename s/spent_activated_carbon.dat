40|$|A Fenton-driven {{mechanism}} for regenerating <b>spent</b> granular <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> (GAC) was recently proposed and tested (1, 2). This technology involves the combined use of two reliable and well-established treatment technologies: adsorption on GAC and Fenton oxidation. Environmental contaminants are immobilized {{and concentrated on}} the GAC during carbon adsorption treatment, and subsequently transformed by the Fenton mechanism generated hydroxyl radical (OH) and superoxide radical (O 2 -) during oxidative treatment. The objective of the treatment process is to: • Transform the contaminants into less toxic by-products • Re-establish the sorptive capacity of the carbon for the target chemicals • Increase the useful life of the GAC • Reduce costs for GAC regeneration and water or air treatment This project involves three main components: • Test {{the applicability of the}} adsorption/oxidation treatment technology to methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) • Optimize the treatment process • Investigate fundamental mechanisms with the treatment process Two regeneration cycles of MTBE-spent <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> under aggressive oxidant conditions were accomplished without significant deterioration of the physical structure and adsorption capacity of the carbon (91 percent regeneration) (3). The reaction by-products from MTBE oxidation were also degraded and did not accumulate significantly on the GAC. Multiple treatments of GAC without sorbed contaminants underwent chemical and physical changes that reduced the sorptive capacity of the GAC (4). Protection of the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> during oxidative treatment can be provided by the adsorbate due to fewer reactions between OH and carbon surfaces relative to reactions between OH and the target adsorbate.

40|$|Effective {{treatment}} of dyestuff containing textile dyeing industry effluents require advanced treatment {{technologies such as}} adsorption {{for the removal of}} dyestuffs. Powdered commercial coal based <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> has been the most widely used adsorbent for the removal of dyestuffs from dyeing industry effluents. As an alternative to commercial coal based <b>activated</b> <b>carbon,</b> <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> prepared from dried tannery sludge was used as an adsorbent for dyestuff removal from simulated textile dying industry effluent in this study. The color removal performance of tannery sludge derived <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> and commercial coal based <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> has been investigated using parameters such as adsorbent dosage, initial dye concentration, pH and temperature. It was found that tannery sludge derived <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> exhibits dye removal efficiency that is about 80 – 90 % of that observed with commercial coal based <b>activated</b> <b>carbon.</b> The amount of dye adsorbed on to tannery sludge derived <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> is lower compared with commercial <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> at equilibrium and dye adsorption capacity increased with increase of initial dye concentration and temperature, and deceasing pH. It was found that the Langmuir isotherm appears to fit the isotherm data better than the Freundlich isotherm. The leachate of heavy metals from tannery sludge derived <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> to the environment is very low, which ar...|$|R
