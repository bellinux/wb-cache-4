5|$|Wadhurst Tunnel {{collapsed}} in 1862 {{and it was}} discovered by the SER that the same situation existed there too. Rectification cost £10,231. By 1877, only one train was permitted in Bopeep Tunnel at a time. The tunnel was partly widened in 1934–35. In November 1949, serious defects were discovered in the tunnel. <b>Single-line</b> working {{was put in place}} on 19November, but the tunnel had to be closed completely a week later. The tunnel was partially relined with cast iron segments. It reopened to traffic on 5June 1950. Mountfield Tunnel was underpinned in 1938–39, remaining open with <b>single-line</b> working in operation. It partially collapsed on 17November 1974, resulting in <b>single-line</b> working until 31January 1975. The line was then closed until 17March whilst the track was singled through the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the Canadian {{astronomer}} William E. Harper {{used this}} technique {{to measure the}} period of this <b>single-line</b> spectroscopic binary and determined it to be 21.724 days. He also initially estimated the orbital eccentricity as 0.027. (Later estimates gave an eccentricity of essentially zero, which is the value for a circular orbit.) The velocity amplitude was measured as 41.5 km/s, which is the maximum velocity of the primary component {{along the line of}} sight to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The Great North {{had opened}} using {{a system of}} telegraphic train orders, and as the {{signalling}} was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange tokens {{in a process that}} frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token exchange system based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first tokens were exchanged at , but soon they were exchanged at line speed. After trialling on the Fraserburgh line, the system was installed on the coast route in May 1889, and by 1 January 1893 it was in operation on all <b>single-line</b> sections.|$|E
5|$|When the Radstock branch was constructed, it was {{intended}} to link it to the main line of the Paulton branch at Midford, which was at a lower level at this point. The Lock Fund created in 1802 was to have paid for the construction of the locks, but because there was little regular traffic on the branch, the company built one lock, an aqueduct over the Midford Brook, and a short tramway to bridge the gap. This contributed to the economic failure of the branch, and its replacement by a tramway in 1815. The tramway was laid along the former canal's towpath. It was <b>single-line</b> with passing places every , and was originally laid using cast iron plates on stone block sleepers, but was relaid using wrought iron plates.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{was officially}} opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 9 September 2015. Her Majesty {{travelled}} with the Duke of Edinburgh and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on LNER Class A4 4488 Union of South Africa {{in the presence}} of its owner, John Cameron. The locomotive hauled a rake of Mark 1s provided by the SRPS as well as Pullman car No. 310 Pegasus. Due to bad weather, the Queen's helicopter journey from Balmoral was delayed which resulted in the late departure of the train and a delay at Newcraighall while a ScotRail service cleared the <b>single-line</b> section to the south. Her Majesty alighted at Newtongrange to unveil a plaque marking the opening of the railway; a second plaque was unveiled at Tweedbank. The following day the LNER Class A4 commenced a six-week programme of Borders steam specials promoted by ScotRail which saw services run to Tweedbank for three days each week. Around 6,200 passengers were carried on the 17 fully booked services.|$|E
25|$|Most {{stations}} have two tracks with an island platform between them. Of the <b>single-line</b> stations, only the stations Olympia-Einkaufszentrum (U1), Richard-Strauss-Straße (U4), Neuperlach Süd (U5), Garching-Hochbrück and Nordfriedhof (both U6) have side platforms.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} system, {{which is}} under the full responsibility of the state-owned company ETED (Electricity Transmission Company), consists of 940km of 138kV <b>single-line</b> circuit lines that radiate from Santo Domingo to the north, east, and west.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} {{operation}} of the Sheffield Supertram {{are similar to those}} of a traditional railway. Unlike normal trains, tramways can be operated without signalling, although block signalling is sometimes necessary on <b>single-line</b> sections. The trams are driven on a line-of-sight basis, so that the tram can be stopped if an obstruction is spotted ahead.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt in stages. The first stage was to erect the new steel arches under the two {{original}} wrought-iron tubes. The arches were completed, and <b>single-line</b> working was {{restored to the}} railway on 30 January 1972 by reusing one of the tubes. The next stage was to dismantle and remove the other tube {{and replace it with}} a concrete deck for the other rail track. Then the <b>single-line</b> working was transfered to the new track. That allowed the other tube to be removed and replaced with a concrete deck and the other rail track installed. A normal two-way rail service was then restored in 1974. Finally the upper road deck was installed and by July 1980, over 10 years after the fire, the new road crossing was completed, and formally opened by HRH the Prince of Wales, carrying a single-carriageway section of the A55 road.|$|E
25|$|By 1866, the Atlantic {{slave trade}} had brought nearly 400,000 Africans to North America. The slaves came largely from West Africa {{and the greater}} Congo River basin and brought strong musical traditions with them. The African traditions {{primarily}} use a <b>single-line</b> melody and call-and-response pattern, and the rhythms have a counter-metric structure and reflect African speech patterns.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January, a {{deputation}} visited Birmingham {{to inspect}} the trolleybus system, following which a recommendation was made to introduce this system in place of all <b>single-line</b> tramways in the City. A provisional order was obtained to convert the Nottingham Road, Wilford Road and Wells Road sections. A limit of nine tons gross weight was imposed by the Ministry on these vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Because {{double and}} single track may use {{different}} signalling systems, {{it may be}} awkward and confusing to mix double and single track too often. For example, intermediate mechanical signal boxes on a double-track line can be closed during periods of light traffic, but this cannot be done {{if there is a}} <b>single-line</b> section in between. This problem is less serious with electrical signalling such as Centralized traffic control.|$|E
25|$|These {{and similar}} {{electronic}} typewriters were in essence dedicated word processors with either <b>single-line</b> LCD displays or multi-line CRT displays, built-in line editors in ROM, a spelling and grammar checker, a few kilobytes of internal RAM and optional cartridge, magnetic card or diskette external memory-storage devices for storing text and even document formats. Text could be entered a line or paragraph {{at a time}} and edited using the display and built-in software tools before being committed to paper.|$|E
25|$|When one {{track of}} a {{double-track}} railway {{is out of}} service for maintenance or a train breaks down, all trains may be concentrated on the one good track. There may be bi-directional signalling and suitable crossovers to enable trains {{to move on to}} the other track expeditiously (see, for example, the article on the Channel Tunnel), or there may be some kind of manual safeworking to control trains on what is now a section of single track. See <b>single-line</b> working.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, {{concern was}} {{expressed}} in Parliament over {{the closing of}} the bridge to road traffic at peak times. The following year, the Manchester Ship Canal Company agreed that the bridge would generally stay open for road traffic during rush hour, though this could not be guaranteed. A cargo vessel struck the bridge on 28 December 1948, restricting the bridge to <b>single-line</b> working and a two-ton weight limit until repairs had been completed. In 1953, traffic was banned from turning right off the bridge into Barton Road.|$|E
25|$|When the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) {{approved}} VGN's 1959 merger into NW, it heralded {{a merger}} movement and a modernization {{of the entire}} U.S. railroad industry. In 1964, the former Wabash; Nickel Plate; Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway; and Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad were brought into the system {{in one of the}} most complex mergers of the era. This consolidation, plus the 1976 addition of a more direct route to Chicago, Illinois, made NW an important Midwestern railroad that provided direct <b>single-line</b> service between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes and Mississippi River.|$|E
25|$|The project {{involved}} electrification of {{the surface}} lines (operated by steam trains at the time), the doubling of the original <b>single-line</b> section between Finchley Central and the proposed junction with the Edgware branch of the Northern line, {{and the construction of}} three new linking sections of track: a connection between Northern City Line and Finsbury Park station on the surface; an extension from Archway to the LNER line near East Finchley via new deep-level platforms below Highgate station; and a short diversion from just before the LNER's Edgware station to the Underground's station of the same name.|$|E
25|$|The {{line from}} Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells (via East Grinstead High Level and Groombridge) opened on 1 October 1866, with the {{connecting}} line from Uckfield via Eridge opening on 3 August 1868. The {{connection between the}} LBSCR station at Tunbridge Wells West and Tunbridge Wells Central opened on 1 February 1876. This <b>single-line</b> section passed through the short Grove Tunnel to Grove Junction, sited a little south of the South Eastern Railway station on its Hastings Line. In 1881 a new track alignment was built between Polegate and Hailsham allowing trains to run into Polegate at {{the west end of}} the station and direct to Eastbourne.|$|E
25|$|As the Wilford Road tram track needed repair, trolleybuses {{were again}} {{considered}} for this road and in September, following {{a report from}} the Manager regarding the whole of the services and types of traction, {{the decision was made to}} replace the <b>single-line</b> tram lines along Wells Road and Wilford Road with trolleybuses, and to apply for powers in the 1929 Parliamentary session to operate, in one direction, via George Street, Victoria Street and South Parade. It was also agreed that when further motorbuses were required, vehicles of larger capacity would be purchased in order to give a better service and improved peak hour facilities.|$|E
25|$|This {{series is}} again {{perforated}} 12, {{and the values}} between 1¢ and 50¢ are printed on <b>single-line</b> watermarked paper. The 50¢ and $1 issues, however, are instead printed on double-line watermarked paper {{left over from the}} production of the 1908 series. Denominations not included in this printing are the 3, 4, 5 and 6-cent stamps as there were still adequate stocks of these available. Of special interest is the first appearance of the 7-cent Washington-head, with its premier color of black, issued on April 29, 1914. An estimated 5 million 7-cent stamps were printed, a relatively low number for a definitive issue. It was available in post offices for only five months, for this denomination went through a perforation change in the next series, thus making it a new and separate issue.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 1990s, the {{reliability}} of the fleet became a problem again. By this time, the class was solely used on the West of England route, having been replaced on the Oxford route by Class 47/4 locomotives, displaced from Railfreight Distribution after the collapse of Speedlink in 1991. Arguably, the Class 50s were not suitable for the stop-start service pattern of Waterloo-Exeter services, nor to the extended <b>single-line</b> sections of this route, where a single locomotive failure could cause chaos. Therefore, the decision was taken to retire the fleet, temporarily replacing them with Class 47/7 locomotives, which were in turn replaced by new Diesel Multiple Units. From 1992, the Oxford route was worked by Class 165 and Class 166 units, whilst Class 159 units were introduced onto the West of England route in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The new Toyota FC Stack {{achieves}} a maximum output of 114kW (153hp). Electricity generation efficiency has been enhanced {{through the use}} of 3D fine mesh flow channels. These channels—a world first, according to Toyota—are arranged in a fine three-dimensional lattice structure and enhance the dispersion of air (oxygen), thereby enabling uniform generation of electricity on cell surfaces. This, in turn, provides a compact size and a high level of performance, including the stack’s world-leading power output density of 3.1kW/L (2.2 times higher than that of the previous Toyota FCHV-adv limited-lease model), or 2.0kW/kg. Each stack comprises 370 (<b>single-line</b> stacking) cells, with a cell thickness of 1.34mm and weight of 102 g. The compact Mirai FC stack generates about 160 times more power than the residential fuel cells on sale in Japan. The Mirai has a new compact (13-liter), high-efficiency, high-capacity converter developed to boost voltage generated in the Toyota FC Stack to 650 volts.|$|E
25|$|This series again {{includes}} Washington-heads on denominations 1-cent through 7-cents and Franklin-heads on the 8-cent through 1-dollar values. It is {{the first}} series to include the 11-cent denomination with the Franklin and Oak leaves design, colored slate-green, which appears again in the following two series of 1916 and 1917. Lower values of the series are printed from plates of 400 on <b>single-line</b> watermarked paper, while the one-dollar Franklin is printed from plates of 200 subjects and uses double-line watermarked paper of the appropriate size. Because of stamp separation problems in previous issues using gauge 12 perforations, particularly when attempting to tear a block of stamps from the sheet to cover postage on parcels, this series was instead issued with gauge 10. The perforations of this gauge would soon {{prove to be a}} problem also, as the coarser gauge of perforation made it more difficult to separate stamps, often resulting in torn stamps.|$|E
25|$|Beginning on January 3, 1911 the Bureau of Engraving and Printing {{issued the}} 1-cent and 2-cent {{denominations}} in imperforate form on <b>single-line</b> watermarked paper specifically {{for use by}} at least seven different private coil-stamp vending machine companies. Each company used its own distinctive types of perforations, and most firms continued to experiment with them. Thus on the 1-cent issues, these five companies employed a total of 18 different types of private perforations, while 19 types exist on the 2-cent denomination. These private perforations, designed to fit the specific mechanisms of the various vending machines, were applied to imperforate sheets of 400 stamps after those sheets had been cut into either vertical or horizontal strips (the first such sheets had been issued in 1906 {{at the request of}} various vending machine companies). Joseph Schermack is generally credited with producing the first coil stamp vending machine. Privately applied perforations continued to be used well into the 1920s, and comprise a distinctive segment of U.S. postal history.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scheduled}} service with a Class 72 train occurred on 8 August 2002 on the Jæren Commuter Rail. NSB {{stated that they}} had never previously spent so much time testing equipment before putting it into service, and that the Jæren had been chosen for the introduction because the <b>single-line</b> system was easier to operate than the services around Oslo. The company also stated that they hoped all the trains would be in service by the end of 2003. By January 2003, half the trains had been delivered, and were gradually being put into service on the Oslo Commuter Rail. However, on the Gardermoen Line the electronics from the train were interfering with the signaling systems, so the lights would switch from green to red before the train passed, instead of afterwards. This made it impossible for the NSB to put the train into service on Norway's only high-speed line. Another problem was that the trains would not close the doors if they were at a station without level tracks, although this was quickly solved. In 2003, NSB decided to abandon the Puls concept, and revert to the former single-profile strategy.|$|E
25|$|The first steam tram {{to service}} Darling Street was in 1892. Ten {{years later the}} service was electrified. A feature of this line was a {{counterweight}} dummy system that controlled and assisted trams on a steep <b>single-line</b> section of track near the terminus at Darling Street wharf. Due to the very steep incline {{at the bottom of}} the street, the trams used a complex 'dummy' / counterweight system constructed under the road surface. A 4-wheel 'dummy' car sat on the single-track at the top of the hill, connected via a large sheave under the track to the counterweight running on a narrow-gauge track in a tunnel under the road. A tram destined for the wharf would close-up to the dummy and push it down the steep hill (gradient 1 in 8), thus raising the counterweight and being assisted in braking. The tram was then assisted up the hill by the weight of the descending counterweight via the dummy. The dummy is behind car 2010 in the photograph below, and is on display at the Sydney Tramway Museum. The slot through which the dummy was fixed to the cable can be seen in that photograph.|$|E
25|$|A 3-cent Washington-head coil stamp (Scott 389) {{issued in}} 1911 is {{commonly}} referred to as the Orangeburg coil. It was printed with the flat-plate press on <b>single-line</b> watermarked paper with vertical, gauge 12, perforations. The Post Office produced only a small batch of these stamps (it would soon switch over to gauge 8½ perforations for coils) and apparently sold them all to the Bell Pharmaceutical Company, which used 3¢ coil stamps to send samples of their products to physicians through the mail. The actual quantity issued remains unknown. The earliest known use on cover is dated April 27, 1911. Due to the quantity of mail, they were put through the first-class canceling machine at Orangeburg, New York and were mailed third-class. Because these stamps were used on third class mail, most were eventually discarded. Owing to its limited and specific usage philatelists were at first unaware of this issue for approximately two years and so very few examples were saved and collected in mint condition, which accounts for their rarity of this issue today. Approximately twelve covers have been certified as genuine by the Philatelic Foundation. The Orangeburg coils are the rarest coils of the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E
25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a {{standard}} letter. The seven separate and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The different issues can be distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: perforation gauge, the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the printing method used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of <b>single-line</b> and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a special fluid). In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with China clay paper, but whether such a paper stock actually existed has become a matter of dispute.|$|E
25|$|Watermarks {{occur in}} paper and are {{made during the}} paper making process by means of various devices that impart an {{impression}} in the wet paper pulp, the impression usually consisting of an official emblem or letter(s). The actual watermark portion of the paper is thinner than the surrounding paper. The difference in paper thickness can usually be detected by holding the stamp up to a light, however some countries have issued stamps whose watermarks {{are very difficult to}} detect in this manner and require watermark detection fluid. Watermarks were originally used by governments for documents, currency and other applications to help prevent counterfeiting. The U.S. Post office began using a double-line watermark bearing the initials USPS in 1895, when the Bureau of Engraving and Printing introduced it into the previously unwatermarked Bureau Triangles stamp issues. The same double-line watermark paper used then was used on the various issues leading up to and used in the production of the 1908 and 1909 versions of the Washington-Franklin issues. In 1910 the watermark was changed to a <b>single-line</b> watermark and with initials which were smaller in size, partly because the double-line watermark tended to weaken the sheets at the perforations causing premature separation of stamps at the Post Office, and partly because postal officials suspected that the double-line watermark caused the stamp paper to shrink unevenly when the sheets dried after printing.|$|E

The route is located within the state of Tamil Nadu and travels through the Nilgiri Hills, which are popularly known as the Blue Mountains of Southern India. The Nilgiri is the only rack railway in India and it uses an Abt rack system. The ABT system requires use of special steam locomotives.

He began giving private music lessons at around the same time, including to saxophonist Lee Konitz. From 1943 Tristano also taught at the Axel Christensen School of Popular Music. He first received press coverage for his piano playing in early 1944, appearing in Metronomes summary of music in Chicago from that year, and then in Down Beat from 1945.
