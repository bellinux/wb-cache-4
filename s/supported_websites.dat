40|$|The {{websites}} {{marketing is}} becoming an important tool both for multinationals and SMEs, {{in their effort to}} internationalizing their business. This study focuses on the international opportunities that are present within the European markets. The paper aims at identifying the degree of websites marketing standardization vs. adaptation, as a marketing tool for cosmetic products. Moreover, the study examines in a comparative manner the standardization strategy of multinationals and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), leaders in European markets, for different cosmetic cathegories. The evaluation of online advertising standardization is based on the modified Model for Testing Advertising Standardization, developed by Whitelock and Chung. The web sites degree of localizations are analyzed based upon 98 criteria, as resulted from an adapted methodology of ProfNet Institut fur Internet Marketing, Munster (Germany). The sample includes the 101 leaders from European markets. The research outcomes reflect a standardized websites marketing policy for SMEs and localized for multinationals. Also, for perfumes, dental care products and toiletry, European cosmetic leaders implement standardized websites marketing policies and balanced for the other cosmetics categories.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) seeds has been followed by the rapid production of GM crops. Many insightful contributions {{have been made in}} the academic literature on the emergence of agricultural biotechnology, however, some gaps remain. First, there is a lack of emphasis on capitalist development in relation to agricultural biotechnology. Second, the capitalist character of the state is underemphasized. Third, there is little discussion about the interests underlying pro-GM crops discourses. Fourth, economic studies on GM crops rely on data and mathematical models to reach conclusions but do not explain them. The problematic for this research is: how are capitalist social relations manifested in and supported by the development, adoption, and production of GM crops? The {{development of}} agricultural biotechnology is the result of capitalist social relations that demand innovation. This is enabled by a conjunction of social actors and scientific practices. The outcome is a research and development (R&D) structure that broadly accommodates capital by promoting the patenting of life forms in agriculture, concentration and centralization among multinational GM seed and agrochemical corporations, and the global production of GM crops. In the Canadian case, an attempt is made by the state to secure the agricultural biotechnology industry through the procurement of R&D, legislation, and regulation and by the state countering civil society organizations that challenge such outcomes. In addition, the state and sections of civil society, government scientists and bureaucrats, corporations, and industry <b>supported</b> <b>websites</b> and NGOs play an important role in the construction of a pro-GM crops discourse that serves to control the discursive norms and institutional contexts that surround agricultural biotechnology. This seeks to represent the interest of capitalist accumulation and those of individual capitals as the general interests of the Canadian public and farming communities. Lastly, the restructuring of the agricultural sector encompasses different conditions among which has been greater concentration and centralization of multinational GM seed and agrochemical corporations and the increase in the production of GM crops. The consequences for Canadian farmers include stagnant net farm income despite increasing yields and gross income, higher farm expenses and debt, and stringent patent laws...|$|E

The purpose of this study was to ascertain the type of resources and support features online faculty need, desire, and expect in a <b>support</b> <b>website.</b> The method used to collect research findings was an online survey. The participants for this study consisted of the online faculty population at an institution of higher learning in the southwestern United States. Participants were invited by email to participate in a 13 question survey which asked participants to rate the importance of the questions listed. Of the 2, 522 survey invitations e-mailed to potential participants, 380 responded with completed surveys, providing a response rate of 15. 06 %. Although this was a relativity low response rate, researchers felt the demographics of the respondents provided an accurate representation of the population studied. Findings from the survey indicated participants agree there is a need to implement a <b>support</b> <b>website.</b> Participants indicated the <b>support</b> <b>website</b> should provide <b>support</b> resources, communication forums, and resources to increase connectivity to the institution.
