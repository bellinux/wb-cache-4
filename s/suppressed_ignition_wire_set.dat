40|$|An {{extensive}} {{program to}} improve {{the operation of the}} Ames 16 Inch Shock Tunnel was carried out. This included reduction of driver slosh wave amplitudes and detonation risk by the use of premixed He/O 2 gas, longer wait times between the last gas load and driver gas ignition, an improved gas loading sequence, the use of four instead of one <b>ignition</b> <b>wire,</b> and the use of lower <b>ignition</b> <b>wire</b> voltages. Successful operation of the tunnel at pressures of 2000 - 6000 psi and enthalpies up to 12, 000 J/gm was achieved. A new diaphragm breaking technique, self break on the driver combustion pressure rise, was tested and found to produce clean breaks over the full pressure range of the tunnel. Improvements were made to the driver gas loading manifold and a preliminary design was made of a gas mixing system which mixes all three gases on the fly just before injection into the driver. Other improvements as well as tests are discussed...|$|R

A theoretically based hypothesis is introduced to help explain the cause of driver tube pressure oscillations that occur during combustion.

50|$|The {{amount of}} energy in the spark {{required}} to ignite the air-fuel mixture varies depending on the pressure and composition of the mixture, and on the speed of the engine. Under laboratory conditions as little as 1 millijoule is required in each spark, but practical coils must deliver much more energy than this to allow for higher pressure, rich or lean mixtures, losses in <b>ignition</b> <b>wiring,</b> and plug fouling and leakage. When gas velocity is high in the spark gap, the arc between the terminals is blown away from the terminals, making the arc longer and requiring more energy in each spark. Between 30 and 70 milli-joules are delivered in each spark.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to investigate, through experimental means, the basic mechanisms influencing ignition overpressure and to determine ways to <b>suppress</b> <b>ignition</b> overpressure. Ignition overpressure was studied using solid rocket motors with geometry scaled at 1 percent of the Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters. Both water injection and aerosol foam were examined as a mean of reducing ignition overpressure. The results of the water injection tests indicate that a relatively small amount of water is sufficient to provide significant suppression. Of the flow rates tested, the lower water injection flow rates provided the best reduction of the ignition overpressure wave. Also, the test results show there is an optimum water flow rate range that provides the best suppression, and as this range is exceeded the effectiveness of water to reduce ignition overpressure is decreased. Aerosol foam provided very little reduction of ignition overpressure, but only small volumes of foam were used and further testing is necessary to determine its total effectiveness {{as a means of}} suppression...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described here}} {{show that the}} cracking at sharp bends, observed in the insulation of internal combustion engine high tension <b>ignition</b> <b>wires</b> after service, {{is due to a}} chemical attack upon the rubber by the ozone produced by the electric discharge that takes place at the surface of the cable. This cracking does not occur if the insulating material is not under tension, or if the cable is surrounded by some medium other than air. But it does occur even if the insulation is not subjected to electric stress, provided that the atmosphere near the cable contains ozone. The extent of this cracking varies greatly with the insulating material used. The cracking can be materially reduced by using braided cable and by avoiding sharp bends...|$|R

50|$|Classes {{and rules}} vary from sanctioning body to sanctioning body, but {{typically}} {{the majority of}} competitors run lightly modified or unmodified (stock) vehicles. SCCA classing, which is also adopted by many independent clubs, {{has a variety of}} Street (formerly known as Stock) classes which range from Super Street for cars like the Corvette Z06 (either the C5 or C6 variants) and Lotus Elise, to H Street for Honda Civics and Mini Coopers. The Street classes allow very little change from how the car was originally manufactured; most items that can be changed are the normal wear items (filters, street-legal tires, shocks/struts, <b>ignition</b> <b>wires).</b> Just beyond Street, there are Street Touring and Street Prepared classes which allow mild modifications, such as those to suspension (wheels, springs, shocks), external engine parts (intakes and exhaust manifolds), and interior (replacement of seats, not removal).|$|R
