40|$|The first Bell Aerospace BGM- 3 Marine Gravity Meter System {{available}} for academic use was installed on R/V Robert D. Conrad in February, 1984. The BGM- 3 system {{consists of a}} forced feedback accelerometer mounted on a gyrostabilized platform. Its sensor (requiring no cross-coupling correction) is a significant improvement over existing beam and spring-type <b>sea</b> <b>gravimeters</b> such as the GSS- 2. A gravity survey over the Wallops Island test range together {{with the results of}} subsequent cruises allow evaluation of the precision, accuracy, and capabilities of the new system. Over the test range, the BGM- 3 data were compared directly to data obtained by a GSS- 2 meter onboard R/V Conrad. The rms discrepancy between free-air gravity anomaly values at intersecting ship tracks of R/V Conrad was ± 0. 38 mGal for BGM- 3 compared to ± 1. 60 mGal for the GSS- 2. Moreover, BGM- 3 's platform recovered from abrupt changes in ship's heading more rapidly than did the platform of GSS- 2. The principal factor limiting the accuracy of sea gravity data is navigation. Over the test range, where navigation was by Loran C and transit satellite, a two-step filtering of the ship's velocity and position was required to obtain an optimal Eötvös correction. A spectral analysis of 1 minute values of the Eötvös correction and the reduced free-air gravity anomaly determined the filter characteristics. To minimize the coherence between the Eötvös and free-air anomaly, it was necessary to prefilter the ship's position and velocity. Using this procedure, reduced free-air gravity anomalies with wavelengths as small as a few kilometers can be resolved...|$|R
50|$|Vening Meinesz then {{designed}} a new gravimeter, which the KNMI (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute) built. The apparatus has two pendula {{of the same}} size hanging in a frame but moving in opposite phases. With mirrors and lightbeams the difference in amplitude of the two pendula is captured on a film. Vening Meinesz had discovered that horizontal accelerations (as by waves on a boat) had no influence on the difference in amplitude between the two pendula. The recorded difference then is the amplitude of a theoretical, undisturbed pendulum. Now it became possible to measure gravity more accurately. Vening Meinesz started with measuring gravity all over the Netherlands, for which a network of 51 monitoring stations was created. This became a success, which encouraged him to do measurements at <b>sea.</b> A perfected <b>gravimeter,</b> hanging in a 'swing', was designed. The experiment was successful.|$|R

40|$|A {{principal}} {{aim of the}} SACS project is to monitor the injected CO 2 by geophysical methods {{and to develop a}} robust and repeatable monitoring and verification methodology for future CO 2 sequestration operations. This report evaluates the applicability of microgravity surveys as a means of monitoring the future subsurface distribution and migration of the Sleipner CO 2 bubble. Time-lapse seismic data acquired in 1999, after 2. 3 MT of CO 2 injection, show an exceptionally clear image of the CO 2 bubble, characterised by very high reflection amplitudes. The outer envelope of the amplitude anomaly roughly defines an elliptical cylindrical ‘bubble envelope’, 225 m high, with a major axis of 1500 m oriented NNE and a minor axis of 600 m. Gravity modelling was based on a number of scenarios. Two ‘in situ’ scenarios assume that the CO 2 is entirely contained within the bubble envelope. The 1999 and 2001 in situ models assume respectively that 2. 3 MT and 4 MT of CO 2 are contained within the envelope. Two migration scenarios are also modelled. The first assumes that 2. 3 MT of CO 2 migrate vertically upwards into the overlying caprock succession to between depths of 375 and 600 m. The second migration model looks further ahead to the situation where 3 x 107 m 3 (10. 5 – 21. 0 MT depending on the density) of CO 2 have been injected, and migrate laterally beneath the caprock {{at the top of the}} reservoir. Results depend strongly on the assumed density of the injected CO 2 at reservoir conditions, which is subject to significant uncertainty. Only one, poorly-constrained, reservoir temperature measurement of 37 ° C is available. A density-depth profile based on this suggests that the density of CO 2 in the reservoir is 700 kgm- 3. However the possibility of significantly lower densities cannot be discounted and modelling also includes a lower density case of 350 kgm- 3. The 1999 and 2001 in situ cases produce anomalies which would be barely detectable if the higher density of CO 2 is assumed. With the lower density however anomalies should be readily detectable with a modern <b>seabed</b> <b>gravimeter.</b> The vertical migration scenario indicates that large-scale vertical migration into the caprock, to depths where densities would be unequivocally lower, would be readily detected. The lateral migration scenario, whereby a single thin layer of CO 2 migrates beneath the top reservoir seal, produces small anomalies which may be locally detectable but with insufficient resolution to enable effective migration mapping. However if lateral migration is via several layers, beneath intra-reservoir shales, then anomalies should be more usefully measurable. Obtaining time-lapse gravimeter readings directly above the bubble would appear to offer the best chance of obtaining useful information. Coupled with geometric information provided by the time-lapse seismic data, the gravity should be able to discriminate between the low and high CO 2 density scenarios. This would provide important constraints on future reservoir modelling and also the volume estimates based on the seismic velocity pushdown effect. Related to this, gravity data would offer the potential to provide independent verification of the amount of CO 2 sequestered. In addition gravimetric surveys above the bubble could provide an effective ‘early warning’ of major caprock breaching...|$|R
5000|$|The first gravity {{measurements}} at sea {{had been}} made in 1926 from a submarine of the Royal Navy.

40|$|The gravity field may be {{determined}} using different techniques, but airborne gravity surveying {{is becoming a}} powerful tool mainly due to its potential in remote areas. One of the main problems in airborne gravity is {{the separation of the}} vertical accelerations acting on the airborne platform from the natural gravity anomalies. GPS information can be used for INS in-flight alignment, calibration of inertial sensor readings and ensure long term navigational accuracy for low cost inertial navigation systems. Such a system was developed in support of an airborne gravimetric and altimetric campaign {{that took place in the}} Azores region, Portugal in October 1997, in the scope of the AGMASCO (Airborne Geoid MApping System for Coastal Oceanography) project. This system was originally developed with the only purpose of determining the navigational parameters (attitude, velocity and position) of the aircraft. However, it is also capable of producing estimates of the vertical gravity anomaly. Since this anomaly is one of the main perturbations to the performance of the navigation system, it had to be estimated together with the inertial sensor biases in order to improve the final solutions. Therefore it was decided to test the ability of a low cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) as a gravity measuring device. This paper describes the methodology followed to obtain estimates of the local gravity anomaly by integrating GPS and inertial measurements. The results show that the gravity anomaly measured by diferential GPS/IMU integrated system matches quite well the results obtained with Lacoste & Romberg (L&R) <b>sea</b> and air <b>gravimeters.</b> The ability of this kind of inertial system to recover gravity anomalies, focused on medium wavelengths perturbation signals, was evaluated. The lack of long term stability of the IMU accelerometers and gyros renders long wavelength gravity anomaly determination impracticable. This integrated DGPS/IMU system can be seen as a complement to a gravimeter, which exhibits a long term stability...|$|R
