50|$|Both the gluteus medius and gluteus maximus {{have greater}} {{activity}} in the kicking leg during the foot planting stage (Stage 2) preparing to raise the leg posterior of the body. During the backward swing in stage 3, the hamstrings (bicep femoris, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus) are activated to flex the knee and extend the hip in the swinging limb. Hamstrings are also activated in the supporting limb throughout the swinging stages until foot comes {{into contact with the}} ball to allow stabilization and balance. Stabilizer muscles, such as the gluteus medius and psoas, on the supporting limb are active to prevent the hip from adducting. As the kicking limb begins forward movement in stage 4, quadriceps, hip flexor muscles (iliopsoas), knee extensor muscles including the rectus femoris creates concentric activity to produce a fast forward velocity toward the ball by extending the knee and flexing the hip. During the <b>swing</b> <b>stage</b> prior to contact of the ball in stage 5, there is greater activation of the rectus femoris and the vastus medialis that may contribute to final knee extension speed. Also during the swinging limb stages, the gluteus medius has a greater activation in the supporting limb to allow rotation of the hip. In the follow-through phase (Stage 6), the gluteus maximus is activated in the kicking limb and during the leg cocking stage in the supporting limb to allow rotation of the hip. The gastrocnemius exhibited greatest muscle {{activity in the}} kicking leg during all stages of the motion, although it exhibited greatest muscle activity in the supporting limb in the swinging limb loading and the swinging limb stages (Stages 3 and 4, respectively), when the leg is cocked back and accelerates forward towards the ball.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} of the paper is to study different parameters involve in building a Scaffolding system for High ‐ Rise Structures for supporting formworks, working platform and passageway for material logistics etc. The study also includes analysis of design guidelines for safe erection of scaffolding system. Scaffolding is the structure used or intended to use for supporting framework, <b>swinging</b> <b>stage,</b> suspended stage or protection of workers engaged in or in connection with construction work, {{for the purpose of}} carrying out that work or for the support of material transportation from one level to other or connection with any such work. Scaffolding system is defined as the planning for the design, erection and the inspection of the use and the dismantling of any scaffolding. By law, worker must have safe working environment. And most construction work involves working at heights which cannot be safely or easily reached from the ground or part of the building. The scaffolding design criteria consider the strength; stability; rigidity of the supporting structure and the safety of persons engaged in the erection, alteration and dismantling of the scaffold. When any material is transferred on or to a scaffold it shall be moved or deposited without imposing any violent shock. Scaffold system shall be properly maintained and every part shall be kept so fixed, secured or placed in a position as to prevent, as far as is practicable, accidental displacement. Thus, it must be designed for the most adverse combination of dead loads, live loads, impact loads and environmental loads that can reasonably be expected during the service life of scaffolding.

40|$|Background: The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee {{is one of the}} most frequently injured ligaments in the body. 70 % of ACL injuries are sustained without any direct contact to the knee, during the early stance phase of a rapid deceleration movement. Females have a significantly greater risk of injury than males participating in the same activities. In the years following injury, ACL deficient individuals are likely to experience lasting joint pain, functional instabilities and the onset of osteoarthritis. The best practice model for management of ACL injuries is a continued emphasis on prevention, which is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of how the injuries occur. Hypothesis: Body biomechanics occurring during the terminal swing phase of a dynamic deceleration movement can predict the resulting weight acceptance phase ACL loading in both ligament bundles. This will further the understanding of the sequence of events that result in non - con tact ACL injuries. Methods: For a preliminary feasibility study, a musculoskeletal model was developed in OpenSim incorporating both anteromedial (AMB) and posterolateral (PLB) bundles of the ACL. Motion capture data of female soccer players (n = 10, mean age = 19. 60 ± 1. 49 years) performing unanticipated side - step cutting movements were recorded. Instantaneous, three dimensional joint angles and angular velocities at the mid - <b>swing</b> <b>stage</b> of the side - step were selected as the independent variables. The dependent variables were the maximum stance - phase AMB and PLB strains. Multiple pairwise correlation analyses were used to quantify linear relationships between these variables. To evaluate the overall potential to predict ACL strain, a best subsets linear regression model was implemented using only the significantly correlated independent variables. Each ligament bundle was analysed independently. Results: Hip internal rotation at the mid - <b>swing</b> <b>stage</b> explained 79. 1 % (95 % CI: 59. 9 % - 98. 2 %) of the variance in maximum stance - phase anteromedial bundle strain (p = 0. 0006). Mid - swing knee varus position and knee valgus velocity combined explained 83. 3 % (95 % CI: 69. 2 % - 97. 3 %) of the variance in maximum stance - phase posterolateral bundle strain (p = 0. 0019). Conclusions: Swing - phase body kinematics during a side - step movement can provide meaningful predictive information as to the future strain in both bundles of the ACL. They are thus useful components in understanding and exploring elements of the inciting e vent, particularly a kinematic "sequence of no return" that directly precedes the injury. The results validate continued research in this area, where the iv relationships identified in this preliminary investigation can guide the development of a priori hypotheses for future studies to be completed at higher levels of evidence. Clinical Relevance: A more comprehensive understanding of the variables that result in non - contact ACL injuries will allow for the design and implementation of more effective preventative measures. For example, knowledge of the "sequence of no return" could be used in sophisticated statistical systems to predict ACL injury events in real - time. This could be used to trigger an active knee brace to apply external support to the knee, pre venting damage to the ligament. The long - term outcome of this project is to move towards reducing the risk and incidence of ACL injuries and the associated negative effects, preserving knee - vitality and ensuring quality of life for athletes and active individuals...|$|E

40|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} {{are widely}} used in cleaning metal parts in manufacturing industries. Tetrachloroethylene (PCE), for instance, is used in eighty percent of all dry cleaning operations in the U. S. 42. Most of these chlorinated solvents are known carcinogens. The advent of the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, and other local strict regulations have led to extensive use of activated carbon beds for end of pipe pollution control. The growing cost of virgin activated carbon and stricter landfill regulations have made carbon regeneration a viable means to keep cleaning costs within reach. ^ Until today all of the regeneration processes are accomplished by heating the bed with an inert gas or steam (thermal swing) and then in some cases subjecting it to reduced pressure (pressure swing) in a later step. In either case {{a substantial amount of}} adsorbate is often left on the activated carbon. Moreover steam stripping tends to transfer the solid waste problem to water and ironically air pollution problems due to the need to dry the bed. ^ According to the present proposed model, both modes of regeneration are utilized in a single step. Wet activated carbon containing adsorbed volatile organic ingredient (PCE) is effectively regenerated using solvent saturated air which is heated under vacuum, which serve to drive off the adsorbed PCE. Heated air vapor mixture preferably 250 to 300 °F, is introduced into the regeneration bed. The sensible heat of the heated vapors heats the activated carbon to promote devolatilization of adsorbed PCE. After {{a significant portion of the}} adsorbate is desorbed in the heating stage and the carbon is above 250 °F, a partial vacuum of 250 torr is gradually created in the regeneration column by throttling the incoming regenerating stream. The reduced pressure within the vessel causes further desorption as the vapor pressure of the adsorbate approaches or exceeds the reduced pressure within the vessel. Once a significant amount of adsorbate is desorbed by a combination of temperature and pressure swings, and the bed is still at high temperature i. e. 250 °F; the vessel is sealed and evacuated to a pressure of 25 torr. This exclusive pressure <b>swing</b> <b>stage</b> recovers the last traces of the recoverable adsorbate present in activated carbon. The regenerating stream and desorbed PCE are withdrawn from the bed. It is chilled, and PCE is recovered as a liquid. ^ It is found that this method is highly successful in regenerating polluted activated carbon. Activated carbon having 0. 6 lb. PCE/lb. -carbon adsorbed to it is regenerated to a value of 0. 25 lb. PCE/lb. carbon. The regenerated carbon when put into an adsorption cycle is exposed to a heavily polluted air-vapor stream of 12000 PPM. It is seen that the exiting stream has literally 0 PPM PCE in it. On the other hand there is not much change in the physical and chemical properties of the regenerated PCE and it is reused in metal cleaning operations. ...|$|E

Almost touching our knees, a perpendicular wall of mail matter rose up to the roof. There {{was a great}} pile of it strapped on top of the stage, and both the fore and hind boots were full. We had twenty-seven hundred pounds of it aboard, the driver said--"a little for Brigham, and Carson, and 'Frisco, but the heft of it for the Injuns, which is powerful troublesome 'thout they get plenty of truck to read." [...] But as he just then got up a fearful convulsion of his countenance which was suggestive of a wink being swallowed by an earthquake, we guessed that his remark was intended to be facetious, and to mean that we would unload the most of our mail matter somewhere on the Plains and leave it to the Indians, or whosoever wanted it.|$|R
