The more advanced structure is the fully flexible base; it provides support to the mattress in every pressure point. They also require more powerful motors due to their weight. Fully flexible bases are usually made of zoned fillings of HR or of cold foam, sometimes covered with either latex or 3D mesh (<b>spacer</b> <b>fabric)</b> layer.

Experimental validation was finally conducted by using 12 warp-knitted <b>spacer</b> <b>fabrics</b> produced with different spacer monofilament diameters and inclination angles, fabric thicknesses, and outer layer structures to identify the physical sense of the parameters. The analysis has showed that an excellent agreement exists between the regressive and experimental results, and all seven parameters have a quantitative effect on a particular phase of the resultant compressive stress–strain curves of warp-knitted <b>spacer</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The change of each parameter makes a clear physical sense on the stress–strain curve.

40|$|Abstract. Three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>spacer</b> <b>fabric</b> {{composite}} {{is a novel}} lightweight sandwich structure, the {{reinforcement of}} which is integrally woven with two facesheets connected by continuous fibers (named piles) in the core. Usually the 3 -D <b>spacer</b> <b>fabric</b> composite without extra reinforcement is called mono-spacer fabric composite, which provides outstanding facesheet / core debonding resistance. However, its mechanical properties cannot meet the demand of structure application because of the thin facesheet and low load-bearing capacity of high piles. Hence, two reinforcement methods were developed by laminating additional weaves at the facesheet and filling foam materials in the core to strengthen the facesheet and piles, respectively. This paper aims to investigate the influences of reinforcement methods on the mechanical behaviors and damage modes of 3 -D <b>spacer</b> <b>fabric</b> composites under flatwise compressive, shear, edgewise compressive and three-point bending loads, by comparing with mono-spacer fabric composites.

Basically, multi-layered fabric technique is used, in which each layer contributes a substantial moisture removal function. The process of moisture removal is greatly affected by the surrounding conditions, such as pressure, temperature and humidity. If these quantities are much higher than the inner microclimate, the moisture removal process is affected, due to reduced hydrostatic pressure. However, the technology of heating in textile systems is widely available but not used as a way of improving and controlling moisture removal. The project main objective is to investigate the feasibility of using heating elements together with knitted spacer structures so as to maintain and transfer moisture by capillary effect in order to be used for moisture management textiles.

In conducting investment analysis of new engines for PT Heksatex, researchers conducted a financial analysis to drive the machine, through the analysis of financial lease or operating lease, which is more profitable for the company. Once these aspects are fulfilled researchers to analyze cash flow predictions, Payback Period, Net Present Value, Interest Rate Return, and Profitability Index. Based on this analysis can be said to be feasible if the value of the project NPV is greater than zero and IRR greater than theWACC. As foraspects of production estimates PT Heksatex will choose the estimated sales optimist. Based on the financialanalysis of the PT Heksatex choose leasing options with optimistic estimates. The option shave a NPV> 0,IRR>WACC, and a payback period of 5 years. From the analysis of the analysis showed that the advantage of this option, especially because the cost is lower...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{mechanical}} properties (compression and impact behaviours) of three-dimension structure (3 D-structure) composites based on warp-knitted <b>spacer</b> <b>fabrics</b> have been thoroughly investigated. In order {{to discuss the}} effect of fabric structural parameters on {{the mechanical}} performance of composites, six different types of warp-knitted <b>spacer</b> <b>fabrics</b> having different structural parameters (such as outer layer structure, diameter of spacer yarn, spacer yarn inclination angle and thickness) were involved for comparison study. The 3 D-structure composites were fabricated based on a flexible polyurethane foam. The produced composites were characterised for compression and impact properties. The findings obtained indicate that the fabric structural parameters have strong influence on the compression and impact responses of 3 D-structure composites. Additionally, the impact test carried out on the 3 D-structure composites shows that the impact loads do not affect the integrity of composite structure. All the results reveal that the product exhibits promising mechanical performance and its service life can be sustained...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{photocatalytic}} decolorization and mineralization of Remazol Black B (RBB), an azo reactive dye, in aqueous solutions {{was investigated}} using UV/H 2 O 2 /ZnO, UV/H 2 O 2 /TiO 2 and UV/H 2 O 2 /ZnO:TiO 2 systems. ZnO and TiO 2 nanoparticles were loaded on 3 -dimensional polyethylene terephthalate <b>fabrics</b> (<b>spacer</b> <b>fabrics).</b> Morphology of the <b>spacer</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{and the presence}} of the nanoparticles were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. Furthermore, the effects of key operational parameters on the efficiency of the decolorization were investigated. These parameters included initial pH value, initial hydrogen peroxide concentration, initial dye concentration, the loaded nanoparticle ratio {{and the presence of}} anions (sulfate, chloride and bicarbonate). Zero-, first- and second-order reaction kinetics were evaluated. Complete decolorization and high efficient mineralization with 90 % total organic carbon (TOC) reduction were achieved at 120 min treatment in the case of ZnO:TiO 2 under optimum condition. The results proved that the novel heterogeneous photocatalytic process is capable of decolorizing and mineralizing azo reactive dyes in textile wastewater...|$|R
