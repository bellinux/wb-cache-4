The <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> shall be calculated on one activity unit: surface (1 ha) or per head: SGM = GP - DPE The standard gross product at poultry is calculated per kg of meat and per 1000 eggs and includes the total output value plus the supplied subsidy. Direct proportional expenditures (DPE) are expenditures that vary directly with the changes in the size of agricultural production (biological material expenditures, feeding stuffs, energy, medicine, insurance and other material expenditures). Are called variable expenditures. Fixed production expenditures such as machinery, buildings (their amortization), permanent labor expenditures, rents or variable costs such as fuel and lubricants, equipment and machinery maintenance and works contracted with third parties are not included in costs for calculation of <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> SGM.

40|$|Within {{the branch}} of horticultural production, {{vegetable}} forcing can play a very {{significant role in the}} future employment of the rural labour force, due to its less seasonal employment and high workforce demand. Taking the ecological endowments of Hungary into consideration the farms of the South Great Plains may play a decisive role in this. During our research we examined eight model hydro-cultured vegetable forcing farms that are competitive due to their income-generating capacity and are suitable for further development. We concluded that pepper forcing farms of 1 ha generated â‚¬ 138, 980 SGM, tomato forcing farms â‚¬ 129, 486 SGM and cucumber forcing farms â‚¬ 121, 641 SGM. By dividing the <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin</b> by â‚¬ 1, 200 we found that the farms examined belonged to the 111. 65 ESU size category in the case of peppers, 107. 91 ESU in the case of tomatoes and 101. 37 ESU in the case of cucumbers, so they can be regarded as rather large farms according to the standards accepted within the EU. Within the category of variable costs, an increase in the <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin</b> (SGM) of viable farms of the right size (in the economic sense of the word) is possible by decreasing heating costs. In the model farms examined the heating costs of greenhouses heated by thermal water was 60 % less than those using forcing equipment fuelled by coal. The increasing costs of thermal water (environmental protection fines, mine charges, fees for using water deposits) significantly undermines this global competitive advantage. production value, variable costs, ESU, vegetable forcing, income, Agribusiness, Farm Management, Production Economics,...|$|E
40|$|The aim of our {{research}} is to determine - {{on the grounds of}} the facts of an average dairy family farm – the necessary economic size to provide subsistence for a four member family, which solely has income from this activity. Our study used three different calculation models. The models featured considerable differences. In the first one the primary aim of the producer is to survive, therefore the achieved gross income in farming includes neither amortization costs, nor the arising costs of repair and maintenance. On the contrary, the primary aim of the second model is to keep up the technology and the stock, which could fulfil the requirements of simple reproduction. The third model assumes a technological development corresponding with 10 % of the invested asset value besides consolidation, thus ensuring the potential of reproduction on an increasing scale. The above mentioned calculations cover the period of several years. The studied years show differences in terms of the buying up price of milk, aid for milk production and the price of used inputs. Our study compared farm sizes with the viable plant size defined according to the <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin.</b> As for the SGM a farm is already viable with 10 dairy cows and their progenies. However, our calculations show that a 10 cowed farm is not able to provide sufficient income for a four member family, if their aim is not only survival, but also simple or enlarged reproduction. The calculations reveal that among the fast changing market conditions of the dairy sector minimal farm size cannot be determined solely on the basis of profit figures in a given year, as in many cases it might lead to the exhaustion of reserves. dairy industry, family farm businesses, economic size, sustainability, <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin.,</b> Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{payments}} are a controversial {{issue in the}} accession negotiations. While the EU proposes reduced payments the accession countries claim {{that they should be}} equally treated as the present EU members. The present study, based on micro-simulations on the farm level, shows impacts of various policy options (ranging from non-accession to the granting of full direct payments) on the production structure and profitability of Hungarian agricultural enterprises. For most products prices are expected to be higher in 2004 than in the reference year, 2001. EU accession will have an additional positive effect on the prices of all products. Direct payments would further increase farm profits. In particular crop producers would benefit (due to the increase in the price of corn) while profits in animal production would be affected in a negative way due to increased opportunity costs of forage area and higher labour cost. The presented figures are based on data collected in 14 typical model farms selected from the Hungarian Farm Accountancy Data Network and they cannot be regarded perfectly representative. However, in accordance with other sector studies the figures allow two conclusions. First, the majority of Hungarian agriculture (with respect to the share in total farm area as well as the share in total <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margins)</b> would suffer no economic harm from an EU accession without direct payments.

The main objective {{of this study is}} to test a method to evaluate land degradation based on the integration of aggregate metrics of biophysical and socio-economic "degradation". We applied a framework that integrates the biophysical and socio-economic dimensions of land degradation to test the hypothesis that macro-economic policies, and in particular agricultural subsidies, are an important driving force of land degradation in marginal regions of the Mediterranean Europe. We analysed the influence of subsidies on the profitability of each crop and livestock type found in a sample of farms in a region of northern Greece. Spatial and socioeconomic data on agricultural households were collected to link remote sensing data and land degradation maps to socio-economic conditions of these households, as measured by the <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> The results demonstrate that subsidies provide a crucial socio-economic support to maintain the profitability of agricultural activities but may also promote land-use practices with damaging ecological impacts.

In this study, invoices for bovine activities of 14 veterinary practises were combined with milk production registration data of the dairy farms of these practices. This way, the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per bovine practitioner could be studied for the different veterinary practise. Moreover; the relation between <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> and specification of the veterinary practise could be studied. Finally, the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per dairy farm and the factors that influenced this <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> were studied. The most important result was the observation that the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per bovine practitioner was dependent on the number of dairy farms per practitioner, the margin on drugs and the region of the veterinary practise. The size of the veterinary practise, the share of the dairy farming within the practise and the source of the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> (drugs, time or operations) did not influence the <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> Variables that explained the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per dairy farm were, amongst others, the number of dairy cows, the milk production level of the farms and participation in PIR-DAP system to support the veterinarians herd health and management program). There is no relation of <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per dairy farm and the veterinary practise or region...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gross</b> <b>margin</b> is the {{difference}} between revenue and cost of goods sold, or COGS, divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage. Generally, it is calculated as the selling price of an item, less the cost of goods sold (production or acquisition costs, not including indirect fixed costs like office expenses, rent, or administrative costs). <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin</b> is often used interchangeably with Gross Profit, but the terms are different. When speaking about a dollar amount, it is technically correct to use the term Gross Profit; when referring to a percentage or ratio, it is correct to use <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin.</b> In other words, <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin</b> is a % value, while Gross Profit is a $ value.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{estimate}} the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> that is earned from {{the supply of}} electricity to households in Ireland. Using half hourly electricity demand data, the system marginal price (also called the wholesale price) and the retail price of electricity, we analyse how the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> varies across customers with different characteristics. The wholesale price varies throughout the day, thus, the time at which electricity is used affects the <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> The main factor in determining <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> however, is demand. The highest <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> are earned from supplying customers that have the following characteristics: being aged between 46 and 55, having a household income of at least € 75, 000 per annum, being self–employed, having a third level education, having a professional or managerial occupation, living in a household with 7 or more people, living in a detached house, having at least 5 bedrooms or being a mortgage holder. An OLS regression shows that <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> is partly explained by the energy conservation measures which are present in a household, the number of household members, the number of bedrooms, income, age, occupation and accommodation type...|$|R
