5|$|There {{were also}} a few road {{modifications}} on the Sheet Harbour {{side of the bridge}} {{as a result of the}} new bridge. Trunk 7 was aligned with what was Riverside Drive, which is now nonexistent. Church Point Road and Pool Road were <b>slightly</b> <b>modified.</b> The access road to Sheet Harbour Consolidated School and Duncan MacMillan High School was <b>slightly</b> <b>modified.</b> Sprott Lane, a minor loop, was extended along a part of the old Trunk 7 for a few households.|$|E

5|$|FireRed and LeafGreen {{were first}} {{announced}} in September 2003 as upcoming remakes {{of the original}} Pocket Monsters Red and Green games that were released in Japan in 1996. Game director Junichi Masuda stated the new titles would be developed around the idea of simplicity, as the game engine was a <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> version of the one used in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. As a result, FireRed and LeafGreen were made fully backward compatible with Ruby and Sapphire, allowing players to trade Pokémon between games.|$|E
5|$|In the manga {{illustrated}} by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> from the anime version. For example, after {{the conclusion of}} the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped to see him in the park. Also, at {{the conclusion of the}} story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her at their hotel wedding.|$|E

5|$|Mendelssohn wrote many songs, {{both for}} solo voice and for duet, with piano. Many {{of these are}} simple, or <b>slightly</b> <b>modified,</b> strophic settings. Some, {{including}} Auf Flügeln des Gesanges (On Wings of Song), became popular. Nine of Mendelssohn's songs, including Auf Flügeln des Gesanges and Neue Liebe (New Love, set to a poem by Heinrich Heine) were transcribed for piano solo, in a virtuoso style, by Franz Liszt.|$|E
5|$|The Leipzig {{class was}} {{a class of}} two light cruisers of the German Reichsmarine and later Kriegsmarine; the class {{comprised}} Leipzig, the lead ship, and Nürnberg, which was built to a <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> design. The ships were improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers, being slightly larger, with a more efficient arrangement of the main battery and improved armor protection. Leipzig was built between 1928 and 1931, and Nürnberg followed between 1934 and 1935.|$|E
5|$|The Mark XIV Computing Bomb Sight was a vector bombsight {{developed}} by Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command during the Second World War. The bombsight was {{also known as}} the Blackett sight after its primary inventor, P. M. S. Blackett. Production of a <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> version was also undertaken in the United States as the Sperry T-1, which was interchangeable with UK-built version. It was the RAF's standard bombsight for {{the second half of the}} War.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} of Lithuania {{is divided into}} 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular apskritis, plural apskritys), all named after their capitals. The counties are divided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular savivaldybė, plural savivaldybės): 9 city municipalities, 43 district municipalities and 8 municipalities. Each municipality is then divided into elderates (Lithuanian: singular seniūnija, plural seniūnijos). This division was created in 1994 and <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> in 2000. On 1 July 2010, the county administrations were abolished, and since that date, counties remains as the territorial and statistical units.|$|E
5|$|Almirante Latorre {{was renamed}} HMS Canada and <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> for British service. The ship {{completed}} fitting-out on 20 September 1915, and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 October. It initially {{served with the}} 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, and saw action in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. It fired 42 rounds from its 14-inch guns and 109 6-inch shells during the battle, and suffered no hits or casualties. Canada {{was transferred to the}} 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916, received further modifications in 1917 and 1918, and was put into reserve in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{four new}} {{performances}} were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. These performances featured <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> {{versions of the}} original arrangements, and like the original concerts, were sold out. Another performance was held in London in October 2016 by the London Symphony Orchestra. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets did {{not simply}} {{replicate}} the Vickers 6-Ton. However, like its British counterpart, the T-26 mod. 1931 had a twin-turreted configuration and {{was designed to}} carry two machine guns, mounting one in each turret. A major difference was that the Soviet T-26 mod. 1931 had higher turrets (with an observation slit) than the British 6-Ton. Soviet turrets had a round firing port for the DT tank machine gun, {{as opposed to the}} rectangular ports used by the original British design for the Vickers machine gun. The front part of the hull was also <b>slightly</b> <b>modified.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} chess (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E

5|$|The second {{elliptical}} {{building was}} built on top foundations of the first, and although the architect must {{have been aware of}} the exact layout of the previous building, the design of the second was <b>slightly</b> <b>modified.</b> Although the it looks very similar to the first, it used different diameters of arc to achieve a slightly 'fatter' design. The second 'elliptical' building was not constructed until about AD 220, and this was confirmed by a coin of Emperor Elagabalus under one of the pavement slabs. It is thought that the second building may have survived until the end of Roman rule and influence in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} board's lack of urgency, C {{took nearly}} a year to {{research}} this project. The proposed main battery of eight 14-inch guns was kept constant while other factors were calculated—speeds of 26, 29 and 32 knots; operating ranges of 5000, 7000 and 8000 miles; and belt armor of 8, 11 and 14 inches. On 12 July 1912, Naval Constructor R.H. Robinson presented these studies at a lecture he gave at the Naval War College with the General Board in attendance. There, he emphasized 8 inches as an absolute minimum for armor protection and recommended a radius of 8000 miles, {{the same as in}} U.S. battleships. The General Board's reaction was to request two battlecruisers for the 1914 Naval Building Program and ask C for a <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> version of the proposed ship, but the Naval War College felt the design had serious problems and that a fast battleship would be a more practical option.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on <b>slightly</b> <b>modified</b> enzymes or substrates often {{shed light on}} this chemical mechanism, as they reveal the rate-determining step or intermediates in the reaction. For example, the breaking of a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary kinetic isotope effect, which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E
