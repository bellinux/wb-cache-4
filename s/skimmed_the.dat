5|$|September 3, 2010– Hurricane Earl <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> {{coast of}} North Carolina and moved northeastward, {{resulting}} in heavy rain and tropical storm force winds in Southeastern Maryland, near Ocean City. Areas inland were {{not affected by}} Earl.|$|E
5|$|On October3, {{the center}} of Onil <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> {{coastline}} of northwestern India; however, the center did not cross land. Around this time, the upper-level circulation detached from the low-level circulation, further weakening the storm. Early on October4, the JTWC stated that the system had degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system. After executing a counter-clockwise loop, the depression slowly tracked south-southeastward, away from land. By October7, the system was reclassified as a tropical depression by the JTWC as it stalled several hundred kilometres southwest of Gujarat, India. The system maintained a relatively low intensity for the following several days before making landfall near Porbandar with winds of 45km/h (30mph). Within hours of moving inland, Onil dissipated early on October10.|$|E

5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts tried the technique and found that it helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E
25|$|Hurricane Fifi caused {{severe damage}} when it <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} coast of Honduras on 18 and 19 September 1974. Melgar Castro (1975–78) and Paz Garcia (1978–82) largely built the current physical infrastructure and telecommunications system of Honduras.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Tropical Storm Jeanne <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> {{north coast}} of Haiti, leaving 3,006 people dead in {{flooding}} and mudslides, {{mostly in the}} city of Gonaïves. In 2008 Haiti was again struck by tropical storms; Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Ike all produced heavy winds and rain. There were 331 dead and about 800,000 in need of humanitarian aid. The state of affairs produced by these storms was intensified by already high food and fuel prices that had caused a food crisis and political unrest in April 2008.|$|E

25|$|The Germans in {{the wood}} also {{suffered}} greatly in the hand-to-hand fighting. III Battalion, Infantry Regiment 165 of the 7th Division and part of I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 62 of the 12th Division, were reinforced from the Switch Line by I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 91, early on 23 July. British gunners had difficulty supporting attacks on High Wood, {{because they had to}} fire over Bazentin Ridge. The low elevation of the guns meant that shells <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> British trenches, the margin for error was small and numerous complaints were made that British infantry casualties were caused by the British artillery. Worn guns, defective ammunition and inaccurate information about the location of British infantry positions were blamed for short-shooting. The 51st Division pushed saps forward on 2 August, towards the Switch Line and dug a new trench near Wood Lane to the east of High Wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{cable network}} {{was able to}} provide a wider library of films for Best Brains to riff from. To assure {{that they would be}} able to produce a funny episode, at least one member of the staff would watch the {{suggested}} films completely, generally assuring that the movie would be prime for jokes throughout; Conniff stated that he often would have to watch twenty films in their entirety before selecting one to use for the show. In one specific case, the second-season episode with the film Sidehackers, they had only <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> first part of the movie before making the decision to use it, and only later discovering that it contained a rape scene. They decided to stay committed to the film, but cut out the offending scene and had to explain the sudden absence of the affected character to the audience. After that point, they carefully scrutinized entire films, and once one was selected and assured the rights, committed to completing the episode with that film. Obtaining the rights was handled by the cable networks. Some licensing required buying film rights in packages, with the selected bad movies included in a catalog of otherwise good films, making the negotiations odd since the network was only interested in the bad film. Other times, the rights to the film were poorly documented, and the network would follow the chain of custody to locate the copyright owner as to secure broadcast rights.|$|E
500|$|Less {{than a day}} later, {{the storm}} {{deteriorated}} to Category 2 strength. Cape Hatteras, North Carolina experienced the hurricane {{on the morning of}} August 23 while its center passed less than [...] offshore. Heading nearly due northward, the cyclone <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey coastline, passing just east of Atlantic City, and weakened further to Category 1 status. On August 23 the storm was one of four hurricanes occurring simultaneously within the Atlantic Ocean. On August 24 the storm moved ashore on western Long Island, in the New York City area. At 1200 UTC that day, while centered just inland, its maximum winds were estimated to have been 85mph (140km/h). It progressed northward through New England, quickly weakening. It was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm before becoming extratropical. It dissipated fully on August 25, near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack for {{the film}} was {{composed}} by Ilaiyaraaja. The album was released on March27,2011 at the Prasad Studios in Chennai with Karunanidhi presiding over the event. The soundtrack album consists of six tracks, with four of them sung by Shreya Ghoshal. The film initially had a track about the glories of Kongu Vellalar which was removed later during the editing process. One of its tracks, Annanmaar Kathai belongs to the Tamil folk genre. The song Kannai Padithaen received a special mention in The Hindu newspaper where it was cited as [...] "simply melodious and rings in ones ears for long". The soundtrack received a negative review by Rediff, which stated that the [...] "tunes were all generic" [...] and that the operatic background score did not gel well with the film's subject. It summed that [...] "Ilaiyaraja had just <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> bare bones of his usually fulfilling musical compositions". There was also a review in Thinakaran on the inappropriateness of the film's tracks as the reviewer felt they were ill-suited to the film's historical themes.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{continental}} Europe, cultured {{butter is}} preferred, while sweet cream butter dominates in the United States and the United Kingdom. Cultured butter is sometimes labeled [...] "European-style" [...] butter in the United States, although cultured butter is made and sold by some, especially Amish, dairies. Commercial raw cream butter is virtually unheard-of in the United States. Raw cream butter is generally only found made {{at home by}} consumers who have purchased raw whole milk directly from dairy farmers, <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> cream themselves, and made butter with it. It is rare in Europe as well.|$|E
2500|$|While the [...] "general" [...] {{way for an}} overarm bowler to {{spin the}} ball is from off to leg (i.e., an off-break), the {{opposite}} was true for the underarm bowlers and Lamborn was thus one of bowling's great innovators. [...] The pitched delivery was still new, having been introduced in the 1760s, when Lamborn played (i.e., his known career was from 1777 to 1781). [...] Until the 1760s, bowlers had always rolled or <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> ball towards the batsman so spin bowling itself was a new skill. [...] Nyren consistently refers to [...] "spin" [...] as [...] "twist".|$|E
2500|$|Between 1990 and 1997, 24 {{shots were}} fired at British forces. The first eight {{operations}} (1990–1992), ended in misses. On 16 March 1990, the Barret M82 was used for first time by the IRA. The target was a checkpoint manned by soldiers of the Light Infantry regiment on Сastleblaney Road. A single [...]50 round pierced the helmet and <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> skull of Lance Corporal Hartsthorne, who survived with minor head injuries. In August 1992, one team mortally wounded a Light Infantry soldier. By April 1997 seven soldiers and two policemen had been killed. An RUC constable almost lost one of his legs in the last sniper attack during the Troubles.|$|E

2500|$|During this period, women's {{underwear}} {{consisted of}} a washable linen chemise or smock. This was the only article of clothing that was worn by every woman, regardless of class. Wealthy women's smocks were embroidered and trimmed with narrow lace. [...] Smocks were made of rectangular lengths of linen; in northern Europe the smock <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> body and was widened with triangular gores, while in Mediterranean countries smocks were cut fuller {{in the body and}} sleeves. [...] High-necked smocks were worn under high-necked fashions, to protect the expensive outer garments from body oils and dirt. There is pictorial evidence that Venetian courtesans wore linen or silk drawers, but no evidence that drawers were worn in England.|$|E
