IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services to museums and nonprofit organizations that want to use technology to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod Touch that presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures.

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>tagging</b> for {{knowledge}} acquisition is the specific use of tagging for finding and re-finding specific content {{for an individual}} or group. <b>Social</b> <b>tagging</b> systems differ from traditional taxonomies {{in that they are}} community-based systems lacking the traditional hierarchy of taxonomies.

Therefore, <b>social</b> <b>tagging</b> serves as a new social way of organizing a set of resources. This free-form annotation approached the [...] "vocabulary problem" [...] from a new social angle. <b>Social</b> <b>tagging</b> systems allow people to annotate a set of resources according to their own needs with freely chosen words—tags, and share them with other users of the <b>social</b> <b>tagging</b> system.The result of this human-based annotation of resources is called Folksonomy, which refers to a fold-generated taxonomy. Examples of such <b>social</b> <b>tagging</b> systems are BibSonomy, CiteULike, Flickr, or Delicious.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the degree of {{difference}} between two types of metadata for biomedical articles generated by different groups of people. The first type of metadata is <b>social</b> <b>tags,</b> which are assigned to articles by their readers using uncontrolled vocabulary. The second type is index terms, which are assigned by professionally trained indexers and domain experts using a controlled vocabulary. When the two kinds of metadata are assigned to the same item, we may expect that they overlap {{to a large extent}} and could substitute for one another. In this study, we compared <b>social</b> <b>tags</b> and index terms for a set of papers that appear both in CiteULike and MEDLINE, and assessed their differences. Due to the idiosyncratic nature of <b>social</b> <b>tags,</b> we preprocessed the tags through normalization, stop-word removal, stemming and spell-checking.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>tags</b> {{inherent}} in online music {{services such as}} Last. fm provide {{a rich source of}} information on musical moods. The abundance of <b>social</b> <b>tags</b> makes this data highly beneficial for developing techniques to manage and retrieve mood information, and enables study of the relationships between music content and mood representations with data substantially larger than that available for conventional emotion research. However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of <b>social</b> <b>tags</b> and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of <b>social</b> <b>tags</b> and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags. The results give validity and analytical insights for harnessing millions of music tracks and associated mood data available through <b>social</b> <b>tags</b> in application development.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>tags</b> are user-generated {{keywords}} {{associated with}} some resource on the Web. In {{the case of}} music, <b>social</b> <b>tags</b> have become {{an important component of}} “Web 2. 0 ” recommender systems, allowing users to generate playlists based on use-dependent terms such as chill or jogging that have been applied to particular songs. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting these <b>social</b> <b>tags</b> directly from MP 3 files. Using a set of 360 classifiers trained using the online ensemble learning algorithm FilterBoost, we map audio features onto <b>social</b> <b>tags</b> collected from the Web. The resulting automatic tags (or autotags) furnish information about music that is otherwise untagged or poorly tagged, allowing for insertion of previously unheard music into a social recommender. This avoids the “cold-start problem ” common in such systems. Autotags {{can also be used to}} smooth the tag space from which similarities and recommendations are made by providing a set of comparable baseline tags for all tracks in a recommender system. Because the words we learn are the same as those used by people who label their music collections, it is easy to integrate our predictions into existing similarity and prediction methods based on web data. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{folksonomy}} is {{a system}} in which users apply public tags to online items, typically to aid them in re-finding those items. This can give rise to a classification system based on those tags and their frequencies, in contrast to a taxonomic classification specified by the owners of the content when it is published. This practice is also known as collaborative tagging, social classification, social indexing, and <b>social</b> <b>tagging.</b> However, these terms have slightly different meanings than folksonomy. Folksonomy was originally [...] "the result of personal free tagging of information ... for one's own retrieval". <b>Social</b> <b>tagging</b> is the application of tags in an open online environment where the tags of other users are available to others.

5000|$|It {{has been}} argued that <b>social</b> <b>tagging</b> or {{collaborative}} tagging systems can provide navigational cues or [...] "way-finders" [...] for other users to explore information. The notion is that, given that social tags are labels that users create to represent topics extracted from Web documents, interpretation of these tags should allow other users to predict contents of different documents efficiently. Social tags are arguably more important in exploratory search, in which the users may engage in iterative cycles of goal refinement and exploration of new information (as opposed to simple fact-retrievals), and interpretation of information contents by others will provide useful cues for people to discover topics that are relevant. One significant challenge that arises in <b>social</b> <b>tagging</b> systems is the rapid increase in the number and diversity of the tags. As opposed to structured annotation systems, tags provide users an unstructured, open-ended mechanism to annotate and organize web-content. As users are free to create any tag to describe any resource, it leads to what {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary problem. Because users may use different words to describe the same document or extract different topics from the same document based on their own background knowledge, the lack of a top-down mediation may lead to an increase in the use of incoherent tags to represent the information resources in the system. In other words, the inherent [...] "unstructuredness" [...] of social tags may hinder their potential as navigational cues for searchers because the diversities of users and motivation may lead to diminishing tag-topic relations as the system grows. However, a number of studies have shown that structures do emerge at the semantic level - indicating that there are cohesive forces that are driving the emergent structures in a <b>social</b> <b>tagging</b> system.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, one of {{the main}} issues with <b>social</b> <b>tagging</b> data is the lack of structure. Synonymy, polysemy and homonymy or problems regarding the semantic of the tags are additional issues related to tagging data. Previous research demonstrate us different algorithms for clustering tagging data which could tackle the above problems by organizing the tags according to a classification schema. Depending on the classification schema, there are two main categories: flat and hierarchical clustering algorithms.|$|E

Folksonomy is sometimes called collaborative tagging, social classification, social indexing, or <b>social</b> <b>tagging.</b> It refers to taxonomies created by users applying their own tags to pieces of information (including articles, pictures, and websites). The tags aid users in categorizing information for both personal management and sharing with others.
