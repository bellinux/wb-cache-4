2500|$|In June 1737, Frederick {{informed}} {{his parents}} that Augusta was pregnant, {{and due to}} give birth in October. In fact, Augusta's due date was earlier and a peculiar episode followed in July in which the Prince, on discovering {{that his wife had}} gone into labour, sneaked her out of Hampton Court Palace {{in the middle of the}} night, to ensure that the King and Queen could not be present at the birth. George and Caroline were horrified. Traditionally, royal births were witnessed by members of the family and senior courtiers to guard against supposititious children, and Augusta had been forced by her husband to ride in a rattling carriage while heavily pregnant and in pain. With a party including two of her daughters and Lord Hervey, the Queen raced over to St James's Palace, where Frederick had taken Augusta. Caroline was relieved to discover that Augusta had given birth to a [...] "poor, ugly little she-mouse" [...] rather than a [...] "large, fat, healthy boy" [...] which made a <b>supposititious</b> <b>child</b> unlikely since the baby was so pitiful. The circumstances of the birth deepened the estrangement between mother and son.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, Ferdinand and Isabella became man and wife. What {{followed}} in {{the next twenty years}} must be rather glanced at than related. Henry IV. resented the step, and vain attempts were made to substitute his <b>supposititious</b> <b>child,</b> La Beltraneja, in the place of his sister, as successor to the throne. A civil war ensued, during which Isabella steadily refused to assume the crown, though often entreated; limiting her efforts to the maintenance of her rights as heiress presumptive. In 1474, or five years after her marriage, Don Henry died, and she then became Queen of Castile, though her spurious niece was also proclaimed by a small party among her subjects. The war of the succession, as it was called, lasted five years longer, when Joanna, or La Beltraneja, assumed the veil, and the rights of Isabella were generally acknowledged. About the same time, died Don John II., when Ferdinand mounted the throne of Aragon. These events virtually reduced the sovereignties of the peninsula, which had so long been cut up into petty states, to four, viz., the possessions of Ferdinand and Isabella, which included Castile, Leon, Aragon, Valencia, and many other of the finest provinces of Spain; Navarre, an insignificant kingdom in the Pyrenees; Portugal, much as it exists to-day; and Granada, the last abiding-place of the Moor, north of the strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
5000|$|To dispel rumours of a <b>supposititious</b> <b>child,</b> James had 40 {{witnesses}} to the birth attend a Privy Council meeting, but Anne claimed she could not attend because she was pregnant herself (which she was not) and then declined to read the depositions because it was [...] "not necessary".|$|E
50|$|<b>Supposititious</b> <b>children</b> were {{a concern}} in Western Society for {{thousands}} of years, being different than illegitimate children, as illegitimate children were designated by their paternity, as <b>supposititious</b> <b>children</b> were never the offspring of the father. This is because these societies were almost uniformly patrilineal societies, and the blood link to the father had to be established {{in order for the}} child to lay claim to the inheritance, or at the very least, the paternity could not be in doubt. This fear led to the coining of the term cuckold, borrowing the name of a bird notorious for tricking other birds into raising its chicks as their own.|$|R
50|$|This was {{a common}} concern in the {{classical}} period as there were dealers in <b>supposititious</b> <b>children</b> who would provide them for a fee. Laws were passed to counter this and those found to be illegitimate might be sold into slavery.|$|R
5000|$|The fear of <b>supposititious</b> <b>children</b> {{also appears}} in {{media in the}} twentieth and twenty-first centuries. With the {{introduction}} of DNA tests, men can request a medical procedure to gain incontrovertible truth about a child’s paternity. Due to court-ordered child support payments being levied on biological fathers {{in the event of}} separation, the fear of <b>supposititious</b> <b>children</b> has been extended from merely raising the child into the fear of having to financially support a child that does not share a biological link. Some entertainers have capitalized on this phenomenon by televising the results of disputed paternity suits. Maury Povich made the phrase “You are not the father!” famous on the show which shares his name.|$|R
50|$|In the First Messenian War, the Messenians, having {{consulted}} the Delphic oracle, {{were told that}} to save their country, they must offer by night, to the gods below, an unstained virgin of {{the blood of the}} Aepytidae. The lot fell on the daughter of Lyciscus; but Epebolus, the seer, pronounced her to be unfit for the sacrifice, as being no daughter of Lyciscus at all, but a <b>supposititious</b> <b>child.</b> Meanwhile, Lyciscus, in alarm, took the maiden with him and withdrew to Sparta. Here she died; and several years after, as he was visiting her tomb, to which he often resorted, he was seized by some Arcadian horsemen, carried back to Ithome, and put upon his trial for treason. His defense was, that he had fled, not as being hostile to his country or indifferent to her fate, but in the full belief of what Epebolus had declared. This being unexpectedly confirmed by the priestess of Hera, who confessed that she was herself the mother of the girl, Lyciscus was acquitted.|$|E

5000|$|Frederick {{applied to}} Parliament unsuccessfully for an {{increased}} financial allowance that had hitherto been denied {{him by the}} King, and public disagreement over the money drove a further wedge between parents and son. On the advice of Walpole, Frederick's allowance was raised {{in an attempt to}} mitigate further conflict, but by less than he had asked. In June 1737, Frederick informed his parents that Augusta was pregnant, and due to give birth in October.

5000|$|<b>Supposititious</b> <b>children</b> are {{fraudulent}} offspring. These arose when an heir {{was required}} {{and so a}} suitable baby might be procured and passed off as genuine. This practice {{seemed to be a}} common occurrence in Ancient Rome was used to claim birthright status to a Roman father's wealth and prestige, as rules were instituted to ensure that the children claimed by the wife were the legitimate children of the husband, or ex-husband, in some cases ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Supposititious</b> <b>children</b> {{appear in}} myths and legends across many Western countries. In some medieval European countries, fairies were {{believed}} to sometimes swap out human children with fairy children so that the human parents unsuspectingly raise the fairy child as their own. In these legends, {{there must be a}} legitimate child present for the fairies to work their tricks on the human parents. These legends played upon the fear medieval men had concerning raising offspring that may not be their own. This was particularly a problem among the upper classes, as older men would marry younger women more frequently in the upper classes.|$|R
6000|$|So far I have {{discussed}} only {{the possibility of}} divorce without offences, the sort of divorce that arises out of estrangement and incompatibilities. But divorce, {{as it is known}} in most Christian countries, has a punitive element, and is obtained through the failure of one of the parties to observe the conditions of the bond and the determination of the other to exact suffering. Divorce as it exists at present is not a readjustment but a revenge. It is the nasty exposure of a private wrong. In England a husband may divorce his wife for a single act of infidelity, and {{there can be little doubt}} that we are on the eve of an equalisation of the law in this respect. I will confess I consider this an extreme concession to the passion of jealousy, and one likely to tear off the roof from many a family of innocent children. Only infidelity leading to <b>supposititious</b> <b>children</b> in the case of the wife, or infidelity obstinately and offensively persisted in or endangering health in the case of the husband, really injure the home sufficiently to justify a divorce on the assumptions of our present argument. If we are going to make the welfare of the children our criterion in these matters, then our divorce law does in this direction already go too far. A husband or wife may do far more injury to the home by constantly neglecting it for the companionship of some outside person with whom no [...] "matrimonial offence" [...] is ever committed. Of course, if our divorce law exists mainly for the gratification of the fiercer sexual resentments, well and good, but if that is so, let us abandon our pretence that marriage is an institution for the establishment and protection of homes. And while on the one hand existing divorce laws appear to be obsessed by sexual offences, other things of far more evil effect upon the home go without a remedy. There are, for example, desertion, domestic neglect, cruelty to the children drunkenness or harmful drug-taking, indecency of living and uncontrollable extravagance. I cannot conceive how any logical mind, having once admitted the principle of divorce, can hesitate at making these entirely home-wrecking things the basis of effective pleas. But in another direction, some strain of sentimentality in my nature makes me hesitate to go with the great majority of divorce law reformers. I cannot bring myself to agree that either a long term of imprisonment or the misfortune of insanity should in itself justify a divorce. I admit the social convenience, but I wince at the thought of those tragic returns of the dispossessed. So far as insanity goes, I perceive that the cruelty of the law would but endorse the cruelty of nature. But I do not like men to endorse the cruelty of nature.|$|R
