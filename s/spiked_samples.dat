50|$|Broad {{screening}} and identification of β-agonists in feed, serum, urine, muscle and liver samples was achieved {{in a quick}} and highly sensitive manner using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) combined with a spectra library search. Solid-phase extraction technology was employed for sample purification and enrichment. After extraction and purification, the samples were analyzed using a Q-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer under full-scan and data-dependent MS/MS mode. The acquired mass spectra were compared with an in-house library (compound library and MS/MS mass spectral library) built with TraceFinder Software which contained the M/Z of the precursor ion, chemical formula, retention time, character fragment ions and the entire MS/MS spectra of 32 β-agonist standards. Screening was achieved by comparing 5 key mass spectral results and positive matches were marked. Using the developed method, the identification results from 10 <b>spiked</b> <b>samples</b> and 238 actual samples indicated that only 2% of acquired mass spectra produced false identities. The method validation {{results showed that the}} limit of detection ranged from 0.021-3.854 μg kg−1and 0.015-1.198 ng mL−1 for solid and liquid samples, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|Sample {{preservation}} may partially {{resolve the}} second problem. A common procedure is keeping samples cold {{to slow the}} rate of chemical reactions and phase change, and analyzing the sample as soon as possible; but this merely minimizes the changes rather than preventing them. A useful procedure for determining influence of sample containers during delay between sample collection and analysis involves preparation for two artificial samples {{in advance of the}} sampling event. One sample container is filled with water known from previous analysis to contain no detectable amount of the chemical of interest. This sample, called a [...] "blank", is opened for exposure to the atmosphere when the sample of interest is collected, then resealed and transported to the laboratory with the sample for analysis to determine if sample holding procedures introduced any measurable amount of the chemical of interest. The second artificial sample is collected with the sample of interest, but then [...] "spiked" [...] with a measured additional amount of the chemical of interest at the time of collection. The blank and <b>spiked</b> <b>samples</b> are carried with the sample of interest and analyzed by the same methods at the same times to determine any changes indicating gains or losses during the elapsed time between collection and analysis.|$|E

After that, different amounts of commercial PVP were pyrolyzed {{in order to establish}} correlation between the amount of generated NVP (its GC peak area) and the initial mass of pyrolyzed PVP. GC-FID analysis was used for construction of calibration curve and for quantitative determination of PVP. Very good linear correlation was obtained between the area of NVP peak, generated during pyrolysis, and the initial mass of PVP (r 2 = 0. 998). Further, solutions of known concentration of PVP were prepared in destilled water ("spiked samples"). <b>Spiked</b> <b>samples</b> were preextracted with diethyl ether and n-hexane, and after that, the water-layer was evaporated and dissolved again in methanol.
