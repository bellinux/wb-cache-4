5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, <b>Said</b> <b>is</b> {{known for the}} book Orientalism (1978), {{a critique of the}} cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E

5|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will versus determinism. Other themes explored by the film include involuntary commitment, the nature of political and legal systems in a high technology-advanced society, the rights of privacy in a media-dominated world, {{and the nature of}} self-perception. The film also continues to follow Spielberg's tradition of depicting broken families,*Vest. pg. 136 which he has <b>said</b> <b>is</b> motivated by his parents' divorce when he was a child.|$|E
5|$|Before {{setting off}} for Paris, Carrouges first visited Argentan {{to meet with}} Count Pierre and there announcing his {{intention}} of continuing to the capital. What followed was a sequence of events which will forever remain unclear but which would have a dramatic effect {{on the lives of}} all concerned. What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words were exchanged, although what was <b>said</b> <b>is</b> unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a reputation that may have played a part in the allegations which followed.|$|E

5|$|The stunt {{simulating}} Lange's {{fall into}} the subway train was filmed on August 27, the second production day, and Yoshimura {{said that it was}} the most challenging part of the shoot. D'Onofrio and MacVittie had to arrive at the platform just as the subway train was approaching, and their scene had to be reshot several times because the train did not pass the actors on time. The crew also filmed shots of a dummy dressed as Lange being dragged by the train inside the dummy wall, but most of those scenes were not used in the final cut. The remaining five filming days focused primarily on the scenes between Braugher and D'Onofrio, which Yoshimura and Fleder felt were the most crucial element of the episode. During the filming of the climactic scene with Pembleton and Lange which ends with Lange's death, several members of the crew reacted emotionally, something Yoshimura <b>said</b> <b>is</b> extremely rare because the crew members typically look at their work as a job and do not become emotionally invested in the story that they are filming.|$|E

The core text of Taoism, the Daodejing, opens with the verses: «The Dao that can be <b>said</b> <b>is</b> not the eternal Dao, the name that can be <b>said</b> <b>is</b> not the eternal name».|$|E

Thus bullshit may be either true or false, but demonstrates a lack of concern for the truth which is likely to lead to falsehoods.|$|E
