5|$|Sustainability {{measurement}} is a {{term that}} denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability. The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are evolving: they include indicators, benchmarks, audits, sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems. They are applied {{over a wide range}} of <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> scales.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} the optimal <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources {{to be placed}} within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E

Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer <b>spatial</b> <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{gain insight}} into the {{association}} between optical and neural components of contrast sensitivity (CS), operationalized as <b>spatial</b> CS (optical <b>and</b> neural) or <b>temporal</b> CS (solely neural), and reading speed in a clinical sample of healthy adults of various ages. Furthermore, precision and agreement of the two methods were assessed. METHODS: The Mars test <b>and</b> the <b>temporal</b> CS implementation of the C-Quant device were used to measure <b>spatial</b> CS <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> CS, respectively. Tests were performed with 71 normally sighted adults: mean age 55 (range 18 - 86) years. Pearson's correlation analyses were performed between spatial CS or <b>temporal</b> CS, <b>and</b> reading speed and partial correlations controlled for age are presented. Precision of the measurement was defined by the coefficient of repeatability and repeated measures standard deviations. Differences between <b>spatial</b> CS <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> CS values were determined with 95 % limits of agreement. RESULTS: A correlation was found between reading speed <b>and</b> both <b>spatial</b> CS (r = 0. 470; P <. 001) <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> CS (r = 0. 258; P =. 04); partial correlations controlled for age were r = 0. 175 (P =. 17) and r = 0. 152 (P =. 24), respectively. Coefficient of repeatability was 0. 13 log units and 0. 24 log units for <b>spatial</b> CS <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> CS test, respectively. A proportional difference of 0. 1 log units was found between <b>spatial</b> CS <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> CS measurements. CONCLUSIONS: A significant correlation was found between both <b>spatial</b> CS <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> CS <b>and</b> reading speed indicating that, besides optical components, neural aspects may be important in defining reading speed. The stronger correlation between <b>spatial</b> CS <b>and</b> reading speed is suggested to reflect a deterioration of both optical and neural factors with increasing age. The coefficients of repeatability for <b>spatial</b> CS <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> CS found {{in the present study}} are in agreement with previous research, and the difference found between the two methods might be attributed to the psychometric differences between the methods...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} are reported which investigate short-term memory for multidimensional stimuli; in particular, item information, <b>spatial</b> location, <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> order.
