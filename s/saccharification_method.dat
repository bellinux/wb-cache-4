40|$|Enzyme {{saccharification}} of pretreated brewers spent grains (BSG) was investigated, {{aiming at}} maximising glucose production. Factors investigated were; {{variation of the}} solids loadings at different cellulolytic enzyme doses, reaction time, higher energy mixing methods, supplementation of the cellulolytic enzymes with additional enzymes (and cofactors) and use of fed-batch methods. Improved slurry agitation through aerated high-torque mixing offered small but significant enhancements in glucose yields (to 53 ± 2. 9 g/L and 45 % of theoretical yield) compared to only 41 ± 4. 0 g/L and 39 % of theoretical yield for standard shaking methods (at 15 % w/v solids loading). Supplementation of the cellulolytic enzymes with additional enzymes (acetyl xylan esterases, ferulic acid esterases and α-L- arabinofuranosidases) also boosted achieved glucose yields to 58 – 69 ± 0. 8 - 6. 2 g/L which equated to 52 - 58 % of theoretical yield. Fed-batch methods also enhanced glucose yields (to 58 ± 2. 2 g/L and 35 % of theoretical yield at 25 % w/v solids loading) compared to non-fed-batch methods. From these investigations a novel enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>method</b> was developed (using enhanced mixing, a fed-batch approach and additional carbohydrate degrading enzymes) which further increased glucose yields to 78 ± 4. 1 g/L and 43 % of theoretical yield when operating at high solids loading (25 % w/v) ...|$|E
40|$|Improper {{disposal}} of 1, 4 -dioxane and the chlorinated organic solvents trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) {{has resulted in}} widespread contamination of soil and groundwater. In the present study, a novel microbially-driven Fenton reaction system was designed to generate hydroxyl (HO) radicals for simultaneous degradation of source zone levels of single, binary, and ternary mixtures of TCE, PCE, and 1, 4 -dioxane. The new Fenton reaction system was driven by the Fe(III) -reducing facultative anaerobe Shewanella oneidensis amended with lactate, Fe(III), and contaminant mixtures and exposed to alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The novel microbially-driven Fenton reaction system successfully degraded TCE, PCE, and 1, 4 -dioxane either as single contaminants or as binary and ternary mixtures. Degradation of lignocellulosic biomass was also demonstrated through the novel microbially driven fenton reaction by S. oneidensis. In this study, we have developed a new method that combines both pretreatment and saccharification of cellulose and xylan in a microbially driven fenton reaction. The combined pretreatment and <b>saccharification</b> <b>method</b> for cellulose and xylan developed did not involve the addition of acid, alkali compounds {{or the use of}} hydrolyzing enzymes thus being an economically feasible process to directly produce simple fermentable sugars from cellulose and xylan. Microbial Fe(III) reduction is a dominant anaerobic respiratory process in soil and sediments, which suggests that the microbially driven fenton reaction may {{play an important role in}} the degradation of decaying plant and woody materials in the natural environment. The expansion of metabolic capability to convert D-xylose to a useful product such as PHB can be beneficial in biotechnological applications to couple multiple carbon sources such as glucose, glycerol and D-xylose by S. oneidensis to improve efficiency of electricity generation, biofuel production and bioremediation of toxic contaminants.

30|$|Research {{on the use}} of food wastes for the {{production}} of biofuel is becoming attractive in different countries. Sulaiman et al. have conceptualized a halal biorefinery for {{the production}} of fuels and value added products in Malaysia [12]. Yao et al. from the Chinese Academy of Sciences investigated the application of food waste to generate hydrolysates for the production of bioethanol [13]. In this context, potato peel is a well-known waste generated by the potato industries in Europe [14]. As reported by Christakopoulos.et al. this “no value” potato peel waste was converted to bioethanol using environmentally benign biocatalytic methods [13]. Researchers have also used household food waste for the production of bioethanol. During this process liquefaction and <b>saccharification</b> <b>methods</b> were employed to increase both ethanol production and productivity of the process [15]. Subsequently, fermentation of the remaining solids obtained from this process was performed to increase the overall yield of ethanol [15].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of different starch liberation and <b>saccharification</b> <b>methods</b> on microbiological contamination of distillery mashes. Moreover, the effect of hop α-acid preparation for protection against microbial infections was assessed. The quality of agricultural distillates was also evaluated. When applying the pressureless liberation of starch (PLS) and malt as a source of amylolytic enzymes, the lactic acid bacteria count in the mashes increased several times during fermentation. The mashes obtained using the pressure-thermal method and malt enzymes revealed a similar pattern. Samples prepared using cereal malt exhibited higher concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, as compared to mashes prepared using enzymes of microbial origin. The use of hop α-acids led to the reduction of bacterial contamination in all tested mashes. As a result, fermentation of both mashes prepared with microbial origin enzyme preparations and with barley malt resulted in satisfactory efficiency and distillates with low concentrations of aldehydes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Wood milling is an intensively energy {{consuming}} operation {{that has a}} significant effect on energy yield of ethanol production processes as particle size {{is an important factor in}} productivity of <b>saccharification</b> <b>methods.</b> Fiber particle size was optimized for a very wide range of treatment conditions (temperature, agitation, and solid loads) for acid hydrolysis in a batch reactor. Also, heat and mass transfer effects were analysed by calculating the Thiele and Prater modulus at experimental conditions. Multivariate optimization results show that using a length-weighted fiber mean diameter (DL 21) of 1. 21 - 2. 68 mm, a better sugar yield, concentration and lower furan production can be achieved. Agitation allowed a simultaneous particle size reduction and hydrolysis of polysaccharides. Heat and mass transfer studies suggest that acid diffusion is only important for hemicellulose hydrolysis at very high temperature and that particles are nearly isothermal. These results show that about 30 % of the required energy for milling can be saved by using optimal particle size. Keywords- Wood, ethanol, acid hydrolysis, saccharification...|$|R

In this study used Cellulose from stem wastes of banana kepok fermented by simultaneous <b>saccharification</b> and fermentation <b>method</b> (SFS). The process of hydrolysis cellulose into glucose and subsequently become bioethanol held simultaneously by using the bacterium Clostridum acetobutylicum. The results showed that the content of banana stem cellulose wastes of 46. 38 % and the optimum condition of fermentation on the 10 th day with pH 6. 0 resulted in bioethanol content of 13. 5 %...|$|R
30|$|All the enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} experiments were performed at 10 % (w/v) solid loading at 45 °C for 48  h in 50  mL screw-capped bottles. Based on our recently reported enzyme optimization studies, an enzyme loading of 9 FPU g− 1 was {{selected in the}} current investigation [12, 13]. All other experimental parameters were similar as detailed previously, unless specified. Control experiments were performed voiding both substrate and enzyme in the reaction mixtures. Enzymatic saccharification was also performed using commercial enzymes at an enzyme loading of 9  FPU of Celluclast 1.5  L and 100 U of Novozyme 188 per gram of pretreated biomass. After enzymatic saccharification, the liquefied fraction was separated and clarified from the residual biomass by filtration method using glass fiber membrane filters. Reducing sugars were analyzed by both HPLC and DNSA <b>methods.</b> <b>Saccharification</b> yields were calculated as described by Taniguchi [20].|$|R
40|$|Ethanol {{production}} from lignocellulosic biomass is considered more beneficial than its {{production from}} starch and sugar based crops, considering the energetics and environmental advantages {{as well as}} the readily availability of the feed stock. However, the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic materials makes its ethanol production more challenging. Common methods of hydrolysis and fermentation of lignocellulosic materials to ethanol is through the separate hydrolysis and fermentation method (SHF) and the simultaneous <b>saccharification</b> and fermentation <b>method</b> (SSF). During SHF, product inhibition of the enzymes occurs as the sugar concentration increases during the hydrolysis, the process is also associated with increased contamination risk. SSF process makes use of suboptimal conditions for the hydrolysis and the fermentation; also the fermenting organism cannot be reused since it has been mixed with the lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, a new method was developed for hydrolysis and fermentation of lignocellulosic materials to ethanol, called simultaneous saccharification, filtration and fermentation (SSFF). The method allows both the hydrolysis and fermentation at optimum conditions {{with the use of a}} membrane bioreactor. It also allows the fermenting organism to be reused for several batches. The method was applied on pretreated spruce using a flocculating yeast strain and also on pretreated wheat straw using encapsulated genetically modified yeast. SSFF was compared with SSF as one of the conventional method, both on 10 % suspended solids basis. From pretreated spruce, similar ethanol yield was obtained. Interestingly, from the pretreated wheat straw, 90 % ethanol yield of the theoretical value was obtained during the SSFF while just 53 % was obtained during the SSF. The study shows that the newly developed method of SSFF has the potential to replace the conventional methods and to improve ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.  Simultaneous Saccharification, Filtration and Fermentatio...|$|R
