40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate small-scale hot-water postpackaging pasteurization (PPP) as a postlethality (post-cooking) treatment for Listeria monocytogenes on ready-to-eat beef snack sticks and natural-casing wieners. Using a com-mercially available plastic packaging film specifically designed for PPP applications and 2. 8 liters of boiling water (1008 C) in a sauce pan on a hot plate, an average reduction in L. monocytogenes numbers of $ 2 log units was obtained using heating times of 1. 0 min for individually <b>packaged</b> beef snack <b>sticks</b> (three brands) and 4. 0 min for <b>packages</b> of four <b>sticks</b> (two brands) and seven sticks (three brands). Average product surface temperatures, measured as soon as possible after PPP and opening the package, were 47 to 51. 5, 58 to 61. 5, and 58. 5 to 618 C for the beef snack <b>sticks</b> <b>packages</b> of one, four, and seven <b>sticks</b> per <b>package,</b> respectively. A treatment of 7. 0 min for packages of four natural-casing wieners (three brands) achieved L. monocytogenes reductions of $ 1. 0 log unit and average product surface temperature of 60. 5 to 63. 58 C. Cooked-out fat and moisture resulting from tested treatments ranged from 0. 2 to 1. 1 % by weight for beef snack sticks and from 0. 4 to 1. 2 % by weight for natural-casing wieners. For natural-casing wieners, PPP had no detrimental effect on overall product desirability to consumers; results suggested that PPP may significantly enhance appearance of this product. However, for beef snack sticks the cooking out of fat and moisture during PPP had a significant negative effect on consumer opinions of product appearance. On 6 June 2003, the U. S.

BoyleTo {{validate}} how {{packaging and}} storage reduces Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) on whole muscle turkey jerky and smoked sausage <b>sticks,</b> four <b>packaging</b> systems, including heat seal (HS), heat seal with oxygen scavenger (HSOS), nitrogen flushed with oxygen scavenger (NFOS), and vacuum (VAC), and four ambient temperature storage times were evaluated. Commercially available whole turkey jerky and pork and beef smoked sausage sticks were inoculated with Lm using a dipping or hand-massaging method, respectively. There was no interaction on packaging and storage time on Lm reduction on smoked sausage sticks and an Lm log reduction of > 2. 0 log CFU/cm[superscript] 2 was achieved in smoked sausage <b>sticks</b> <b>packaged</b> in HS, HSOS, and VAC. A > 2. 0 log CFU/cm[superscript] 2 reduction was achieved after 24 h of ambient temperature storage, regardless of package type. NFOS was less {{effective in reducing}} Lm by more than 0. 5 log CFU/cm[superscript] 2 compared to HS, HSOS or VAC. After 30 d of ambient storage, Lm had been reduced by 3. 3 log CFU/cm[superscript] 2 for all packaging environments. In turkey jerky, Lm reduction was affected by the interaction of packaging and storage time. HS, HSOS, NFOS, or VAC in combination with 24, 48, or 72 h ambient temperature storage achieved 2. 0 log CFU/cm[superscript] 2 in HS and VAC, and {{could serve as a}} post-lethality treatment. Alternatively, processors could package turkey jerky in HSOS or NFOS in combination with 30 d ambient storage period as an antimicrobial process. Very little data has been published describing how packaging atmospheres affects Lm survival in RTE meat. The mechanism for Lm reduction under these conditions is not fully understood and additional research is needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of UV-C light treatments on microbial load {{and quality of}} fresh-cut pineapple sticks was studied. At all tested fluencies (200 - 4800 J/m 2), UV-C light did not decrease the initial microbial load of pineapple sticks. Nevertheless, pineapple sticks submitted to 200 J/m 2 UV-C light, packaged in conventional PET/EVOH/PE trays and stored at 6 °C up to 15 days showed slower yeast and lactic acid bacteria growth. In these samples, microbial counts were generally 2 log cycles lower that those observed in the untreated sticks. UV-C light did not promote changes in colour and increased consumer preference. Similar results were also obtained when UV-C light treatment was applied on pineapple <b>sticks</b> previously <b>packaged</b> in highly UV-C light transparent PA/PE pouches to avoid post treatment contamination. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

50|$|COASt, {{an acronym}} for cache on a <b>stick,</b> is a <b>packaging</b> {{standard}} for modules containing SRAM used as an L2 cache in a computer. COASt modules look like somewhat oversized SIMM modules. These modules were somewhat popular in the Apple and PC platforms during early to mid-1990s, but with newer computers cache is built into either the CPU or the motherboard. COASt modules decoupled the motherboard from its cache, allowing varying configurations to be created. A low-cost system could run with no cache, while a more expensive system could come equipped with 512 KB or more cache. Later COASt modules were equipped with pipelined-burst SRAM.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{brings into}} light a new ultra-thin and highly {{flexible}} package with embedded active chips. In this technology, no supporting and permanent substrates were needed. Copper foil {{was used as}} temporal substrate, and it became the bottom circuit after patterning and etching processes. Ultra-thin chips with 20 - 25 m thickness were assembled directly on the structured copper foils in a flip-chip fashion. The gap between chip and copper foil was only about 10 m. Subsequently, the chips were embedded into flexible adhesive/polyimide polymer layers or alternatively in highly elastic polyurethane materials, with a copper foil always laminated on the top. The resultant ultra-thin film package (UTFP) has a thickness of 100 m only. Each <b>package</b> <b>sticking</b> on a rod with 10 mm diameter could pass the electrical measuring. Stacking of three-layer chip embedded packages had also been realized and passed electrical measurements.

Cedar Creek Lake was a joint venture of the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife (KDFW), Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC), {{and the leaders of}} Lincoln County—most importantly ex-Judge-Executive John Sims who envisioned the project. On February 16, 2003, due to excessive amounts of rain, the lake was filled sooner than predicted. This impounded 784 acre of the 14000 acre Cedar Creek watershed, making Cedar Creek Lake the second largest state-controlled lake in Kentucky (with Lake Malone being the largest).During the preparations for Cedar Creek Lake, it was decided to leave all trees and brush to provide a habitat for the future lake's many species of fish.

40|$|Today {{approximately}} 10 % of {{fermented milk}} products <b>stick</b> to the <b>packaging</b> material inner surface, {{and therefore it}} is not possible to pour all of the dairy product from the package. This is both an economical and environmental issue. The product loss is expensive for consumer and makes recycling of package less effective. As they do not yet exist the development of packaging materials to which fermented milk products stick less, it would make it possible to both save money and protect our environment. The aim of this work was to provide knowledge and understanding of the important factors involved in the phenomenon when fermented milk products adhere to the inner surface of a packaging material. Studies were done on materials having different surface properties, such as polarity and relative oxidation. They were incubated in fermented milk and other dairy products varying in fat concentration and protein type up to 168 h. The systems were investigated gravimetrically, with Fourier Transform Infra Red/Attenuated Total Reflectance Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Contact Angle measurements. Fermented milk contains amphiphilic components and therefore can interact both with polar and non-polar surfaces, such that the relative oxidation of the surface does not contribute to the adhesion. The adhesion of fermented milk is an equilibrium reaction, which depend on the fat concentration before equilibrium as well as the protein concentration after equilibrium. The adhesion seems to follows the Vroman effect, with smaller molecules associating faster and thereby adhering to the surface initially, but are displaced by larger molecules that associates slower as times passes...|$|R
