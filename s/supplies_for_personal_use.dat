Four inscribed lead curse tablets excavated from the Heroön of Opheltes at Nemea are edited and presented here with commentary. The texts of the tablets are erotic in nature, but closer analysis reveals a fundamental ambiguity in the rhetorical force of the anatomical lists and the operative verb apostrephō ( ἀποστρέφω) in the curses. The choice of a hero shrine as the place of their deposition is unusual; a deciding factor for this location {{may have been the}} presence of the grave of Opheltes, who was believed to have died very young (aōros; ἄωρος) and through violence (biaiothanatos; βιαιοθάνατος), both of which being desirable qualities in the practice of ancient magic...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the psychology of}} “instigators,” i. e., people who surround an unethical act and influence the wrongdoer (the “actor”) without directly committing the act themselves. In four studies, we found that instigators of unethical acts underestimated their influence over actors. In Studies 1 and 2, university students enlisted other students to commit a “white lie” (Study 1) or commit a small act of vandalism (Study 2) after making predictions about how easy {{it would be to}} get their fellow students to do so. In Studies 3 and 4, online samples of participants responded to hypothetical vignettes, e. g., about buying children alcohol, and taking office <b>supplies</b> home <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>use.</b> In all 4 studies, instigators failed to recognize the social pressure they levied on actors through simple unethical suggestions, i. e., the discomfort actors would experience by making a decision that was inconsistent with the instigator’s suggestion...|$|R
40|$|Lerna and the Lower Citadel of Tiryns are key {{sites for}} {{understanding}} the Early Helladic II–III transition in the northeastern Peloponnese. We argue that {{the differences between the}} two settlements do not reflect chronological variation, but rather the ways in which each settlement responded to events ca. 2200 b. c. The ceramic and architectural sequences are used to illustrate the divergent strategies practiced by the inhabitants of each site. Lerna III–IV epitomizes the renegotiation of social values during a period when centralized decision-making and coordination of economic activities was disintegrating. Activities in the coeval Lower Citadel of Tiryns, on the other hand, reflect the maintenance of continuity in a domestic setting.

40|$|The Joint Committee {{decided to}} {{undertake}} a study into the effects of crimes carried out in communities by gangs and held a number of public hearings in relation to this matter. In the course of its hearings on 18 th February 2015, the Committee was told of an approach adopted by the authorities in Portugal whereby possession of drugs was not dealt with through the Criminal Justice system but by civil/administrative sanctions which has had a very positive result for the communities concerned. As drug supply is {{the main source of}} income to these groups operating in cities and towns throughout Ireland, the Committee decided to send a delegation to Portugal to examine this approach in more detail. It should be noted that it is still an offence to take or possess drugs, but the offence is now treated in a similar way to a traffic offence. However, this approach only applies to possession of a quantity up to 10 day’s <b>supply</b> <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>use</b> [Table 1]. Any person found in possession of drugs must report within 72 hours to a Commission for Addiction Dissuasion for a treatment programme tailored to the individuals needs in order to ensure the best possible result. Possession of more than this stated amount will result in the person falling outside this approach and it then becomes a criminal offence. The delegation was told that in order to break the cycle and allow drug addicts the opportunity to move away from a life of drugs ‘positive discrimination’ for gaining employment was introduced. This system offered employers tax breaks to employ recovering addicts and the State would pay the employee an amount equal to the minimum wage. The employer was required to release the employee for their treatment/counselling until their programme had concluded. The delegation was told that in many cases, these employees gained full time employment and did not go back to using drugs. The approach in relation to drugs has not resulted in an increase in drug taking nor has it resulted in Portugal becoming a destination for drug tourists. The number of HIV/AIDS cases has dropped dramatically...|$|R
50|$|Before 1229, Heston {{was part}} of the parish of Gistleworth (Isleworth) before being taken by Henry III, who {{subsequently}} granted it to the Earl of Cornwall. It covered until the late 19th century creation of Hounslow from outlying parts of two adjoining parishes, 3,823 acres. The close association pre-dates the town of Hounslow, when that was simply Hounslow Priory, the two parishes had long been associated: the medieval manor of Isleworth covered all of that parish and this. After Henry III died in 1316, Heston was owned by the Crown, and later by the wardens of St. Giles Hospital, until it was surrendered to Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Elizabeth I granted Heston to Sir Thomas Gresham, and, after eating some bread made from locally grown wheat, insisted on a <b>supply</b> <b>for</b> her own <b>personal</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to increasing prescription drug costs, more U. S. patients and policymakers are importing less-expensive pharmaceutical products from other countries. Large-scale prescription drug impor-tation is currently illegal, but the U. S. Food and Drug Administra-tion permits individuals {{to bring in}} 90 -day <b>supplies</b> of drugs <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>use.</b> As patient use of foreign-bought drugs has increased, federal legislators have continued to debate the full legalization of importation. Three factors help guide whether U. S. patients and policymakers can rely on other countries as sources of imported prescription drugs: whether {{the safety of the}} product can be en-sured, how the import price compares with domestic prices, and how importation might affect the exporting country’s pharmaceu-tical market. In wealthier countries with active regulatory systems, drug safety can be adequately ensured, and brand-name products are usually less expensive than in the United States (although generic drugs may be more expensive). However, implementing large-scale importation can negatively impact the originating coun-try’s market and can diminish the long-term cost savings for U. S. consumers. In low- and middle-income countries, prices may be reduced for both brand-name and generic drugs, but the preva-lence of unauthorized products on the market makes ensuring drug safety more difficult. It may be reasonable for individual U. S. con-sumers to purchase essential medicines from certain international markets, but {{the most effective way to}} decrease drug costs overall is the appropriate use of domestic generic drugs, which are avail-able for almost every major therapeutic class.
