5000|$|In 1895, the Army {{introduced}} a new enlisted rank system that {{became the basis for}} the system used in World War I. Smaller rank insignia were introduced in 1903 that were to be worn point-up, but with the transition from the older, larger point-down insignia to the new, smaller point-up versions, there was some confusion concerning the proper manner of wear of the new insignia. War Department Circular 61 of 1905, directed that the points be placed up and designated certain colors for each branch of the military for uniformity. During World War I troops overseas in France used standard buff stripes inset with trade badges in the place of colored branch stripes or rank badges. The seniority grades were numbered from top down, from General of the Army being graded [...] "1" [...] to the rank of Corporal being graded [...] "19"; NCO ranks <b>in</b> <b>seniority</b> <b>grades</b> 13 through 19 were clumped together at each level. The confusing part was that the pay grades were different, with less senior ranks with a more technical training being paid more than senior staff NCOs. On 22 July 1919, the military approved [...] "an arc of one bar" [...] (a trade badge over a single arc [...] "rocker") for a private first class. This was later changed to a single chevron in 1920.|$|R
