5000|$|For {{describing}} the blur spot achieved by a lens, {{at its best}} focus or more generally. Recognizing that real lenses do not focus all rays perfectly under even the best conditions, the term circle of least confusion is often used for the smallest blur <b>spot</b> a <b>lens</b> can make (Ray 2002, 89)i, for example by picking a best focus position that makes a good compromise between the varying effective focal lengths of different lens zones due to spherical or other aberrations. The term circle of confusion is applied more generally, {{to the size of}} the out-of-focus spot to which a lens images an object point. Diffraction effects from wave optics and the finite aperture of a lens determine the circle of least confusion; the more general usage of [...] "circle of confusion" [...] for out-of-focus points can be computed purely in terms of ray (geometric) optics.|$|R

50|$|In {{idealized}} ray optics, where {{rays are}} assumed to converge to a point when perfectly focused, {{the shape of a}} defocus blur <b>spot</b> from a <b>lens</b> with a circular aperture is a hard-edged circle of light. A more general blur spot has soft edges due to diffraction and aberrations (Stokseth 1969, 1317; Merklinger 1992, 45-46), and may be non-circular due to the aperture shape. Therefore, the diameter concept needs to be carefully defined in order to be meaningful. Suitable definitions often use the concept of encircled energy, the fraction of the total optical energy of the spot that is within the specified diameter. Values of the fraction (e.g., 80%, 90%) vary with application.|$|R

Two spatially separated focal spots for orthogonal polarizations are obtained by designing metasurface pattern, made of overlapping tightly packed cross and rod shaped antennas {{with a strong}} polarization selectivity. Optimized subwavelength pattern allows multiplexing two different lenses with low polarization crosstalk on the same substrate and provides a control over focal <b>spots</b> of the <b>lens</b> only by changing of the polarization state of the incident wave. More than a wavelength separation between the focal spots was demonstrated for a broad spectral range, covering half a decade in frequency.

Each launch required someone to pull a canvas rip panel, releasing the balloon, while four people guided the chair and camera rig across the ground to a position underneath the rising balloon. The first rig partially collapsed on take-off, but it remained intact enough to rise for over 82 minutes, reaching a height of 98,268 ft before the balloon shattered and the rig fell for around {{half an hour before}} hitting ground. At one point during the ascent, telemetry from the rig recorded a temperature of [...] before the air became too thin to dissipate heat effectively and the temperature rose again. The cameras on both of the first two rigs were offline, but usable footage was recovered from the second launch, albeit slightly overexposed. Two additional launches were made the following day, with the fourth re-capturing footage unrecoverable from previous launches. Despite the four balloons reaching heights of 98268 ft, 93000 ft, 94000 ft and 82000 ft all of the rigs and cameras were recovered within twelve miles (12 mi) of the launch site. The launch reaching 98,268 ft set a new world record for Highest High-Definition Television Commercial. In all, 16 hours of footage were recorded and handed to The Mill for post production.

The purpose {{of this research is}} to measure the dielectric properties of transformer oil by using free-space microwave measurement system between 18 – 26 GHz (K-band), to compare measured results with published results for transformer oil and to collect the variation values of dielectric properties in microwave frequency between 18 GHz to 26 GHz (k-band). FSMM system consists of <b>spot</b> focusing horn <b>lens</b> antennas, mode transitions, coaxial cables and vector network analyzer (VNA).

40|$|The Gaussian {{approximation}} that {{is typically}} {{used to estimate}} single-mode fiber microlens performance is investigated. It is applied to hemispheric lenses on two types of tapered single-mode fiber. Theoretical and experimental results are compared. The first type of taper, which is fabricated by pulling a fiber while it is melted, has a tapered core and a tapered cladding. The second type of taper, which is fabricated by etching the cladding, has a tapered cladding only. For a tapered-core fiber, coupling to the cladding-guided modes and the finite radius of curvature of the wave front before the lens must be considered to predict the <b>lens</b> <b>spot</b> size accurately, whereas the spot size of a tapered-cladding lens can be predicted from the lens diameter alone. Thus the spot size of a lens on a tapered-cladding fiber is easier to predict and control {{than that of a}} lens on a tapered-core fiber. It is also shown that the usual theory used to predict the spot size gives accepted values for tapered-cladding lenses but not for tapered-core lenses...|$|R
40|$|State-of-the-art high {{brightness}} LEDs offer optical powers {{of about one}} watt and span a wide wavelength range - clearly outperforming usual single mode laser diodes. Thus, LEDs excel in applications where beam quality - the main advantage of lasers - is not the decisive criteria and/or speckle are critical.

Contrary to usual laser diode spot array generators with diffractive beamsplitters this design enables individually colored spots, suppresses unwanted speckle and increases beam quality with increasing spot number. Design rules and scaling laws are established, then the resulting system is analyzed with respect to useful transmission, beam quality and chromatic aberrations. We realized a 21 x 21 spot array generator with 40 °x 40 ° FOV using a simple plano-convex lens as projection optics. A chirped lens array with varying focal widths and pre-distorted lenslet positions corrects field curvature and distortion of the projection optics.

40|$|Today {{spot welding}} {{is still the}} most applied joining {{technique}} in the automotive industry. But new developed materials require the adaption and enhancement of this technology for a robust joining process. Investigations were focused on weld-ability of high- and ultra high strength steels like HT 700 T (TRIP steel) or 22 MnB 5 (press hardening steel) by using a servo-mechanical drive for electrode force as well as power control instead of conventional welding current controller. The results of the experiments showed that the TRIP-steel as well as the press hardening steel can be safely welded with an electrode force of more than 5 kN and an welding current of about 8 kA. Best results were achieved with a process control using multiple current impulses. By using an after-heat impulse hardness of spot welds is decreased and the failure mode of the specimen during the chisel test could be improved. The course of hardness across the <b>spot</b> weld <b>lens</b> as well as inside of the base material is already on a high level but drops significantly steep inside of heat affected zone (HAZ). The advantage of the servo mechanical electrode drive is the backlash-free threaded spindle which leads to an increase of electrode force because of the thermal expansion of material during heating up to melting temperature. This effect improves the weldability of 22 MnB 5 and leads to an increase in tool-life time of the spot welding electrodes. The use of process control with controlled welding power in conjunction with a multi impulse process have favorable effects on the results of the tensile tests and ensures a robust welding process. It could be proven that, if the appropriate welding parameters are chosen, joining of HT 700 T as well as 22 MnB 5 by resistance spot welding is possible where the welded connections fulfill the requirements of quality in respect of lens diameter, connection strength and failure mode...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFemtosecond laser surface {{processing}} of materials allows for precise micrometer cutting with restricted detrimental side effects. An {{efficient way to}} increase the ablation or cutting speed and energy efficiency of the process is the generation of N parallel laser spots in the focal plane of a lens on the sample surface, each spot simultaneously following a defined cutting trajectory. However, the cutting scheme is then limited in area to avoid overlap of the spot trajectories. We present in this paper a technique to overcome this limitation. The ultrafast laser beam wavefront is spatially modulated, generating a line of multiple processing <b>spots</b> in the <b>lens</b> focal plane. Micro-cutting is then conducted by translation of the sample along the spot line. That way, no restriction on the cutting trajectory length is imposed while preserving {{the increase in the}} cutting speed and energy efficiency of the process compared to single spot machining. Successful cutting of PZT ceramic and stainless steel is achieved with the spot array and compared to single spot machining in terms of processing time. In the case of PZT, the cutting efficiency and speed is compared to single spot laser machining with various focal lenses. We also investigate the effect of intensity gradient on the spots line for micro-cutting on stainless steel. The method efficiency is discussed relying on surface characterization using scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{high power}} and {{repetitive}} Nd:Glass laser, there would appear serious thermal effect {{due to the}} significantly-enhanced pumping optical power density in laser rod, which would induce thermal double refraction, phase distortion, thermal focusing, thermal depolarization, etc. Thus, the laser output power and beam quality would be influenced severely. Influence of thermal lens effect and depolarization effect caused by thermal stress double refraction on laser beam were studied in this paper for high power and repetitive laser. In the experiment of thermal lens effect, change of the laser <b>spot</b> by thermal <b>lens</b> effect was recorded after a TEM 00 He-Ne laser beam passing through the Nd:Glass rod pumped by Xe lamp, and the corresponding optical compensator was applied to eliminate the thermal lens effect to improve the beam quality. Configuration of polarizer was designed in our experiment to research the depolarization effect caused by thermal stress double refraction. First, emergent light distribution and loss factor caused by double refraction was calculated according to the theoretical model. Then the exiting cone-shaped polarized light intensity distribution was obtained through the experiment. It could {{be obtained from the}} experiments that thermal lens effect and depolarization effect caused by thermal double refraction would reduce the output laser beam quality to varied extents. As the number of laser pulses increased, thermal effects began to emerge and the output laser energy apparently decreased; when the thermal effects steadied, the output energy would be tending towards stability...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{damage that}} results in large scale {{fracture}} has been observed in the large, high-fluence, fused-silica, spatial filter lenses on the Nova and Beamlet lasers. In nearly all cases damage occurs on the vacuum side of the lenses and because the vacuum side of the lens is under tensile stress this damage can lead to catastrophic crack growth if the flaw (damage) size exceeds the critical flaw size for SiO{sub 2 }. The damaged 52 cm Nova lenses fracture into two and sometimes three large pieces. Although under full vacuum load {{at the time they}} fracture, the Nova lenses do not implode. Rather the authors have observed that the pieces lock together and air slowly leaks into the vacuum spatial filter housing through the lens cracks. The Beamlet lenses have a larger aspect ratio and peak tensile stress than Nova. The peak tensile stress {{at the center of the}} output surface of the Beamlet lens is 1, 490 psi versus 810 psi for Nova. During a recent Beamlet high energy shot, a damage <b>spot</b> on the <b>lens</b> grew to the critical flaw size and the lens imploded. Post shot data indicate the lens probably fractured into 5 to 7 pieces, however, unlike Nova, these pieces did not lock together. Analysis shows that the likely source of damage is contamination from pinhole blow-off or out-gassing of volatile materials within the spatial filter. Contamination degrades the antireflection properties of the sol-gel coating and reduces its damage threshold. By changing the design of the Beamlet lens it may be possible to insure that it fails safe by locking up in much that same manner as the Nova lens...|$|R

The light diffused from the cornea is observed by two cameras and processed in order to yield the surfaces' profiles. The optical system used to project a thin rotating line on the cornea consists of a white light source provided with optical fiber bundle output which is first conditioned {{by a set of}} lenses so that it would produce a spot on the cornea. A small cylinder lens is used to expand the beam in one direction so that a thin line illuminates the cornea, rather than a <b>spot.</b> The cylinder <b>lens</b> is provided with motor driven rotation about an axis normal to its own in order to rotate the line on the cornea such that the projected line scans the whole cornea; the illuminator is completed with a slit aperture. The cornea is not perfectly transparent, scattering some of the light that traverses it; this fact is used for its observation by two cameras.

The two cameras' images can be combined in order to simulate a single virtual rotating camera. Image processing is used to extract information about the corneal surfaces profiles and thickness from the optical sections.

The laser interaction with an induced plasma is described, starting from the kinematics of single electron motion, followed by collective electron effects and the ponderamotive motion in the laser focus and the plasma transparency for the laser beam. The three different mechanisms prepared to accelerate and propagate electrons through matter are discussed. The following indirect acceleration of protons is explained by the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism. Finally some possible applications of laser accelerated protons are explained briefly. • Chapter 3 deals with the modeling of geometry and field mapping of magnetic lens. Initial proton and electron distributions, fitted to PHELIX measured data are generated, a brief description of employed codes and used techniques in simulation is given, and the aberrations at the solenoid focal spot is studied. • Chapter 4 presents a simulation study for suggested corrections to optimize the proton beam as a later beam source. Two tools have been employed in these suggested corrections, an aperture placed at the solenoid focal spot as energy selection tool, and a scattering foil placed in the proton beam to smooth the radial energy beam profile correlation at the focal spot due to chromatic aberrations. Another suggested correction has been investigated, to optimize the beam radius at the focal <b>spot</b> by <b>lens</b> geometry controlling. • Chapter 5 presents a simulation study for the de-neutralization problem in TNSA caused by the fringing fields of pulsed magnetic solenoid and quadrupole. In this simulation, we followed an electrostatic model, wherethe evolution of both, self and mutual fields through the pulsed magnetic solenoid could be found, which is not the case in the quadrupole and only the growth of self fields could be found. The field mapping of magnetic elements is generated by the Matlab program, while the TraceWin code is employed to study the tracking through magnetic elements. • Chapter 6 describes the PHELIX laser parameters at GSI with chirp pulse amplification technique (CPA), and Gafchromic Radiochromic film RCF) as a spatial energy resolver film detector. The results of experiments with laser proton acceleration, which were performed in two experimental areas at GSI (Z 6 area and PHELIX Laser Hall (PLH)), are presented in section 6. 3. • Chapter 7 includes the main results of this work, conclusions and gives a perspective for future experimental activities...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} descibes {{the development}} {{and the application of}} a planar acoustic microscope lens. The prototype lens consists of a pair of concentric circular metal electrodes plated on the interface between a piezoelectric solid and a liquid medium. These two circular electrodes excite Rayleigh waves of velocity V(,R) which are converging towards the common centre but which are phase matched to the compressional waves of the velocity V(,c) in the liquid in a very narrow range of zenith angle about a value given by (phi) (,m) = sin('- 1) V(,c) /V(,R). The waves radiated into the liquid are thus {{in the form of a}} hollow cone converging onto a common focal <b>spot</b> on the <b>lens</b> axis at a distance determined by this zenith angle and the radius of the electrodes. This planar acoustic microscope lens is called the Rayleigh-to-Compressional Conversion (RCC) lens. Since the lens behavior is determined by the geometry of the electrodes and because of the simplicity of the photolithographic fabrication process of the RCC lens, more complicated configurations can be made as easily as the prototype; for example, semicircular lenses have been produced and analyzed. A mathematical analysis based on a spatial impulse of stress applied on the solid/liquid boundary has been used to calculate the focussing characteristics of the RCC lens. For isotropic solid not only the particle displacements of the compressional wave in the liquid have been computed, but also that of the waves radiated into the solid. For anisotropic solids only the radiation pattern of the compressional wave in the liquid, which is the one of most interesting, has been investigated using an isotropic equivalent model. In the model the circular shape of the electrodes has been considered to consist of many line segments and it has been used to analyze the focal properties of partial circles and anisotropic substrate. This planar acoustic microscope lens has been employed in standard transmission and reflection imaging experiments to demonstrate the structure of its focal spot and in particular the lack of spherical aberration when traversing a metal surface. Because of the hollow conical nature of the beam away from the focal region the RCC lens is inherently adapted to dark field microscopy. Some properties of semicircular lens are also given as examples in linear and nonlinear operation.... (Author's abstract exceeds stipulated maximum length.
