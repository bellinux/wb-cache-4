40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{identify}} the mechanical loading of the gymnast’s motor system during forward and backward <b>swings</b> on gymnastic <b>rings.</b> A junior gymnast of the First Class, aged 14, with body mass 53. 1 kg and body length 1. 61 m, participated in the study. He executed a series of ten cyclic <b>swing</b> movements on <b>rings</b> with his maximum amplitude. Kinematic variables of the gymnast’s centre of mass (COM) as well as reaction forces in the cables were measured and synchronized using the SIMI MOTION movement analysis system. Two separate phases of mechanical loading of the motor system have been identified: resistance phase and non resistance phase. In the non resistance phase the gymnast attains similar values of the COM’s momentum but different angular displacements. In the resistance phase the forces acting on the motor system have their maximum. They amount to 5. 5 BW for the forward swing and 6. 5 BW for the backward swing movement. The maximum rate of change of the force for forward and backward swing is 42. 6 BWs- 1 and 67. 4 BWs- 1, respectively. These two variables differentiate the mechanical loading of the gymnast’s motor system between forward and backward swings. The reaction force produced by the gymnast is significantly greater during the execution of forward swings. It seems probable that horizontal displacements of COM may be the factor responsible for reduction of the mechanical loading experienced by the gymnast...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the serial, Journal of Biomechanics [© Elsevier]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] elite gymnasts perform the straight arm backward longswing on rings in competition. Since points are deducted if gymnasts possess motion on completion of the movement, the ability to successfully perform the longswing to a stationary final handstand is of great importance. Sprigings et al. (1998) found that for a longswing initiated from a still handstand the optimum performance of an inelastic planar simulation model resulted in a residual swing of more than 3 ° in the final handstand. For the present study, a three-dimensional simulation model of a gymnast <b>swinging</b> on <b>rings,</b> incorporating lateral arm movements used by gymnasts and mandatory apparatus elasticity, was used to investigate the possibility of performing a backward longswing initiated and completed in handstands with minimal swing. Root mean square differences between the actual and simulated performances for the orientations of the gymnast and rings cables, the combined cable tension and the extension of the gymnast were 3. 2 °, 1. 0 °, 270 N and 0. 05 m respectively. The optimised simulated performance initiated from a handstand with 2. 1 ° of swing and using realistic changes to the gymnast's technique resulted in 0. 6 ° of residual swing in the final handstand. The sensitivity of the backward longswing to perturbations in the technique used for the optimised performance was determined. For a final handstand with minimal residual swing (2 °) the changes in body configuration must be timed to within 15 m s while a delay of 30 m s will result in considerable residual swing (7 °) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Human Movement Science [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] elite gymnasts perform the straight arm backward longswing on rings during their competition routines in order to satisfy specific judging requirements. Measured peak combined cable tension during a backward longswing is typically in excess of 9 bodyweights and forces of this magnitude have been associated with an increased risk of injury to gymnasts' shoulders. This study investigated the contribution of longswing technique and the elasticity of the gymnast and rings apparatus to minimising loading at the shoulders. A three-dimensional video and cable tension analysis was conducted on a backward longswing performed by an elite gymnast. This analysis provided information regarding the motion of the rings cables, the gymnast's technique and the elasticity of the rings apparatus. A three-dimensional five-segment computer simulation model of a gymnast <b>swinging</b> on <b>rings</b> was developed. The inertial characteristics for the model were determined from anthropometric measurements of the gymnast and measurements taken directly from the rings apparatus. The simulation model was evaluated by comparing the backward longswing from the data collection with a simulation of the same performance. The root mean squared (rms) differences between the actual performance of the longswing and the simulation for cable tension, orientations of the gymnast and rings cables and the wrist to ankle length of the gymnast were 297 N, 3. 3 °, 1. 1 ° and 0. 06 m, respectively. During the simulated longswing the peak combined force at the shoulders was 8. 5 bodyweights. Modifications to the evaluated simulation of the longswing were used to determine the effect of the gymnast's technique, his elasticity and that of the rings apparatus on peak shoulder force. Altering the gymnast's technique, by fixing the gymnast in a straight body configuration throughout the swing, increased the peak shoulder force by 2. 56 bodyweights. Removing only the lateral arm movements, which form part of the gymnast's technique, also resulted in an increased peak shoulder force (0. 73 bodyweights). Removing only the elasticity of the apparatus or gymnast from the evaluated simulation resulted in smaller increases in peak shoulder force (0. 62 bodyweights and 0. 53 bodyweights). Although the elasticity of the gymnast and apparatus contribute to minimising peak shoulder force, this study shows that the contribution of a gymnast's technique is considerably greater...|$|R
