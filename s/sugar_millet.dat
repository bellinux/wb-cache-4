50|$|In 1871, {{the line}} of the Phulkian dynasty which had ruled Nabha, a small 11-gun state, since 1718 became extinct upon the death from {{tuberculosis}} of the young Raja, Bhagwan Singh (1842-1871). The remaining two lines of the dynasty-the rulers of Patiala and Jind-in conjunction with the British government fixed upon Hira Singh as the successor to the Nabha gadi (throne). Hira Singh ascended the throne of Nabha on 9 June 1871 and began a long and successful reign that would usher Nabha into the modern era. Great monuments and public buildings were erected, roads, railways, hospitals, schools and palaces were constructed and an efficient modern army was established that saw service during the Second Afghan War and the Tirah Expedition. As well, agriculture flourished with the construction of an irrigation canal at Sirhind, and Nabha soon produced bountiful harvests of wheat, <b>sugar,</b> pulses, <b>millet</b> and cotton, thus enabling the state to increase the value of its land revenue assessments.|$|R

30|$|Green {{corn leaf aphid}} (GCLA), Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), is a major pest of corn in Egypt, Middle East, and elsewhere; heavy infestations cause {{yield loss}} by more than 35 % (Al-Eryan and El-Tabbakh, 2004). It is also {{considered}} as a major pest of sorghum, barley, <b>sugar</b> cane, <b>millet,</b> wheat, and banana {{in various parts of}} the world. This pest is attacked by various predators of different families, viz., Chrysopidae, Syrphidae, and Coccinellidae. Green lacewing, Crysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Chrysopidae), is the most effective biological control agent of aphid species. The larva of C. carnea has relatively a wide range of prey acceptance (Preetha et al., 2009), which includes aphids, whiteflies, eggs of moths, and other soft-bodied insects. As a result of the polyphagous ability and voracious nature of C. carnea in addition to its vast geographical distribution (New, 1975), there is easiness of mass multiplication (Araujo and Bichao, 1990) and tolerance to several pesticides (Hassan et al., 1985). C. carnea has received numerous attentions from farmers as well as researchers as a potential biological pest control agent. The effectiveness of C. carnea as a biological control agent has been demonstrated in field and greenhouses and reported to give about 100 % lepidoptran pest control when used along with Trichogramma spp. (Hagley and Miles, 1987; Rincon, 1999). Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the potential impact of Bt transgenic plants on green lacewing predator, C. carnea.|$|R
25|$|The Nivkh had {{a diverse}} diet being semi-sedentary before colonization. Fish {{was the main}} source of food for the Nivkh, {{including}} pink, Pacific, and chum salmon as well as trout, Red Eye, burbot and pike found in rivers and streams. Salt water fishing provided saffron cod, flatfish, and marine goby caught in the littoral coasts of the Strait of Tartary, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean, though over fishing by Russian and Japanese trawlers have depleted many of these fish stocks. Additionally, industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged the soil of the estuaries. A traditional preservation process called Yukola, involving slicing the fish in a particular way and drying the strips by hanging them in the frigid air, without salt, was used before foreign influences. The preservation process created a lot of dried fish waste, unpalatable for human consumption but utilized for dog food. Pulverizing dried fish and mixing it with fish skins, water, seal fat, and berries until the mixture had a sour cream consistency is a favorite Nivkh dish called mos. Nivkhs would hunt seal (Larha, Reinged, Reibbon, Sea-lions), duck, sable, and otters. They would gather various berries, wild leeks, lilybulbs, and nuts. Contacts with the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese from the 12th century on introduced new foods incorporated in the Nivkhs diet such as salt, <b>sugar,</b> rice, <b>millet,</b> legumes and tea. Russian 19th century colonisation introduced flour, bread, potatoes, vodka, tobacco, butter, canned vegetables and fruits, and other meats.|$|R
40|$|Striga hermonthica, or striga {{as it is}} {{commonly}} known, is a pernicious parasitic weed that affects millions of hectares of land in sub Saharan Africa and is becoming a major constraint to food production on the African continent. Striga attacks a variety of crops; including maize, sorghum, <b>millet,</b> <b>sugar</b> cane and rice, stunting growth and reducing yields. In heavily infested fields, maize yields can drop by 50 % or more. Physical eradication of striga by hand weeding is labour intensive, and chemical control methods are too expensive for small-scale farmers. In Kenya, laboratory and greenhouse experiments at the National Sugar Research Centre at Kibos have shown- that Sesbania sesban trees can stimulate striga seed germination in the soil, just as maize does. In the Vihiga District of Kenya's Western Province researchers are now evaluating the longterm effects of ses bania trees on striga. The trees are planted mainly to improve soil fertility, {{but they also have}} the added bonus of stimulating striga seeds to germinate. The seeds subsequently die because sesbania is not a true host plant. Results from two seasons of experiments in 1994 showed that sesbania trees actually reduced the number of striga seeds in the soil by 34 %, whereas in maize plots without a sesbania' trap' crop, the striga seed population increased by 11 %. The preliminary results are encouraging but the real test will come when the sesbania in the fallow plots is replanted with maize and both soil fertility and striga populations can be assessed and compared.

40|$|Although the {{pesticide}} DDT has been banned from use in Canada {{for more than}} three decades, DDT still persists in Canadian farmlands at detectable levels. Much effort, such as incineration, thermal desorption, and bioremediation, has been used to remediate DDT contaminated soils, but so far it is either too expensive or impractically slow. In this study, a three-year period of field trials was performed to investigate phytoremediation of DDT contaminated soil. In the field trials, <b>millet,</b> fall rye, <b>sugar</b> beet, potato, and pumpkin, treated with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were planted on two sites. As well, untreated plants were planted as a control. Plant growth, and 4, 4 ’-DDT plus 4, 4 ’-DDE concentrations in plant tissues and soil were monitored regularly. Comparing the plant growth between PGPR treated and untreated, PGPR significantly promoted the plant growth. On site 1, the root length and root weight of fall rye treated with PGPR were 16 % and 44 % greater, respectively, compared to the untreated plants. The root and shoot dry weights of millet treated with PGPR were 38 % and 47 % greater than those untreated plants. Root dry weight of sugar beet treated with PGPR was increased by 74 % compared to untreated sugar beet. A significant effect of growth promotion was also observed in pumpkin and potato treated with PGPR. Following plant growth, DDT detection in plants was performed. 4, 4 ’-DDT and 4, 4 ’-DDE were found in plant tissues of fall rye, <b>millet,</b> <b>sugar</b> beet, and pumpkin. The concentrations of 4, 4 ’-DDT and 4, 4 ’-DDE in fall rye roots were 0. 61 and 0. 59 μg/g, respectively. In pumpkin tissues at harvest, 4, 4 ’-DDT and 4, 4 ’-DDE concentrations were 0. 67 and 1. 64 μg/g in roots, 1. 06 and 2. 05 μg/g in the lower stems, and 0. 2 and 0. 32 μg/g in the upper stems. The data indicated that it is feasible to phytoremediate DDT from contaminated soil. In addition, 4, 4 ’-DDT concentrations in soils with different plant species were determined. In millet plot on site 1, 4, 4 ’-DDT concentration in rhizosphere soil dropped by 41 % in 2006 compared to 4, 4 ’-DDT concentration at t 0. In sugar beet plot on site 1, 28 % of 4, 4 ’-DDT dropped in rhizosphere soil in 2007. In pumpkin plot on site 1, 4, 4 ’-DDT in rhizosphere soil was decreased by 22 % in 2007. The results show that 4, 4 ’-DDT concentration in rhizosphere soil was significantly lower than the initial level of DDT. Based on the data of 4, 4 ’-DDT in soils and plant tissues, a mass balance was constructed and calculated. The preliminary mass balance shows that the total amount that DDT decreased in rhizopshere soil approximately equals to the total amount of DDT accumulated in plant tissues. This indicates that phytoextraction is the mechanism of DDT phytoremediation. In addition, PGPR promoted plant growth and then enhanced the phytoremediation efficiency of DDT. Therefore, the research indicates that PGPR assisted phytoremediation has a great potential for remediation of DDT and other chlorinated aromatics from impacted soil...|$|R
