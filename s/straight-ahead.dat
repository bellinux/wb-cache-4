25|$|A {{number of}} players who usually perform in largely <b>straight-ahead</b> {{settings}} have emerged since the 1990s, including pianists Jason Moran and Vijay Iyer, guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, vibraphonist Stefon Harris, trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Terence Blanchard, saxophonists Chris Potter and Joshua Redman, clarinetist Ken Peplowski and bassist Christian McBride.|$|E
25|$|He has {{performed}} and recorded in various genres, including pop, R & B, Motown/soul, gospel, rock, classic rock, country (contemporary and traditional), contemporary Christian, classical and jazz music, and {{perhaps best known}} for his work in the jazz idiom, combining <b>straight-ahead</b> jazz piano stylings with Sinatra-style vocals. He resides in Birmingham, Alabama.|$|E
25|$|Other albums {{included}} The Tokyo Concert (1973); Since We Met (1974); and But Beautiful (1974), {{featuring the}} trio plus saxophonist Stan Getz in live performances from the Netherlands and Belgium. Morell was an energetic, <b>straight-ahead</b> drummer, {{unlike many of}} the trio's former percussionists, and many critics feel {{that this was a}} period of little growth for Evans. After Morell left, Evans and Gómez recorded two duo albums, Intuition and Montreux III.|$|E
25|$|The band's Wooden Nickel {{recordings}} Styx (1972), Styx II (1973), The Serpent Is Rising (1973) and Man of Miracles (1974) were {{a mixture}} of <b>straight-ahead</b> rock with some dramatic prog-rock flourishes and art-rock aspirations. These albums showcase intricate and powerful organ, guitar, vocal and percussion solos as well. The Serpent Is Rising would foreshadow later endeavors by the group—the concept album is an idiom upon which Styx would rely heavily by the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|He {{recorded}} three albums in this vein, Free Form (Jazzland 1960), Abstract (Columbia (UK) 1962) and Movement (Columbia (UK) 1963). Abstract {{received a}} five star review from Harvey Pekar in Down Beat, {{the first such}} honour for a British Jazz record. Free Form and Abstract together formed a perfect pair of cohesive, trailblazing free jazz sessions. The next album, Movement, featured {{some of his most}} fiercely abstract compositions, but these were tempered by some other, more <b>straight-ahead</b> pieces.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, {{his smooth}} jazz-influenced Brazilian music {{came to the}} {{forefront}} with Festival – another album strongly featuring his work on nylon-string acoustic guitars. The following album, Color Rit, continued with a similar mood. He did however, change direction completely again with his <b>straight-ahead</b> jazz album Stolen Moments. Sounding similar to Wes Montgomery, Ritenour played alongside long-time collaborator, saxophonist Ernie Watts, pianist Alan Broadbent, bassist John Patitucci (playing only acoustic) and drummer Harvey Mason. During that same year, he performed and composed the theme song of the Canadian TV series Ramona.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} {{portion of his}} solo career (about 1931–1934), Crosby's emotional, often {{pleading}} style of crooning was widely popular. But Jack Kapp (manager of Brunswick and later Decca) talked Crosby into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms, {{in favor of a}} <b>straight-ahead</b> clear vocal style. Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other artists, and most importantly, diversifying his repertoire into various styles and genres. This approach's wide appeal helped Crosby become highly successful, charting number-one hits in the genres of Christmas music, Hawaiian music and Country music, as well as top-thirty hits in Irish music, French music, Rhythm and blues, as well as Ballad songs.|$|E
25|$|Harriott's free-form {{compositions}} normally formed only {{a portion}} of live gigs. Indeed, the final album recorded by the quintet, 1964's High Spirits (Columbia), was a <b>straight-ahead</b> jazz interpretation of compositions from the musical of that name, which was based on the Noël Coward play Blithe Spirit. However, the continuing hostility of the older British jazz establishment to free form, and the drying up of recording and performance opportunities, saw Harriott's quintet cease to be sustainable in the changing musical climate of mid-1960s Britain. The quintet effectively broke up when Shake Keane moved to Germany in 1965. From this point onwards, Harriott worked freelance on a number of projects.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all {{vehicles}} (except many motorcycles {{and commercial}} semi-tractors) have a turn-indicator self-cancelling feature that returns the lever to the neutral (no signal) {{position as the}} steering wheel approaches the <b>straight-ahead</b> position after a turn has been made. Beginning in the late 1960s, indicating for a lane change was facilitated {{by the addition of}} a spring-loaded momentary signal-on position just shy of the left and right detents. The signal operates for however long the driver holds the lever partway towards the left or right turn signal detent. Some recent vehicles have an automatic lane-change indication feature; tapping the lever partway towards the left or right signal position and immediately releasing it causes the applicable turn indicators to flash three to five times.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{dual-mode}} ignition, the KR200 had a steering bar reminiscent of {{that of an}} aircraft. To steer the KR200, the driver would swivel the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (<b>straight-ahead)</b> position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. The mechanism was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common steering mechanisms which involved reduction gearing. The gearshift lever had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would {{put the car in}} neutral regardless of what gear it had been in before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|E
25|$|Roth hired 19-year-old guitar virtuoso Jason Becker {{to replace}} Steve Vai prior to {{recording}} his third solo LP, A Little Ain't Enough. A <b>straight-ahead</b> hard rock album produced by Bob Rock, (who had just produced Metallica's self-titled album), A Little Ain't Enough achieved RIAA gold status shortly after its January 1991 release. Before starting a support tour for A Little Ain't Enough, Jason Becker {{was diagnosed with}} Lou Gehrig's disease, rendering him unable to perform onstage. Guitarist Joe Holmes stood in for Becker during the tour. Later in 1991, Nirvana and grunge rock emerged, altering musical tastes and suddenly making Roth's brand of hard rock seem unfashionable. Roth's band fractured shortly following the tour's completion. With one exception – 1997's well-received DLR Band album, featuring guitarist John 5 and drummer Ray Luzier – until his reconciliation with Van Halen in 2006, Roth would utilize hired-hands and studio musicians on his club and amphitheater solo tours.|$|E
25|$|Halladay's fastball was clocked up to , but it {{had little}} movement, and his pitches were up in the strike zone, which was {{ultimately}} the reason why his 2000 season was so unsuccessful. He worked with former Blue Jays pitching coach Mel Queen. The problem, Queen realized, was Halladay's total reliance on his strength—his attempt to overpower batters with <b>straight-ahead</b> pitches. Within two weeks, Halladay had altered his arm angle for a more deceptive delivery, and added pitches that sank and careened. Instead of throwing over the top, he chose to use a three-quarters delivery (the middle point between throwing overhand and sidearm). Originally a fastball pitcher, he became reliant on keeping his pitches low across the plate, regardless {{of the type of}} pitch thrown. The adjustments proved successful. After a month and a half, he was promoted to Double-A Tennessee, and a month later, to Triple-A Syracuse. By mid-season, he was back in the Blue Jays' rotation. He posted a 5–3 win–loss record with a 3.19 ERA for the Blue Jays in 16 starts in 2001.|$|E

500|$|Groza was a <b>straight-ahead</b> kicker. He {{approached}} the football {{in a straight}} line and booted it with the top of his foot, aiming for the middle of the ball. Early in his career, Groza scraped the ground with his cleats {{in a straight line}} to help guide his kicks. Later he put down a piece of one-inch adhesive tape rolled up inside his helmet. The [...] "Lou Groza Rule" [...] in 1950 banned the use of artificial kicking aids, including the tape. [...] The <b>straight-ahead</b> style used by Groza and other kickers of his era has since been supplanted by soccer-style kicking with the side of the foot. [...] "I don't know why all the kids kick soccer-style", he said in 1997. [...] "They kick the ball with the side of their foot, which is supposed to give them better control. I don't know, I never tried it." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{composition}} in Bleed American also remained rather direct and straightforward {{in comparison to}} Clarity. Mark Vanderhoff of Allmusic said that Bleed American didn't have any [...] "16 minute songs," [...] referencing [...] "Goodbye Sky Harbor" [...] from Clarity. Rather, he called the music on Bleed American [...] "just <b>straight-ahead</b> rock & roll, performed with punk energy and alt-rock smarts." ...|$|E
500|$|Unterberger {{wrote that}} the 1995 reissue of the album was [...] "probably {{motivated}} by the exotica-space age pop revival". [...] He called the album's music [...] "more or less <b>straight-ahead</b> pop-calypso" [...] that was [...] "not that strange or cheesy". [...] He complimented Angelou's performance, saying that she [...] "sung with respectable gutsiness", and compared the album to Harry Belafonte's calypso recordings of the same era.|$|E
500|$|Finances were tight: {{the record}} label Gull {{provided}} a recording budget of £2000 {{for each of}} the band's first two albums. [...] During the recording of Sad Wings of Destiny, band members restricted themselves to one meal a day, and several took on part-time work: Tipton as a gardener, Downing in a factory, and Hill driving a delivery van. [...] The group went into the studio with the intention of making an album that mixed <b>straight-ahead</b> rock with a progressive edge.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} studio fire, Schlesinger and Chase {{discussed}} trying out new genres for the album, incorporating influences from {{different types of}} music. Schlesinger stated: [...] "The first songs [...] recorded were jangly and simple and <b>straight-ahead.</b> We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy stuff. It works well with Dominique's voice". However, while tracks like [...] "Edge of the Ocean" [...] experimented with new music like trip hop, [...] "Lucy Doesn't Love You" [...] reflected Ivy's previous material.|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the song, Adam Schlesinger and Chase played {{around with the}} idea of incorporating new genres into their music; in an interview with Billboard, Ivy stated, [...] "The first songs [...] recorded were jangly and simple and <b>straight-ahead.</b> We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy stuff. It works well with Dominique's voice". With the exploration, Ivy began crafting [...] "stronger" [...] songs, that were less atmospheric than those on their previous studio album, Apartment Life (1997), but contained more [...] "infectious melodies".|$|E
500|$|On review {{aggregator}} site Rotten Tomatoes, The Getaway has an 85% {{approval rating}} based on 20 surveyed critic; {{the average is}} 7/10. Much of the praise is directed to the film's plot, citing its action sequences and ruthless characters. Rotten Tomatoes also ranked it [...] 46 on their [...] "75 Best Heist Movies of All Time". In 2010, The Getaway was among the 25 heist films considered an all-time favorite by IndieWire; of the film, the site remarked that it is [...] "a solid, <b>straight-ahead</b> action flick that's always fun to wander {{into the middle of}} on late night TV".|$|E
500|$|Rachel Dratch, Fey's {{longtime}} comedy {{partner and}} fellow SNL alumna, was originally cast to portray Jenna. Dratch {{played the role}} in the show's original pilot, but in August 2006, Jane Krakowski was announced as Dratch's replacement, with Dratch remaining involved in the show playing various characters. Fey explained the change by noting that Dratch was [...] "better-suited to playing a variety of eccentric side characters", which was suitable when the show intended to feature actual sketches from TGS with Tracy Jordan. However, {{this aspect of the}} show was scrapped, thus they required more of a <b>straight-ahead</b> acting part for the role of Jenna.|$|E
500|$|As Bob Thiele intended, {{the next}} of Coltrane's {{releases}} featured the hard bop form of playing, incorporating influences from rhythm and blues, gospel music, and the blues, {{especially with the}} saxophone and piano, and <b>straight-ahead</b> ballads and standards. Ballads, recorded in late 1961 and 1962, was at first criticized as predictable and too simple after the aggressiveness Coltrane displayed on his previous recordings, but was later reevaluated favorably, {{by some as a}} masterpiece. On Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, Ellington [...] "sat in" [...] with the John Coltrane Quartet for a set dominated by the pianist's songs. Some performances had Ellington's usual sidemen, bassist Aaron Bell and drummer Sam Woodyard, replacing Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones in the group.|$|E
500|$|Peter Lawrence {{described}} Jonny as a [...] "hero in training" [...] on {{the cusp}} of adulthood. He remarked that Jonny possessed [...] "a <b>straight-ahead,</b> right-on attitude" [...] free of introspection or self-doubt. At age 14, Jonny was a confident problem-solver prone to getting in trouble. Writers framed him as more an intuitive thinker than an intellectual, and created tension by contrasting his father's academic leanings with Jonny's affinity for Race's daring lifestyle. Jonny inherited his father's driving curiosity (rendering him a [...] "walking query"), as well as his mother's [...] "restless, adventurous spirit". Takashi designed Jonny to be lean, wiry, athletic, and coordinated. Creative directors centered episodes around Jonny; Seibert summarized the shift: ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Apartment Life (1997), Ivy began work on a new studio album; however, the band was dropped by their label, Epic Records, shortly after the reissue of Apartment Life was released. After the end of their {{contract}} with Epic, and lead singer Dominique Durand's pregnancy, the New York City studio where Ivy regularly recorded music burned down. In order to forget about these events, Ivy resumed recording sessions, and began incorporating influences from new wave. Member Adam Schlesinger detailed the album's exploration of different genres: [...] "The first songs [...] recorded were jangly and simple and <b>straight-ahead.</b> We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy stuff. It works well with Dominique's voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Aerosmith {{recorded}} [...] "Baby, Please Don't Go" [...] {{for their}} blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which {{was released on}} March 30, 2004. The album was produced by Jack Douglas, who had worked on the group's earlier albums, and reflects a return to their hard rock roots. Billboard magazine describes the song as [...] "the kind of <b>straight-ahead,</b> hard-driving track that always typified the band's [...] records". Edna Gundersen of USA Today called their version a [...] "terrific revival." [...] It was the first single {{to be released from}} the album and reached number seven on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. A music video, directed by Mark Haefeli, was produced to promote the single. Subsequently, the song has become a staple of the band's concert repertoire.|$|E
500|$|Another {{example of}} Manne's ability {{to transcend the}} narrow borders of any {{particular}} school is the series of trio albums he recorded with guitarist Barney Kessel and bassist Ray Brown as [...] "The Poll Winners". (They had all won numerous polls conducted by the popular publications of the day; the polls are now forgotten, but the albums endure, now reissued on CD.) Manne even dabbled in Dixieland and fusion, as well as [...] "Third Stream" [...] music. He participated in the revival of that jazz precursor ragtime (he appears on several albums devoted {{to the music of}} Scott Joplin), and sometimes recorded with musicians best associated with European classical music. He always, however, returned to the <b>straight-ahead</b> jazz he loved best.|$|E
500|$|N.E.R.D {{produced}} a remix featuring Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and Pusha T, which was available as an iTunes and Zune Marketplace bonus track with {{the purchase of}} Seeing Sounds. When asked why the song was remixed, Hugo replied with, [...] "We wanted something with more of a <b>straight-ahead,</b> club-bumping beat, just a different take on it. We like to remix, dismantle, take apart shit {{and put it back}} together. It's just like a Rubik's Cube: When you can't solve it, you just break it and you put it back together." [...] Williams added, [...] "We think that 'Everyone Nose' in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way, so I just wanted to go and do something different." ...|$|E
500|$|Bringing {{elements}} of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less [...] "dangerous" [...] styles, new wave artists became very popular {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a <b>straight-ahead</b> punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone [...] "beyond punk before punk even properly existed". New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation. However, the music was often derided at the time as being silly and disposable.|$|E
500|$|Standing [...] {{tall and}} {{weighing}} , Perry was small {{for a typical}} fullback, even during his era. Also unlike typical fullbacks, Perry's forte was not to run with power, but rather he was a <b>straight-ahead</b> runner who combined power and speed with deceptive elusiveness. His role was primarily as a ball carrier rather than a blocker, {{and he had a}} knack for finding holes in opposing defensive lines. [...] "If you saw a hole, you take it," [...] Perry described his running style to The Sacramento Bee. [...] "If you didn't, you kept moving until you did. You run with instinct." [...] Perry was known for his speed, which earned him the nickname [...] "The Jet". He ran the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds in 1947, two-tenths of a second slower than Mel Patton's then-world record of 9.3 seconds.|$|E
500|$|While Presley {{performed}} {{several of}} his classic ballads for the '68 Comeback Special, {{the sound of the}} show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He would record few new <b>straight-ahead</b> rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they were [...] "hard to find". A significant exception was [...] "Burning Love", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. Much of Elvis In Memphis, as well as [...] "Suspicious Minds", cut at the same sessions, reflected his new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Eighteen" [...] comes {{between two}} <b>straight-ahead</b> rockers: [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] and album opener [...] "Caught in a Dream". [...] Both follow simple hard-rock , trading heavy riffing with guitar fills and solos. [...] The album title derives from lyrics in [...] "Long Way to Go". [...] "Caught in a Dream" [...] was the album's second single and {{features}} irreverent, tongue-in-cheek lyrics such as [...] "I need everything the world owes me/ I {{tell that to}} myself and I agree". [...] The first side closes with [...] "Black Juju" [...] by bassist Dunaway, a lengthy track in the vein of The Doors, and Pink Floyd's [...] "Interstellar Overdrive"—both bands Alice Cooper earlier had opened for—with an organ part derived from Pink Floyd's [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". [...] The band named the song after a stray dog in Pontiac.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, he {{recorded}} Silver 'n Brass, {{the first of}} five Silver 'n albums, which had other instruments added to the quintet. The personnel in his band continued to change, and continued to contain young musicians who made telling contributions. One of these was trumpeter Tom Harrell, who stayed from 1973 to 1977. Silver's pattern in the late 1970s was to tour for six months a year. His final Blue Note album was Silver 'n Strings, recorded in 1978 and 1979. His stay was the longest in the label's history. By Silver's account, he left Blue Note after its parent company was sold and the new owners {{were not interested in}} promoting jazz. In 1980, he formed the record label Silveto, [...] "dedicated to the spiritual, holistic, self-help elements in music", he commented. Silver also formed Emerald at the same time, a label for <b>straight-ahead</b> jazz, but it was short-lived.|$|E
500|$|Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic gave {{a mostly}} {{positive}} {{review of the}} album, commenting that [...] "fans of Arjona's <b>straight-ahead</b> rock style are sure to be disappointed with much of 5to Piso, as piano and strings drive much of the music rather than the electric guitar and drums of years past." [...] Billboards Leila Cobo, on her review of the album, commented that the singer had [...] "an uncanny knack for marrying sophisticated lyrics with catchy hooks and mass-appeal messages", stating that songs like [...] "Ni Tu Ni Yo", a duet with Paquita la del Barrio, [...] "underscores how universal" [...] his songs and themes are, [...] "even in the most regional arrangements." [...] 5to Piso received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Album and a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Singer-Songwriter Album though lost to Sin Frenos and Caetano Veloso respectively.|$|E
500|$|Scott-Heron's {{characteristic}} {{sound on}} the album {{is rooted in the}} blues, jazz, and soul music. He referred to his mellow fusion of style as [...] "bluesology, the science of how things feel." [...] Scott-Heron's and Jackson's compositions for Winter in America incorporate elements of African music, heavy percussion, and chants. They also feature scene-setting, spoken word intros and mystical interludes, which were influenced by the free jazz stylings of contemporary artists such as Pharoah Sanders and Abdullah Ibrahim. Jackson wrote arrangements that tended to be more <b>straight-ahead</b> material, incorporating classic jazz bridges in his compositions. Scott-Heron, as the main lyricist and vocalist, exhibited more pop sensibilities with his compositions and created indelible hooks that were influenced by the black popular music of the time. By combining their distinct approaches to composing, Scott-Heron and Jackson produced a multicultural, diffused sound that evoked the afrobeat and world music style of artists such as Fela Kuti during the African music scene's popularity.|$|E
500|$|The {{band had}} grown {{dissatisfied}} with Gull; the tight finances led Moore {{to leave the}} band a second time—this time permanently. [...] The album {{caught the attention of}} , {{and with the help of}} new manager David Hemmings, the band signed with CBS and received a £ budget for their next record, Sin After Sin (1977). [...] Downing described how the disappointed feelings the group had over Gull's management influenced the dark themes that appeared on Sad Wings of Destiny. [...] The signing required breaking their contract with Gull, resulting in the rights to the first two albums and all related recordings—including demos—becoming property of Gull. [...] Gull periodically repackaged and re-released the material from these albums, such as on the 1981 double album Hero, Hero. [...] For the most part, the band was to abandon the progressive rock elements of their first two albums for a more <b>straight-ahead</b> heavy rock sound; the band revisited these progressive elements in 2008 on the album Nostradamus.|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 interview, Joel {{dismissed}} {{criticism of}} unclear elements in their films: [...] "People {{have a problem}} dealing {{with the fact that}} our movies are not <b>straight-ahead.</b> They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, but I feel like there’s so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That’s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I’d have with {{me for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
