5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group led by Garth Motherloving and Mr. Burns to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to dump the cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge and press the button Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar, jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset and <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> giving up changing the world. However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E
25|$|Sarah is {{the female}} {{half of the}} lizard couple, the mate of Leslie. Like her mate, Sarah is {{cautious}} and fearful around the humans. Yet like Nancy, she is curious about them and tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on {{what he should do}} and what <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also emphasizes the importance of contact.|$|E

50|$|The song's narrator asks {{a former}} lover if <b>she</b> still <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> him, and <b>she</b> says {{every once in}} a while. In reality <b>she</b> {{constantly}} <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> their old relationship and wants to return to the way things were.|$|R
50|$|In {{the movie}} Gone with the Wind, how did Hattie McDaniel live—in {{the big house}} or the slaves' quarters? What did <b>she</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the civil war? These were all {{questions}} I wanted answers to.|$|R
500|$|An 'It Girl' to me {{is someone}} who is selfless, someone who's always {{thinking}} about others before <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> herself. You know, my mom is a very charitable woman, so I'd want someone who {{is in line with}} that kind of thought process. I also like a girl who's polite. I feel like that's a lost art, and just saying 'please' and 'thank you' goes a very long way with me. That's just so lost these days. So, ladies, it's OK to say 'thank you.' ...|$|E
500|$|Hoping {{to divert}} {{herself from the}} grief of Cazale's death, Streep {{accepted}} a role in The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979) as the chirpy love interest of Alan Alda, later commenting that she played it on [...] "automatic pilot". She performed the role of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew for Shakespeare in the Park, and also played a supporting role in Manhattan (1979) for Woody Allen. Streep later said that Allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes, and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue. In the drama Kramer vs. Kramer, Streep was cast opposite Dustin Hoffman as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child. Streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as [...] "too evil" [...] and insisted {{that it was not}} representative of real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles. The makers agreed with her, and the script was revised. In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a wife with a career, and frequented the Upper East Side neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions between parents and children. The director Robert Benton allowed Streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman, who [...] "hated her guts". Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, [...] "She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> nothing else but what she's doing." [...] The film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic Stephen Farber believed displayed Streep's [...] "own emotional intensity", writing that {{she was one of the}} [...] "rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery".|$|E
2500|$|In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau {{noted the}} album's less caustic sound but praised Love's songwriting: [...] "Punk {{aesthetic}} or no punk aesthetic, Courtney Love's songs wouldn't be compromised {{and might be}} deepened by steeper momentum and more articulate guitar noise. But they prevail anyway. Their focus is sexual exploitation, and not just by the media, evil straights, and male predators of every cultural orientation. She's also exploited by Courtney Love, and not only does she know it, <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
50|$|McCallie is the {{daughter}} of a Navy pilot, born in Monterey, CA and raised in Florida, New York, Texas, Rhode Island, and finally Maine, where her parents and family still live. Fred Koerber, her high school coach, {{was the first person to}} suggest that <b>she</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> coaching someday, but it was years later at Auburn before she acted on the suggestion.|$|R
50|$|In 1942 {{the editor}} of The Sunday Telegraph, Cyril Pearl, {{was looking for a}} new strip to replace Mary and Elizabeth Durack's Nungulla and Jungalla. Journalist, Bob Slessor, {{suggested}} to O'Brien that <b>she</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> coming up with something. Her idea was a girl in the armed services, Pearl liked the samples and asked her to prepare a strip for the paper.|$|R

2500|$|The Progressive Conservatives won a {{landslide}} majority {{government in the}} 1984 federal election under Brian Mulroney, defeating the Liberals under their new leader John Turner. Blaikie was again returned for his riding, and was appointed as NDP Environment Critic in the new parliament. He opposed the Mulroney government's budget cuts and was strongly critical of Environment Minister, Suzanne Blais-Grenier, saying, [...] "It is clear she does not think about the environment. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the deficit." [...] He called for Blais-Grenier's resignation in June 1985, after she remarked that national parks could be opened to mining and logging. In the same year, Blaikie brought forward a private member's bill calling for a three-year moratorium on the construction and export of nuclear power stations, {{to be followed by}} a national referendum on any further development.|$|E

"It won't do the Captain any good," [...] thought Bungay, {{going back}} to his desk and accounts, [...] "but Mrs. B. becomes reglar upset when <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> her misfortune. The child would have been of age yesterday, if she'd lived. Flora told me so:" [...] and he {{wondered}} how women did remember things.|$|E
60|$|So! All {{is broken}} down. Her name is in these many mouths, her husband knows his wrongs, her shame will be published--may be {{spreading}} while <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> it--and {{in addition to}} the thunderbolt so long foreseen by her, so unforeseen by him, she is denounced by an invisible accuser as the murderess of her enemy.|$|E
6000|$|Verrian {{answered}} with light cynicism: [...] "It will be tainted {{with the pain}} of the fellows who don't like me, or who haven't succeeded, and they'll take care to let me share their pain if ever they can. But if you mean that merry maiden up country, she's probably thinking, if <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> it at all, that she's the luckiest girl in the United States to have got out of an awful scrape so easily. At the worst, I only had fun with her in my letter. Probably she sees that she has nothing to grieve for but her own break." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes,--why not? Why {{should you}} be {{different}} from other mothers? Why should I not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it as other fathers might do? It is impossible. I wish it were not. For Mary's sake, I wish he were {{three or four years}} older. But he is as he is, and we know that it is impossible. Nevertheless, it is natural that <b>she</b> should <b>think</b> <b>about</b> him. I only hope that <b>she</b> will not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> him too much." [...] So saying he closed the conversation for that night.|$|R

5000|$|The {{story begins}} as Ruby Hill, {{a woman who}} has lately been {{suffering}} from minor illness, enters the door of her apartment building after shopping at the grocery store. Ruby begins to work her way up the stairs to her apartment, stopping frequently to catch her breath. Along the way she reflects on aspects of her life, including her younger brother Rufus, who has recently returned from fighting in the European Theater and is now living with Ruby and her husband. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> disparagingly <b>about</b> her brother, and his failure to change much from their rural upbringing. <b>She</b> also <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> her husband, Bill Hill, a salesman for [...] "Miracle Products" [...] who has seemed particularly happy lately; about her age of 34; and about her general dislike for children. When she sits down on a step to catch her breath she accidentally sits on a toy pistol, which she recognizes as belonging to Hartley Gilfeet, an unruly six-year-old boy who lives in the building. <b>She</b> also <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> Madam Zoleeda, a fortune teller who has recently read her palm and claimed that [...] "a long illness" [...] would lead to [...] "a stroke of good fortune." ...|$|R
60|$|Why the deuce should Mrs. Botibol blow me a kiss? I wouldn't {{kiss her}} for the world. Why do I grin when I see her, as if I was delighted? Am I? I don't care a straw for Mrs. Botibol. I know what <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> me. I know what she said about my last volume of poems (I had it from a dear mutual friend). Why, I say in a word, are we going on ogling and {{telegraphing}} each other in this insane way?--Because we are both performing the ceremonies demanded by the Great Snob Society; whose dictates we all of us obey.|$|E
6000|$|... "That may be," [...] replied Croft, {{speaking}} a little warmly. [...] "None of us exactly {{know what she}} thinks or wishes. But I {{want to find out}} what <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> me by distinctly asking her. And I should suppose you would consider it to your advantage, as well as mine, that I should do so." [...] "I have my own opinion on that point," [...] said Keswick, [...] "which it is not necessary to discuss at present. If I were to assist you to an interview with Miss March it would be on the lady's account, not on yours or mine.

If the storm were not of snow, but of fire--such as came refreshingly down on the cities of the plain--she would go through it to procure five minutes' speech of that Moore. Now, I {{consider}} I have had a pleasant morning. The disappointments got time on; the fears and fits of anger only made that short discourse pleasanter, when it came at last. She expected to coax me at once. She'll not manage that in one effort. She shall come again, again, and yet again. It would please me {{to put her in}} a passion--to make her cry. I want to discover how far she will go--what she will do and dare--to get her will. It seems strange and new to find one human being thinking so much about another as <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> Moore. But it is time to go home; my appetite tells me the hour. Won't I walk into that goose? and we'll try whether Matthew or I shall get the largest cut of the apple-pie to-day." ...|$|E

60|$|Only {{second to}} the wedding morning, in the {{interest}} and expectation it engenders among the household, is this evening of the coming home. Mrs Perch is in the kitchen taking tea; and has made the tour of the establishment, and priced the silks and damasks by the yard, and exhausted every interjection in the dictionary and out of it expressive of admiration and wonder. The upholsterer's foreman, who has left his hat, with a pocket-handkerchief in it, both smelling strongly of varnish, under {{a chair in the}} hall, lurks about the house, gazing upwards at the cornices, and downward at the carpets, and occasionally, in a silent transport of enjoyment, taking a rule out of his pocket, and skirmishingly measuring expensive objects, with unutterable feelings. Cook is in high spirits, and says give her a place where there's plenty of company (as she'll bet you sixpence there will be now), for she is of a lively disposition, and she always was from a child, and she don't mind who knows it; which sentiment elicits from the breast of Mrs Perch a responsive murmur of support and approbation. All the housemaid hopes is, happiness for 'em--but marriage is a lottery, and the more <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> it, the more she feels the independence and the safety of a single life. Mr Towlinson is saturnine and grim' and says that's his opinion too, and give him War besides, and down with the French--for this young man has a general impression that every foreigner is a Frenchman, and must be by the laws of nature.|$|E

Penny apologizes once again, saying that <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> that night every single day. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> what Meredith said to her and how she needed to be better.
