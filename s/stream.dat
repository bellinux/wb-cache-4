5000|$|Three {{kinds of}} <b>streams</b> are formed by headward erosion: insequent <b>streams,</b> {{subsequent}} <b>streams,</b> and obsequent and resequent <b>streams</b> (See Fluvial landforms of <b>streams.)</b> Insequent <b>streams</b> form by random headward erosion, usually from sheetflow of {{water over the}} landform surface.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines <b>streaming</b> media both as {{a technological}} innovation and cultural practice that co-configures audience and industry. Strategies and tactics provide a theoretical framework for understanding <b>streaming</b> media. <b>Streaming</b> is theorized as a tactic; wherein audiences momentarily buck against the strategic logic of media conglomerates and copyright regimes. However, <b>streaming,</b> concomitantly, is an audience tactic and a strategic logic of an emergent <b>streaming</b> industry. This results in the blurring between first and third party and sanctioned and unsanctioned <b>streaming.</b> In this dissertation, I parse out what are the nascent <b>streaming</b> logics within this burgeoning industry and how they constitutively shape and re-shape audiences and traditional broadcasting logics. Five typologies of <b>streaming</b> serve as conceptual tools for deepening our understanding of <b>streaming</b> media and technology. The first is <b>streaming</b> as a recent technological advancement, divided into software and hardware categories. The second conceptual framework is a typology of <b>streaming</b> that divides <b>streaming</b> into first and third party sanctioned and unsanctioned <b>streaming.</b> The third is <b>streaming</b> as an emergent industry. The fourth is <b>streaming</b> as a discourse, and the final typology divides <b>streaming</b> based on geography as transnational <b>streaming,</b> national <b>streaming,</b> and diasporic <b>streaming.</b> All of these classifications {{lay the groundwork for}} the further conceptualization of this important and emergent socio-technical practice...|$|R

40|$|Plasma and {{magnetic}} field observations of interplanetary <b>streams</b> near 1 AU are summarized. Two types of <b>streams</b> {{have been identified}} - corotating <b>streams</b> and flare-associated, and other flow patterns are present due to interactions among <b>streams.</b> The theory of corotating <b>streams,</b> which attributes them to a high temperature region near the sun, satisfactorily explains many of the effects observed at 1 AU. A correspondingly complete theory of flare-associated <b>streams</b> does not exist. <b>Streams</b> are a key link in the chain that connects solar and geomagnetic activity.

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet <b>stream</b> {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States.

During the Dust Bowl, the jet <b>stream</b> weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
