2500|$|Born Henry D. Neuman in {{northern}} Germany, he immigrated to New York {{with his family}} as a child. Having a respectable middle class upbringing, it is unknown motivations {{that led him to}} pursue a criminal career. He was involved in petty theft as a teenager, referred to as [...] "The Flying Dutchman", and was associated with the Greenthals and the Mandlebaums. In 1860, he was arrested after stealing a watch from a man at the corner of Broadway and Canal Street, presumably his first criminal act, 08 May 1873 for which he was convicted and spent two years in New York State Prison. During his time in prison, he became friends with noted bond robber Chauncey Johnson and joined his gang upon his release. He eventually became his chief lieutenant and was involved in numerous robberies with the gang including $16,000 from the Adam Express Company, $21,000 from the Vesey <b>Street</b> <b>robbery</b> and, most notably, the theft of $1,000,000 in bonds from industrialist Rufus L. Lord. Other participants in the robbery included Jack Tierney and Hod Ennis. 28 Nov 1872 ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001 Brixton became {{subject of}} {{newspaper}} headlines {{due to the}} implementation of a pilot cannabis programme, also known as the [...] "softly softly" [...] approach, initiated by Brian Paddick, then Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth. Police officers were instructed not to arrest or charge people who were found to be in possession of cannabis. They were instead to issue on-the-spot warnings and confiscate the drugs. Although Paddick is credited with the idea, the pilot programme was sanctioned by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Sir John Stevens. Paddick asserts that he implemented the policy because he wanted his officers to deal with cannabis quickly and informally so that they could concentrate on heroin and crack cocaine offences, and <b>street</b> <b>robbery</b> and burglary, which were affecting {{the quality of life in}} Lambeth to a greater extent. The pilot was ended December 2005 and was replaced by a so-called [...] "no deal" [...] policy on cannabis in Brixton following complaints about increasing numbers of dealers openly selling the drug.|$|E

60|$|This {{new style}} of <b>street</b> <b>robbery</b> {{must have been}} quite profitable, for of course {{the boy in the}} basket was well instructed, and never {{snatched}} at a shabby hat or a poor looking wig.

6000|$|The city of Dublin, at {{the time}} Swift wrote, was {{on a par with}} some [...] of the lower districts of New York City about twenty years ago, [...] which were {{dangerous}} in the extreme to traverse after dark. Robbers [...] in gangs would waylay pedestrians and leave them often badly [...] maltreated and maimed. These thieves and [...] "roughs" [...] became so [...] impudent and brazen in their business that the condition of the [...] city was a disgrace to the municipal government. To put down the [...] nuisance Swift took a characteristic method. Ebenezer Elliston had, [...] about this time, been executed for <b>street</b> <b>robbery.</b> Although given a [...] good education by his parents, he forsook his trade of a silk [...] weaver, and became a gambler and burglar. He was well known to the [...] other gangs which infested Dublin, but his death did not act as a [...] deterrent. Swift, in composing Elliston's pretended dying speech, [...] gave it the flavour and character of authenticity in order to [...] impose on the members of other gangs, and so successful was he in [...] his intention, that the speech was accepted as the real expression [...] of their late companion by the rest and had a most salutary effect. [...] Scott says it was [...] "received as genuine by the banditti who had been [...] companions of his depredations, who were the more easily persuaded [...] of its authenticity as it contained none of the cant usual in the [...] dying speeches composed for malefactors by the Ordinary or the [...] ballad-makers. The threat which it held out of a list deposited [...] with a secure hand, containing their names, crimes, and place of [...] rendezvous, operated {{for a long time in}} preventing a repetition of [...] their villanies, which had previously been so common." ...|$|E

60|$|When the Hertford <b>Street</b> <b>robbery</b> {{was three}} days old, {{and was still}} the talk of all the town, Lizzie Eustace was really ill. She had promised {{to go down to}} Scotland in {{compliance}} with the advice given to her by her cousin Frank, and at the moment of promising would have been willing enough to be transported at once to Portray, had that been possible--so as to be beyond the visits of policemen and the authority of lawyers and magistrates; but as the hours passed over her head, and as her presence of mind returned to her, she remembered that even at Portray she would not be out of danger, and that she could do nothing in furtherance of her plans if once immured there. Lord George was in London, Frank Greystock was in London, and Lord Fawn was in London. It was more than ever necessary to her that she should find a husband among them,--a husband who would not be less her husband when the truth of that business at Carlisle should be known to all the world. She had, in fact, stolen nothing. She endeavoured to comfort herself by repeating to herself {{over and over again that}} assurance. She had stolen nothing; and she still thought that if she could obtain the support of some strong arm on which to lean, she might escape punishment for those false oaths which she had sworn. Her husband might take her abroad, and the whole thing would die away. If she should succeed with Lord George, of course he would take her abroad, and there would be no need for any speedy return. They might roam among islands in pleasant warm suns, and the dreams of her youth might be realised. Her income was still her own. They could not touch that. So she thought, at least,--oppressed by some slight want of assurance in that respect. Were she to go at once to Scotland, she must for the present give up that game altogether. If Frank would pledge himself to become her husband in three or four, or even in six months, she would go at once. She had more confidence in Frank than even in Lord George. As for love,--she would sometimes tell herself that she was violently in love; but she hardly knew with which. Lord George was certainly the best representative of that perfect Corsair which her dreams had represented to her; but, in regard to working life, she thought that she liked her cousin Frank better than she had ever yet liked any other human being. But, in truth, she was now in that condition, as she acknowledged to herself, that she was hardly entitled to choose. Lord Fawn had promised to marry her, and to him as a husband she conceived that she still had a right. Nothing had as yet been proved against her which could justify him in repudiating his engagement. She had, no doubt, asserted with all vehemence to her cousin that no consideration would now induce her to give her hand to Lord Fawn;--and when making that assurance she had been, after her nature, sincere. But circumstances were changed since that. She had not much hope that Lord Fawn might be made to succumb,--though evidence had reached her before the last robbery which induced her to believe that he did not consider himself to be quite secure. In these circumstances she was unwilling to leave London though she had promised, and was hardly sorry to find an excuse in her recognised illness.|$|E

40|$|The near-repeat {{phenomenon}} {{refers to}} the increased risk of repeat victimization {{not only at the}} same location but at nearby locations up to a certain distance and for a certain time period. In recent research, near-repeat victimization has been repeatedly confirmed for different crime types such as burglaries or shootings. In this article the near-repeat phenomenon is analyzed for each day of the week separately. That is, the near-repeat pattern is evaluated for all consecutive Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, etc. included in the dataset. These consecutive weekdays represent the fictive set of consecutive dates to allow for spatial and temporal analysis of crime patterns. Using these principles, it is hypothesized that <b>street</b> <b>robberies</b> cluster in space and time and by the same day of the week. This research analyzes <b>street</b> <b>robberies</b> from 2009 to 2013 in Vienna, Austria. The overall research goal investigates whether near-repeat patterns of robberies exist by weekdays and in an additional step by time of day, and whether these near-repeat patterns differ from each other and from purely spatial patterns. The results of this research confirm the existence of near-repeat patterns by weekday and especially by time of day. Distinctive locations have been identified that differ greatly per weekday and time of day. Based on this information, law enforcement agencies in Austria can optimize strategic planning of police resources in combating robberies...|$|R
