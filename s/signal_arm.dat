25|$|In {{semaphore}} areas, junctions are signalled using {{a series}} of between 2 and 5 stop signal arms on one bracket or gantry, known as splitting signals. Each arm (usually) has its own post ("doll") on the bracket, and each arm applies to one possible route. The relative heights of the dolls usually convey some information about the lines to which they apply, {{although there is no}} definite standard. In some cases, the tallest doll applies to the highest-speed route; in others, it applies to what the railway considered the most important route. Traditionally, splitting distant signals would be provided – {{a series of}} side-by-side distant signals telling the driver which doll on the following stop signal was off; but practice since the 1920s has erred towards providing just one distant which is locked at caution if a large speed reduction is necessary. Drivers of trains must know which <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> applies to which route, and the speed limit on that route; accidents have resulted from drivers either mis-reading splitting signals or forgetting speed restrictions, and consequently approaching junctions too fast.|$|E

50|$|The {{operating}} {{mechanism of the}} system was located {{at the bottom of}} the mast in the observation room of the station. The indicators were operated with six adjustable levers arranged above each other in pairs. The position of each lever corresponded to the three-level alignment of the <b>signal</b> <b>arms</b> on the mast above. The levers and <b>signal</b> <b>arms</b> were connected by hemp ropes and later by wire cables. The levers each were lockable in four different positions, that exactly corresponded to the position of <b>signal</b> arm: 0° (<b>arm</b> hanging downward parallel to the mast), 45°, 90° (perpendicular to the mast), and 135°. Each position was relative to the mast.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, states began to specify a {{mechanical}} stop <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> which the driver would swing {{out from the}} left side of the bus to warn traffic of a stop in progress. The portion of the stop arm protruding in front of traffic was initially a trapezoidal shape with [...] painted on it. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 131 regulates the specifications of the stop arm as a double-faced regulation octagonal red stop sign at least 45 cm across, with white border and uppercase legend. It must be retroreflective and/or equipped with alternately flashing red lights. As an alternative, the [...] legend itself may also flash; this is commonly achieved with red LEDs. FMVSS 131 stipulates that the stop <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> be installed on {{the left side of the}} bus, and placed so that when it is extended, the arm is perpendicular to the side of the bus, with the top edge of the sign parallel to and within 6 in of a horizontal plane tangent to the bottom edge of the first passenger window frame behind the driver's window, and that the vertical center of the stop <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> must be no more than 9 in from the side of the bus. One stop <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> is required; a second may also be installed. The second stop arm, when it is present, is usually mounted near the rear of the bus, and is not permitted to bear a [...] or any other legend on the side facing forward when deployed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{illustration}} (right) shows a Bavarian distant signal. In the 'caution' aspect it {{displays a}} round disc. The disc had a diagonally-oriented hinge in the centre. On changing from the 'warning' aspect (Vr 0) to the 'clear' aspect (Vr 101 or 102) both {{halves of the}} disc folded to the rear, so that, in their place, a <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> appeared pointing up and to the right. Because this movement looked like a butterfly closing its wings, the Bavarian distant signal was called the [...] "butterfly signal" [...] (Schmetterlingssignal). Until 1922, the disc was green with a white border and white dot in the centre; thereafter it was orange with a white border. The <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> and signal mast were also green and white until 1922; then red and white.|$|E

50|$|The {{shape of}} the trafficator arm is closely based upon the {{shape of the}} {{semaphore}} <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> used by the Royal Bavarian Railway beginning in 1890.

5000|$|During the 1870s, all the British railway {{companies}} standardised {{on the use}} of semaphore signals, {{which were}} then invariably all of the lower quadrant type. From the 1920s onwards, upper quadrant semaphores almost totally supplanted lower quadrant signals in Great Britain, except on former GWR lines. The advantage of the upper quadrant signal is that should the signal wire break, or the <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> be weighed down by snow (for instance), gravity will tend to cause the signal to drop to the safe [...] "danger" [...] position. In a lower quadrant signal, the opposite may happen, sending the signal to [...] "off" [...] when in fact it should be illustrating [...] "danger". Their spectacle cases, which are {{on the opposite side of}} the spindle on which the <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> is pivoted, are therefore required to be sufficiently heavy to prevent this happening.|$|E

50|$|At night (or in poor {{visibility}} in daytime) an oil lamp displayed a white light when the signal was at 'all clear'; when the <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> {{moved to the}} horizontal “danger” position it brought a red lens {{in front of the}} light, so that a red light was then displayed to oncoming trains. In {{poor visibility}}, GNR regulations called for detonators to be laid if possible on the track at the home signal when this was set to danger; at stations where platelayers were available, this should also be done at the distant signals.|$|E

As the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited has only one {{locomotive}} (apart from the short service of Juggernaut), Bluebell is sometimes called upon to provide motive power. Examples include the towing by chain of the broken down locomotive Juggernaut and also the pulling of Mrs Porty's donkey cart when this was temporarily set on the railway tracks to pursue 'robbers' when Ivor had been 'stolen' in the episode The Lost Engine; in this latter case, like a locomotive, Bluebell strictly observed the railway signals, halting the chase until Owen the Signal had raised the <b>signal</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first railway {{semaphore}} signals had arms {{that could be}} worked to three positions, in the lower quadrant. Used {{in conjunction with the}} time-interval system, the arm horizontal meant [...] "danger", inclined downwards at 45 degrees meant [...] "caution" [...] and the arm vertical (arm hidden within the post) meant [...] "clear". The vertical indication gradually came to be discontinued as the absolute block system superseded time-interval working. The Great Northern Railway was the first company to introduce [...] "somersault" [...] signals, mounted away from the post, after an accident in January 1876 when a train passed a signal giving a false [...] "clear" [...] aspect because the <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> had frozen into its slot during a blizzard.|$|E
5000|$|Canadian {{school buses}} {{are similar to}} their U.S. {{counterparts}} {{both in terms of}} overall design and their usage by school systems. The primary functional difference is the adaptation to the bilingual population of Canada. In francophone Quebec, the signage {{on the outside of the}} bus is in French; the front and rear legends read [...] "—French for [...] "Schoolchildren" [...] ("School Bus" [...] translated into French is the much longer [...] ""). The stop <b>signal</b> <b>arm</b> legend may read , French for [...] "Stop", or may have both [...] "" [...] and [...] "". In addition, all emergency exit designations and instructions are required to be bilingual. Further safety requirements may be introduced at a provincial or even local level; for example, some coastal jurisdictions where fog is common insist on buses being fitted with roof-mounted strobe lights for use in poor visibility.|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} details linking integrin {{engagement to}} downstream cortactin (Ctn) tyrosine phosphorylation are largely unknown. In this report, we {{show for the}} first time that Fer and Ctn are potently tyrosine phosphorylated in response to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in a variety of cell types. Working with catalytically inactive fer and src/yes/fyn-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (ferDR/DR and syf MEF, respectively), we observed that H 2 O 2 -induced Ctn tyrosine phosphorylation is primarily dependent on Fer but not Src family kinase (SFK) activity. We also demonstrated {{for the first time}} that Fer is activated by fibronectin engagement and, in concert with SFKs, mediates Ctn tyrosine phosphorylation in integrin signaling pathways. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers or the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium, attenuated integrin-induced Fer and Ctn tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings provide novel genetic evidence that a ROS-Fer <b>signaling</b> <b>arm</b> contributes to SFK-mediated Ctn tyrosine phosphorylation in integrin signaling. Lastly, a migration defect in ferDR/DR MEF suggests that integrin signaling through the ROS-Fer-Ctn <b>signaling</b> <b>arm</b> may be linked to mechanisms governing cell motility. These data demonstrate for the first time an oxidative link between integrin adhesion and an actin-binding protein involved in actin polymerization...|$|R
