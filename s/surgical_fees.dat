40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2003. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 12 - 14). The {{problem of}} companion animal overpopulation in the United States {{is a serious}} issue wrought with multifaceted barriers {{standing in the way}} of complete elimination. This paper will focus on surgical sterilization as one means to control over-population. Recent studies estimate that 3 to 4 million cats are euthanized annually and these numbers do not include those unwanted animals that are left to starve or to die of trauma or exposure. One of the main reasons cited for relinquishment of animals to a humane society (36. 4 %) was that the animals were from an unwanted litter. Traditionally, shelters across the country have adopted animals out with contracts mandating that new owners spay or neuter their pets. Studies have shown that there is less than 60 % compliance with this mandate, despite preadoption screening, prepayment of <b>surgical</b> <b>fees,</b> reduced <b>surgical</b> <b>fees,</b> neuter contracts, and follow up activity by shelter personnel. Even in those households that do comply, it can be estimated that many of those cats may wander outside prior to gonadectomy to make their contribution to the overpopulation problem. Just a single pair of cats may be the progenitors of 174, 760 kittens in 7 years even if they and their offspring are not allowed to reproduce at full potential. Dr. Leslie Appe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cataract {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} {{blindness}} worldwide. Despite the high therapeutic efficacy of cataract surgical interventions, surgical uptake has been sub‑optimal, especially in low ‑ and middle‑income countries. Objective: The objective was to investigate the effect of <b>surgical</b> <b>fee</b> reduction on the uptake of cataract surgical services at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Enugu. Methods: In a retrospective comparative study, all patients who underwent cataract surgery at UNTH between January 2008 and December 2011 were identified from the eye theatre’s surgical logbook. Their clinical charts were recalled and relevant demographic and clinical data were abstracted, categorized into pre (January 2008 to December 2009, Group A), and post (January 2010 to December 2011, Group B) <b>surgical</b> <b>fee</b> reduction groups. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were performed. Results: A total of 376 cataract surgeries (Group A, 164 [43. 6 %]; Group B, 212 [56. 4 %]) was performed during the 4 ‑year study period. The surgeries were performed on 217 males, and 159 females aged 55. 4 ± 23. 4 standard deviation years (range, 7 months to 89 years). The average annual uptake of cataract surgery was 94 overall, 82 pre and 106 postsurgical fee reductions. The two groups did not differ significantly by age (P = 0. 8750) or gender (P = 0. 8337). Conclusion: There is low uptake of cataract surgery at UNTH Enugu. Direct <b>surgical</b> <b>fee</b> reduction alone caused only a modest increase in uptake without alteration in age and gender balance. Further fee reduction and exploration of other uptake barriers are warranted...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{evaluates the}} impact of {{surgical}} fee reductions under Medicare on the utilization of surgical services. DATA SOURCES. Medicare physician claims data were obtained from 11 states for a five-year time period (1985 - 1989). STUDY DESIGN. Under OBRA- 87, Medicare reduced payments for 11 surgical procedures. A fixed effects regression method {{was used to determine}} {{the impact of}} these payment reductions on access to care for potentially vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries: joint Medicaid-eligibles, blacks, and the very old. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS. Medicare claims and enrollment data were used to construct a cross-section time-series of population-based surgical rates from 1985 through 1989. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Reductions in <b>surgical</b> <b>fees</b> led to small but significant increases in use for three procedures, small decreases in use for two procedures, and no impact on the remaining six procedures. There was little evidence that access to surgery was impaired for potentially vulnerable enrollees; in fact, declining fees often led to greater rates of increases for some subgroups. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that volume responses by surgeons to payment changes under the Medicare Fee Schedule may be smaller than HCFA's original estimates. Nevertheless, both access and quality of care should continue to be closely monitored...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) {{and characteristics of}} VBAC births are investigated using 1980 - 85 National Hospital Discharge Survey Data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. Only 3. 4 per cent of mothers with previous cesarean delivery had VBAC in their subsequent 1980 delivery; this increased to 6. 6 per cent in 1985. Because VBAC is a relatively infrequent event, 1980 - 85 data were combined and indicate that in this period 4. 9 per cent of mothers with previous cesarean had a vaginal birth in their subsequent delivery. Combined 1980 - 85 VBAC rates are under 10 per cent for all age, race, marital status, region, hospital size, hospital ownership, and expected source of payment groups. Between 1980 and 1985, over 1. 4 million repeat cesareans were performed for mothers having a live birth. Evidence suggests that potentially over 500, 000 of these repeat cesareans could have been VBACs (over and above the 74, 000 VBACs which occurred). VBAC mothers' mean length of hospital stay is 3. 2 days, which compares closely with 3. 0 days for other vaginal deliveries, but both contrast sharply with 5. 6 days for repeat cesareans and 6. 0 days for primary cesareans. Except for the uterine scar from the previous cesarean, VBAC mothers appear to have about the same history and frequency of complications as mothers with other vaginal deliveries. If the 500, 000 repeat cesareans had been VBACs, <b>surgical</b> <b>fees</b> and costs for 1. 2 million days of hospital stay would have been averted over the 1980 - 85 period...|$|E
40|$|Background Tonsillectomy is a {{very common}} {{operation}} and is performed using various surgical methods. Coblation is a popular method because it purportedly causes less pain than other surgical methods. However, the superiority of coblation is unproven. Objectives To compare the effects of coblation tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy with other surgical techniques, both hot and cold, on intraoperative morbidity, postoperative morbidity and procedural cost. Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 3); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials. gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 April 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children and adults undergoing tonsillectomy with coblation compared with any other surgical technique. This review is limited to trials of extracapsular (traditional) tonsillectomy and excludes trials of intracapsular tonsil removal (tonsillotomy). Data collection and analysis We used the standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: patient-reported pain using a validated pain scale at postoperative days 1, 3 and 7; intraoperative blood loss; primary postoperative bleeding (within 24 hours) and secondary postoperative bleeding (more than 24 hours after surgery). Secondary outcomes were: time until resumption of normal diet, time until resumption of normal activity, duration of surgery and adverse effects including blood transfusion {{and the need for}} reoperation. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. Main results We included 29 studies, with a total of 2561 participants. All studies had moderate or high risk of bias. Sixteen studies used an adequate randomisation technique, however the inability to mask the surgical teams and/or provide adequate methods to mitigate the risk of bias put nearly all studies at moderate or high risk of detection and measurement bias for intraoperative blood loss, and primary and secondary bleeding. In contrast most studies (20) were at low risk of bias for pain assessment. Most studies did not report data in a manner permitting meta-analysis. Most studies did not clearly report the participant characteristics, surgical indications or whether patients underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Most studies reported that tonsillitis (infection) and/or tonsillar hypertrophy (obstruction) were the indication for surgery. Seven studies included only adults, 16 studies included only children and six studies included both. Pain At postoperative day 1 there is very low quality evidence that patients in the coblation group had less pain, with a standardised mean difference (SMD) of - 0. 79 (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 1. 38 to - 0. 19; 538 participants; six studies). This effect is reduced a SMD of - 0. 44 (95 % CI - 0. 97 to 0. 09; 401 participants; five studies; very low-quality evidence) at day 3, and at day 7 there is low quality evidence of little or no difference in pain (SMD - 0. 01, 95 % CI - 0. 22 to 0. 19; 420 participants; five studies). Although this suggests that pain may be slightly less in the coblation group between days 1 and 3, the clinical significance is unclear. Intraoperative blood loss Methodological differences between studies in the measurement of intraoperative blood loss precluded meta-analysis. Primary and secondary bleeding The risk of primary bleeding was similar (risk ratio (RR) 0. 99, 95 % CI 0. 48 to 2. 05; 2055 participants; 25 studies; low-quality evidence). The risk of secondary bleeding was greater in the coblation group with a risk ratio of 1. 36 (95 % CI 0. 95 to 1. 95; 2118 participants; 25 studies; low-quality evidence). Using the median of the control group as the baseline risk, the absolute risk in the coblation group was 5 % versus 3. 6 % in the control group. The difference of 1. 3 % has a 95 % CI of 0. 2 % lower in the coblation group to 3. 5 % higher. Secondary outcomes Differences in study design and data reporting precluded the identification of differences in the time to resumption of normal diet or activity, or whether there was a difference in the duration of surgery. Although we could not feasibly compare the costs of equipment or operative facility, anaesthetic and <b>surgical</b> <b>fees</b> across different healthcare systems we used duration of surgery as a proxy for cost. Although this outcome was commonly reported in studies, {{it was not possible to}} pool the data to determine whether there was a difference. Adverse events other than bleeding were not well reported. It is unclear whether there is a difference in postoperative infections or the need for reoperation. Authors' conclusions The coblation technique may cause less pain on postoperative day 1, but the difference is small and may be clinically meaningless. By postoperative day 3, the difference decreases further and by postoperative day 7 there appears to be little or no difference. We found similar rates of primary bleeding but we cannot rule out a small increased risk of secondary bleeding with coblation. The evidence supporting these findings is of low or very low quality, i. e. there {{is a very}} high degree of uncertainty about the results. Moreover, for most outcomes data were only available from a few of the 29 included studies. The current evidence is of very low quality, therefore it is uncertain whether or not the coblation technique has any advantages over traditional tonsillectomy techniques. Despite the large number of studies, failure to use standardised or validated outcome measures precludes the ability to pool data across studies. Therefore, well-conducted RCTs using consistent, validated outcome measures are needed to establish whether the coblation technique has a benefit over other methods. In the included studies we identified no clear difference in adverse events. However, given the rarity of these events, randomised trials lack the power to detect a difference. Data from large-scale registries will provide a better estimate of any difference in these rare outcomes...|$|E

Some practices also bundle a set duration of post-operative follow-up visits for filling and unfilling the gastric band as necessary (e.g., as many fills/unfills as necessary for anywhere from 3 to 13 months following surgery, depending on the practice), which as a stand-alone service cost between $15 and $300 per office visit.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Local steroid {{injections}} {{and community-based}} physiotherapy {{have been shown}} to be of similar benefit for treating shoulder pain presenting to primary care. This paper presents a cost consequences analysis of a prospective economic evaluation, conducted alongside a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of corticosteroid injections versus physiotherapy for new episodes of unilateral shoulder pain, to determine the economic implications of injection versus physiotherapy. METHODS: A pragmatic RCT with 207 patients randomized to either physiotherapy (n = 103) or local steroid injection (n = 104) was conducted. The resource inputs required were identified for each treatment arm in terms of capital, staff and consumables. These were measured for the period up to 6 months post-randomization. Outcome measures included shoulder disability, shoulder pain, global assessment of health change and the EQ 5 D, all at 6 months. A sensitivity analysis was performed around the general practitioner minor <b>surgical</b> <b>fee.</b> RESULTS: Analysis is presented on the 199 patients for which the general practice record review (101 physiotherapy, 98 injection) was available. The total mean costs, per patient, were 71. 28 pound sterling for the injection group and 114. 60 pound sterling for the physiotherapy group. The difference in average total cost per patient was 43. 32 pound sterling (95 % bootstrap confidence interval: 16. 21 pound sterling, 68. 03 pound sterling). This is a statistically significant difference in cost. Outcome was similar in both groups across all measures following intervention. Smaller mean differences in cost were observed between the treatment groups in the sensitivity analysis, but the difference remained in favour of injection over physiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown, given similar clinical outcomes across the treatment groups, that corticosteroid injections were the cost-effective option for patients presenting with new episodes of unilateral shoulder pain in primary care...|$|R
