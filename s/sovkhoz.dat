Bordiga's writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy, in contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists, also focused on the agrarian sector.

In particular, he emphasized how much of the national agrarian produce came from small, privately owned plots (writing in 1950) and predicted the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914.|$|E

Facing one of the main German thrusts {{in the area of the}} Ponyri 2 <b>sovkhoz,</b> the 75th Guards helped repulse the attack, positioned in the second defensive belt. [...] On 6 July, the second day of the battle, the 70th and 75th Guards, supported by the 9th and 16th Tank Corps, attacked the 2nd Panzer Division, positioned between Bobrik and Saborovka, [...] from its start line. In fierce fighting, the 2nd Panzer managed to slightly expand its bridgehead over the Svapa River. At Ponyri, the 75th Guards' 84th Separate Guards Anti-Tank Battalion was attacked by Tiger tanks, but managed to claim five Panzer IVs with its 45 mm anti-tank guns. At 19:30, German tanks and infantry attacked into the division's flank and rear west of Snova after pushing the 6th Guards Rifle Division back. The 75th Guards speedily regrouped and repulsed the German attack, destroying up to 30 tanks according to Soviet reports. On 7 July the German attacks at Ponyri 2 continued, with an attack by thirty tanks and infantry from the 9th Panzer Division achieving a limited advance against the 75th Guards by 17:00.

5000|$|Omolon was the {{headquarters}} for the <b>sovkhoz</b> (state farm) Omolon until 1992 Prior to 1992, the <b>Sovkhoz</b> had 15 separate herds of reindeer under its control. From 1992 onwards, the <b>Sovkhoz</b> structure was dismantled bit by bit {{in line with the}} wider course of Russian privatisation. Previously, the <b>Sovkhoz</b> had been in control of all of the major community services, such as power, education, health and other functions, which were now administered individually at rural settlement or district administrative level. Four of the 15 brigades split from the former <b>Sovkhoz</b> and formed their own private enterprise and those remaining formed a limited liability company called TOO [...] "Omolon". This privatisation was not a success. Where previously the <b>Sovkhoz</b> had controlled the settlements economy and its associated facilities, by 1998 there were nine separate entities involved in the same work and the number of reindeer held by the brigades had fallen from nearly 34,000 to just over 9,000.|$|E

[...] One brigade decided to work independently of the <b>sovkhoz,</b> took a portion of the land, and struck out on their own, although the brigadier is now back with the main farm, since it proved too difficult to barter for supplies with the other three brigades. The remaining few families withdrew from the tundra completely and focused on establishing local farms. Those who remained in one of the two groups tending the reindeer on the tundra were generally related to those families who had originally owned the reindeer prior to the establishment of the <b>sovkhoz</b> and almost all those still involved in reindeer herding in Snezhnoye have family ties which keep them in the region.|$|E
