5|$|Despite {{his father}} {{saying he was}} betrayed by his friend C. W. McAllister during their climb on the mountain, Homer accepts and is aided by two Sherpas, but fires them after waking up one night to find them {{secretly}} dragging him up. Realizing he lacks the strength and resources to reach the top, Homer enters a cave to find McAllister's frozen body and evidence proving it was Abraham who betrayed him. Tired and ashamed, Homer <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> flag pole on the ledge. The ensuing crack collapses {{the rest of the}} mountain, making where he is on now the peak. Proud, he uses McAllister's body to sled down, where he is greeted by the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Walter Skinner's (Mitch Pileggi) office, Mulder {{begins to}} doubt once more {{that they are}} free at all, asking Scully to name any sort of drug that causes its effects to halt once users know they are hallucinating. Scully is in disbelief until Mulder proves his point by {{shooting}} Skinner in the chest; the yellow substance oozes out of the bullet wounds. Once again, their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again in the cave. Mulder <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> hand through the earth ceiling as Skinner {{and a team of}} rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out and haul them to the safety of an ambulance.

5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama {{tries to}} track her down using her résumé, but as Yoshikawa warned, {{all of the}} {{contacts}} are dead ends. At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E

Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E

25|$|Both the {{temperature}} and the moisture content of the mound are critical to the survival {{and development of the}} eggs, so both are carefully regulated for {{the entire length of the}} breeding season (which may last for as long as eight months), principally by the male. Ornithologists believe that megapodes may use sensitive areas in their mouths to assess mound temperatures; each day during the breeding season, the male digs a pit into his mound and <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> head in. If the mound's core temperature is a bit low, he adds fresh moist material to the mound, and stirs it in; if it is too high, he opens the top of the mound to allow some of the excess heat to escape. This regular monitoring also keeps the mound's material from becoming compacted, which would inhibit oxygen diffusion to the eggs and make it more difficult for the chicks to emerge after hatching. The malleefowl, which lives in more open forest than do other megapodes, uses the sun to help warm its nest as well—opening the mound at midday during the cool spring and autumn months to expose the plentiful sand incorporated into the nest to the sun's warming rays, then using that warm sand to insulate the eggs during the cold nights. During hot summer months, the malleefowl opens its nest mound only in the cool early morning hours, allowing excess heat to escape before recovering the mound completely. One recent study showed that the sex ratio of Australian brushturkey hatchlings correlated strongly with mound temperatures; females hatched from eggs incubated at higher mean temperatures.|$|E
500|$|During his {{coaching}} career, Rymkus was renowned for his strictness. While with the Oilers, he repeatedly threatened to whip his players. He {{could also be}} melodramatic. He once repeated a speech Leahy gave at Notre Dame before a practice in a blizzard. He told his players during a hot August in Houston to be [...] "like the Great Northern Buffalo, whose coat is shaggy and whose muscles are strong. The Great Northern Buffalo <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> head into the wind and braves the cold, not like the puny Southern Buffalo, who turns {{his back to the}} storm." ...|$|E
500|$|On the Smashing Pumpkins album Zeitgeist and {{subsequent}} tour, Chamberlin used a Yamaha Maple Custom Absolute kit with 60 (instead of standard 45) degree bearing edges. His kit {{consisted of two}} snares (5x12 and the main snare, his 5.5x14 [...] "Signature" [...] model – Yamaha SD-2455JC), six toms (12x14, 8x10, 9x13, and an 8x8 above his floor toms which are 16x16 and 16x18), a 16x22 bass drum, four crash cymbals (a 15" [...] thin and three Zildjian A customs – 15", 18", and 19"), an 8" [...] splash cymbal, 15" [...] New Beat hi-hats, a 20" [...] China High, a 22" [...] K Constantinople medium ride, and a 22" [...] riveted swish knocker.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: [...] "Hans is a little Dutch boy, {{the son of a}} poor fisherman. He, like all children of Holland, is early impressed {{with the fact that the}} safety of the whole community depends on the strength of the dike. He is sent upon an errand to his aunt late one evening. Walking along the foot of the dike, he discovers a tiny hole, through which the water is pouring. Realizing that if left to flow through even this small aperture, the water would soon break down the dike and flood the village, he <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> tiny finger in the hole, and waits for someone to come to his assistance. Night comes on. His family decided he has stayed with his aunt, and do not worry about him. In the morning he is found almost unconscious from fatigue and exposure, by his little sister who has been searching for him. She runs back and notifies the villagers, who come to his assistance, repair the dike, and carry the little hero back to the village in triumph. He is received by the burgomaster and praised by the minister. By his night's heroism he has made himself a place in history, and will always be known as 'the little hero of Holland.'" ...|$|E
