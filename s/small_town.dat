40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION {{of people in}} {{developing}} countries live in <b>small</b> <b>towns.</b> <b>Small</b> <b>towns</b> often require more elaborate forms of water supply systems than villages, such as pipe networks. In addition, as villages are growing into rural growth centres and <b>small</b> <b>towns,</b> the transition of appropriate management of watsan and the institutional set up proves difficult, consequently many of the <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> have relatively low levels of water and sanitation services. Until recently, <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> have been largely ignored in terms of new investments in water supply and sanitation. Where investment has been made, deterioration of services occurs soon after commissioning, possibly because proper arrangements were not made for operations and maintenance of the systems, or because inappropriate management options were adopted. Low levels of water and sanitation services contribute to the poor economic growth in many <b>small</b> <b>towns,</b> thus hindering poverty reduction efforts in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>towns</b> internationally and in South Africa are {{becoming}} increasingly marginalised, and they are often experiencing economic downturn, demographic shifts and a rearticulation of {{their role in the}} urban hierarchy. In the case of South Africa many of these <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> are also faced with low levels of social development. The urgent need to address such conditions is evident by the fact that {{a large proportion of the}} South African population resides in <b>small</b> <b>towns,</b> and their surrounding hinterlands. This said, there are examples of <b>small</b> <b>towns,</b> internationally and in South Africa which, through the use of various Local Economic Development actions, have managed to remain sustainable, and in some cases become economically viable localities once again. In light of the above, the research conducted for this thesis seeks first to establish the socio-economic changes occurring over time in three <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, namely Stutterheim, Bedford and Hamburg. Secondly, the research aims to identify the nature of LED activities in the three <b>small</b> <b>towns,</b> highlighting those factors contributing to the success of LED initiatives as well as those factors inhibiting LED in <b>small</b> <b>towns.</b> This is done with the intention of developing future lessons for LED in <b>small</b> <b>towns.</b> The research was conducted using a mix of qualitative and quantitative data generated through the interviews with key role players in each town, as well as secondary data sources. Findings from the research suggest that the <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> investigated are characterised by low levels of socio-economic development. In addition, it appears that the development opportunities for the towns are limited. Current initiatives are being driven by private role players with local government being largely uninvolved. Such initiatives are limited in nature, with benefits only felt by small groups of the local community. However, examples do exist of where LED has successfully benefited the broader spheres of the local community, thus suggesting that if implemented properly such an approach does have potential to assist in the socio-economic development of <b>small</b> <b>towns.</b> In light of this, a number of lessons are identified for LED in <b>small</b> <b>towns,</b> including the need for strong leadership, community involvement, partnerships between role players, and planning for project sustainability...|$|R
40|$|The {{urbanisation}} programme instigated by the Romans as they {{conquered the}} western provinces {{resulted in a}} network of chartered towns and numerous slighter settlements, popularly titled 'small towns'. Much research has focussed on {{the wide range of}} sites encompassed by the term 'small town'; Burnham's work has provided a framework for analysing these sites, based on settlement morphology and functions. Concentrating on the evidence of <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> alone can answer many questions about appearance, development, functions and complexity, but cannot indicate the audiences at which a wide range of activities was aimed. This thesis concentrates on the <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> of the East Midlands, using existing analytical frameworks to establish a hierarchy, and testing this by exploring the nature and strength of relations with neighbouring settlements. <b>Small</b> <b>towns</b> are placed in their landscape, and evaluated as administrative, regional, local market and service centres. Investigation is carried out in three stages: (i) detailed comparative analysis of the <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> alone; (ii) comparing small town-country relations, selecting a sample area of fixed size around each small town; (iii) assessment of the region as a whole, placing <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> in regional economic, administrative and religious networks. The balance of current academic opinion is that <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> served as local socio-economic centres. However, this thesis shows that few <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> In the East Midlands developed into market centres, the rest being more satisfactorily explained as rural, rather than central, places. Moreover, not all specialist production in some <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> need have been aimed at the locality, but a more distant market. Although many <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> originated as sites of specialist production, or were religious or administrative centres, one cannot assume that their continued existence relied on the evolution of local trade and exchange networks centred upon them...|$|R
