50|$|Despite {{the game}} obtaining mostly {{positive}} reviews, a major <b>source</b> of <b>complaints</b> {{came from the}} saving system. Players are allowed to save their progress once every four races. Since the game requires the player to always finish in first place in order to progress further into the game, this means players needed to win four races in a row before saving their progress.|$|R

5|$|According to the Arab chroniclers, the {{realization}} of Egypt's vulnerability from the sea led, after {{a long period of}} neglect, to the urgent strengthening of Egypt's maritime defences by Governor Anbasah. Within nine months of the raid, Damietta was refortified along with Tinnis and Alexandria. Various works were undertaken at Rosetta, Borollos, Ashmun, at-Tina, and Nastarawwa. Ships were constructed and new crews were raised. Most seamen were forcibly conscripted from among the Copts and the Arabs of the interior, earning Anbasah a bad reputation in contemporary <b>sources.</b> <b>Complaints</b> against him were directed to Caliph al-Mutawakkil. Later Arabic sources like al-Maqrizi and Coptic sources confirm that the new fleet was used in raids against the Byzantines in subsequent years, although no details are recorded. This activity is generally held to have marked the rebirth of the Egyptian navy. Under the Tulunid dynasty (868–905) it numbered 100 ships and reached its peak later under the Fatimids (969–1171).|$|R

50|$|Emissions {{from the}} station {{in the form of}} {{particulates}} are a frequent <b>source</b> of pollution <b>complaints</b> in the neighbourhood and region, and in the 1990s, NSPI funded a $32 million project to install filters to limit the escape of pollutants.|$|R
50|$|Disorders of the {{conjunctiva}} and cornea are {{a common}} <b>source</b> of eye <b>complaints,</b> in particular because {{the surface of the}} eye is exposed to various external influences and is especially susceptible to trauma, infections, chemical irritation, allergic reactions and dryness.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the main}} protests of nuncio Valerio Valeri against the Vichy racial {{legislation}} {{was that there was}} no provision for conversion to Christianity written into the law. Morley notes that the effect on converts was the sole basis for Vatican protests: [...] "any governmental attitude that did not recognize the rights of the Church was a <b>source</b> of <b>complaint</b> by the Vatican. There is no basis for suggesting that any of the other provisions gave occasion for complaint".|$|R
50|$|Antenna farms {{have often}} been the <b>source</b> of <b>complaints</b> from local neighborhoods, {{particularly}} when a new tower is added. This has been increasingly so for TV stations, which have been pursuing with alacrity {{the construction of new}} digital television antennas. Because many of these towers are already full, or were built well before there was the expectation of DTV, many stations have been forced to go through the even greater expense of constructing a new tower.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} 1850s, {{the output of the}} Fife {{coalfield}} expanded considerably, {{and a great deal of}} the mineral went for export from east coast ports. Chief among these was Burntisland, expanded from its original role as a simple ferryport. Congestion there became a major <b>source</b> of <b>complaint,</b> and late in 1860 a major expansion of the dock facilities was commissioned. A sheltered dock area of 20 acres had been provided at a cost of £10,000.|$|R

50|$|On July 11, 2002, Morocco {{stationed}} six gendarmes on Perejil Island, {{which was}} at the time a <b>source</b> of <b>complaint</b> by Spain.

The Spanish Navy and Spanish Air Force provided support; the six Moroccan navy cadets did not offer any resistance and were captured and evicted from the island. It has since been evacuated by both countries.|$|R
500|$|Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes {{received}} similar praise, {{with particular}} attention given towards the large cast {{and the addition}} of three-on-three combat. The Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions were criticized for their lack of online multiplayer support outside Japan. These concerns were addressed with the release of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 ports, which reviewers commended for their smooth online experience.

50|$|Mining {{towns in}} 19th-century Colorado had often been {{built by the}} miners {{themselves}} out of whatever material they could find and assemble in their spare time. Often these wound up being log cabins covered with rock and dirt. The companies had to provide other public services due to the remoteness of many camps, but did nothing to provide living quarters. In the labor unrest of the era, the shabby and unsafe housing, which miners often shared with their families, were a frequent <b>source</b> of <b>complaint.</b>|$|R

50|$|This station {{does not}} have any {{disabled}} access due to the narrowness of the island platform; this is the <b>source</b> of many <b>complaints.</b> Installation of lift access would require platform widening, which would in turn require widening of the tunnel, requiring massive alteration to the buildings adjacent.|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of the income tax is an unending <b>source</b> of <b>complaint.</b> Compliance costs have received increasing attention and {{are estimated to be}} large. Yet most recognize that some degree of complexity is necessary if ability to pay is to be measured accurately. This article presents a framework for analyzing the value of greater accuracy in income taxation. Formulations for both distributive and incentive benefits of accuracy are offered. The question whether taxpayers have excessive or inadequate incentives to acquire information about taxable income and to challenge tax assessments is also examined. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the time}} of Bishop Wilson {{it had been a}} {{constant}} <b>source</b> of <b>complaint</b> among the Manx clergy that they were the only church in Christendom that had no version of the Bible in the vulgar tongue. Wilson set to work to remedy the defect, and, with the assistance of some of his clergy, managed to get some of the Bible translated, and the Gospel of St. Matthew printed. Bishop Hildesley, his successor, {{with the help of the}} whole body of Manx clergy, completed the work, and in 1775 the whole Bible was printed.|$|R

50|$|Critics {{reject the}} ban on driving on the grounds that: (1) it is not {{supported}} by the Quran, (2) it causes violation of gender segregation customs, by needlessly forcing women to take taxis with male drivers, (3) it is an inordinate financial burden on families, causing the average woman to spend half of her income on taxis and (4) it impedes the education and employment of women, both of which tend to require commuting. In addition, male drivers are a frequent <b>source</b> of <b>complaints</b> of sexual harassment, and the public transport system is widely regarded as unreliable and dangerous.|$|R
40|$|Uterine {{pathology}} {{represents one}} of the most common <b>sources</b> of <b>complaints</b> in women. It may cause pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding or problems related to infertility. On the other hand, endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy. Pelvic ultrasound has been demonstrated as an excellent tool for diagnosing uterine pathology. In this review, we shall summarize the role of this technique for diagnosing uterine pathologies, such as uterine congenital anomalies, myoma and sarcoma, adenomyosis, benign endometrial pathology and endometrial cancer. We shall also address new technologies, such as 3 D ultrasound, and the future prospects of this ever-evolving technique...|$|R
50|$|Izzet Ahmed Pasha {{was the son}} of Hakkı Mehmed Pasha (1747-1811), a {{prominent}} bureaucrat, vizier, and statesman of the time, and reportedly counted the 16th-century statesman Sokollu Mehmed Pasha as among his ancestors. While posted in Baghdad, he married the daughter of Ali Rıza Pasha, Baghdad's governor. When his father-in-law was dismissed from the governorship of Baghdad, the decree that dismissed him cited Izzet Ahmed Pasha as a <b>source</b> of <b>complaints</b> against alleged abuses of his father-in-law's administration, most likely pointing to a fallout or disagreement between the two, or a political plot against Ali Rıza Pasha by his son-in-law.|$|R
5000|$|The Denes were an {{extensive}} beach {{area on the}} east side of the walled town. Townsmen let their animals roam here.
