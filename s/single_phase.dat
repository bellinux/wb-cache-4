40|$|The {{reaction}} kinetics of acrolein oxidation over various oxidic catalysts have been investigated. The phases were employed as both pure <b>single</b> <b>phases</b> and mixtures of the <b>single</b> <b>phases.</b> It could {{be shown that}} copper molybdate {{in combination with the}} active phase (Mo-V-Oxide) improves the selectivity of acrylic acid formation. Simultaneously to the concentration profiles the course of the oxygen activity in a typical catalyst for acrylic acid formation (Mo-V-Cu-Oxide) could be determined 'in situ' along a tubular fixed-bed reactor by use of the solid electrolyte potentiometry (SEP).

25|$|When one {{substance}} is dissolved into another, a solution is formed. This {{is opposed to}} the situation when the compounds are insoluble like sand in water. In a solution, all of the ingredients are uniformly distributed at a molecular level and no residue remains. A solvent-solute mixture consists of a <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> with all solute molecules occurring as solvates (solvent-solute complexes), as opposed to separate continuous phases as in suspensions, emulsions {{and other types of}} non-solution mixtures. The ability of one compound to be dissolved in another is known as solubility; if this occurs in all proportions, it is called miscible.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{three phase}} {{induction}} motor is a popularly used machine {{in many of}} the industries, which is well known for its robustness, reliability, cost effectiveness, efficient and safe operation. The unnoticed manufacturing failure, mistakes during repair work, exceeding life time may be some of the causes of the induction motor failure, which may lead to the unknown shut down time of the industry. The condition monitoring plays important role as it has the influence on the production of materials and profit. In our work, the induction motor is modelled using stationary reference frame and analysed for <b>single</b> <b>phasing</b> stator fault. The techniques used in detecting the <b>single</b> <b>phasing</b> (open circuit) failures are Park’s vector approach and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Park’s vector approach is used for detecting the faults occurring at various phases and FFT is used for detecting the faults of the induction motor working under no load and varying loading conditions...|$|R

We present here comparative results of the crystal structure formation and dielectric properties of the materials studied at room temperature. The crystalline structure of the <b>single</b> <b>phased</b> samples is cubic spinel phase with space group Fd 3 m. The alloying of two spinel oxides (i. e., Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 3 O 4) is also complemented from FTIR spectrum. Impedance spectroscopy suggested only one semi circle in the Cole-Cole plot of mechanical milled samples, which indicated the dominant grain boundary contribution in the conduction mechanism. In addition to the grain boundary contribution, the electrical conduction from grains is also substantial in the <b>single</b> <b>phased</b> compositions of the present material.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{microstructure}} and texture evolution of a Ti- 5 Al- 5 Mo- 5 V- 3 Cr alloy during cold rolling and annealing treatments. Three samples with different initial microstructures were cold rolled to a 40 % reduction in thickness. The starting microstructure of one sample was <b>single</b> β <b>phase</b> while two other specimens were α+β phases with different α particle sizes, distributed in β grains. For all three samples, the average size of primary β grains was 150 µm. The cold rolled specimens were then annealed at 860 °C (10 °C above the β transus temperature) for 5 minutes followed by water quenching. Microstructure development during cold rolling and recrystallization was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. Microstructure investigations showed that massive amount of shear bands occurred during the cold rolling of the <b>single</b> β <b>phase</b> sample while only a few shear bands were observed in the α+β cold rolled microstructures. The cold rolled texture of the sample comprised of a <b>single</b> β <b>phase</b> contains a gamma fibre (//ND) and a partial alpha fibre (//RD). Annealing treatment decreased {{the intensity of the}} cold rolled texture in the <b>single</b> β <b>phase</b> sample. Also, {{it was found that the}} presence of α precipitates changes the common annealing texture observed in the <b>single</b> β <b>phase</b> specimen...|$|R
25|$|Whereas {{ordinary}} mechanics only {{considers the}} behaviour {{of a single}} state, statistical mechanics introduces the statistical ensemble, which is a large collection of virtual, independent copies of the system in various states. The statistical ensemble is a probability distribution over all possible states of the system. In classical statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over phase points (as opposed to a <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> point in ordinary mechanics), usually represented as a distribution in a phase space with canonical coordinates. In quantum statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over pure states, and can be compactly summarized as a density matrix.|$|E

Another Spore title for the DS called Spore Hero Arena was released in 2009. Spore Origins is the mobile phone/iPhone/iPod spinoff of Spore, and as with the Nintendo DS version, focuses on a <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> of gameplay; in this case, the cell phase.

25|$|The {{fraction}} {{of water that}} an ethanol-gasoline fuel can contain without phase separation increases with the percentage of ethanol. For example, E30 can have up to about 2% water. If {{there is more than}} about 71% ethanol, the remainder can be any proportion of water or gasoline and phase separation does not occur. The fuel mileage declines with increased water content. The increased solubility of water with higher ethanol content permits E30 and hydrated ethanol to be put in the same tank since any combination of them always results in a <b>single</b> <b>phase.</b> Somewhat less water is tolerated at lower temperatures. For E10 it is about 0.5% v/v at 70 F and decreases to about 0.23% v/v at −30 F.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{different}} coefficients of thermal expansion of aluminium and silicon, high residual stresses of second order occur in Al-Si alloys depending on the cooling rate during the molding process. In products as for example crank cases made of Al-Si alloys these residual stresses may cause microcracks. In the work at hand measurements of the eigenstresses in the <b>single</b> <b>phases</b> (i. e. residual stresses of second kind) performed via neutron diffractometry are compared to numerical simulations for a specific cooling rate. To this end a three-phase model is presented, which considers the α aluminium, the eutectic aluminium, and the silicon particles. The presented model is able to predict the residual stresses in the <b>single</b> <b>phases</b> within an elastoplastic framework. The simulation of tensile loadings of these structures are compared to experiments.

25|$|AC {{traction}} still occasionally uses dual {{overhead wires}} instead of <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> lines. The resulting three-phase current drives induction motors, {{which do not}} have sensitive commutators and permit easy realisation of a regenerative brake. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss rack railways. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the two-phase lines are problematic.|$|E
25|$|Casting {{and then}} {{machining}} plutonium is difficult {{not only because}} of its toxicity, but also because plutonium has many different metallic phases. As plutonium cools, changes in phase result in distortion and cracking. This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with 30-35 mMol (0.9–1.0% by weight) gallium, forming a plutonium-gallium alloy, which causes it to take up its delta phase over a wide temperature range. When cooling from molten it then has only a <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> change, from epsilon to delta, instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through. Other trivalent metals would also work, but gallium has a small neutron absorption cross section and helps protect the plutonium against corrosion. A drawback is that gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to plutonium dioxide for power reactors, there is the difficulty of removing the gallium.|$|E
