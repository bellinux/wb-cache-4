Take off, landing or pass by operations can be modeled by INM, {{but it does not}} consider aircrafts taxiing, which, in some cases, can be important to accurately evaluate and reduce airports' noise assessment. Aircraft taxiing noise emission can be predicted using other prediction tools based on standards that describe sound attenuation during propagation outdoors. But these tools require data inputs that are not known: directivity and <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels</b> emitted by aircraft during taxiing. This paper describes methods used to calculate directivity indexes and <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels,</b> based on field measurements made in Madrid-Barajas Airport (Spain).

40|$|Refinements {{have been}} made to a method for {{estimating}} the modal <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels</b> of a ducted fan ingesting distorted inflow. By assuming that each propagating circumferential mode consists only of a single radial mode (the one with the highest cut-off ratio), circumferential mode <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels</b> can be computed for a variety of inflow distortion patterns and operating speeds. Predictions from the refined theory have been compared to data from an experiment conducted in the Advanced Noise Control Fan at NASA Glenn Research Center. The inflow to the fan was distorted by inserting cylindrical rods radially into the inlet duct. The rods were placed at an axial location one rotor chord length upstream of the fan and arranged in both regular and irregular circumferential patterns. The fan was operated at 2000, 1800, and 1400 rpm. Acoustic pressure levels were measured in the fan inlet and exhaust ducts using the Rotating Rake fan mode measurement system. Far field sound pressure levels were also measured. It is shown that predicted trends in circumferential mode <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels</b> closely match the experimental data for all operating speeds and distortion configurations tested. Insight gained through this work is being used to develop more advanced tools for predicting fan inflow distortion tone noise levels...|$|R

5000|$|An {{important}} woofer specification is {{its power}} rating, {{the amount of}} power the woofer can handle without damage. The electrical power rating is not easily characterized and many manufacturers cite peak ratings attainable only for very brief moments without damage. Woofer power ratings become important when the speaker is pushed to extremes: applications requiring high output, amplifier overload conditions, unusual signals (i.e., non-musical ones), very low frequencies at which the enclosure provides little or no acoustic loading (and {{so there will be}} maximum cone excursion), or amplifier failure. In high-volume situations, a woofer's voice coil will heat up, increase its resistance, causing [...] "power compression", a condition where output <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>level</b> decreases after extended high power activity. Further heating can physically distort the voice coil, causing scuffing, shorting due to wire insulation deterioration, or other electrical or mechanical damage. Sudden impulse energy can melt a section of voice coil wire, causing an open circuit and a dead woofer; the necessary level will vary with driver characteristics. In normal listening level music applications, the electrical power rating of woofers is generally unimportant; it remains important for higher frequency drivers.|$|E

[...] "Signal passes through both the channels at an equal volume while the pan pot points directly north." [...] If the two output buses are later recombined into a monaural signal, then a pan law of -6 dB is desirable. If the two output buses are to remain stereo then a law of -3 dB is desirable. A law of −4.5 dB at center is a compromise between the two. A pan control fully rotated to one side results in the source being sent at full strength (0 dB) to one bus (either {{the left or right}} channel) and zero strength (− dB) to the other. Regardless of the pan setting, the overall <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>level</b> remains (or appears to remain) constant.

This low-distortion manifold design made it possible for EV to produce its first high-power concert and touring loudspeaker: the MT-4, with [...] "MT" [...] standing for [...] "Manifold Technology". This was a 4-way system split between two enclosures, with four speaker drivers summed in each bandpass; a total of 16 drivers. The upper two bandpasses used the Gunness manifold design for compression drivers, each manifold formed of two zinc castings. The medium low frequencies were carried by four 10 in cone drivers summed using a larger embodiment of the Gunness manifold concept based on ray tracing and reflection. The MT-4 was a very heavy system at 633 lb, but it put more power into a smaller package, and it was quicker to position and connect. The MT-4 proved popular, used on major tours and festivals such as the 1995 Monsters of Rock at Donington Park in central England and the main stage of the 1996 Lollapalooza tour featuring Metallica and Soundgarden. Together, EV engineer David Carlson and Gunness presented a paper to the Audio Engineering Society (AES) in November 1986, describing the methods they used to sum four drivers in each bandpass.|$|E

This code was used to predict the circumferential and radial mode <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels</b> in the inlet and exhaust duct of an axial spacecraft cabin ventilation fan.

Noise predictions indicate that tones are produced for the distorted inflow cases that are not present when the fan operates with an undistorted inflow.
