50|$|For light {{aircraft}} {{a type of}} landing gear which is economical to produce is a simple wooden arch laminated from ash, as used on some homebuilt aircraft. A similar arched gear is often formed from spring steel. The Cessna Airmaster {{was among the first}} aircraft to use spring steel landing gear. The main advantage of such gear is that no other <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>device</b> is needed; the deflecting leaf provides the shock absorption.|$|E
50|$|Jack Jumping, {{also known}} as Skibock in Europe, is an action sport that {{involves}} descending a slope that is covered with snow on a Jackjumper. The Jackjumper is a skiing device with a bench seat attached to a ski. The seat may be solidly mounted with a post, or sprung mounted with a <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>device.</b> The origins of Jack Jumping, {{as well as its}} name, remain a mystery. The earliest Jackjumpers date to the mid- to late 1800s. Early patents for Jackjumpers were granted in the 1920s and the 1930s. Jackjumpers in the US, and Skibocks in Europe, are used today for both sport and recreation. There are numerous competitive events scheduled each year on both continents.|$|E
5000|$|In railroading, slack {{action is}} the amount of free {{movement}} of one car before it transmits its motion to an adjoining coupled car. This free movement results from the fact that in railroad practice cars are loosely coupled, and the coupling is often combined with a <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>device,</b> a [...] "draft gear," [...] which, under stress, substantially increases the free movement as the train is started or stopped. Loose coupling is necessary to enable the train to bend around curves and is an aid in starting heavy trains, since the application of the locomotive power to the train operates on each car in the train successively, and the power is thus utilized to start only one car at a time.|$|E
40|$|A 15, 000 -ft {{string of}} Grade E drill pipe {{is capable of}} {{stretching}} 37 ft without yielding. If the pipe were infinitely rigid so it would not stretch, it would break at the slips {{as soon as they}} were set. Fortunately, the pipe is not rigid, but is capable of stretching without permanent elongation provided the stress developed does not exceed the yield point of the pipe material. This ability to stretch allows the top of the pipe to be stopped suddenly while the bottom of the pipe continues to move. Whenever slips are set on moving drill pipe, dynamic stresses are added to the stresses already in the string. Parting or permanent elongation could result from these stresses depending upon the string length and upon the velocity of the pipe when the slips are set. An investigation into these stresses shows what are the critical slip setting velocities and how much effect slowing down the pipe velocity can have on the magnitude of these stresses. This study also reveals that the expense and inconvenience of <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>devices</b> can hardly be justified for protection of drill pipe since only relatively small shock reduction is practical...|$|R
40|$|When {{the strong}} {{earthquake}} occurs and a bridge suffers the longitudinal impact, a superstructure and abutments of a bridge will collide. There is a spatial gap between superstructure and wall of abutment and this gap may effect to accelerate collision speed between them. Then, in this paper, effect of <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>device</b> to softening the collision is investigated {{in the cases}} of simple and continuous girder bridges. And the effect of stiffness of <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>device,</b> laying-gap length and back-fill ground of a abutment to soften the collision response, is analyzed. Moreover, influence by laying-gap length and an abutments of back-fill ground when colliding was examined...|$|E
40|$|Impact {{response}} {{analysis of}} horizontal collision of continuous truss bridge to parapet wall of abutment during the strong earthquake, is {{dealt with in}} this paper. Elasto plastic behaviors of piers and rubber shoes {{are taken into account}} in the numerical analysis. Dynamic responses of displacement and acceleration of superstructure and maximum contact force between superstructure and abutment are obtained by changing the stiffness of <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>device</b> and clearance between superstructure and abutment. Nonlinear behavior and ductility factor of piers, nonlinear effect of shock absorbing device and effect of the stiffness of back-fill ground, are also obtained...|$|E
