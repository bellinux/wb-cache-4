5|$|An {{aggressive}} 113 for Fitzroy against Melbourne Cricket Club in 1946–47 saw Harvey {{selected for}} the Victorian team {{at the age of}} 18. He made 18 in his only innings during his first-class debut against Tasmania. In the next match against Tasmania, Harvey made his maiden first-class century, scoring 154. He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> effort was inspired by elder brother Merv, who gained Test selection in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} once, he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> favourite city was London, {{and in another}} instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah {{had asked him to}} join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, and in his usual jovial style, commented that if he had joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war. The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything else in his career.|$|E

5|$|At the {{sentencing}} hearing for a Chicago attorney, a federal agent {{testified that the}} attorney <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> job with Burke's Finance Committee only required four hours of work a week, although he was paid a full-time salary. On January 8, 1998, federal prosecutors in Operation Haunted Hall indicted another Chicago attorney for collecting $9,223 in wages and benefits from the Finance Committee in 1991 and 1992 despite doing little or no work.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1973, Sihanouk loyalists {{had been}} purged from all of GRUNK's {{ministries}} {{and all of the}} prince's supporters within the insurgent ranks were also eliminated. Shortly after Christmas, as the insurgents were gearing up for their final offensive, Sihanouk spoke with the French diplomat Etienne Manac'h. He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> hopes for a moderate socialism akin to Yugoslavia's must now be totally dismissed. Stalinist Albania, he said, would be the model.|$|E
5|$|From 10 July 1925, {{until his}} death in 1969, Meher Baba was silent. He communicated first by using an {{alphabet}} board and later by unique hand gestures which were interpreted and spoken out by one of his mandali, usually by his disciple Eruch Jessawala. Meher Baba <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> silence was not undertaken as a spiritual exercise but solely in connection with his universal work.|$|E

5|$|Keating {{motivated}} Tonelli {{by showing}} {{him the best}} times recorded by American boys of the same age, as documented in Swimming World Magazine. Unaware that the Americans were swimming in 50yd pools, roughly 10% shorter than those in Australia, Tonelli could not understand his inability to match and better their times. He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> greatest motivation was the desire to impress his parents.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 2011, Wilders {{was acquitted}} of all charges. A Dutch court <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> speech was {{legitimate}} political debate, but on the edge. Because both the public prosecutor and the defence requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed.|$|E

5|$|Adrian Paul {{said that}} Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as a smoker to mark her {{out as a}} {{different}} character from Tessa. Paul also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> lovemaking scene with Vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between MacLeod and Lisa from that between MacLeod and Tessa. According to Paul, Lisa {{was more like a}} temptress to MacLeod than was Tessa. According to Panzer, the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter's barge. After reading the draft script, Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa's grave would have a more dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love (2011), Sukumar {{began working}} on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident in which a bus driver talked about a young boy who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> parents were murdered on his bus became the story's base. Mahesh met Sukumar {{on the set of}} Businessman (2012) in Goa, and listened to the script for 25 minutes. Although Sukumar could not describe the story well in the noisy restaurant, Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour. Sukumar worked on 1:Nenokkadine script for two months, and considered it his dream project.|$|E
5|$|After {{consecutive}} retirements in {{the previous}} three races which included first lap collisions in Austria and Germany, Michael Schumacher <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> objective in Hungary was to avoid any incidents on the first lap and to finish in a points-scoring position.

Barrichello revealed that he received backing from Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo to challenge for more victories and the championship despite the latter's comments to the press about Barrichello assisting Michael Schumacher's title aspirations.|$|E

5|$|After his {{marriage}} to Yanti, she ended her singing career to become a housewife. When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little {{time to spend with}} them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to spend as much time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} switch of coaches, Thorpe {{indicated}} that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. During this period, his times in the 400m and 200m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, particularly during the build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> results justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster times as a young swimmer under Frost.|$|E
5|$|Also in October 2012, Jamie McIntosh of IJM Canada <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{organization}} {{supports the}} NAP-CHT, {{and that the}} plan's promises to participate in international child protection would be best fulfilled by apprehending and prosecuting Canadians who engage in child sex tourism and child trafficking in other countries. McIntosh recommended that this work be focused on Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand because these countries are particularly vulnerable to Canadian traffickers. He also recommended focusing on these countries because Canadians have been caught participating in child sex tourism there; McIntosh made specific reference to the cases of Kenneth Klassen and Donald Bakker.|$|E

5|$|Born in Huyton, Merseyside, Barton is {{the oldest}} of four brothers. His parents {{separated}} when he was 14 years old and consequently {{he lived with his}} father at his grandmother's house on a different estate. He has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> grandmother's influence helped him to avoid getting caught up in a recreational drug culture and attributes his work ethic to his father. His father, also named Joseph, worked as a roofer and played football semi-professionally for Northwich Victoria. Barton enjoyed physical education at his school, St Thomas Becket, which he represented in various sports and was a talented rugby league prospect. He left school with ten GCSEs.|$|E
5|$|Born on August 9, 1982 in Lexington, Kentucky, Tyson Gay is {{the only}} son of Daisy Gay and Greg Mitchell. Athletic prowess {{was part of his}} family life; Gay's {{grandmother}} ran for Eastern Kentucky University and his mother Daisy also competed in her youth, though she was pregnant with her first child by her early teens. Gay's older sister, Tiffany, was a keen sprinter and had a successful high school career. Tiffany and Tyson Gay, encouraged by their mother, raced at every opportunity, training hard at school and on the hills in their neighborhood. There was strong competition between the two, and Gay later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> sister's quick reaction time inspired him to improve.|$|E
5|$|Gorman <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Catholic {{grandmother}} had secretly married Albert Victor, {{and that his}} mother, as the legitimate daughter of Albert Victor, was the rightful heir to the throne. He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged {{as part of a}} conspiracy to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth. In the original television series, the story is depicted as the belief of Gorman but not of the detectives. Captivated by Gorman's story, journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further, and eventually published his research as the book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution in 1976.|$|E
