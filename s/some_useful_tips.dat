40|$|Revision total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) {{represents a}} technically challenging procedure. The {{use of an}} offset stem extension can help in addressing some of the difficulties that can be encountered during surgery and, in particular, anatomical mismatch, malalignment, and gap balancing. Different offset stem extensions are available and can be classified according to four parameters: modularity, location of the offset, direction, {{and size of the}} displacement. Offset stem extensions can assist with implant alignment on the metaphysis if there is an offset diaphysis, can avoid medial-lateral or anterior-posterior component overhang, can reduce the incidence of coronal or sagittal malalignment, and can help in balancing the flexion and extension spaces by effectively translating the components. The aim {{of this study is to}} give an overview of the currently available evidence regarding the use of offset stem extensions in revision TKA as well as <b>some</b> <b>useful</b> surgical <b>tips...</b>|$|R

40|$|Perforator flaps have {{revolutionized}} {{the field of}} reconstructive plastic surgery by allowing novel therapeutic options with minimal functional cost to the patient. Despite initial resistance, perforator flaps are now preferentially accepted as the gold standard in autogenous reconstruction in situations where muscle transfer is not necessary. The superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) flap constitutes the descendant of the gluteus maximus myocutaneous flap. Although possessing all of its predecessor's advantages, the SGAP flap generates much less donor-site morbidity. Indications for use are multiple, spanning locoregional use as a pedicled flap to free-tissue transfer in breast reconstruction.

40|$|Induction cooking units work by {{generating}} a radio frequency (RF) magnetic field for heating purposes. Concerns have been expressed {{from time to}} time about whether induction cookers may present a health hazard to humans. The first paper, “Analysis of Stray EM Fields Generated by Induction Cooktops”, authored by Marco Bullo, Fabrizio Dughiero and Elisabetta Sieni of Padova University, Italy, aims to evaluate possible biological effects to the human body due to an RF magnetic field emitted by the induction cooktop. The measurement results of several models of cooktops have shown that most of the induction cooktops do comply with the exposure limits given in the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) standard. The results have also shown that the emitted field is much lower if the pot is centered at the cooktop, as the pot bottom serves as a shield that blocks the magnetic field from the induction coil.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} project {{is to create a}} user {{interface}} for a web based film production project management portal. This implies creating a site map and a functionality specification based on the needs of the people working in the film production industry. The project was made on account of The Chimney Pot, a post production company in Stockholm. For the scope of this project, the research was concentrated on the part of film production that concerns The Chimney Pot, i. e. the procedures that take place after a film has been recorded. The research also focused on people working in the area of Stockholm, even if their clients and customers in other areas of Sweden and abroad were indirectly included in order for the project portal to be a usable tool in projects where these people are involved. Before any visible results can be seen in a web production project, a range of preparation steps needs to be taken. Planning is essential if the final product shall work properly. Extensive research has to be done into the industry. In order to make the product usable, the intended users, their requirements, work procedures and environment need to be examined. Only when there are substantial results and enough knowledge about the industry, the actual implementation can start. The first step is to make a functionality specification, next a site map should be produced and the technical architecture should be specified. These are the areas that are covered in this project, but there are also recommendations about how the further development should be made. Important aspects in the next phase are to create a budget, to put together a development team and to create a graphic user interface. In the whole process the issues of usability need to be considered, i. e. efficiency, flexibility, learnability and satisfaction. The key requirements for the project portal turned out to be speed and effectiveness. The user interface was designed to be intuitive and to be shallow, which means that the user should be able to perform any task with the least amount of mouse clicks possible. Another intention with the produced user interface is for it to be clearly divided into the four main areas that could be extracted from the user requirements. They are planning, project details, communication and file sharing. Directly after logging on to the project portal, the user should get an overview of all these areas. Other important considerations were security, version control and seamlessness. These issues demand a thorough planning of the technical architecture and this thesis provides <b>some</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tips</b> for the further development of the technical specification...|$|E
