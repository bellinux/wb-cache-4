This is a third evolutionary <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> after e-commerce and mcommerce and is popularly called as u-commerce (ubiquitous commerce).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{highlighting}} the bi-univocal relationship between the development of the Marketing Higher Education and the design of knowledge-based economy. On one hand, marketing science needs to incorporate the principles and the mentality of the knowledge based economy in order to develop itself separately from other socio-economic sciences and, on the other hand, knowledge-based economy needs to incorporate marketing techniques and philosophy to enhance economic relations in human communities, based not only on technology but primarily on the needs, expectations and aspirations of the people. Starting from an analysis of the state of art of the concept of knowledge-based economy and from an analysis of the current developmental <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> science, particularly in Romania, this paper will highlight the strong links between those two areas and multiple interferences between them.

40|$|A {{paper is}} devoted to the {{problems}} of studying consumer behavior using up-to-date qualitative research methodologies. Nowadays, the status of academic discussion on application of qualitative methods in market research is similar to the 60 -s, when available amount of data on consumer behavior which had been traditionally analyzed with statistical procedures unexpectedly became almost useless in explaining rapidly complicating strategies of consumer behavior. Back in 60 s, a new academic school (understanding sociology) was required to provide genesis and functioning of qualitative methodology which was applicable for solution of marketing problems. Current approach to qualitative market research which appears to be a symbiosis of rational positivistic knowledge and methods taken from phenomenological sociology evidently does not meet market demand any more. Common attention to communicative research methods to the injury of observation techniques and analytical induction leads to sharp decrease of effectiveness of qualitative approach as a whole. The aim of the current paper is to analyze a possibility of new qualitative methods of studying consumer behavior at the current <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> evolution. The paper considers the reasons why ethnographic qualitative methods become more important and describes the concepts of commercial ethnography and observation methods. ...|$|E

40|$|Under European {{trade mark}} law, ‘functional’ signs, i. e. signs {{exclusively}} consisting of shapes which {{result from the}} nature of the product, are necessary to achieve a technical result, or give substantial value to the goods, are barred from trade mark protection with absolute and permanent effect, without the possibility to establish acquired distinctiveness. While the rule may appear sound as such, its application in practice is problematic, in particular as regards the third ground for exclusion, which {{is often referred to as}} ‘aesthetic functionality’: the dangerous implications of that rule for particularly attractive design have become obvious in the recent decision by the General Court, T- 508 / 08 – Bang & Olufsen. The article traces the origins of that rule in US case law and screens its application in Europe. It is argued that the original aim of the functionality doctrine in its various forms, namely to foster and maintain efficient competition, has been lost out of sight. Instead of embarking on an analysis of competitive concerns, courts tend to focus their attention on elements of largely accidental character, like the attractiveness of shapes in the early <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing.</b> Against that, the position is endorsed that it should not be precluded forever that a shape, initially attracting customers by its pleasant appearance, will become a valid sign at a later stage. Instead of focusing on how the public, at a given point in time, perceives and evaluates a certain shape, the crucial test should consist of an analysis of the competitive potential of the shape at stake, considering to what extent its assignment to one particular right holder would be liable to impede, or even exclude, efficient and meaningful competition...|$|E
40|$|The distant {{marketing}} of vegetables {{has been developed}} in many places of the country because of the price differences among the regions. This research aims to explore the expansion process of the distant marketing developed at a village in Bangladesh. The historical data collected through a field survey at Losmanpur village in Sherpur district is used for this study. The expansion of distant marketing is divided into 3 stages: the launching of distant marketing stage during 1983 and 1985, the adaptive distant marketing stage during 1986 and 1993 and the extensive distant marketing stage since 1994 thereafter. The market at the initial stage was limited to only one season in one market of Dhaka city that has been expanded for whole the year to many other markets of other cities, too. This research has identified the factors influencing {{for the expansion of}} the distant marketing. The vegetable business requires less capital because the traders collect vegetables mostly on credit from the farms. The success factor of the credit-sale is the trust between the farmers and traders. The development of rice millings in Sherpur district has an indirect effect on the expansion of vegetable marketing because the vegetable has been carried as the extra load of rice trucks. The price information was available from the traders or truck drivers coming back to the locality. The expansion of telephone since the early 1990 ’s and the mobile phone since the late 1990 ’s has facilitated for receiving the update market price. The relation among the traders was friendly at the early <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> and subsequently become collusive and competitive for increasing the number of traders. The farmers of the study village have expanded vegetable farming from 66 ha to 194 ha during 1996 and 2004 because of the gradual increase of demand...|$|E

The company runs a business in very specific area of car diagnostic consulting. In {{the first part of this}} work you can find an analyses of the current <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> activities. The company which entered the market in 2005 has already gained the respect of many respected authorities for its quality and wide range of provided services. The strenghts of the company are by my opinion primarily in very good functioning, interesting vision and clever strategy of the company. Very good example of all this is functioning of the FCD s. r. o. ` s portal which is by my personal view perfectly timed. On the other hand I find the level of the marketing activities (and marketing functioning at all) as very unsatisfying, mostly due to a lack of marketing planning. It is also quite obvious that the company has very big reserves in marketing research and uses a wrong horizontal communication within the company. As far as a second part of the project is concerned there has been suggested an own alternative way of handling the marketing activities. There have been suggested some changes in following areas: 1. It is an absolute necessity to elaborate a marketing plan of the company 2. It is necessary to name a person who will be in charge of the marketing activities of the company 3. To improve marketing information system (starting from more effective data collection) 4. To improve horizontal communication within the company 5.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the present status of traditional drying practices of commercially important marine fishes in the coastal region of Bangladesh. A survey was made on the source of raw materials, handling, transportation, processing and marketing aspects of fish using questionnaires through interviews among the cross section of people involved in fishing, middlemen, wholesalers, retailers and processors in the Kutubdiapara of Cox’s Bazar sadar upazilla, Ghati Bhanga of Moheshkhali upazilla and Shahaparirdip of Teknaf upazilla under Cox’s Bazar district. Survey was also made in the wholesale and retail dried fish markets in Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar area. After harvesting, the small scale fishermen carry their catch to the landing centre in traditional bamboo baskets without using adequate ice and sell it to the pre-selected buyers or middlemen locally called ‘mohajan’. Both quantitative and qualitative losses occur in raw materials due to spoilage. Considerable post harvest losses also occur in fish before and after drying due to insect attack and contamination which amounts to about 10 - 30 % of the total catch. There is also widespread use of insecticides before and after drying to avoid insect infestation. In most cases the fishes which are not sold as fresh in the market are used as raw materials of the dried products. The overall organoleptic qualities of the dried products available in various marketing chains are very poor. There is a long marketing chain for fresh and dried products which include fishermen, purchase commission agents (fresh fish), processor, purchase commission agents (dried fish), wholesaler, retailer and finally the consumer. Due to the involvement of various middlemen in the different marketing chains, the price in each <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> increases and finally the consumers buy the products with a higher price. In all the marketing chains, the dried fish products are marketed without adequate packaging. The dried products contaminated with moulds and fungus is common in the retail and wholesale markets in Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar dried fish markets. Study on the marketing margin and marketing profit of traditional dried fish products reveals that the processors in primary market receive higher marketing profit followed by retailers and wholesalers in consumer market and secondary market, respectively...|$|E
