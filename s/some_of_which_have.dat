5|$|A seventh-century Armenian chronicler {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} seventy Armenian monasteries in Palestine, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> been revealed in excavations. The Byzantines ceded Jerusalem to the Rashidun Caliphate after a siege in 637. Until this point, Jerusalem had a single Christian bishop. In 638, Armenians established their own archbishop, Abraham I. He was officially recognized by Rashidun Caliph Umar. The foundation of the Armenian migration to Jerusalem thus solidified. In the 12th century, around one thousand Armenians moved to Jerusalem with the Crusaders, presumably mainly from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.|$|E

5|$|Calabria, alone, has 30 {{traditional}} musical instruments, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> strongly archaic {{characteristics and}} are largely extinct elsewhere in Italy. It {{is home to}} the four- or five-stringed guitar called the chitarra battente, and a three-stringed, bowed fiddle called the lira, which is also found in similar forms in the music of Crete and Southeastern Europe. A one-stringed, bowed fiddle called the torototela, is common in the northeast of the country. The largely German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the ghironda (hurdy-gurdy) is found in Emilia, Piedmont and Lombardy.|$|E

Ne-Yo has also contributed songs to singers Mary J. Blige, B2K, Faith Evans, and Musiq, among others.|$|E
5|$|H.olivaceoalbus shows {{similarities}} between other closely related fungi {{of the genus}} Hygrophorus, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> only minor differences in physical features. Examples include H.pustulatus, H.inocybiformis, H.tephroleucus or H.morrisii. In the field, H.olivaceoalbus is distinguished {{by a combination of}} features including the double velum, the dark streaks on the slimy cap, the ing of the stem, and growth under pines, as well as by microscopic characteristics. There is no risk of confusing it with toxic fungi.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{concerning}} the national symbols {{is far from}} perfect. The Coat of Arms Act has been amended several times and refers extensively to executive ordinances, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> never been issued.

5|$|The long {{sentences}} of the Gun Court and its {{restrictions on the}} rights of the accused have given rise to constitutional challenges, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> been appealed to the Privy Council in London.

5|$|The {{space between}} the skin and gut is filled with mesenchyme, a {{connective}} tissue made of cells and reinforced by collagen fibers that act {{as a type of}} skeleton, providing attachment points for muscles. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> fluid-filled vacuoles; and stem cells, which can transform into any other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after injury or asexual reproduction.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little remains}} of the {{installations}} along the former inner German border. At least 30public, private and municipal museums along the old line present displays of equipment and other artifacts relating to the border. Among the preserved sites are several dozen watchtowers, short stretches of the fence and associated installations (<b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> been reconstructed), sections of the wall still in situ at Hötensleben and Mödlareuth, {{and a number of}} buildings related to the border, such as the GDR crossing point at Marienborn.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} subgenera have been {{proposed}} over the years. For instance in the 1870s and 1880s John Gilbert Baker considerably reorganised Hippeastrum. In 1878 he described nine sections of the genus, but by 1888 he included seven subgenera, namely (number of species in parentheses) Habranthus (10), Phycella (3), Rhodophiala (5), Macropododastrum (1), Omphalissa (6), Aschamia (10) and Lais (3), <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> since been treated as separate genera (Habranthus, Rhodophiala). Baker both reduced the original number of species of Herbert, but also enlarged the genus by adding in other genera such as Habranthus, Phycella, Rhodophiala and Rhodolirion (also called Rhodolirium, and subsequently moved to Rhodophilia), which he included as separate sections of Hippeastrum. In addition, he included many new species being discovered in South America, particularly Chile. His 1878 classification included 47 species, reduced to 38 by 1888.|$|E
