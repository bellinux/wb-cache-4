5000|$|While {{the region}} of Tennessee west of the Tennessee River was, on paper, part of Tennessee at its {{statehood}} in 1796, it had been recognized as Chickasaw territory by the 1786 Treaty of Hopewell, {{and it did not}} come under actual American control until it was obtained in a series of cessions by the Chickasaw in 1818, an acquisition known as the Jackson Purchase, and named for Andrew Jackson, one of the officials involved.

For example, preferential customs and transit duties on Nepalese goods entering or passing through India (whether imports or exports) were discontinued.

A deadlock ensued and the Treaties of Trade and Transit expired on March 23, 1989. The brunt of the closure of the trade and transit points was mainly faced by the lower classes in Nepal due to the restricted supply of consumer goods and petroleum products like petrol, aviation fuel and kerosene. The industries suffered because of their dependence on India for resources, trade and transit. The Government of Nepal tried to deal with the situation by depending on foreign aid from the US, UK, Australia and China. However, the government's strategy to manage the crisis could not satisfy those people who desired negotiations with India rather than dependence on foreign aid as a solution.|$|E

More specifically, this essay considers the ability of the International Criminal Court to perform such a task.

The Single Convention, adopted in 1961, consolidated those treaties and broadened their scope to include cannabis and drugs whose effects {{are similar to}} those of the drugs specified. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the World Health Organization were empowered to add, remove, and transfer drugs among the treaty's four schedules of controlled substances. The International Narcotics Control Board was put in charge of administering controls on drug production, international trade, and dispensation. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) was delegated the Board's day-to-day work of monitoring the situation in each country and working with national authorities to ensure compliance with the <b>Single</b> Convention. This <b>treaty</b> has since been supplemented by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, which controls LSD, MDMA, and other psychoactive pharmaceuticals, and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which strengthens provisions against money laundering and other drug-related offenses.|$|R
50|$|No <b>single</b> overall peace <b>treaty</b> was signed. The post-war {{border between}} Paraguay and Argentina was {{resolved}} through long negotiations, finalized in a treaty that defined the frontier {{between the two}} countries signed on February 3, 1876 and which granted Argentina roughly a third of the area it had intended to incorporate originally. The only region about which no consensus was reached — the area between the Río Verde and the main branch of Río Pilcomayo — was arbitrated by U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who declared it Paraguayan. (The Paraguayan department Presidente Hayes was named after Hayes due to his arbitration decision.) Brazil signed a separate peace treaty with Paraguay on January 9, 1872, obtaining freedom of navigation on the Río Paraguay. Brazil received the borders it had claimed before the war. The treaty also stipulated a war debt to the imperial government of Brazil that was eventually pardoned in 1943 by Getúlio Vargas in reply to a similar Argentine initiative.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} over half a century since the {{landmark}} Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs was adopted, {{for the first time}} unifying international drug policy under a <b>single</b> <b>treaty</b> aimed at limiting use, manufacture, trade, possession, and trafficking of opiates, cannabis, and other narcotics. Since then, other international drug policy measures have been adopted, largely emphasizing enforcement-based approaches to reducing drug supply and use. Recently, in response to concerns that the historic focus on criminalization and enforcement has had limited effectiveness, international drug policies have begun to undergo a paradigm shift as countries seek to enact their own reforms to partially depenalize or deregulate personal drug use and possession. This includes Mexico, which in 2009 enacted national drug policy reform partially decriminalizing possession of small quantities of narcotics for personal consumption while also requiring drug treatment for repeat offenders. As countries move forward with their own reform models, critical assessment of their legal compatibility and effectiveness is necessary. In this commentary we conduct a critical assessment of the compatibility of Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s reform policy to the international drug policy regime and describe its role in the current evolving drug policy environment. We argue that Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s reform is consistent with flexibilities allowed under international drug treaty instruments and related commentaries. We also advocate that drug policy reforms and future governance efforts should be based on empirical evidence, emphasize harm reduction practices, and integrate evidence-based evaluation and implementation of drug reform measures...|$|E
40|$|With a {{starting}} point from Eckehart´s sermon on the Gospel of Luke this thesis examines the doctrine of living, which is expressed {{in the interpretation of}} the life of the sisters Martha and Mary. The epistemological and ontological levels of the interpretation will be examined by drawing on other of Eckehart´s sermons. Through a thorough and textual analysis of the chosen sermons and a <b>single</b> <b>treaty,</b> the thesis examines how Eckehart´s ideal of living, epistemology and ontology entails a particular understanding of God within these different levels. This understanding influences how Eckehart extrapolate the possibility of a union between the divine and the human. This thesis points towards the fact that Eckehart´s interpretation of Martha and Mary, as the representatives of a contemplative and an active ideal, should be interpreted as a way of integrating or synthesizing the ideals, which enables a contemplative approach to the active. This is established through detachment as a way to gain an awareness of the “spark” in the soul that can create and inner awareness and expand human´s realization of the reality structure it takes part in. Eckehart expresses an ontological understanding where humans in their soul has an “uncreated” part and thus shares its ground with God´s ground. The immanent and transcendent can thereby become united, which is why realization of the self and of God becomes part of the same process. Detachment is “the one thing needful” that generates a safety in the soul´s ground, which enables one to see things as they are in themselves and not through an imaginary idea. This way one can be with and not in things and concerns...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1995 In {{order to}} show how {{formulations}} of Indian identity have reflected specific historical relations, this dissertation traces changing ideas about Indians {{in a region where}} Indians' relations with non-Indians have been unusually extensive and intimate [...] the Pacific Northwest's Puget Sound basin. Characteristics of Indians there have altered drastically since relations with Europeans began, necessitating the continual redefinition of Indianness. Recognizing that different ethnic groups depend on each other for their self-definitions, this history explains how some people came to conceive of themselves as Indians, then describes how Indians' self-conceptions evolved through give-and-take with others. The account begins in the 1820 s, when Hudson's Bay Company initiated land-based trade with diverse indigenous people who lived in many autonomous but interlinked villages. It ends in the 1970 s, when people organized in a score of tribes seized on a <b>single</b> <b>treaty</b> promise as the principal emblem of their shared Indian identity. Several times regional peculiarities thwarted American efforts to deal with Indians of Puget Sound strictly according to national models. Even after they achieved hegemony late in the 1800 s, Americans could not define Indians unilaterally. During years when national policy favored segregating Indians by tribal groups, local aborigines' habits [...] their reciprocal relations with outsiders, mobility, and economic independence [...] had a countervailing effect. At other times, when the principal federal goal was to assimilate Indians, local Indians' contacts with non-Indians reminded people in both groups that important differences remained between them. The cultural, biological, and legal lines around Indians and tribal groups remained indistinct and contested into the twentieth century. Those people who believed they were inside the lines, growing ever more diverse, tried to give their shared classification a satisfying meaning. Using public forums such as courts, they gradually formulated a history that identified them principally as descendants of people who had established a special relationship with American leaders through treaties...|$|E
25|$|After the war's end, {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to build any {{aircraft}} or aircraft engines. The <b>treaty</b> <b>singled</b> out the Fokker D.VII for destruction or confiscation, the only aircraft to be named in the treaty. In 1919 Fokker returned to the Netherlands and started a new aircraft company, the Nederlandse Vliegtuigenfabriek (Dutch Aircraft Factory), predecessor to the Fokker Aircraft Company. Despite the strict disarmament conditions in the Treaty, Fokker did not return home empty-handed: he managed to smuggle six goods trains' worth of D.VII and C.I military planes and spare parts out of Germany across the German-Dutch border. Author Weyl says that Fokker used 350 railway wagons and made sure that each train was too long to fit into the railway sidings where trains were normally checked for contraband. Weyl quotes Fokker himself as saying that he paid 20,000 Dutch guilders in bribes. The trains included 220 aeroplanes, more than 400 aero engines and much other material. This initial stock enabled him to quickly set up shop, but his focus shifted from military to civil aircraft such as the very successful Fokker F.VII trimotor.|$|R
5000|$|A scholar {{considered}} by some the greatest figure of late 19th century Traditionalism is Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo, who published most of his key works in the 1880s and 1890s. Historian of political thought and literary critic rather than a political theorist himself, he championed Traditionalism as a cultural approach, defined as constant defense of orthodoxy based on Catholicism though embodied in vastly different locals realms of Hispanidad. Erudite to the extreme politically he neared the Conservatives and briefly served as MP; some scholars refer also to [...] "menendezpelayismo político"; most, however, limit themselves to [...] "menendezpelayismo". Some deny him Traditionalist credentials altogether. Until the very late 1890s political Traditionalism lacked a complete lecture comparable to works of Balmes and Donoso; authors like Luis Llauder Dalmases produced general overviews of smaller scope or systematically contributed minor theoretical pieces to the press. This changed {{at the turn of}} the centuries thanks to two figures who renovated Traditionalist thought: Enrique Gil Robles and Juan Vázquez de Mella. Both offered complete and similar political visions; the former produced it as a <b>single</b> lengthy <b>treaty</b> accompanied by few minor works and the latter as massive and a rather loose collection of press contributions, parliamentary addresses and booklets. Some scholars consider de Mella a follower of Gil, others believe that Traditionalism achieved its most-refined embodiment in the Mellista thought. Gil remained a scholar with impact mostly in academic realm; following death in 1908 his work was soon eclipsed by that of de Mella, who gained high profile as deputy and politician and became sort of a celebrity. Politically Gil remained in-between Integrism and mainstream Carlism. De Mella for some 25 years was considered the key Carlist theorist until in 1919 he broke away. The short-lived party he founded was named Partido Católico-Tradicionalista; in popular discourse it was referred to as Mellistas or Tradicionalistas, while the Carlists of the era - still sharing the same Traditionalist outlook - were usually named Jaimistas.|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the process of}} formation of internal makret of 12 member states of the European Communities and analyses its implications for Poland. Attention was paid {{to the fact that}} European internal market is a consequence of economic integration within the Communities. In June 1985 the Commission prepared for the Council of Ministers the so-called White Paper on the implementation of internal market. Its content is very interesting, for it defines the features of internal market and contains about 300 proposals to implement internal market in various spheres. These proposals are accompanied by a detailed schedule of their realization. By the end of 1988 the Council of Ministers took about 90 decisions with respect to the internal market implementation; further steps are being discussed in working groups. The White Paper was later confirmed by Single European Acts, having the binding force of <b>treaties.</b> <b>Single</b> European Acts define the notion of internal market of member states of the Communities, proclaim the rule of qualified majority vote for decisions taken by the Council and set the deadline for a full realization of internal market for December 31, 1992. Various economic implications for Poland result from the above. It is indispensable for Polish economy to achieve a certain degree of convergence with the economies of member states of the Communities. In order to accomplish it, deep reforms of the structure of economy and management are necessary. The article indicates main directions of reforms and ways of carrying them out. It is a very demanding task for the Polish economic policy. Otherwise, Poland would find itself outside the economic relations with the Communities. Therefore, the article is against „emergency" reforms and instead postulates the realization of far-reaching reforms which would take into account the changes on the economic map of Europe.

40|$|Introduction]. The draft Constitution {{is on the}} table. Attention {{is moving}} towards the {{traditional}} intergovernmental game that will be played out at the intergovernmental conference (IGC) during autumn 2003 – and quite possibly into early 2004 (despite {{the intentions of the}} Italian presidency). Much of the structure and the detailed substance of the draft treaty will stay but the IGC will be far from a rubber-stamp exercise. Moreover, despite the pessimists’ (or perhaps realists’) view that the IGC will only make the draft Constitution worse, the governments do have an opportunity to improve and clarify many areas. Certainly a number of issues will still be hotly contested not least on the core institutional questions. In many ways, the results of the Future of Europe Convention represent an important step forward. The operation of the Convention itself, through its relative openness, was a significant development. The existence of a <b>single</b> Constitutional <b>Treaty</b> is an important move in the right direction. The Convention also achieved considerable simplification in some areas, and some very important democratic steps were taken. But the Convention has also thrown up a number of problems. Despite its openness, the core institutional debate was conducted largely behind closed doors and in considerable haste. It is far from clear that the procedures followed for the Convention’s institutional work were even as good as, let alone better than, an IGC. In this respect the procedures deviated strongly from that followed for all other areas of the Convention’s work. In some ways, the draft Constitutional Treaty introduces more complexity than more simplicity – particularly in the dual presidencies of Commission and European Council. Crucially, there are some big gaps on the democratic front, notably on the accountability of the executive. The result of the Convention was a compromise and consequently it is not easy or necessarily advisable to try to identify winners and losers. Nevertheless, it is clear by looking at the three main institutions that the European Parliament has been strengthened in important ways. But the picture is much less clear for the Commission and Council, where turf-fighting and confusion looks likely {{to be one of the}} legacies of the changes proposed, with neither institution ending up substantially strengthened. Many of the divides in the Convention were between larger and smaller countries as much as the inevitable conflict between intergovernmental and integrationist points of view. All sides can claim some successes. But the compromises that were necessary to balance these points of view have produced an outcome that, on the one hand, could function fairly well and represent a step forward but that could, on the other hand, equally result in institutional malfunctioning. Which of these two outcomes occurs will depend not only on the political personalities involved but also on relations between the institutions (and whether member states get involved in any of the ongoing battles that may develop between personalities or institutions). Overall, the draft treaty is at least a substantial step forward from the inadequacies of the Nice Treaty. Its structure will act as the basic framework for the EU’s politics and policies for many years to come – though revisions will certainly occur. But some of its central and messy compromises leave much uncertainty as to the future functioning of the enlarged EU...|$|R
40|$|The article {{critically}} {{assesses the}} Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) {{as a potential}} model for solving the immense legal challenges presented by transborder activity. Inaugurated in late 1999 by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the UDRP creates a fast, inexpensive online mechanism for trademark owners to recapture domain names held by persons who, in bad faith, register and use domain names that are confusingly similar to those marks. At present, the UDRP applies only to a narrow segment of disputes between trademark owners and domain name registrants. But the UDRP has been heralded by some {{as the model for}} a new non-national approach to lawmaking and dispute settlement applicable to a broader set of legal issues that transcend national borders. In this article, we describe the conditions that led to the UDRP 2 ̆ 7 s formation and consider whether the UDRP can and should be replicated elsewhere. The process by which the UDRP was created, {{and the way in which}} it is structured, departs significantly from preexisting approaches to international lawmaking and dispute settlement. The UDRP is the product not of national legislation nor an international treaty, but rather of a web of contractual obligations imposed by a private, non-profit corporation with a monopoly over a valuable resource. Through its agreements with the U. S. Department of Commerce, ICANN serves as the gatekeeper for anyone seeking to acquire the most commercially valuable internet addresses. Exclusive control of access to the root server enables ICANN to dictate the terms and conditions for domain name ownership. This technological control also facilitates enforcement of UDRP panel decisions compelling domain name registrars to cancel ownership of contested domain names or transfer them from registrants to trademark owners. The UDRP deviates from preexisting lawmaking and dispute settlement paradigms in other ways that make its advantages considerable (and which may make it attractive for replication). For example, the UDRP is a hybrid dispute settlement system. It contains an amalgam of elements from three distinct decision making paradigms - judicial, arbitral and ministerial - and it draws inspiration from international, supranational, and national legal systems. The UDRP thus reveals how dispute settlement structures can be tailored to the needs of new technologies and new types of legal conflicts. The UDRP is also non-national. Neither its substantive content nor its prescriptive force necessarily depends upon the laws, institutions, and enforcement mechanisms of any <b>single</b> nation-state or <b>treaty</b> regime. It thus suggests ways to bypass the often slow and cumbersome mechanisms of national and international lawmaking and to fulfil the demand for effective dispute settlement mechanisms that, like so much current social activity, transcend national borders. Even assuming the UDRP can be applied to other situations where the conditions of monopolistic technological control do not subsist, however, we do not believe that it should be uncritically extended to other contexts without first questioning how non-national systems ought to be structured. In particular, while we applaud the effort to construct a non-national model that draws upon but is not constrained by existing paradigms, the current iteration of that model fails to incorporate appropriate checking mechanisms to control the scope and pace of lawmaking and the limited powers granted to dispute settlement decisionmakers. Moreover, the tensions between national and non-national values may be more difficult to reconcile in other settings; cybersquatting, in contrast, was universally condemned, and thus competing national values were less frequently implicated. We seek to identify these and other variables that should guide the authors of new checking mechanisms for new non-national structures...|$|R
