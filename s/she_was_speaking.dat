The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to. An FBI {{operator}} answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E
5|$|No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an {{autobiography}} by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It {{was published in}} hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper {{as a form of}} therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was telling the truth and explained <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain {{the killing of the}} students. The students all attended a local teacher training college with a history of left-wing activism and radicalism, {{but it is not clear}} that they were targeted for their political beliefs. Some think that they may have angered Guerreros Unidos by refusing to pay extortion money. Others believe there may be a link between the students' disappearance and a speech given by the wife of Iguala's mayor on the day of the clashes. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to local dignitaries when the students were protesting in Iguala and some believe they may have been targeted because it was feared they could disrupt the event.|$|E

Smith also {{received a phone call}} from Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman to orbit the Earth. However, not realizing with whom <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking,</b> Samantha mistakenly hung up after only a brief conversation. Media followed her every step—photographs and articles about her were published by the main Soviet newspapers and magazines throughout her trip and after it. Smith became widely known to Soviet citizens and was well regarded by many of them. In the United States, the event drew suspicion and some regarded it as an [...] "American-style public relations stunt".|$|E
500|$|Bethune {{was also}} active in women's clubs, which were strong civic {{organizations}} supporting welfare and other needs, {{and became a}} national leader. After working on the presidential campaign for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, she was invited {{as a member of}} his Black Cabinet. She advised him on concerns of black people and helped share Roosevelt's message and achievements with blacks, who had historically been Republican voters since the Civil War. At the time, blacks had been largely disenfranchised in the South {{since the turn of the}} century, so <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to black voters across the North. Upon her death, columnist Louis E. Martin said, [...] "She gave out faith and hope as if they were pills and she some sort of doctor." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 22, 1879, {{a female}} admirer {{traveled}} to Longfellow's house in Cambridge and, unaware to whom <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking,</b> asked him: [...] "Is this {{the house where}} Longfellow was born?" [...] He told {{her that it was}} not. The visitor then asked if he had died here. [...] "Not yet", he replied. In March 1882, Longfellow went to bed with severe stomach pain. He endured the pain for several days with the help of opium before he died surrounded by family on Friday, March 24. He had been suffering from peritonitis. At the time of his death, his estate was worth an estimated $356,320. He is buried with both of his wives at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His last few years were spent translating the poetry of Michelangelo. Longfellow never considered it complete enough to be published during his lifetime, but a posthumous edition was collected in 1883. Scholars generally regard the work as autobiographical, reflecting the translator as an aging artist facing his impending death.|$|E
500|$|After German reunification, Mühe {{allegedly}} discovered {{evidence in}} his Stasi file {{that he had}} been under surveillance not only by four of his fellow actors in the East Berlin theatre, but also by his wife Gröllmann. The file held detailed records of meetings that Gröllmann, who was registered as an [...] "Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter" [...] (unofficial collaborator), had with her controller from 1979 to 1989. This mirrored the plot of Das Leben der Anderen as in the film pressure exerted by the Stasi on the playwright's girlfriend makes her betray him as the author of an exposé of covered-up GDR suicide rates. Mühe and Gröllmann divorced in 1990. In a book accompanying the film, Mühe spoke about the sense of betrayal he felt when he found out about his former wife's alleged Stasi role. However, Gröllmann's real-life controller later claimed he had made up many of the details in the file and that the actress had been unaware that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to a Stasi agent. After a highly public and acrimonious battle in the courts, Gröllmann, who died in August 2006, won an injunction preventing the book's publication. Mühe's response when asked how he prepared for his role in Das Leben der Anderen was, [...] "I remembered." ...|$|E

He had also supported her when disputes about her behaviour arose within the commune leadership, but in spring 1984, as tension amongst {{the inner circle}} peaked, a private meeting was convened with Sheela and his personal house staff. According to the testimony of Rajneesh's dentist, Swami Devageet (Charles Harvey Newman), she was admonished during a meeting, with Rajneesh declaring that his house, and not hers, was {{the centre of the}} commune. Devageet claimed Rajneesh warned that Sheela's jealousy of anyone close to him would inevitably see them become a target.|$|E

On April 7, around 250 protesters surrounded and prevented audience members from entering the building where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> at Claremont McKenna College, whose president Hiram Chodosh stated afterwards: [...] "Based on the judgment of the Claremont Police Department, we jointly concluded that any forced interventions or arrests would have created unsafe conditions for students, faculty, staff, and guests." [...] Mac Donald ultimately gave the talk to a small audience in the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum which was also live-streamed on the Claremont McKenna website. Chodosh added: “In the end, the effort to silence her voice effectively amplified it to a much larger audience.” ...|$|E

This left his mother devastated, and Barrie tried to fill David's place in his mother's attentions, even wearing David's clothes and whistling in the manner that he did. One time, Barrie entered her room and heard her say, [...] "Is that you?" [...] "I {{thought it was the}} dead boy <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to", wrote Barrie in his biographical account of his mother Margaret Ogilvy (1896) [...] "and I said in a little lonely voice, 'No, it's no' him, it's just me. Barrie's mother found comfort in the fact that her dead son would remain a boy forever, never to grow up and leave her. Eventually, Barrie and his mother entertained each other with stories of her brief childhood and books such as Robinson Crusoe, works by fellow Scotsman Walter Scott, and The Pilgrim's Progress.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first trial}} of {{defendants}} McGeehan, Carroll, Duffy, James Boyle, and James Roarity {{for the killing}} of Yost commenced in May 1876. Yost had not recognized the men who attacked him. Although Kerrigan has since been described, along with Duffy, as hating the night watchman enough to plot his murder, Kerrigan became a state's witness and testified against the union leaders and other miners. However, Kerrigan's wife testified in the courtroom {{that her husband had}} committed the murder. She testified that she refused to provide her husband with clothing while he was in prison, because he had [...] "picked innocent men to suffer for his crime". She stated that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> out voluntarily, and was only interested in telling the truth about the murder. Gowen cross-examined her, but could not shake her testimony. Others supported her testimony amid speculation that Kerrigan was receiving special treatment {{due to the fact that}} McParland was engaged to his sister-in-law, Mary Ann Higgins. This trial was declared a mistrial due to the death of one of the jurors. A new trial was granted two months later. During that trial Fanny Kerrigan did not testify. The five defendants were sentenced to death. Kerrigan was allowed to go free.|$|E
2500|$|In early August 2002, Razack, the {{director}} of OISE's Centre for Integrative Anti-racism Studies at the time, wrote a letter about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In it she denounced Israeli [...] "atrocities beyond belief" [...] enacted on the Palestinian people during the Battle of Jenin, and the ongoing Israeli military occupation of Palestine. The letter and a Pro-Palestine petition it introduced were emailed to the University of Toronto's student body and faculty. The letter was signed by 15 professors from the U of T, and 22 professors not affiliated with the university. Simon Rosenblum, {{a spokesman for the}} Canadian Jewish congress, called the letter [...] "a prejudicial, inflammatory and highly biased view" [...] of the Israeli-Palestine conflict that [...] "pays no attention to Israel's attempts to achieve peace nor Israel's legitimate need for self-defence." [...] B'nai Brith Canada took issue with the letter's content's because it created [...] "a poisoned environment [...] for Jewish students at U of T." [...] According to the organisation, the letter created an atmosphere in which Jewish students, associated to Israel because of their religion, were subject to anti-semetic attitudes. The U of T defended Razack, as Jane Stirling, a spokeswoman for the university, declared to the press that [...] "faculty at a university must be able to voice unpopular or controversial ideas." [...] Another spokeswoman echoed this idea, re-affirming that the [...] "U of T does not muzzle its community when it comes to political discourse." [...] However, acting president Shirley Neuman underlined that Razack was not speaking on behalf of the University of Toronto when she wrote the letter as Razack instead specifically stated that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> on the behalf of [...] "Canadian scholars meeting at the First National Conference on Critical Race Scholarship and the University." [...] The link to the letter and the petition were removed from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) website in late August 2002.|$|E
