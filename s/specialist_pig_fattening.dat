40|$|In {{the case}} of some {{agricultural}} investments, often net cash flow changes its sign from positive to negative, many times during the project. It causes the problem of {{internal rate of return}} calculation, which is an important indicator of economic effectiveness of investments. That is, in such situations, internal rate of return cannot be used. To solve this problem, modified rate of return is applied. This paper aimed to describe this method in detail, and to show its calculation for investments in <b>pigs</b> <b>fattening.</b> By application of modified internal rate of return it is determined that <b>pigs</b> <b>fattening,</b> under assumed conditions, is economically justified. Also, authors calculated the upper limit of discount rate (cost of capital), to which investment in <b>pigs</b> <b>fattening</b> is economically justified. It is concluded that, in {{the case of}} specific agricultural investments (such as <b>pigs</b> <b>fattening),</b> the use of traditional internal rate of return could give the wrong image on actual rate of return on investments...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of the finishing system (under montanheira or with commercial feed) on carcass characteristics and dry cured-ham of Alentejano pigs. 24 <b>pigs</b> were <b>fattening</b> until 130 kg LW under montanheira and 24 <b>pigs</b> were <b>fattening</b> with commercial feed. Carcasses of <b>pigs</b> <b>fattened</b> under the montanheira system were slightly heavy (98, 38 vs 96, 13 kg), with significantly higher (P> 0, 01) dressing percentage (79, 55 % vs 78, 11 %), backfat thickness (6, 09 vs 5, 34 cm), percentage of fatty cuts (32, 06 % vs 30, 44 %) and weight (21, 92 vs 19, 77 kg) and percentage of adipose tissue (51, 65 % vs 47, 71 %). Percentage of lean cuts (50, 03 % vs 49, 07 %), bone cuts (19, 53 % vs 18, 87 %), weight (14, 91 vs 13, 77 kg) and percentage of lean (36, 04 % vs 32, 54 %), lean:bone (3, 21 vs 3, 01) and lean:fat (0, 76 vs 0, 63) ratios were significantly higher in pigs fed commercial feed.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of indigenous or modern genotypes for organic {{conditions and the}} necessity of a specific organic breeding programme are intensively discussed in the organic <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> scene. To clarify both items information about Genotype-Environment-Interaction (GEI) is necessary. Therefore 682 pigs of 7 different genotypes with widely spread protein synthesis capacity were tested for growth performance and carcass quality under conventional and organic environments at two performance testing stations in order to verify GEI. The modern genotypes were superior to the old ones, all genotypes achieved significantly better results within the conventional environment and there were significant interactions between genotype and environment for all criteria of growth performance and carcass quality. The interactions were mainly caused by varying differences between organic and conventional environment within genotypes, but without a shift of the ranking order within environment between genotypes. Hence no special breeding programme is necessary for organic <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> under relatively similar marketing systems for conventionally and organically produced pork...|$|R
40|$|Farmers make {{decisions}} in a planning {{environment in which}} planning information is frequently imperfect and outcomes uncertain. Efficient planning systems must therefore be dynamic in nature. However, available systems which are capable of being directly applied to individual farms on a whole farm basis {{do not reflect the}} true nature of the planning environment. This study explores the nature of these problems through developing a dynamic planning system for <b>pig</b> <b>fattening.</b> The study considers the nature of the <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> problem and specifies the important factors that planning models must allow for representing the realistic planning environment. The features of currently available models are reviewed leading to a statement of the improvements required. A realistic model of <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> is developed and possible solution algorithms are considered. As the models require detailed pig growth information a simulation model designed to predict response from alternative feeding patterns was developed. The output from this model together with the output from a model which calculates growth distributions and posterior probabilities on potential growth provide some of the input data for a stochastic multi-period linear programming model of the problem. The remainder, feed cost information, is obtained from least cost models formulated to represent the features of the dynamic planning problem. With imperfect information, planning involves continual re-planning as new observations are made. Consequently only the solution to the first period of the model is likely to be implemented. To ensure that the first period decision set is optimal it is shown that a minimum number of periods must be included in the planning model. The minimum number is referred to as the planning horizon. Methods of determining a planning horizon are reviewed and it is concluded that available methods do not provide a general method for all planning situations. A method is developed for the <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> problem. Finally, a number of planning experiments were carried out to demonstrate the value of the planning models and systems developed. The results indicate the potential value of applying sophisticated planning methods to individual farms and provide a means to examine the condition under which detailed individual farm dynamic planning can be worthwhile...|$|R

Although {{it is well known that}} the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms is high, risk factors for the presence of MRSA in herds of <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate available data from previous studies on MRSA in <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> in a meta-analysis to answer the question: What are the factors associated with the occurrence of MRSA in <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds?The studies on MRSA in pigs that were identified by literature research were heterogeneous with respect to the risk factors investigated and the type of herds focused on. Therefore we decided to carry out a pooling analysis on herd level rather than a typical meta-analysis. Eligible herd data were identified based on the published literature and communication with the authors. The final data set covered 400 <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds from 10 different studies and 12 risk factors. The prevalence of MRSA in the 400 <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds was 53. 5 %.

Finallythe economic size of each farm was estimated in ESU according to the EU classification. As a conclusion, all thethree farms carried out profit but the farm F 3, which was the largest farm, registered the highest efficiency: Lei 107. 8 profit/ pig, Lei 238 gross margin/pig, Lei thousand 1, 895. 582 gross margin/farm/year. Therefore, the higher theincome and profit per fatty pig, the higher economic efficiency. As a conclusion, farmers have to pay attention tofarm size in order to increase economic efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} and characteristics were investigated of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in pigs in Thailand. A total of 179 rectal swabs were collected aseptically from suckling <b>pigs,</b> <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> and breeding sows on four commercial farms located in Central Thailand. VRE with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 8  μg/mL to 16  μg/mL were detected in 43 of 179 pigs (an overall prevalence rate of 24 %). VRE carriers {{were identified in}} 12 of 61 (19. 7 %) suckling pigs, 15 of 60 (25 %) <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> and 16 of 58 (27. 6 %) breeding sows, respectively. Enterococcus gallinarum was the most prevalent species for VRE in all age groups, followed by the detection of Enterococcus casseliflavus. All of the isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. A large proportion of VRE isolates showed resistance to tetracycline (86. 5 %), erythromycin (61. 5 %), ampicillin (53. 8 %), chloramphenicol (34. 6 %) and ciprofloxacin (32. 7 %). Resistance to ampicillin was more prevalent in E.  gallinarum isolates than in E.  casseliflavus isolates. The {{results of this study}} indicate that VRE isolates of pigs are of the VanC phenotype and commonly exhibit multiple drug resistance. Different antimicrobial susceptibility is present between VanC species, while E.  gallinarum is less susceptible than E.  casseliflavus...|$|R
50|$|Frankfurt's Forest District ranged over 22.123 morgen (4480 hectare). The City Forest, {{belonging}} to Frankfurt since 1372, {{was the most}} important part of the district. It was situated south of the river Main, stretching out over almost 40 square kilometers. The Riederwald, located south of Bornheim, as well as the exclave Hohemark in Taunus, which had been part of Niedererlenbach, Bonames, Niederursel and Dortelweil, also belonged to the forest district. While the use of forests for <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> became less important, the wood harvest was one of the major economic factors. On Wäldchestag, the Tuesday following Whitsun, the majority of the citizens went to the forester's house in the city forest to celebrate Frankurt's biggest folk festival.|$|R
