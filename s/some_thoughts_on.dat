5|$|Two essay {{collections}} {{were published}} during Orwell's lifetime—Inside the Whale and Other Essays in 1940 and Critical Essays in 1946 (the latter {{published in the}} United States as Dickens, Dali, and Others in 1958.) His publisher followed up these anthologies with Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays in 1950, England Your England and Other Essays in 1953—which was revised as Such, Such Were the Joys—and Collected Essays in 1961. The first significant publications in the United States were Doubleday's A Collection of Essays by George Orwell from 1954, 1956's The Orwell Reader, Fiction, Essays, and Reportage from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and Penguin's Selected Essays in 1957; re-released in 1962 with the title Inside the Whale and Other Essays and in abridged form as Why I Write in 2005 {{as a part of}} the Great Ideas series. In the aforementioned series, Penguin also published the short collections Books v. Cigarettes (2008), <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> <b>on</b> the Common Toad (2010), and Decline of the English Murder (2009). The later does not contain the same texts as Decline of the English Murder and Other Essays, published by Penguin in association with Secker & Warburg in 1965. The complete texts Orwell wrote for the Observer are collected in Orwell: The Observer Years published by Atlantic Books in 2003.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, {{he seemed to}} have been {{planning}} two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published Essays on Philosophical Subjects, a history of astronomy down to Smith's own era, plus <b>some</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> ancient physics and metaphysics, probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. Lectures on Jurisprudence were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of The Wealth of Nations, published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms (1763) (first published in 1896); and Essays on Philosophical Subjects (1795).|$|E

500|$|When Locke {{began writing}} {{the letters that}} would {{eventually}} become <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> <b>on</b> Education, he was addressing an aristocrat, but the final text appeals to a much wider audience. For example, Locke writes: [...] "I place Vertue [...] as {{the first and most}} necessary of those Endowments, that belong to a Man or a Gentleman." [...] James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although [...] "he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that many of the things he said about education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to all children" [...] (Axtell's emphasis). This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, [...] "it is certain that this Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are." ...|$|E

500|$|Although both bills failed, {{they led}} to media {{pressure}} that was exacerbated by both Defoe and How. Defoe's A Review, published on 3 December 1709 and demanding [...] "a Law {{in the present}} Parliament... for the Encouragement of Learning, Arts, and Industry, by securing the Property of Books to the Authors or Editors of them", was followed by How's <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> <b>on</b> the Present State of Printing and Bookselling, which hoped that Parliament [...] "might think fit to secure Property in Books by a Law". This was followed by another review by Defoe on 6 December, in which he {{even went so far}} as to provide a draft text for the bill. On 12 December, the Stationers submitted yet another petition asking for legislation on the issue, and the House of Commons gave three MPs – Spencer Compton, Craven Peyton and Edward Wortley – permission to form a drafting committee. On 11 January 1710, Wortley introduced this bill, titling it A Bill for the Encouragement of Learning and for Securing the Property of Copies of Books to the rightful Owners thereof.|$|E

[...] The Kirkus Reviews calls it, [...] "...an essay devoted to resurrecting the name and importance of Edward Blyth, a 19th-century naturalist.
