The <b>mobile</b> <b>groups</b> approach represents a novel mobility support mechanism, {{which can be used}} to handle reliability of mobile agents required at both, the application and system level (e. g., for coordinating distributed agents and for reliable agent migration, respectively). In this paper, we discuss the motivations for the <b>mobile</b> <b>groups</b> approach, formally define their properties, and present a membership protocol for such groups. We also discuss some implementation issues and related performance data, and present the advantages of <b>mobile</b> <b>groups</b> against mechanisms commonly employed for the coordination of mobile agents...|$|R

40|$|Society is {{increasingly}} on the move, mobile devices are commonly {{being used to}} coordinate group actions, and group communication features are rapidly being added to existing technologies. Despite this, {{little is known about}} how <b>mobile</b> <b>groups</b> act, or how communications technologies should be designed to augment existing behaviour. This is partially due to minimal research being done on the topic, but also to the lack of research methods available to study the topic with. <b>Mobile</b> <b>groups</b> are challenging to study because of frequent and long-duration movement, frequent distribution, and the rapidly changing environments they operate within. To address these issues, this research focuses on methodological issues surrounding the development of mobile devices for <b>mobile</b> <b>groups</b> and communities. More specifically it addresses backpackers, who are a relevant example of this type of community. The research primarily explores the convergence of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) and the field of mobile device development. This enables the combination of emphasis on designing technologies for <b>groups,</b> social implications, <b>mobile</b> device design, and mobile settings. Major research outcomes presented in this thesis lie in three areas: 1) methods, 2) technology designs, and 3) backpacker culture. Five studies of backpacker behaviour and requirements form the core of the research. The methods used are in-situ and exploratory, and apply both novel and existing techniques to the domain of backpackers and <b>mobile</b> <b>groups.</b> Methods demonstrated in this research include: field trips for exploring <b>mobile</b> <b>group</b> behaviour and device usage, a social pairing exercise to explore social networks, contextual postcards to gain distributed feedback, and blog analysis which provides post-hoc diary data. Theoretical contributions include: observations on method triangulation, a taxonomy of mobility research, method templates to assist method usage, and identification of key categories leading to <b>mobile</b> <b>group</b> requirements. Design related outcomes include: 57 mobile tourism product ideas, a format for conveying product concepts, and a design for a wearable device to assist mobile researchers. Our understanding of backpacker culture has also improved {{as a consequence of the}} research. It has also generated user requirements to aid mobile development, methods of visualising <b>mobile</b> <b>groups</b> and communities, and a listing of relevant design tensions. Additionally, the research has added to our understanding of how new technologies such as blogs, SMS and iPods are being used by backpackers and how <b>mobile</b> <b>groups</b> naturally communicate...|$|R
