40|$|Rapid double-pulsed {{holographic}} {{techniques were}} used to visualize the shock configurations in the tip region of a lightly loaded, high tip speed fan stage. The holograms showed the passage shock emanating from the blade leading edge, a moderately strong conical shock originating {{at the intersection of}} the part <b>span</b> <b>shroud</b> leading edge and the blade suction surface, and a second conical shock originating at the intersection of the part <b>span</b> <b>shroud</b> and the blade pressure surface. Due to a limited viewing angle, the bow waves upstream of the rotor could not be observed, and only limited details of the trailing edge shocks were obtained. Reasonable details of the shock patterns were obtained from holograms which were made without extensive rig modifications. Results indicate that larger viewing windows and and holographic plates would permit a wider viewing angle and give much more coverage of the regions of interest. Also, shorter time delay for double-pulsed holograms is also desirable, and would minimize blade movement and give clearer holograms...|$|E

40|$|A FORTRAN-IV {{computer}} program {{was developed for}} the calculation of the inviscid transonic/supersonic flow field in a fully three dimensional blade passage of an axial compressor rotor or stator. Rotors may have dampers (part <b>span</b> <b>shrouds).</b> MacCormack's explicit time marching method is used to solve the unsteady Euler equations on a finite difference mesh. This technique captures shocks and smears them over several grid points. Input quantities are blade row geometry, operating conditions and thermodynamic quanities. Output quantities are three velocity components, density and internal energy at each mesh point. Other flow quanities are calculated from these variables. A short graphics package is included with the code, and {{may be used to}} display the finite difference grid, blade geometry and static pressure contour plots on blade to blade calculation surfaces or blade suction and pressure surfaces. The flow in a low aspect ratio transonic compressor was analyzed and compared with high response total pressure probe measurements and gas fluorescence static density measurements made in the MIT blowdown wind tunnel.

40|$|A {{two-stage}} fan with a first rotor {{tip speed}} of 1450 ft/sec (441. 96 m/sec) and no {{inlet guide vanes}} was tested with uniform and distorted inlet flows, with a redesigned second rotor having a part <b>span</b> <b>shroud</b> to prevent flutter, with variable-stagger stators set in nominal positions, and without rotor casing treatment. The fan achieved a pressure ratio 2. 8 at a corrected flow of 185. 4 lbm/sec (84. 0 kg/sec), an adiabatic efficiency of 85. 0 percent, and a stall margin of 12 percent.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the bending mode flutter of a modern transonic fan has been studied using a quasi- 3 D viscous unsteady code. The type of flutter in {{the scope of this}} research is that for a highly loaded blade with a tip relative Mach number just above unity, commonly referred to as transonic stall flutter. This type of flutter is often encountered in modern wide chord fans without a part <b>span</b> <b>shroud.</b> The code written as a part of this research uses an upwinding scheme with Roe's 3 rd-order flux differencing, and Johnson and King's turbulence model with later modification by Johnson and Coakley. An extensive series of code validation calculations were performed and the reliability of the code has been verified against data and other calculational procedures. The calculations of the flow in this fan revealed that the source of the flutter is an oscillation of the passage shock, rather than a stall. As blade loading increases, the passage shock moves forward. Just before the passage shock unstarts, the stability of the passage shock decreases, and the shock oscillates at a large amplitude between unstarted position and started position with small blade vibration. The shock foot of the oscillating passage shock on the blade pressure surface exerts the dominant blade exciting force.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{concerns}} {{the characterization of}} both the steady and unsteady flows and the analysis of stator/rotor interactions of a two-stage axial turbine. The predicted aerodynamic performances show noticeable differences when simulating the turbine stages simultaneously or separately. By considering the multi-blade per row and the scaling technique, the Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) produced better results concerning the effect of pitchwise positions between vanes and blades. The recorded pressure fluctuations exhibit a high unsteadiness characterized by a space–time periodicity described by a double Fourier decomposition. The Fast Fourier Transform FFT analysis of the static pressure fluctuations recorded at different interfaces reveals the existence of principal harmonics and their multiples, and each lobed structure of pressure wave corresponds {{to the number of}} vane/blade count. The potential effect is seen to propagate both upstream and downstream of each blade row and becomes accentuated at low mass flow rates. Between vanes and blades, the potential effect is seen to dominate the quasi totality of blade span, while downstream the blades this effect seems to dominate from hub to mid <b>span.</b> Near the <b>shroud</b> the prevailing effect is rather linked to the blade tip flow structure...|$|R
40|$|Two {{state of}} the art finite element {{reduction}} techniquespreviously validated against the direct finite element method,one based on classical modal analysis and another based oncomponent mode synthesis, are applied for efficient mistunedfree vibration and forced response analysis of several bladeddisk geometries. The methods are first applied to two testcases in order to demonstrate the differences in computationalefficiency as well as to validate the methods againstexperimental data. As previous studies have indicated, nonoticeable differences in accuracy are detected for the currentapplications, while the method based on classical modalanalysis is significantly more efficient. Experimental data(mistuned frequencies and mode shapes) available for one of thetwo test cases are compared with numerical predictions, and agood match is obtained, which adds to the previous validationof the methods (against the direct finite element method). The influence of blade-to-blade coupling and rotation speedon the sensitivity of bladed disks to mistuning is thenstudied. A transonic fan is considered with part <b>span</b> shroudsand without <b>shrouds,</b> respectively, constituting a high and alow blade-to-blade coupling case. For both cases, computationsare performed at rest as well as at various rotation speeds. Mistuning sensitivity is modelled as the dependence ofamplitude magnification on the standard deviation of bladestiffnesses. The finite element reduction technique based onclassical modal analysis is employed for the structuralanalysis. This reduced order model is solved for sets of randomblade stiffnesses with various standard deviations, i. e. MonteCarlo simulations. In order to reduce the sample size, thestatistical data is fitted to a Weibull (type III) parametermodel. Three different parameter estimation techniques areapplied and compared. The key role of blade-to-blade coupling,as well as the ratio of mistuning to coupling, is demonstratedfor the two cases. It is observed that mistuning sensitivityvaries significantly with rotation speed for both fans due toan associated variation in blade-to-blade coupling strength. Focusing on the effect of one specific engine order on themistuned response of the first bending modes, it is observedthat the mistuning sensitivity behaviour of the fan withoutshrouds is unaffected by rotation at its resonant condition,due to insignificant changes in coupling strength at thisspeed. The fan with shrouds, on the other hand, shows asignificantly different behaviour at rest and resonant speed,due to increased coupling under rotation. Comparing the twocases at resonant rotor speeds, the fan without shrouds is lessor equally sensitive to mistuning than the fan with shrouds inthe entire range of mistuning strengths considered. This thesis 9 ̆ 2 scientific contribution centres on themistuning sensitivity study, where the effects of shrouds androtation speed are quantified for realistic bladed diskgeometries. However, also the validation of two finite elementreduction techniques against experimental measurementsconstitutes an important contribution. NR 2014080...|$|R
40|$|Modern steam {{turbines}} often utilize very long last stage buckets (LSB's) in their low-pressure sections to improve efficiency. Some of these LSB’s can {{range in the}} order of 5 feet long. These long buckets (aka "blades") are typically supported at their tip by a tip-shroud and near the mid span by a part <b>span</b> <b>shroud</b> or part span connector (PSC). The PSC is a structural element that connects all the rotor blades, generally at the mid span. It is primarily designed to address various structural issues, often with little attention to its aerodynamic effects. The objective of the current work is to quantify the impact of PSC on aerodynamic performance of the last stage of a LP steam turbine by using detailed CFD analyses. A commercial CFD solver, ANSYS CFXTM, is used to solve the last stage domain by setting steam as the working fluid with linear variation of specific heat ratio with temperature. A tetrahedral grid with prismatic layers near the solid walls is generated using ANSYS WORKBENCHTM. The results show a cylindrical PSC reduces the efficiency of the last stage by 0. 32 pts, of which 0. 20 pts is due to the fillet attaching the PSC to the blade. The results also show insignificant interaction of the PSC with the bucket tip aerodynamics. The work presents a detailed flow field analysis and shows the impact of PSC geometry on the aerodynamic performance of last stage of steam turbine. Present work is useful to turbine designer for trade-off studies of performance and reliability of LSB design with or without PSC...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{an experimental}} and computational {{study of the}} unsteady flow around oscillating blades in low-pressure turbines, with emphasis on the three- dimensional flow behaviour, intra-row interaction effects, tip clearance flow and part- <b>span</b> <b>shroud</b> influence. The research vehicles were a linear low speed oscillating turbine test cascade and a realistic low-pressure steam turbine rotor/stage. Systematic experimental measurements were conducted on the linear turbine cascade, which consists of seven, large scale, prismatic blades with the middle blade being driven to oscillate in a three-dimensional bending/flapping mode. Blades were instrumented with pressure tappings at six span-wise sections between 10 % and 95 % span to facilitate detailed three-dimensional steady and unsteady pressure measurements on the blade surface. Steady flow pressure was measured by using an inclined manometer bank, whilst the unsteady pressure measurements were obtained through off-board pressure transducers. The measured unsteady pressure was superposed to construct tuned cascade flutter data using a technique named the influence coefficient method. This study produced the first known set of 3 D flutter data for tuned turbine cascade. On the computational side, a state-of-the-art, single-passage, three-dimensional, time- marching, Navier-Stokes flow solver has been adopted. The computational solutions of the linear cascade flow exhibits a consistently high level of agreement with the experimental data, which corroborates the experimental findings {{on the one hand}} and acts to validate the present flow solver on the other hand. The results, from several aspects, suggest a strong three-dimensional nature of the unsteady aerodynamic response to the blade first-bending/flapping and clearly demonstrate the inadequacies of the currently widely used two-dimensional and quasi-three-dimensional methods. turbine configurations. It was found that accurate flutter predictions require three- dimensional, multi-row flow solvers including tip clearance modelling. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{need was}} {{identified}} {{to develop an}} analytical performance prediction code for subsonic multistage axial compressors that can be included in network analysis software. It was found that performance calculations based on an elementary one-dimensional meanline prediction method could achieve remarkable accuracy, provided that sound models are used for the losses, deviation and the onset of rotating stall. Consequently, this study focuses on gaining more expertise on the modelling of losses in such compressors through investigating the mechanisms responsible, the methods of predicting them, their implementation and possible usage. Internal losses are seen as mechanisms that increase the entropy of the working fluid through the compressor and it was found that, at a fundamental level, all internal losses are {{a direct result of}} viscous shearing that occurs wherever there are velocity gradients. Usually the methodology employed to predict the magnitudes of these mechanisms uses theoretically separable loss components, ignoring the mechanisms with negligible velocity gradients. For this study these components were presented as: Blade profile losses, endwall losses including tip leakage and secondary losses, part <b>span</b> <b>shroud</b> losses, other losses, losses due to high subsonic Mach numbers and incidence loss. A preliminary performance prediction code, with the capability of interchanging of the different loss models, is presented. Verification was done by comparing the results with those predicted by a commercial software package and the loss models were evaluated according to their ease of implementation and deviation from the predictions of the commercial package. Conclusions were made about the sensitivity of performance prediction to using the different loss models. Furthermore, the combination of loss models that include the most parameters and gave the best comparison to the commercial software predictions was selected in the code to perform parametric studies of the loss parameters on stage efficiency. This was done to illustrate the ability of the code for performing such studies to be used as an aid in understanding compressor design and performance or for basic optimization problems. It can therefore be recommended that the preliminary code can be implemented in an engineering tool or network analysis software. This may however require further verification, with a broader spectrum of test cases, for increased confidence as well as further study regarding aspects like multi-stage annulus blockage and deviationMaster...|$|E
