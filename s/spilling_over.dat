5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid <b>spilling</b> <b>over</b> the top of the glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigate}} return, volatility and leverage <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> effects between banking industrial {{stock markets}} {{of the major}} economies (ME) (Germany, UK and US) and the smaller stressed European Union countries (SE), (Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal) from 2002 to 2014 which includes the global financial crisis period (2007 - 2014). Thus the paper investigates {{the influence of the}} global crisis on the <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> between the banking industrial stock markets of Europe and US. We apply a multivariate GARCH-GJR framework to investigate the effects financial crisis with respect to <b>spill</b> <b>over.</b> Our results indicate an increase in both means and volatility <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> between the major economies and the stressed EU economies from the pre-crisis to the crisis period. During the pre-crisis period there is ample evidence of <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> from the Germany, UK and US to the smaller EU economies. Little evidence of a significant <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> from the smaller economies to the major economies found during this period. Thus we find that return and volatility transmission mechanisms between the major economies and the smaller EU countries are asymmetric during the crisis period. During the crisis, the level and amount of <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> from the major economies increases. But now there is also clear evidence of <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> from smaller EU economies to the major economies also, {{this is especially true for}} Germany and the UK. Evidence of spillover effects suggest the existence of exploitable trading strategies and have important implications to investors in the areas of option pricing, portfolio optimization and risk management. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Orientation: The article {{investigated}} {{the application of}} a suitable estimation model to measure the productivity <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> effects of informal employees. Research purpose: The aim of the article was to estimate the sign and magnitude of productivity <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> effects of informal employees when employee and firm characteristics as well as external factors were considered. Motivation for the study: The researcher thought that empirical research was appropriate because of the belief that, because of low productivity levels in the South African workplace, firms are resorting to greater numbers of informal employees in order to generate positive productivity <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> effects that would improve their levels of competitiveness. Research design, approach and methodology: The researcher constructed real data series on the applicable variables from weekly data that he collected from firms in the sample group over the sample period. He then applied the Nelen, de Grip and Fourage estimation model to determine the sign and magnitude of the <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> effects for the different employee segments. Main findings: The informal employee segment created greater positive productivity <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> effects. This was especially true for older informal employees with longer tenures and lower levels of absenteeism. External factors, like variations in market demand, improved the positive <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> effects that informal employees generated. Practical/managerial implications: Firms might reconsider the composition of their workforce if the informal employee segment consistently generated higher positive productivity <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> effects. Contribution/value-add: The researcher has introduced an estimation procedure that firms can apply to measure the productivity <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> effects of formal and informal employee segments at firm and industry level. </p...|$|R

Since 2005, the insurgency has largely shifted out of Chechnya proper and into the nearby Russian territories, such as Ingushetia and Dagestan; the Russian government, for its part, has focused on the stabilization of the North Caucasus.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{dependence}} on Syriam's revenues, Minye Thihathu did nothing when other rulers {{tried to take}} over the port. In 1601, the Syriam garrison repulsed two separate attacks by Yan Naing, the lord of Prome, and Binnya Law, a Mon lord. Later in the year, the garrison came under siege by Binnya Dala, the Siamese appointed viceroy of Martaban, for seven months until May 1602. Binnya Dala then made peace with De Brito in a marriage of alliance between his daughter and De Brito's son Simon. All the while, Minye Thihathu kept a series of garrisons near Syriam and Martaban to prevent the warfare from <b>spilling</b> <b>over</b> but nothing else. By then, even the authority of the Arakanese king over the Portuguese led garrison was nominal.

The conflict ended later after an amnesty and subsequent stabilization by the provincial military administrator Rahimuddin Khan. Bhutto and his government carried out major reforms such as the establishment and development and re-designing of the country's infrastructure, the establishment of the Joint Chiefs Committee (as well Joint Strategic Forces Command), the reorganization of the military, special forces and chain of commands in the military. Steps were taken for democratization of civil bureaucracy, election commission and the political structure, expansion of country's economic and human infrastructure growth, starting first with the agriculture, land reforms, and government-control (nationalization) of major private industries, industrialization and the expansion of the higher education system throughout the country. In 1974, Bhutto succumbed to increasing pressure from religious parties and helped Parliament to declare the Ahmadiyya adherents as non-Muslims. Bhutto's efforts undermined and dismantled the private-sector and conservative approach for political power in country's political setup.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian {{authorities}} have long expressed {{concern over the}} instability in eastern Libya <b>spilling</b> <b>over</b> into Egypt due {{to the rise of}} jihadist movements in the region, which the government believes to have developed into a safe transit for wanted Islamists following the 2013 coup d'état in Egypt that ousted Muslim Brotherhood-backed president Mohamed Morsi. There have been numerous attacks on Egypt's trade interests in Libya which were rampant prior to Haftar's offensive, especially with the kidnapping of truck drivers and sometimes workers were murdered. Due to this, the military-backed government in Egypt had many reasons to support Haftar's rebellion and the Islamist February 17th Martyrs Brigade operating in Libya has accused the Egyptian government of supplying Haftar with weapons and ammunition, a claim denied by both Cairo and the rebel leader. Furthermore, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has become increasingly popular among many Libyans wishing for stability, has called on the United States to intervene militarily in Libya during his presidential candidacy, warning that Libya was becoming a major security challenge and vowed not to allow the turmoil there to threaten Egypt's national security.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} {{thousands}} of refugees from Central America stressed Mexico's relationship with Guatemala, at one point coming close to war {{as well as a}} politically destabilized Chiapas. Although Mexico is not a signatory to the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, international pressure forced the government to grant official protection to {{at least some of the}} refugees. Camps were established in Chiapas and other southern states, and mostly housed Mayan peoples. However, most Central American refugees from that time never received any official status, estimated by church and charity groups at about half a million from El Salvador alone. The Mexican government resisted direct international intervention in the camps, but eventually relented somewhat because of finances. By 1984, there were 92 camps with 46,000 refugees in Chiapas, concentrated in three areas, mostly near the Guatemalan border. To make matters worse, the Guatemalan army conducted raids into camps on Mexican territories with significant casualties, terrifying the refugees and local populations. From within Mexico, refugees faced threats by local governments who threatened to deport them, legally or not, and local paramilitary groups funded by those worried about the political situation in Central American <b>spilling</b> <b>over</b> into the state. The official government response was to militarize the areas around the camps, which limited international access and migration into Mexico from Central America was restricted. By 1990, it was estimated that there were over 200,000 Guatemalans and half a million from El Salvador, almost all peasant farmers and most under age twenty.|$|E
