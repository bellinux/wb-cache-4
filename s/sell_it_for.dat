5|$|In September 1994, Weisman {{died from}} {{pancreatic}} cancer in Los Angeles, and his relatives {{took over the}} racetrack. Although attendance and handle were increasing, the owners were losing money. Reports by independent auditors stated Rosecroft and Ocean Downs combined to lose $1.1 million in fiscal year (FY) 1992, $1.4 million in FY 1993, and $6.2 million in FY 1994. According to Rosecroft's racing official Allan Levey, Weisman's relatives {{did not want to}} operate the track and their only goal was to <b>sell</b> <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> the 1995 season, Rosecroft could not afford the payment to host five stake races—including the Messenger Stakes—and dropped them from the racing schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} learn that A Lady Writing was traveling from The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. to Hyde Park. The next day {{there is a}} story in the paper of how the painting mysteriously disappeared. A letter from the thief appears in the newspaper, telling the public that he will not give back A Lady Writing until they prove which Vermeer paintings were truly painted by him. This sparks worldwide uproar. Calder and Petra investigate as their friendship grows. Mrs. Sharpe requests police protection and it is revealed that she and Ms. Hussey were two of the three recipients of the thief's letter. Calder and Petra eventually conclude that the painting is hidden in the local Delia Dell Hall, and they sneak out and find it. They barely escape from the thief, who is later found dead from a massive heart attack on the train by the police. They learn that the man is Xavier Glitts,also known as Glitter Man,who was posing as Tommy's stepfather under the name Fred Steadman. A known art thief, he was asked to steal the painting and <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> sixty million dollars. The other recipient of the letter is revealed to be Mr. Watch.|$|E
25|$|Any loan that {{is allowed}} to {{generate}} negative amortization means that the borrower is reducing his equity in his home, which increases the chance that he won't be able to <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> enough to repay the loan. Declining property values would exacerbate this risk.|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} day, Casolaro's friend Ben Mason {{agreed to talk}} to Casolaro about his finances. A few days later, Casolaro showed Mason a 22-point outline for his book and {{expressed}} frustration at having been tied up with a literary agent who was unable to <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the last eighteen months. He also allegedly complained about his sleep being disturbed for the previous three months by calls during the night.|$|E
25|$|Standard Oil's market {{position}} was initially established through {{an emphasis on}} efficiency and responsibility. While most companies dumped gasoline in rivers (this was before the automobile was popular), Standard used it to fuel its machines. While other companies' refineries piled mountains of heavy waste, Rockefeller found ways to <b>sell</b> <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> example, Standard created the first synthetic competitor for beeswax and bought the company that invented and produced Vaseline, the Chesebrough Manufacturing Co., which was a Standard company only from 1908 until 1911.|$|E

50|$|The duplex {{penthouse}} {{has changed}} hands many times. It is 5,000 square feet spanning the 19th and 20th floors, {{with an additional}} 2,000 square feet of terraces. Composer Jerry Herman owned it in the 1970s before <b>selling</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> $1 million to Klein (who later sold it before buying it again in the 1990s). David Geffen later purchased <b>it</b> <b>for</b> $6 million before <b>selling</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> $8.6 million to fellow music executive Steve Gottlieb, who outbid Mike Nichols and Diane Sawyer. Gottlieb actually lives on the 18th floor; after renovating the two floors above him, Gottlieb decided it was too big for his needs {{and put it on}} the market for $35 million in 2012.|$|R
25|$|By 1845, {{all that}} was left of the Stourbridge Lion was its boiler. The boiler was still functional, however, and it was used in a foundry in Carbondale for about another five years until the foundry's owner headed west to try his luck as a Forty-niner. The foundry was sold a few years later to new owners who {{recognized}} the boiler's value as a piece of history, and reportedly tried to <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> $1,000 (equal to $ today) in 1874. The owners weren't able to find a buyer so they hung onto it themselves.|$|E
25|$|Veiller {{used his}} {{experience}} as a crime reporter to develop the play, but he was initially unable to find a producer for it. He finally settled on selling the rights to the play, along with two others he had written, for a fixed fee. After an unsuccessful run in Chicago, it became a huge hit on Broadway in 1912–1913, running for 541 performances. It was subsequently performed by multiple road companies and adapted as a movie five times. Although {{it was one of the}} biggest hits of its era, Veiller got relatively little income from it due to his decision to <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a lump sum.|$|E
25|$|The {{sales and}} {{marketing}} stage is closely intertwined with the editorial process. As front cover images are produced, or chapters are edited, sales people may start talking about the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often produce advanced information sheets that may be sent to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. As early interest is measured, this information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting {{of the book and}} the strategy employed to <b>sell</b> <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.|$|E

25|$|Edison's major {{innovation}} was {{the establishment}} of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars.), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.|$|E
25|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{the major}} food and cash crop after banana, in the {{highland}} region. Next in order of priority are maize, beans and wheat. In order to increase the growth of these crops in the highland region, inter cropping of bean, potato, pea and wheat was tested on an experimental basis with Seasbani sesban (Sesbania); lime and manure were added as supplements for the growth. Species of shrubs such as Sasbania, Leucaena, Calliandra and Markamia showed better growth than in the Central Plateau Region where similar studies were conducted. Studies have been conducted since 1987 by the National Agricultural Research Institute (ISAR) who maintains a substation in Rwerere, Western Province within the highlands. In order to increase agricultural production with use new commercial crops have been adopted in the project area. The crops adopted are maracuja (passion fruit), an export item, and potatoes. In addition, modern livestock breeding techniques have also been adopted. This project under the aegeis of IFAD, has been found successful in increasing the incomes and purchasing power of the farmers and pastorals. A local NGO supports women {{who live in the}} highlands to collect clay and <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> use in the construction of bricks and roof tiles.|$|E

It criticised the keyboard; [...] "inexpensive or not, the ... layout is impossible to justify ... poorly designed in several respects". The review was skeptical of the computer's appeal to American consumers if sold for US$220—"hardly competitive with comparable low-cost American units"—and expected that Timex would <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> $125–150.|$|E

500|$|The band's {{political}} sentiments were {{reflected in}} their resistance to the music industry's usual profit motivations; even at their peak, tickets to shows and souvenirs were reasonably priced. The group insisted that CBS sell their double and triple album sets London Calling and Sandinista! {{for the price of}} a single album each (then £5), succeeding with the former and compromising with the latter by agreeing to <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> £5.99 and forfeit all their performance royalties on its first 200,000 sales. These [...] "VFM" [...] (value for money) principles meant that they were constantly in debt to CBS, and only started to break even around 1982.|$|E
500|$|Nick Fury, {{director}} of S.H.I.E.L.D., approaches Stark, revealing [...] "Rushman" [...] to be Agent Natasha Romanoff and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father jointly invented the arc reactor with Stark, but when Anton tried to <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> profit, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the gulag. Fury gives Stark {{some of his}} father's old material; a hidden message in the diorama of the 1974 Stark Expo proves to be a diagram {{of the structure of}} a new element. With the aid of his computer J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark synthesizes it. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.|$|E

By May 2010, {{mephedrone}} had been detected in all 22 EU member states that reported to Europol, {{as well as in}} Croatia and Norway. The Daily Telegraph reported in April 2009 that it was manufactured in China, but it has since been made illegal there. In March 2009, Druglink magazine reported it only cost a [...] "couple of hundred pounds" [...] to synthesise a kilogram of mephedrone, the same month, The Daily Telegraph reported manufacturers were making [...] "huge amounts of money" [...] from selling it. In January 2010, Druglink magazine reported dealers in Britain spent £2,500 to ship one kilogram from China, but could <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> £10 a gram, making a profit of £7,500. A later report, in March 2010, stated the wholesale price of mephedrone was £4000 per kilogram.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} The Sun Also Rises {{guaranteed}} interest from Broadway and Hollywood. In 1927 two Broadway producers wanted {{to adapt the}} story for the stage but made no immediate offers. Hemingway considered marketing the story directly to Hollywood, telling his editor Max Perkins {{that he would not}} <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> less than $30,000—money he wanted his estranged wife Hadley Richardson to have. Conrad Aiken thought the book was perfect for a film adaptation solely on the strength of dialogue. Hemingway would not see a stage or film adaption anytime soon: he sold the film rights to RKO Pictures in 1932, but only in 1956 was the novel adapted to a film of the same name. Peter Viertel wrote the screenplay. Tyrone Power as Jake played the lead role opposite Ava Gardner as Brett and Errol Flynn as Mike. The royalties went to Richardson. [...] It was again adapted into a film in 1984. It was adapted into a one-act opera in 2000.|$|E
500|$|Asda, {{along with}} several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily {{discounted}} price, sparked a price war {{two days before the}} book's launch by announcing they would <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> just £5 a copy. Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a loss leader. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone's, the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, [...] "It is a war we can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans." [...] Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: [...] "You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, as its use {{became more}} prevalent, many {{countries}} passed legislation prohibiting mephedrone. It became illegal in Croatia and Germany in January, followed by Romania and the Isle of Man in February. In March 2010, it {{was classified as}} an unregulated medicine in the Netherlands, making the sale and distribution of it illegal. The importation of mephedrone into the UK was banned on 29 March 2010. The next day, the ACMD in the UK published {{a report on the}} cathinones, including mephedrone, and recommended they be classified as Class B drugs. On 7 April 2010, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2010 was passed by parliament, making mephedrone and other substituted cathinones, Class B drugs from 16 April 2010. Prior to the ban taking effect, mephedrone was not covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It was, though, an offence under the Medicines Act to <b>sell</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> human consumption, so it was often sold as [...] "plant food" [...] or [...] "bath salts", although it has no use as these products; this, too, was possibly illegal under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. In the US, similar descriptions have been used to describe mephedrone, as well as methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). In May 2010, the Republic of Ireland made mephedrone illegal, followed by Belgium, Italy, Lithuania, France and Norway in June and Russia in July. In August 2010, Austria and Poland made it illegal and China announced it would be illegal as of 1 September 2010. Mephedrone had been reported to be used in Singapore in February 2010, but it was made illegal in November 2010. In December 2010, following the advice of the EMCDDA, mephedrone was made illegal throughout the EU, a move Switzerland also made shortly afterwards. Countries which have not already banned it, such as the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal, will need to change legislation to comply with the EU ruling. In Hungary, a government advisory body recommended mephedrone should be made illegal in August 2010, which was followed, making it illegal in January 2011; Spain followed in February 2011. Mexico, by decree, outlawed mephedrone as a substance [...] "with low or no therapeutical use which pose a serious threat to public health" [...] in 2014.|$|E
