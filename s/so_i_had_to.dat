25|$|In an {{interview}} in the German daily Die Welt on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism on German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose “merciful” solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, want to change it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make myself very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, are nothing unusual. Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke recalled. He also recalled that Pope John Paul II had ruled out women’s ordination “once and for all”.|$|E
500|$|For most of Bullock's shots, she {{was placed}} inside a giant, {{mechanical}} rig. Getting into the rig took {{a significant amount}} of time, so Bullock chose to stay in it for up to 10 hours a day, communicating with others through a headset. Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious – [...] "no space suit opens up at the front – but we had to do that in order for her to get out. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> redesign it and readapt all the functions of the suit for front opening." ...|$|E

500|$|A 163-minute {{version of}} the film competed in the main {{competition}} of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The Cannes cut lacked much of the finished film's sound design, and some visual effects were not fully in place. Noé said about the version: [...] "the film was like a baby of three months. I took {{it out of my}} belly to show it, flattered by [...] Thierry Frémaux's invitation, but it was still in gestation. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> put it back into my belly, that is to say to tweak many details." ...|$|E
500|$|Hergé's main assistant, Bob de Moor, {{showed an}} {{interest}} in completing the book following Hergé's death. In de Moor's words, [...] "Personally I {{would have loved to}} finish Alph-Art. It would have been a tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn't insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> finish it." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker {{and casting}} {{director}} Juliet Taylor held open casting calls in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, New York City and Philadelphia. Matthew Modine originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Al Columbato, but Parker decided to cast him as Birdy, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "introverted honest quality" [...] that best suited the character. Modine said, [...] "I was flabbergasted because I hadn't auditioned for Birdy. I had never imagined playing the part of Birdy. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> really go through an extraordinary transformation in my mind of trying to bring this remarkable character to life.

500|$|In {{the final}} part of qualifying, Massa set the fastest time, taking pole {{position}} from second placed Alonso {{in the last}} few seconds as rain began to fall, with Räikkönen completing the top three. Massa's lap of 1:35.043 marked tyre company Bridgestone's 100th pole position in Formula One. Hamilton came fourth, over half a second behind the leading three. He conceded inexperience was to blame, saying that there were [...] "some spots of rain on my visor, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sort of let off". Heidfeld qualified fifth, ahead of Nico Rosberg in sixth and teammate Kubica in seventh. The Toyotas of Trulli and Schumacher were eighth and ninth, with Webber completing the top ten.|$|E
500|$|For {{several years}} after he had turned 40, Miller {{concentrated}} on composing and playing his own music. He therefore reduced his recording and club appearances, as well as one-day associations. The stimulus for this change had built gradually from Miller's first studio recording in 1981: [...] "my recording activity increased {{and by the time}} that it got into 1986–87 I was on so many records it was unbelievable until eventually it became rather overwhelming and stressful, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> cut back." [...] He did continue to record, often with musicians he had established relationships with: in 1996 he reunited with Williams to appear on what became the drummer's final recording, Young at Heart; further albums led by Kenny Garrett, Nelson, Reeves, and others were made in the period 1997–99.|$|E

500|$|After the 1983–84 season, Olajuwon {{debated whether}} {{to stay in}} college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time (before the NBA Draft Lottery was {{introduced}} in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: [...] "I really believed that Houston {{was going to win}} the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make that decision (to leave early)." [...] His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton, and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in time, [...] Morrison was under {{pressure}} by Warner Bros. Records to produce chart singles and two albums within a year. [...] His previous album, His Band and the Street Choir, had been released in November 1970. [...] In an interview with journalist Sean O'Hagan in 1990, he described this period as being {{in contrast to the}} laid back atmosphere pictured on the album cover: [...] "When I went to the West Coast these people [...] weren't that available <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> virtually put a completely new band together overnight to do [...] So it was a very tough period. I didn't want to change my band but if I wanted to get into the studio I had to ring up and get somebody. That was the predicament I was in." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Sanz {{suffered}} a mental breakdown and took two months off {{in the middle of}} a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel. He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay. A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely." [...] Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which [...] "helped [...] a lot" [...] and gave him [...] "more power" [...] to perform.|$|E

500|$|The Age of Plastic {{lasts for}} a total length of 36 minutes and 24 seconds. Unable to make the album sound like what was typical of other records {{released}} in the late 1970s, as well as finding it boring, Horn [...] "figured that if I couldn't get records to sound like Elton John, which I couldn't because I couldn't {{figure out how they}} did it, then whatever I could do, I'd better exaggerate it." [...] He had also wanted to [...] "perverse things with sound, except that in 1978 and 1979, none of the equipment which would later allow me to do that was available. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pre-date that technology by finding my own ways of achieving certain sounds." [...] Audio noted the album's sound to be reminiscent of duo Godley & Creme's debut album Consequences.|$|E
500|$|The entire sub-plot {{featuring}} Susanne Modeski {{caused a}} minor continuity error {{that had to}} be retconned. Bruce Harwood, the actor who portrayed Byers, originally wore a wedding ring when he first portrayed the character, noting, [...] "I'd worn my wedding ring [...] so I imagined a married life for Byers". During the filming of [...] "Unusual Suspects"—an episode that would largely feature Byers feeling a romantic connection to Susanne—Harwood removed his wedding ring, deducing that in 1989, when the episode took place, Byers had not been married yet. However, [...] "Three of a Kind"—which takes place in 1999—features Byers once again romantically drawn to Susanne. Harwood explained, [...] "And then [...] brought back the character Suzanne [...] Modeski back in season six, and {{that was supposed to be}} in the present. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> redo my back story; I said Byers had been divorced".|$|E
500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E
5000|$|The lyrics {{consist of}} {{constant}} repetition {{of a few}} simple rhymes: [...] "Hey, you, hawk of Lebanon. Hey, you, Nasrallah.

500|$|By September 2013, Sia was {{recording}} vocal tracks at {{her home}} studio {{with the hope of}} releasing a new album the following spring.

The singer agreed to a contract for a new album in which she was not obliged to tour or do press appearances to promote the album. In an interview published by NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that 1000 Forms of Fear was released as a contractual obligation: [...] "Basically, I put this out {{to get out of my}} publishing deal. I was planning to be a pop song writer for other artists. But my publishing deal was as an artist <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> put one more album out.

Tim Nixon of The Sun wrote that the [...] "red hot chemistry" [...] between Rihanna and Timberlake must have been difficult for their partners to watch. Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said that Timberlake's partner Jessica Biel was [...] "said to be 'sick to her stomach' after seeing Rihanna wearing a revealing outfit while filming with Timberlake." [...] Timberlake told Access Hollywood, [...] "I’m {{the guy in the}} video, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give them all insecurities about that.

500|$|When it {{came time}} to write the episode however, Kaling had to perform a Google search, as she had {{forgotten}} many details. She explained, [...] "I was a little embarrassed with how little I knew about it. I'm Hindu, but I'm not really a practicing Hindu, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do a lot of research." [...] Kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture, at first being concerned that Daniels [...] "and people I work with were a little antsy about assigning the Hindu writer the Indian episode. I didn't want to feel like they pigeonholed me, but I felt like I'd done enough episodes that it was okay." [...] She found that making the episode [...] "was kind of the perfect meeting of being the child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show." [...] The series writers have since joked that they should do a Diwali-themed episode every year in the same vein as the Christmas specials.|$|E
