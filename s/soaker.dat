5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, <b>soaker</b> hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E

2500|$|After {{seedlings}} are planted, {{the soil}} around the roots should be watered.

To achieve water-conservation, <b>soaker</b> hoses, drip irrigation, distribution of mulch to prevent water evaporation, and a soil ring around the plant to retain water may be effective. It should be noted that overwatering may cause root issues. Soil drenching is effective in increasing the size of the shoots.|$|E

60|$|Amid {{the general}} vacant hilarity of the {{assembly}} a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing {{what might be the}} cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad's bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady what's got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low <b>soaker</b> without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.

50|$|In <b>soaker</b> visbreaking, {{the bulk}} of the {{cracking}} reaction occurs not in the furnace but in a drum located after the furnace called the <b>soaker.</b> Here the oil is held at an elevated temperature for a pre-determined period of time to allow cracking to occur before being quenched. The oil then passes to a fractionator. In <b>soaker</b> visbreaking, lower temperatures are used than in coil visbreaking. The comparatively long duration of the cracking reaction is used instead.|$|E
50|$|Another {{simple method}} {{employed}} is a syringe or piston type. In essence, the water gun {{is made up}} primarily (sometimes exclusively) of the pumping mechanism that comprises an outer pump shaft with an inner pump-rod and water-tight seal. This allows water {{to be drawn into}} the pump as the pump is extended, then forcibly ejected out as the pump is compressed. Stream performance is dependent on the user's strength. Some models, like the Super <b>Soaker</b> Power <b>Soaker</b> Jr. and Stream Machines draw in and expel water from their nozzles. This design requires a bucket-type filling source. Other models, like the Super <b>Soaker</b> Power <b>Soaker</b> Mighty Cannon and Water Warriors Steady Stream, have check valves and a reservoir for portability.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJohn F. SmithA {{series of}} {{experiments}} was developed to investigate how Korral Kool® (KK) systems work in arid climates to prevent heat stress on dairy cows. These experiments were conducted during summer on a commercial dairy farm in eastern Saudi Arabia. In the first experiment, the core body temperatures (CBT) of 63 multiparous cows were evaluated when KK were operated for 18, 21 and 24 h/d. Animals were housed in 9 different pens, which {{were randomly assigned to}} treatment sequence in a 3 x 3 Latin square design. In the second experiment, 21 multiparous and 21 primiparous cows were housed in 6 different pens, which were randomly assigned to sequence of treatments (KK operated for 21 or 24 h/d) in a switchback design. In the third experiment, 7 primiparous and 6 multiparous lactating cows were assigned to one of two pens, which were randomly assigned to treatment sequence in a switchback design. Treatments in the third experiment were KK used with or without feedline <b>soakers</b> 24 h/d. In the fourth experiment, 20 multiparous cows were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two pens, which were randomly assigned to treatment sequence in a switchback design. Treatments in this experiment were KK operated for 24 h/d while feedline <b>soakers</b> were operated for 12 h/d. In the fifth experiment, 2 different sizes of KK were compared (BIG and SMALL); 48 multiparous cows were randomly assigned to 8 pens and pens were randomly assigned to sequence of treatments (KK were operated for 21 or 24 h/d) in a switchback design. Results demonstrated that for multiparous cows in desert climate conditions, it is advisable to operate KK systems continuously regardless of the size of KK system used, whereas KK operating time could potentially be reduced from 24 to 21 h for primiparous cows. Reducing operation time should be done carefully, however, because CBT was elevated in all treatments. Feedline <b>soakers</b> complementing KK systems decreased the CBT of dairy cows housed in desert environments. However, the combined systems were not adequate to lower CBT to normal temperatures in this extreme environment...|$|R
