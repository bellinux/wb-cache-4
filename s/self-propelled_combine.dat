25|$|In 1947, John Deere {{introduced}} its first <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine,</b> the model 55. It was soon {{followed by the}} smaller models 40 and 45, the larger model 95, and an even larger model 105 {{was introduced in the}} 1960s. In the mid-1950s, Deere introduced attachable corn heads, allowing crop producers to cut, shell, and clean corn in one smooth operation.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Deere {{replaced}} the 6620, 7720, and 8820 {{with a new}} line of completely redesigned 'Maximizer' combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines were completely redesigned and featured a center-mounted cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, PTO shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.|$|E
2500|$|Like Model T {{cars and}} trucks, the Fordson tractor {{provided}} {{the basis for}} a large and varied aftermarket in accessories and conversions. A pair of articles in a 1922 issue of the Chilton Tractor Journal describes the business environment and gives photographs of many of the attachments and conversions available. As with most other tractors, farmers and construction contractors could buy aftermarket governors, ignition parts, hitches and drawbars; but with the Fordson especially, one could buy a crawler tractor, road grader, or <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> built by an aftermarket firm that used the Fordson essentially as a platform. For example, the original Gleaner self-propelled combines were built by attaching the combine to a Fordson. At least 3 companies offered crawler conversions, and others offered enlarged cleats, including the [...] "overgrown tire chain" [...] type that had led to crawler development not long before. Several companies converted Fordsons to road graders; the Wehr (...) is well remembered. [...] The first tricycle cultivator version of the Fordson was available as an aftermarket conversion by the Moline Implement Company as early as 1920 or 1921, [...] which was 3 to 4 years before the Farmall was introduced, a full decade before Dearborn prototyped the Fordson All-Around, [...] and a full decade and a half before Ford Ltd produced that model. It lacked those tractors' high clearance but was otherwise prescient.|$|E

50|$|After the war, the Stalinets-6 {{combines}} harvesters were {{assembled and}} in 1955 Rostselmash began {{to specialize in}} grain harvester production. In 1958, the SK-3 <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combines</b> were introduced followed by the SK-4 in 1962. By 1969, Rostselmash produced 1,000,000 combine harvesters. The SK Niva combines, introduced in 1973, remain in production for the Eastern European market.|$|R

Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a stationary threshing machine, these combines cut, threshed, and separated the grain while moving continuously through the field.|$|R
50|$|Bhadson is a {{developing}} town. It has made tremendous {{progress in the}} field of industry and technology. It is well-known all over India for manufacturing of harvester combines. The first two harvester combine industries in India are manufactured by SANT combines and KARTAR combine, Bhadson. Now there are many firms which are manufacturing harvester combines and other agricultural implements. Bhadson has become very famous for the manufacture of wheat threshers, agricultural and farm machinery, such as tractor driven <b>combines,</b> <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combines</b> with self-developed indigenous technology.|$|R
50|$|The Gleaner E was a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> {{harvester}} {{manufactured by}} the Gleaner Manufacturing Company while {{part of the}} Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company in the 1960s. 17,300 machines were manufactured in total from 1962 to 1969.|$|E
50|$|The Matador Gigant, {{initially}} called Matador is a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> harvester {{produced by}} the German agricultural company Claas in Harsewinkel.

From 1961 to 1969, approximately 35,000 Matador series combine harvesters were made.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, {{following}} the war, Claas introduced <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> harvesters. By the mid 1950s they {{opened a new}} factory in Paderborn, Germany, and their first outside Germany - in Metz, France in 1961. Claas took over Josef Bautz, (agricultural machinery factory) in 1969 and expanded the product range to include green harvest machinery.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} decennia the {{internal}} combustion engine; first the petrol engine, and later diesel engines; became {{the main source}} of power {{for the next generation of}} tractors. Early companies expanded into the tractor business, such as John Deere which bought the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor. In the 1930s new technologies as rubber ties and hydrologics were introduced in tractors and other farm machinery. The diesel engines also contributed to the development of the <b>self-propelled,</b> <b>combined</b> harvester and thresher, or combine harvester (also shortened to 'combine'). Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a stationary threshing machine, these combines cut, threshed, and separated the grain while moving continuously through the field.|$|R
50|$|<b>Self-propelled</b> Gleaner <b>combines</b> {{could be}} fitted with special tracks instead of tires or tires with tread {{measuring}} almost 10in deep {{to assist in}} harvesting rice. Some combines, particularly pull type, have tires with a diamond tread which prevents sinking in mud. These tracks can fit other combines by having adapter plates made.|$|R

50|$|In 1952 Claeys {{produced}} the first European <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> harvester {{and by the}} 1960s, Claeys {{was one of the}} biggest combine manufacturers in Europe; in 1964 the majority of Claeys was acquired by Sperry New Holland. In 1967 the company changed the name in Clayson and in 1986 was merged with Ford. In 1991 Ford was acquired by Fiatagri and became New Holland.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., Allis-Chalmers, Massey-Harris, International Harvester, Gleaner Manufacturing Company, John Deere, and Minneapolis Moline are past {{or present}} major combine producers.In 1937, the Australian-born Thomas Carroll, working for Massey-Harris in Canada, perfected a {{self-propelled}} model and in 1940 a lighter-weight model began to be marketed widely by the company. Lyle Yost invented an auger that would lift grain out of a combine in 1947, making unloading grain much easier. In 1952 Claeys launched the first <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> harvester in Europe; in 1953, the European manufacturer Claas developed a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> harvester named 'Hercules', it could harvest up to 5 tons of wheat a day. This newer kind of combine is still in use and is powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Until the self-cleaning rotary screen was invented in the mid-1960s combine engines suffered from overheating as the chaff spewed out when harvesting small grains would clog radiators, blocking the airflow needed for cooling.|$|E
5000|$|Laverda is a {{manufacturer}} of combine harvesters and hay equipment, based in Breganze, Italy. It was founded in 1873 by Pietro Laverda to produce farming implements in the Province of Vicenza. 1956 was the year the first <b>self-propelled</b> Laverda <b>combine,</b> the M 60, was manufactured. Laverda formed a partnership with Fiat in 1981, and would {{be a part of}} that company for some 20 years.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Self-propelled</b> <b>combines</b> {{started with}} {{standard}} manual transmissions that provided one speed based on input rpm. Deficiencies were noted {{and in the}} early 1950s combines were equipped with what John Deere called the [...] "Variable Speed Drive". This was simply a variable width sheave controlled by spring and hydraulic pressures. This sheave was attached to the input shaft of the transmission. A standard 4 speed manual transmission was still used in this drive system. The operator would select a gear, typically 3rd. An extra control was provided to the operator to allow him to speed up and slow down the machine within the limits provided by the variable speed drive system. By decreasing the width of the sheave on the input shaft of the transmission, the belt would ride higher in the groove. This slowed the rotating speed on the input shaft of the transmission, thus slowing the ground speed for that gear. A clutch was still provided to allow the operator to stop the machine and change transmission gears.|$|R
50|$|The ISU-152 <b>self-propelled</b> gun <b>combined</b> three battle roles : heavy assault gun, heavy tank {{destroyer}} {{and heavy}} self-propelled artillery. The 152.4 mm gun used {{a number of}} powerful (shell and charge) ammunition. Some of these ammunition had a 43.56 kg high-explosive shell, or a 48.78 kg armour-piercing shell, or the heaviest of all, the 53-G-545 (53-Г-545) long-range concrete-piercing ammunition with a 56 kg shell. The ISU-152 was used for infantry and tank support, and attack on fortified positions in a direct fire role, for support on the battlefield in an indirect fire role, and for fight against tanks with a direct fire.|$|R
50|$|Massey and Harris both became {{pre-eminent}} in harvesting machinery, {{and eventually}} the arch rivals merged in 1891. The new company was responsible for producing the world’s first commercially successful <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> harvester in 1938. Massey-Harris merged with the Ferguson Company in 1953 and brought together their twin skills in harvesting machinery and tractor design to produce one of the world’s most powerful forces in farm equipment.|$|E
50|$|In 1943 Mr. Lodigiani was {{the sole}} owner of Bubba S.A. when the D42, with 42HP, {{an updated version of}} the Ariete, was released. Unfortunately due to the war it was not very successful. Then came the Centauro a 45/55 HP crawler tractor. During the same period Bubba S.A. tested their first {{self-propelled}} threshers with full track. In 1948 Bubba produced the first Italian <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> harvester, the 1500, preceded only by Massey Harris in 1941.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954, {{there was}} the {{introduction}} of Jupiter, a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> harvester. This harvester was very modern and advanced for the time, being able to work through not only one, but {{many different types of}} grain. In 1966, Fella added yet another product to their line: silos. In the 1980s and 1990s Fella really began to focus on their forage product range. They kept a large product range, but focused on advancing in the forage harvesting industry.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{prominent}} tractor division, IH also sold several {{different types of}} farm-related equipment, such as balers, cultivators, <b>combines</b> (<b>self-propelled</b> and pull behind), combine heads, corn shellers, cotton pickers, manure spreaders, hay rakes, crop dusters, disk harrows, elevators, feed grinders, hammer mills, hay conditioners, milking machines, planters, mills, discs, plows, and miscellaneous equipment.|$|R
50|$|The Selbstfahrer is a <b>self-propelled</b> {{straw walker}} <b>combine</b> harvester. For the German market, the Selbstfahrer was offered with a 2600 mm header, in other countries, a 3000 mm and a 3600 mm header were offered as well. The header - {{designed}} for harvesting bent fruit - and the reel are adjustable vertically with a hydraulic system. The knife cutter bar is replaceable with a pickup-reel. The Selbstfahrer is usable as a stationary threshing machine as well.|$|R
5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, <b>self-propelled</b> mechanical harvesters (<b>combines),</b> planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|R
50|$|Case {{evolved as}} World War II arrived, {{becoming}} involved in the manufacturing of shells for the United States and allied forces military, as well as airplane parts for the B-26s, bombs, and doors for the Sherman Tank. Three new plants were opened across the United States during that year, and, in 1942, the company produced its first <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine.</b> That same year, Case released the company's first cotton picker, which is currently preserved by the Smithsonian society. A protracted 440-day strike in Wisconsin of theCase factory weakened the company.|$|E
50|$|The post-revolution and postwar periods gave a {{new life}} to the city. The power {{machinery}} engineering, metallurgical production, instrument-making and other industry branches began to develop. The development of science was closely connected with the inauguration of the Taganrog State University of Radio Engineering. In the seventies and eighties, Taganrog was known as an important scientific and industrial center of Southern Russia. Taganrog companies produced: steam-boilers, <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> harvesters, drill-, casing-, oil-, gas-, and water-pipes, gears for searching fish and other installations. Taganrog products were exported to over 50 countries of the world.|$|E
50|$|Grain {{harvesting}} was revolutionized by Massey engineer Tom Carroll in 1938 {{with the}} world's first <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> - the No. 20. —but {{it was too}} heavy and expensive for extensive mass production. However, it served {{as a guide for}} the building of the lighter and less costly No. 21, which was tested in 1940 and put on sale in 1941. The Massey-Harris No. 21 Combine was commemorated with a Canada Post stamp on June 8, 1996. E.P. Taylor, one of C.D. Howe's dollar-a-year men, joined the board of directors in 1942, and Eric Phillips joined management in 1946.|$|E
5000|$|The Gleaner {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} in <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combines.</b> They were often {{considered}} the [...] "Cadillac" [...] of the industry because of this feature and because of their sound engineering. Buescher (1991) credited the design principally to one of the brothers, Curt Baldwin, and explained that it focused on the needs of custom cutters like the Baldwin brothers themselves—contractors who move north with the harvest season, selling harvesting services to farmers. It resulted in machines that were extraordinarily reliable and useful, which benefited not only custom cutters but anyone who bought a Gleaner. The short wheelbase and axle track allowed the combine to fit on a truck. The grain header {{did not need to be}} detached for transit, because it fit over the cab of the truck. Buescher said, [...] "Since custom cutters didn't know where their next parts supply source would be, Baldwin designed his combine so that it wouldn't need parts." [...] (Buescher's tongue-in-cheek point is that the machines were designed and built well so that need for repairs would be minimal.) The frame was [...] "like a bridge" [...] in its strength. The bearings were chosen with service in mind—large and good quality (to obviate service) and of common sizes (so that the operator could carry merely a small stock of spares in his truck and yet be certain to have the size he needed when a replacement did become necessary). The Gleaner's exterior sheet metal was galvanized (zinc plated), giving it weather resistance superior to that of typical farm equipment, which was painted but not plated. As Buescher said, [...] "Baldwin reasoned that most of his combines would sit outdoors. Texas and Oklahoma dust storms have a way of peeling paint off of machinery." [...] As a result of the silver color of the zinc plating, the Gleaner brand ended up having a distinctive color (just as Allis had Persian Orange, IH had red, and John Deere had green), despite the sheet metal not even having any paint.|$|R

The scaling trends of the time-averaged thrust forces are shown to be predicted accurately by Garrick's theory. However, the scaling of the time-averaged power for finite amplitude motions is shown to deviate from the theory. Novel time-averaged power scalings are presented that account for a contribution from added-mass forces, from the large-amplitude separating shear layer at the trailing-edge, and from {{the proximity of the}} trailing-edge vortex. Scaling laws for the self-propelled speed, efficiency and cost of transport (CoT) are subsequently derived. Using these scaling relations the self-propelled metrics can be predicted to within 5...|$|R
50|$|The Selbstfahrer is {{the first}} <b>self-propelled</b> <b>combine</b> {{harvester}} by Claas. It was produced 19.465 times from 1952 to 1963. The German name Selbstfahrer literally means Self-propeller and in the German agricultural language, it refers to a combine harvester or agricultural machine that can propel itself. Initially, {{the name of the}} Selbstfahrer was Hercules; due to an already registered trademark with the name Hercules, the combine harvester was renamed SF for Selbstfahrer in 1953. In contemporary brochures, the Selbstfahrer is called Claas Selbstfahrer Type S.F.55. It was targeted at agricultural contractors and large farms in Europe. In 1961, the Selbstfahrer was succeeded by the Matador. However, it was kept in production until 1963.|$|E
