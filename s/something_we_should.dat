"Fly on the Wall" [...] is {{prominently}} an electropop {{song that}} is also composed {{of a number of}} hooks, which yell the song's title, while the instrumentation relies on electric guitars. Unlike other songs on Breakout, [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] has Cyrus' voice processed to sound different. The song's lyrics taunt [...] "the listener for being on the outside of her inner sanctum". The target of the message has been interpreted differently by contemporary critics – an ex-boyfriend and the media have most commonly been referred to. [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] is a contemporary ballad that contains a sound reflecting influences from minimalist music. The backdrop for the [...] "feel-bad" [...] love song features ocean wave sounds. The track [...] "Wake Up America" [...] has a [...] "cheeky riff-rock backdrop" [...] as its, while its lyrical content concerns environmentalism, where Cyrus mainly pleads for audiences to give the Earth [...] "just a little attention". In the first verse, she [...] "admits that she doesn't know exactly what's up with this global warming but believes there's <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all do about it". [...] "These Four Walls" [...] is a power ballad accented with country pop elements and twangy vocals and lyrics which speak of an interior narrative. [...] "Simple Song" [...] has [...] "bile" [...] sound and is lyrically about moments in coming of age where a person [...] "can't tell which way is up, which way is down" [...] and they feel the need to alienate themselves. In [...] "Goodbye", Cyrus' vocal performance is more [...] "roosty" [...] with a more [...] "natural-sounding accompaniment" [...] while, in the lyrics, she finds her remembering the [...] "simple things ... until [...]" [...] "See You Again" [...] (Rock Mafia Remix) is dance-pop number, fusing sultry vocals with techno beats. The track has Cyrus detailing previous scenes and plans to redeem herself.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} launch, David Campbell {{was quoted as}} saying that [...] "the music policy was wrong, even though Virgin had lots of {{research}} to suggest it was doing what listeners said they wanted. We did <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never do: pursue critical acclaim, playing obscure tracks, gaining the praise of the music press." [...] The station's approach had been to mix in more familiar music.|$|E
2500|$|The Hong Kong {{government}} {{welcomed the}} NPCSC decision. Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said that [...] "the majority of Hong Kong citizens, namely, the 5 million qualified voters {{of the selection}} of Chief Executive in 2017, {{will be able to}} cast their votes to select the chief executive." [...] He also said [...] "this is the first opportunity – a very good opportunity – for Hong Kong to have one man, one vote – universal suffrage. This is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all feel proud of." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, in ’t Hooft’s opinion: “History {{tells us}} that if we hit upon some obstacle, even {{if it looks like}} a pure {{formality}} or just a technical complication, it should be carefully scrutinized.

2500|$|On 19 February 2015, it was {{revealed}} West had already filmed his final scenes and left the show. Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, saddening Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come in and see her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising what it might be. He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible really, <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all look at and not do the same. What Men United seeks to do, and it's terribly important, is to hold out a hand to people to say, 'Come on, you will see people here with whom you can swap experiences, swap ideas, swap thoughts, swap feelings'. You don't have to stand there and wait for people to come, because they won't. You just need a little push and you will like it when you get there." ...|$|E

60|$|Secondly, OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF MODES, being {{voluntary}} {{collections of}} simple ideas, which the mind puts together, {{without reference to}} any real archetypes, or standing patterns, existing anywhere, are and cannot but be ADEQUATE IDEAS. Because they, not being intended for copies of things really existing, but for archetypes made by the mind, to rank and denominate things by, cannot want anything; they having each of them that combination of ideas, and thereby that perfection, which the mind intended they should: so that the mind acquiesces in them, and can find nothing wanting. Thus, by having {{the idea of a}} figure with three sides meeting at three angles, I have a complete idea, wherein I require nothing else to make it perfect. That the mind is satisfied with the perfection of this its idea is plain, in that it does not conceive that any understanding hath, or can have, a more complete or perfect idea of that thing it signifies by the word triangle, supposing it to exist, than itself has, in that complex idea of three sides and three angles, in which is contained all that is or can be essential to it, or necessary to complete it, wherever or however it exists. But in our IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES it is otherwise. For there, desiring to copy things as they really do exist, and to represent to ourselves that constitution on which all their properties depend, we perceive our ideas attain not that perfection we intend: we find they still want <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be glad were in them; and so are all inadequate. But MIXED MODES and RELATIONS, being archetypes without patterns, and so having nothing to represent but themselves, cannot but be adequate, everything being so to itself. He that at first put together the idea of danger perceived, absence of disorder from fear, sedate consideration of what was justly to be done, and executing that without disturbance, or being deterred by the danger of it, had certainly in his mind that complex idea made up of that combination: and intending it to be nothing else but what is, nor to have in it any other simple ideas but what it hath, it could not also but be an adequate idea: and laying this up in his memory, with the name COURAGE annexed to it, to signify to others, and denominate from thence any action he should observe to agree with it, had thereby a standard to measure and denominate actions by, as they agreed to it. This idea, thus made and laid up for a pattern, must necessarily be adequate, being referred to nothing else but itself, nor made by any other original but the good liking and will of him that first made this combination.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{unless it}} serves his purpose. It is astonishing," [...] Crawshay went on reflectively, [...] "how {{the science of}} {{detection}} has changed during the last ten years. When I was an apprentice at it--and though you may not think it. Miss Sharey, I am a professional, not an amateur, although I am generally employed on Government business--secrecy was our watchword. We hid in corners, we were stealthy, we always posed as being <b>something</b> <b>we</b> weren't. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> have denied emphatically having the slightest interest in the person under surveillance.

5000|$|The {{river is}} an enigma (Rätsel). But Heidegger relates this to Raten, giving counsel, and to Rat, counsel, but also [...] "care." [...] To give counsel means {{to take into}} care.

5000|$|Equality {{is not a}} concept. It's not <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be striving for. It's a necessity.
