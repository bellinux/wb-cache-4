60|$|Million by million <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> them all, but {{the face}} of Richard Darrien was not there.|$|E
60|$|She {{unlocked}} the door, and Inez entered bearing a lamp, {{by the light}} of which <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> her with her quiet eyes.|$|E
60|$|When Mrs. Clifford {{came back}} to the hotel an hour later, <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> her daughter's face with a keen glance of inquiry.|$|E
5000|$|Later, <b>she</b> <b>scans</b> Bishop's mind to {{find his}} ideal woman and changes her {{appearance}} to match this image. She takes the name Pamela Greenwood, but she fails to get any closer to Bishop. Bishop notices something familiar about Pamela, but never pursues his interest in her.|$|R
5|$|Therese accepts Jack's ride to a party, but finds she cannot {{connect with}} anyone. Therese rushes to the Oak Room. <b>She</b> <b>scans</b> {{the crowd and}} sees Carol at a table. Their eyes meet. Carol gazes at Therese {{with a smile that}} slowly grows as Therese moves towards her.|$|R
60|$|The automobile, {{with its}} brass and varnish {{shining in the}} sunlight, was waiting a little way up the street, and the first person Honora met in the {{vestibule}} of Delmonico's was Lula Chandos. She was, as usual, elaborately dressed, and gave one the impression of being lost, so anxiously was <b>she</b> <b>scanning</b> the face of every new arrival.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>scanned</b> my face. [...] "Stephen, you're {{not much}} changed. You're looking well.... But your eyes--they're dog-tired eyes. Have you been working too hard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>scanned</b> him {{a moment}} gravely, almost inscrutably. [...] "What purpose can it serve?" [...] she asked; and her tone was forbidding--almost a tone of fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she smiled, [...] "you HAVE done it." [...] And {{then having}} thought again: [...] "You CAN'T after that propose--!" [...] Yet <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> his face.|$|E
5000|$|After {{an initial}} {{negotiation}} session, Talia and Taro are approached in a corridor by Abel Horn, who proclaims [...] "Free Mars!" [...] and electrocutes Taro. When {{he goes to}} attack Talia, <b>she</b> <b>scans</b> his mind, picking up memories of him in a fighter exploding while attacking an Earth Alliance cruiser. After the scan, Horn moves on, seemingly oblivious. Talia is interviewed by Captain Sheridan, who attempts to understand the images. Talia explains that <b>she</b> has <b>scanned</b> numerous members of the Free Mars movement, whom she describes as violent fanatics with a hatred for Earth. Talia believes that this person is different, as there was no emotion of any kind in his mind, {{and there is more}} going on here than people realize.|$|R
5|$|The Enterprise {{meets with}} a Ferengi vessel whose captain, DaiMon Bok, {{requests}} {{a meeting with}} Captain Picard. Picard meanwhile is suffering from persistent headaches and seeks the help of Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). <b>She</b> <b>scans</b> Picard, but can not find what is causing them. Meanwhile, on the bridge, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) reports that a second vessel is approaching. Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) identifies it as a Federation Constellation-class starship.|$|R
50|$|Finally, Uma tackles {{the raging}} {{conflict}} between Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan. <b>She</b> <b>scans</b> his expenses and reminds him that costs are actually reduced when items are obtained in larger quantities. She also reminds him that Ammaiyappan does not charge rent. She also {{reminds him of}} his filial responsibilities. In the meantime, Kannamma reminds Ammaiyappan that his family is all he has, {{and that he should}} think of his children and grandchildren as his legacy and not his adversaries. Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan are finally reconciled.|$|R
60|$|Edna's {{heart beat}} rapidly {{and her face}} flushed as, with Ralph's spy-glass to her eyes, <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> {{the people in the}} boat as it pulled away from the ship.|$|E
60|$|A very correct butler {{brought her}} the Pall Mall Gazette {{a moment or}} two later. <b>She</b> <b>scanned</b> it eagerly. Then it slipped from her shuddering fingers. She turned upon her husband.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>scanned</b> him keenly {{before she}} answered: [...] "Something that I {{should like to}} tell you--that you ought to know. Alan, {{do you think you}} are fit to judge of a very serious matter?" ...|$|E
60|$|September 15th.--To-day is Flora's birthday. Dear lass! it is {{well that}} she cannot see her boy, as she used to call me, shut up among the ice fields with a crazy captain and a few weeks' provisions. No doubt <b>she</b> <b>scans</b> the {{shipping}} list in the Scotsman every morning {{to see if we}} are reported from Shetland. I have to set an example to the men and look cheery and unconcerned; but God knows, my heart is very heavy at times.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Byron's vanity was touched. [...] "Is he like me?" [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>scanning</b> his features. He, without heeding her, said to Lydia with undisguised mortification, ...|$|R
50|$|Finally, Uma tackles {{the raging}} {{conflict}} between Prakash and Appala Narsaih. <b>She</b> <b>scans</b> his expenses and reminds him that costs are actually reduced when items are obtained in larger quantities. She also reminds him that Appala Narsaih does not charge rent. She also {{reminds him of}} his filial responsibilities. In the meantime, Chilakamma reminds Appala Narsaih that his family is all he has {{and that he should}} think of his children and grandchildren as his legacy and not his adversaries. Prakash and Appala Narsaih are finally reconciled.|$|R
6000|$|At whiles would flit Swart bats, whose wings, be-webbed and tanned, Whirred {{like the}} wheels of ancient clocks: She laughed a hailing as <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> Me in the gloom, the tuneful box [...] Intoning it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then my old glutton can {{gobble up}} what's left. Who taught you about them? And why," [...] <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> me closely, [...] "why {{did you pick}} out the faintest; do you see them the best?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{gave her}} one, and rising on her arm, eagerly <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> {{her face in}} the dim light of the shadowed room, then let the plate of {{burnished}} gold fall, and sank back with a faint and happy cry: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The se√±oritas have {{discharged}} {{their spiritual}} duties; {{they are coming}} now to dance," [...] she said, smiling, as <b>she</b> eagerly <b>scanned</b> the side approaches of the stage.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, Cordelia fears Fiona's wrath. Instead, Fiona admires the Coven's {{resilience}} and {{believes there is}} hope for its future. Fiona then sees the blessed silver bullet Cordelia found - a witch hunter is in New Orleans. Cordelia tells Fiona the Coven needs their Supreme, now more than ever. With no servants to be found, Fiona answers the front doorbell, only to find a cardboard box on the porch. <b>She</b> <b>scans</b> it with magic, takes it inside and opens it. Inside is Delphine LaLaurie's head staring back at her, whispering for help.|$|R
25|$|She {{journeys}} to the Savage Land {{with the}} rest of the heroes under Invisible Woman's invisibility field and Storm's mist. Upon arriving <b>she</b> <b>scans</b> Luke Cage's mind in New York informing the others that he survived the nuclear blast and that Ultron is using Vision as a conduit to control the world from the future. It is also hinted that her powers are still broken and not fully recovered from the merge with the Phoenix but improved significantly. When Wolverine and the Invisible Woman go to the past and kill Hank Pym, the current reality is wiped out and replaced with an alternate one.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Somerset, {{will you}} {{allow me to}} have the Greek court I mentioned?' she asked tentatively, after a long break in their discourse, as <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> the green stones along {{the base of the}} arcade, with a conjectural countenance as to his reply.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{that were}} permitted,' {{answered}} Meg Merrilies, while <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> with {{a close and}} keen glance {{the features of the}} expiring man. 'He has had a sair struggle; but it's passing. I kenn'd he would pass when you came in. That was the death-ruckle; he's dead.' ...|$|E
60|$|As she breakfasted <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> Mr. Wrenn for a second. He was too {{obviously}} caught staring {{to be able}} to {{drop his}} eyes. She studied him all out, with almost as much interest as a policeman gives to a passing trolley-car, yawned delicately, and forgot him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, father," [...] {{interrupted}} Adolay, knitting {{her pretty}} brows as <b>she</b> earnestly <b>scanned</b> the letter, [...] "but don't {{you see the}} line of geese flying over the tree-tops? That shows that {{it was at the}} beginning of the warm time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{needed a}} man here," [...] she said, [...] "and I think that Heaven {{it must have}} been that sent you to my aid. But do you think," [...] she asked, and with her eyes <b>she</b> closely <b>scanned</b> his face for any sign of doubt, [...] "that they are pacified?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{pedestrian}} stood up, apparently with revived determination, {{and looked}} around. The road {{appeared to be}} familiar to her, and <b>she</b> carefully <b>scanned</b> the fence as she slowly walked along. Presently there became visible a dim white shape; it was another milestone. She drew her fingers across its face to feel the marks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes," [...] she said, slowly, [...] "but I like to {{hear you}} say that again--every day, and every night, {{whenever}} I ask; and never to be angry because I ask. I am afraid of white women who are shameless and have fierce eyes." [...] <b>She</b> <b>scanned</b> his features close for a moment and added: ...|$|E
60|$|One {{thing the}} girl had noticed {{particularly}} when she had seen Tarzan rushing upon Terkoz--the vivid scarlet band upon his forehead, from above the left eye to the scalp; but now as <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> his features she noticed that it was gone, and only a thin white line marked the spot where it had been.|$|E
60|$|Farrar and I {{introduced}} ourselves, awkwardly enough, {{and we both}} {{tried to}} explain at once how it was that neither Mr. nor Mrs. Cooke was there to meet her. Of course we made an absolute failure of it. <b>She</b> <b>scanned</b> our faces with a puzzled expression {{for a while and}} then broke into a laugh.|$|E
50|$|Seven then recounts to the ship's {{holographic}} Doctor {{the events}} in her mind of how she remembers her violation. It begins with a weapons test where Lt. Paris was using a new energy assault rifle for Voyager defenses on the Entharan planet, when Seven went with Kovin to do some remodulating. At Kovin's workshop, <b>she</b> <b>scans</b> the device, but he turns the weapon on her and fires‚Äîwhich incapacitates her. Seven then remembers a female lab assistant, and the extraction of her Borg parts. Then {{she goes on to}} detail her assimilation tubules being removed of nanoprobes, tested the probes on another person in the lab which assimilated him, and other internal components. Afterwards, she can only recall Kovin telling her the weapon overloaded and burned her hand ‚Äî which Seven now believes to be a lie.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the learner}} {{produces}} an utterance, he or <b>she</b> internally <b>scans</b> it for errors, {{and uses the}} learned system to make corrections. Self-correction occurs when the learner uses the Monitor to correct a sentence after it is uttered. According to the hypothesis, such self-monitoring and self-correction are the only functions of conscious language learning.|$|R
60|$|Gui. My utmost aim {{has been}} to hide it from her, But there I'm short; by the long chain of causes <b>She</b> has <b>scanned</b> it, just {{as if she were}} my soul; And though I flew about with circumstances. Denials, oaths, improbabilities; Yet, through the {{histories}} of our lives, she looked, She saw, she overcame.|$|R
