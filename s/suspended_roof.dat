5|$|The {{gymnasium}} has {{a capacity}} of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events that are taking place. At {{the time it was}} built, the gymnasium had the world's largest <b>suspended</b> <b>roof</b> span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a heavy concrete support system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.|$|E

2500|$|The New York State Pavilion, {{designed}} by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, {{is one of}} the few structures still standing in Flushing Meadows Park. The oval roof, suspended and cable-hung, was the largest in the world. [...] The pavilion was praised for its <b>suspended</b> <b>roof</b> and two towers that stood as the tallest structures of the fair. This large tent-like structure may have been an influence on the current Flushing Meadows Natatorium. Today, all these structures are either demolished or left in an uninhabitable, dilapidated state.|$|E
40|$|For {{designing}} structures with <b>suspended</b> <b>roofs,</b> {{the knowledge}} of the characteristics of wind forces on them is most essential, because the effect of wind forces is more serious than on ordinary roofs. However, {{little is known about the}} characteristics of wind forces on <b>suspended</b> <b>roofs.</b> Hence, an experimental study of these was carried out on two dimensional rigid roof models of three types. Static wind pressure coefficient distributions were obtained on roofs of five different wall heights in five different wind speeds. Dynamic wind pressurei were measured on the roof of three type models. Their results are discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{non-linear}} {{behavior of}} multi-suspended roof systems for seismic loads is studied. The study {{is based on}} a formulation that call be easily employed for a preliminary design of multi-suspended roofs subjected to seismic loads. Specifically, applying Lagrange's equations, the corresponding set of equations of motion for discrete models of multiple suspension roofs is obtained and numerical integration of the equations of motion is performed via the Runge-Kutta scheme. For representative realistic combinations of geometric, stiffness and damping parameters, a non-linear analysis is employed to study the behavior of <b>suspended</b> <b>roofs</b> for near-source and far-field seismic motions. The analysis demonstrates that: (i) code-specified design loads could dramatically underestimate the response of <b>suspended</b> <b>roofs</b> subjected to near-source ground motions and (ii) flexible rooting systems are greatly affected by near-source ground motions, a behavior that is not observed for stiff systems.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, the {{nonlinear}} static {{as well as}} dynamic buckling of asymmetrical <b>suspended</b> <b>roofs,</b> acted upon by step conservative loading of infinite duration is examined in detail. This is achieved via a two-degrees-of-freedom imperfect dissipative model simulating the real roof structure. Natural and complementary equilibrium paths are determined for different characteristic values of the parameters involved, revealing a variety of equilibrium configurations. Evolution from symmetry to asymmetry, especially for high roofs, changes the static response from limit point instability to monotonically rising stable paths and increases the amplitude of horizontal displacement. For all cases considered the corresponding dynamic response is associated with point attractors, being either remote stable physical equilibria or prebuckling fixed points, simultaneously locally and globally asymptotically stable, although the dynamic buckling phenomenon has already occurred. The main feature of <b>suspended</b> <b>roofs</b> - sensitivity to horizontal vibrations - is captured by the proposed model, while eliminating the effect of suspension the model yields snap-through buckling as expected...|$|R

500|$|The North Galleries, {{which opened}} to the public in 1975, marked the arrival of modernist {{architecture}} at the National Gallery. In the older rooms, the original classical details were effaced by partitions, daises and <b>suspended</b> <b>roofs,</b> the aim being to create neutral settings which did not distract from contemplation of the paintings. But the Gallery's commitment to modernism was short-lived: by the 1980s Victorian style was no longer considered anathema, and a restoration programme began to restore the 19th- and early-20th-century interiors to their purported original appearance. This began with the refurbishment of the Barry Rooms in 1985–6. From 1996 to 1999 even the North Galleries, by then considered to [...] "lack a positive architectural character" [...] were remodelled in a classical style, albeit a simplified one.|$|R

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{nonlinear}} static as well as dynamic stability aspects of an initially imperfect dissipative 2 -mass, 3 -DOF model under step loading, introduced as a simplified simulation of a class of double-suspension roofs. Employing a fully nonlinear straightforward analysis {{it is found that}} global stability, being the main feature of double-suspension roofing systems, is captured by the proposed autonomous conservative model. For realistic combinations of the geometric, stiffness and damping parameters involved the model dealt with is always associated with a stable point attractor response and does not experience either snapping or large amplitude horizontal motions, contrary to recent findings reported for single <b>suspended</b> <b>roof</b> models. Finally, various mathematical and visualization obstacles were encountered, to be overcome by modern commercial software. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a general {{description of the}} <b>suspended</b> <b>roof</b> forms. The concept covers all kinds of diaphragms, tents and cord nets. Depending on the roof construction, in particular the way of attachment, the used material or external factors, the roof forms undergo some decisive changes. The shape of the suspended roofs is difficult to define, especially in case of more complex roofs. Their surfaces are multi-curvature and do not comprise typical solids or geometrical forms, which make the design even more complicated. The shape of the surfaces {{is close to the}} minimal surfaces, i. e. those, which we would obtain form a bubble film spread over any limited outline. Unfortunately, the very designing, element dimensions as well as the tension design are still troublesome. Only the finite element method, if applied, allows the film form design. Nowadays, thanks to particular computer programmes, it is possible to simulate certain phenomena...|$|E
