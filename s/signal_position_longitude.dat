5000|$|The {{canons of}} John of Saxony {{explained}} how one {{could find the}} planetary <b>position</b> (<b>longitudes)</b> at any given time. One would have to calculate {{the length of time}} between the basic year and they year sought. They would then divide them by mean figures of the planetary orbits, and add/subtract values to adjust for hours and minutes. To expedite these calculations he had an accompanying table of sexagesimal multiplication. [...] In addition to this, he divided the day into sixty parts rather than 24 hours, consistently representing time by sexagesimal fractions and multiples of a day. It is in this form that the Alfonsine tables circulated in Western Europe for the next three centuries.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Position sensor {{is the key}} of exact {{commutation}} for switched {{reluctance motor}} (SRM). When position sensor is faulted, some phase information of commutation will be lost, causes torque decrease, affects the system reliability. Through {{the analysis of the}} fault <b>position</b> <b>signals,</b> a real-time diagnostic method that detected the edge sequences of <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> and calculated the angle between the adjacent edges of <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> is proposed. After fault of <b>position</b> <b>signal</b> is diagnosed, fault-tolerant control is carried out immediately by taking advantage of the redundant information of <b>position</b> <b>signal</b> detection scheme and the time between the adjacent edges of <b>position</b> <b>signals.</b> The validity and practicability of fault analysis, fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control is verified by simulated fault experiments on SRM.

40|$|Although both sensory {{and motor}} signals in {{multiple}} cortical areas are modulated by eye position, {{the origin of}} eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> for cortical neurons remains uncertain. One likely source is the central thalamus which contains neurons sensitive to eye position. Since the central thalamus receives inputs from the brainstem, these neurons may transmit eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> arising from the neural integrator or from proprioceptive feedback. However, since the central thalamus also receives inputs from many cortical areas, eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> in the central thalamus could come from the cerebral cortex. To clarify these possibilities, spatial and temporal properties of eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> in the central thalamus were examined in trained monkeys. Data showed that eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> were decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, suggesting that the central thalamus lies within pathways that transmit brainstem eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> to the cortex. Further quantitative analyses suggested that two distinct groups of thalamic neurons mediate eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> from different subcortical origins, and that the signals are modified dynamically through ascending pathways. Eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> through the central thalamus may play essential roles in spatial transformation performed by cortical networks...|$|R

50|$|Rodríguez wrote many works, {{some of them}} truly revolutionary {{contributions}} to mathematics (like his treatise on logarithms), astronomy and engineering. He also wrote treatises on technology, {{such as the one}} dealing with the construction of precise clocks. Many of these works were developed for his own courses in the university; others were written to support his own investigations. In the latter category is the report on the prediction and exact measurement of eclipses, which is fundamental for calculation of exact geographic <b>positions</b> (<b>longitude),</b> because the eclipse permits synchronization of the time with that in other geographic localities. This and his work on the improvement of clocks allowed him to measure the longitude of Mexico City with a precision greater than Alexander von Humboldt was able to make {{a century and a half}} later, even with improved methods. Rodríguez's Peruvian student and correspondent, Francisco Ruiz Lozano, used the same technique to measure the position of his birthplace, Lima, Peru.|$|R

40|$|The genetic {{structure}} and genetic diversity of Mexican populations of Swietenia macrophylla were evaluated. In Mexico, this neotropical tree reaches its northernmost distribution limit. The relationship between genetic diversity and geographic <b>position</b> (<b>longitude,</b> latitude) of four populations was described. The mean genetic and pairwise genetic differentiations were estimated {{to study the}} geographic pattern in the genetic structure. The mean overall values for observed heterozygosis (Ho), expected heterozygosis (He) and fixation coefficient (Fis) were 0. 41, 0. 71 and 0. 449 respectively. The mean values per population of Ho, He and Fis correlated with latitude only. The genetic differentiation between populations revealed by the coefficient of differentiation (Fst= 0. 047) was statistically significant (p= 0. 0001). Unweighted pair group method analysis showed that the extent of pairwise genetic differentiation increased with latitudinal position of populations, although no isolation by distance was observed (r= 0. 76, p= 0. 15). Results were discussed {{in the context of}} the marginal distribution of Mexican populations. Implications of the results on the conservation of S. macrophylla, particularly for populations located in the Mayan zone were discussed. Peer Revie...|$|R
