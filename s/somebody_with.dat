25|$|Gerry {{contacts}} Thierry, and the airliner is {{diverted to}} a World Health Organization (WHO) facility outside Cardiff, Wales. When a stowaway zombie attacks in mid-air, Gerry uses a grenade {{to blow the}} infected out of the aircraft, but this also causes them to crash. Gerry is injured, but both he and Segen survive. They proceed to the WHO facility, where Gerry loses consciousness. He awakens three days later and explains to the remaining WHO staff a theory he has, based on the people he has seen the zombies ignore: the infected do not bite the seriously injured or terminally ill, since they would be unsuitable hosts for viral reproduction. He suggests that they test this by deliberately infecting <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> a pathogen from the facility, but the pathogens are stored in a wing already overrun by zombies. Gerry, Segen and the lead WHO doctor go to get a pathogen. As they fight their way through, they are separated; Gerry continues to the pathogen vault while Segen and the doctor return to the main building. A zombie corners Gerry inside the vault, prompting him to inject himself with an unknown pathogen and open the vault, thereby testing his theory. The zombie ignores him, as do those he encounters while returning to the main building. Everybody rejoices at Gerry's success.|$|E

According to {{journalist}} and friend Sharon Lawrence, Hendrix [...] "admitted he could not handle hard liquor, which set off a bottled-up anger, a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise".|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the episode, Leslie had a large framed photo of Dave Sanderson, the Pawnee police officer she had {{recently}} broken up with in the episode [...] "Christmas Scandal". Sanderson was played by stand-up comedian Louis C.K. in several of Parks and Recreation episodes. When asked about her ideal man, Leslie said she wanted <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> the brains of film star George Clooney and the body of Joe Biden, the 67-year-old Vice President of the United States. April said she was late for work because she had to finish watching the 2002 teenage horror-film Swimfan.|$|E

But Francis and I worked together. ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker.

500|$|Ralph P. Locke, in {{his study}} of Carmen's origins, draws {{attention}} to Bizet's successful evocation of Andalusian Spain. Grout, in his History of Western Music, praises the music's extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality, and Bizet's ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion. Among the opera's early champions were Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and particularly Wagner, who commented: [...] "Here, thank God, at last for a change is <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> ideas in his head." [...] Another champion of the work was Friedrich Nietzsche, who claimed to know it by heart; [...] "It is music that makes no pretensions to depth, but it is delightful in its simplicity, so unaffected and sincere". By broad consent, Carmen represents the fulfilment of Bizet's development as a master of music drama and the culmination of the genre of opéra comique.|$|E
500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website stated that Eve was the [...] "beautiful and compassionate town doctor" [...] who was enjoying a successful career; [...] she {{was described as}} an altruist by John Berlau of The Atlas Society. Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging on an emotional level, comparing the experience to [...] "getting a jail sentence and you're expected {{to go along with}} it without any explanation" [...] or [...] "the gods messing with <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> no reason but to mess with them". When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded that she was a [...] "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was [...] "as if somebody came and told you that your closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} airing of this episode, Mrs. Krabappel names several different diseases Bart has faked {{in order to}} get out of taking his English test, one of which is Tourette's syndrome. After Bart claims that he is not over it, he begins barking and snarling and mutters, [...] "Shove it, witch!" [...] This scene garnered many complaints from people who thought it was tasteless of the writers to make fun of an actual condition and Joshua Smith, a boy in Renton, Washington began seeking legal action. Smith demanded that they [...] "not repeat the episode and have Bart Simpson befriend <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> Tourette's on the show" [...] and include an apology from Bart at the end. Executive producer Mike Reiss replied with an apology saying [...] "We kind of feel like we made a mistake this time. We felt bad about this." [...] In a move that was unprecedented for the show, the producers agreed to remove the scene from future broadcasts. However, Smith's other requests went unfulfilled. In the version of the episode released on the season four DVD boxset, the part with Bart demonstrating his supposed Tourette's syndrome to Mrs. Krabappel was kept intact, but Krabappel's line about Bart having [...] "...that unfortunate bout of Tourette's syndrome" [...] was replaced with [...] "...that unfortunate bout of rabies." ...|$|E

500|$|The Sands of Time {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon launch. Edge said that, despite difficulty spikes caused by respawning enemies, [...] "the game cannot be commended highly enough". IGN's Matt Casamassina found the entire experience enjoyable, saying that [...] "Whether you're a diehard Prince of Persia fan or <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> a mild interest in action-adventures, The Sands of Time {{is a must}} own -- a soon-to-be-classic worthy of a permanent place in your collection". 1UP.com, while pointing out the camera control as [...] "tricky", said that the game [...] "will make your chest explode if you've got a heart condition (in a good way, of course)". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called it [...] "a game that can be recommended wholeheartedly". Both Eurogamer and Official PlayStation Magazine positively compared the game's aesthetics and presentation to Ico. Francesca Reyes of Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a good review, praising the story and general gameplay, but finding the combat difficult at times and lack of new skills. In closing, she praised the game's lasting appeal: [...] "When {{the whole thing is}} over, it's perfectly timed to leave you wanting more. It's a stunning and rare achievement that makes you feel happy to be a gamer." [...] Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the PS2 version a good review, saying that the action was smooth and challenging, bearing similarities to the original Prince of Persia, and one reviewer found the Prince [...] "colourful".|$|E
500|$|AJ {{brings out}} a {{different}} side to Masood, which Ganatra said could [...] "upset the status quo". He said that AJ {{was brought in}} [...] "to stir up Masood's life, and that has exciting prospects", and they would [...] "get up {{to all sorts of}} shenanigans." [...] Presenter Kate Thornton, when interviewing Ganatra, said AJ was a [...] "playmate" [...] for Masood, while Wadia said that AJ brings the comedy back to Masood. Inside Soap Kate White called AJ [...] "a world away from family man Masood", while Soaplife said AJ is [...] "not a good influence but he sure puts a smile on [...] face and a new spring in his step." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, you get to see what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on the straight and narrow [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ as <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm interested to see him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..." [...] AJ is accepting of Syed's homosexuality and his relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge).|$|E

After working off-Broadway and in summer-stock, he began directing television in 1950, after working as an assistant to friend and then-director Yul Brynner. He soon developed a [...] "lightning quick" [...] method for shooting due to the high turnover required by television. As a result, while working for CBS he directed hundreds of episodes of Danger (1950–55), Mama (1949–57), and You Are There (1953–57), a weekly series which co-starred Walter Cronkite in one of his earliest leading roles. He chose Cronkite for the role of anchorman [...] "because the premise of the show was so silly, was so outrageous, that we needed <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> the most American, homespun, warm ease about him," [...] Lumet said.|$|E
