50|$|Joe {{built the}} wing in two {{sections}} and bolted {{them together in}} the center. Their total length came to 28ꞌ7ꞌꞌ and a width of 4ꞌ2ꞌꞌ. He covered the joined wings with nine pieces of unbleached muslin 3 x 8.5 feet and sewed them together with an ordinary domestic sewing machine borrowed from his wife (who by this time recognized {{she was not going}} to come into possession of any handcrafted furniture). He sewed the fabric to each rib and the trailing edge by hand. He then covered it with 2 ½ inches of <b>scalloped</b> <b>tape</b> and painted the fabric with two coats of acetate dope. He followed this with three coats of nitrate dope— orange for the wings and black for the fuselage. He fashioned 28 ribs, each constructed of 16 pieces of ¼ inch spruce strips and 36 gussets of 1/16 inch plywood glued and nailed and requiring 250 brads for each rib.|$|E
