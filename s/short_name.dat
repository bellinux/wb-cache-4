The new environment replaces an inefficient application and has already provided time savings for both the registry's administrator and editors of SC 4 standards.

The new SC 4 <b>Short</b> <b>Names</b> Registry resides on a server at NIST and uses an SQL database engine in conjunction with the NIST Express Toolkit.
