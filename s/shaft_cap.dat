40|$|Drilled shaft {{groups are}} often {{designed}} to resist lateral loads for transportation structures. The shaft group capacity usually {{corresponds to a}} load being applied at the <b>shaft</b> <b>cap</b> level. However, in abutment wall applications, the lateral load is, in fact, applied well above the cap elevation. Thus, the load is transferred to the cap with an additional moment, causing the cap to deflect and rotate more than if this added moment were absent. As a result, the lateral capacity for a given allowable deflection of the group should be reduced because of this effect. Design engineers usually select or approve the allowable deflection {{at the top of}} the abutment wall. However, deflection at the cap level is needed to design the group capacity. The main objective of this paper is to report the results from a series of finite element analyses on abutment wall cap configurations to study the effect of moment on the capacity of the shaft group under lateral load. A scaling factor is defined as the ratio between the group capacity at any load application point height and the group capacity for load applied at the cap level, and was found to be dependent on the wall height, spacing between shafts, and cap deflection level, and more or less independent on the soil type, cap thickness and shaft diameter. The ratio between the deflection {{at the top of the}} abutment wall and the deflection at the cap was found to be dependent on the wall stiffness (wall thickness to wall height ratio) ...|$|E

2500|$|A sundial {{dating from}} the late 17th century stands in the churchyard; it is {{mentioned}} in records of 1704 and {{is known to have}} been moved sometime after 1774. Of an unusual construction, with a long octagonal <b>shaft</b> <b>capped</b> with a ball finial, the sundial is believed to have originated as a medieval cross, perhaps destroyed under the Puritan government. It was originally decorated, with the ball being painted as a globe and the shaft having gold and black banding, and bore the twin inscriptions [...] "Tempus Fugit: Mors Venit (Time flies, death comes)" [...] and [...] "Ut Hora: Sic Vita (As the hour, so life)". It is grade II listed and also designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Cricketer and rugby player A. N.

50|$|The 1969 {{excavation}} uncovered two burials, both of children. The {{first was}} {{of an infant}} {{less than a year}} old, buried in a narrow <b>shaft</b> <b>capped</b> by a flat quartzite rock. The mouth of the burial shaft opens into the Wilton Base Marker Unit, and the remains have been dated to 7,300 years BP. No grave goods were associated with this burial. The second burial was of a child about five years old, buried in a squatting position, again in a narrow shaft - this time, however, opening into the Main Bedding Unit and capped by a 6-millimeter-deep layer of powdered red ochre as well as three large stones on top of the ochre. This burial was associated with several grave goods: three notched shells and 14 baked earthen beads, which are thought {{to be part of a}} necklace.|$|R

The cable is now 200 m of thin multi-core containing one coaxial and 5 single wires. As it is not load-bearing, a rope {{still has to be}} used and 9 mm static climbing rope was found to be better than anything thinner, including wire rope, at preventing twist. The rope often becomes tangled with the cable, so I.A.Recordings is still looking for a weight-bearing cable. The 180 degree tilt range allows the underside of <b>shaft</b> <b>caps</b> to be inspected. Compared with commercial versions which were still monochrome and used a mirror to switch the image from vertical to horizontal, the MineCam was much more flexible, and the goal of having a complete system that could be carried by individuals on foot had been reached.

500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} it was {{apparent}} that considerable subsidence was being caused by mining in the built-up area of Manchester around Bradford Colliery.
