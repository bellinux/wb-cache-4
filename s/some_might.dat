5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Marquesan Dog. They were {{introduced}} to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, pigs, and the Polynesian rat. The dog is thought to have become extinct prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although <b>some</b> <b>might</b> have survived beyond this point.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and <b>some</b> <b>might</b> be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 1780, British and Indian forces {{attacked}} {{the town of}} St. Louis, but were forced to retreat due to the fortifications and defections of some Indian forces. In spite of their defeat, the British and their allies destroyed much of St. Louis' agricultural lands and cattle stock, killed 23 residents, wounded 7, and captured between 25 and 75 as prisoners (<b>some</b> <b>might</b> have been murdered after their capture). A subsequent counterattack launched from St. Louis against British forts in the Midwest ended the threat of another attack on the town.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the day of}} the accident, {{there was}} {{uncertainty}} about who boarded the plane and about the exact cargo manifest—all leading to uncertainty as to the identity of the bodies recovered from the crash site; some bodies, including that of Sikorski's daughter, Zofia, were never recovered. Since several bodies were never found and the bodies of several members of Sikorski's entourage were never positively identified, some conspiracy theorists such as journalist and amateur historian Dariusz Baliszewski postulate that <b>some</b> <b>might</b> have been murdered on the ground while others might have been abducted to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Lancastrian cognatic {{descent from}} John of Gaunt and Blanche's {{daughter}} Phillipa {{continued in the}} royal houses of Spain and Portugal. The remnants of the Lancastrian court party coalesced support around Henry Tudora relatively unknown scion of the Beauforts. They had been amongst the most ardent supporters of the House of Lancaster and were descended illegitimately from John of Gaunt by his mistress Katherine Swynford. However John of Gaunt and Katherine subsequently married and their children were legitimated by the Pope and by Parliament {{during the reign of}} Richard II. Henry IV had tried to debar them from the succession by use of his royal prerogative to avoid competition with the House of Lancaster’s claims to the throne but this was of limited effect. By some calculations of primogeniture, there were as many as 18 peopleincluding both his mother and future wifewith what <b>some</b> <b>might</b> claim a better right to the throne. By 1510, this figure had increased with the birth of an additional 16 possible Yorkist claimants.|$|E
5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines of criticism. He {{pointed out that}} Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. <b>Some</b> <b>might</b> accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the regular}} Sharingan, which appears {{identical}} from user to user, the Mangekyō Sharingan's tomoe seal differs between individuals. Its abilities were usually derived from Japanese mythology, hence giving the interpretation {{that they are}} one of the divine and most powerful ninja techniques ever used. Also, the Mangekyō seems to grant different kinds of abilities to each of its users, though <b>some</b> <b>might</b> share the same jutsu, as Sasuke and Itachi share the ability to perform Amaterasu, while all members have the potential to construct a Susanoo. Features of the Mangekyō Sharingan include Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu. When the user has mastered the full power of both of their eyes, regardless of what kind of Mangekyō abilities they have, the user gains the ability to create a construct of chakra called a Susanoo. Other Mangekyō abilities include Kamui and , awakened in Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, which granted him the ability to control other people's minds without them knowing.|$|E

25|$|Gay {{people could}} seldom be {{convinced}} that heterosexual sex would {{provide them with the}} same pleasure they derived from homosexual sex.

On 27 September a struggle for power developed, and Wiszniewski, after a failed attempt to take power, was exiled by Tyssowski and Dembowski within a matter of hours.|$|E
25|$|While <b>some</b> <b>might</b> {{say that}} Nakamichi {{violated}} the tape recording standards {{to achieve the}} highest dynamics possible, producing non-compatible cassettes for playback on other machines, {{the reasons for this}} are more complex than they appear on the surface. Different interpretations of the cassette standard resulted in a 4dB ambiguity at 16kHz. Technically, both camps in this debate were still within the original cassette specification as no tolerance for frequency response was provided above 12.5kHz and all calibration tones above 12.5kHz are considered optional. But also Nakamichi is not error-prone. Decreasing noise at 16kHz also decreases the maximum signal level at 16kHz, the HighFrequency-Dynamics stay almost constant.|$|E
25|$|Although {{initially}} stout {{opponents of}} the advancing Turks, Albanian chiefs ultimately came to accept the Ottomans as sovereigns. The resulting alliance facilitated the mass conversion of Albanians to Islam. Given that the Ottoman Empire's subjects were divided along religious (rather than ethnic) lines, Islamisation greatly elevated the status of Albanian chiefs. Prior to this, they were organised along simple tribal lines, living in the mountainous areas of modern Albania (from Kruje to the Sar range). Soon, they expanded into a depopulated Kosovo, as well as northwestern Macedonia, although <b>some</b> <b>might</b> have been autochthonous to the region. However, Banac favours {{the idea that the}} main settlers of the time were Vlachs.|$|E
