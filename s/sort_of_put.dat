Law believed so much in Conran's movie that {{he became one of}} the producers and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember [...] "any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>put</b> to her, and jumped on board." [...] Paltrow said in an interview, [...] "I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>put</b> us all together, and I {{think it was very}} quick, like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E
500|$|Despite the New York City setting, {{additional}} skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois provided {{inspiration for}} the opening sequence of the skyline, such as the Merchandise Mart and Aon Center. Skyscrapers from New York City included the Chanin Building, the Fred F. French Building and One Wall Street, Manhattan. [...] "We took all our favorite buildings in New York from where they actually stood and <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>put</b> them into one neighborhood," [...] Gassner continued, [...] "a fantasy vision which adds to the atmosphere and flavor." [...] First of all, a model had to be created based on the fantasy 1950's New York for the opening shot. So a miniature city was created, as McAlister mentioned that the Coens did not want a realistic reproduction of [...] 1950's New York skyline, instead they wanted a more stylized version of it. [...] So Gassner used the book New York in The Forties as a reference to create the look for the cityscape. It took three months and 27 crew member to create the miniature city at the scale of 24:1. As for the Hudsucker building, they made it at the scale of 6:1 for closer shots including the long-zoom in of Norville at the beginning. For that scene to be created, it started off with a wide angle shot, moving closer towards Tim Robbins, who was standing in a full sized set, which they inserted inside the shot of the model clock. ‘Marrying a live-action image with a painted or miniature element was, of course, nothing new, however, {{in the case of}} the zoom-in on Robbins from such a distance, keeping the full-size set locked in with the model building, ‘that was state-of-the-art and the only way to do it was with computers.’ says McAlister. Most of the buildings were created with two sides only, as they will only be seen from the front and the side, and some only needed one side as they were only going to be seen from the front, while the Hudsucker building was made completely three-dimensional. The work of The Computer Film Company (supervised by Janek Sirrs) included manipulations of the zoom-in shot of Norville at the beginning, as well as CGI snow and composites of the falling sequences.|$|E

It would be <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> it back into its old place, you know, for the time being. IT might like it." ...|$|R

He {{had found}} that there was nobody in our part of the country who knew how to put a play of Shakespeare on the stage, and took a trip to New York to see Sir Henry Irving and Miss Terry do the play.

50|$|For {{the roles}} of Finn and other new Star Wars {{characters}} for The Force Awakens, director J. J.
