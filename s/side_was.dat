5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, national organizations {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to weigh in.

Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a choice on women's rights and abortion.|$|E

5|$|The Bourbon Spanish, meanwhile, were {{planning}} {{to carry out a}} surprise attack. Simón Susarte, a Spanish goatherd who had fled Gibraltar after its capture by Rooke a few months earlier, told Villadarias that there was a secret route by which {{the east side of the}} Rock of Gibraltar could be scaled. It required a climb of around , of which the upper section was near-vertical, but was passable with the use of rope and ladders via the Great Sand Dune. As the east <b>side</b> <b>was</b> considered virtually impregnable, only the west <b>side</b> <b>was</b> fortified; if the Rock could be climbed from the east, an attacker could evade the fortifications and descend directly into the town. The route was reconnoitred and found to be passable by a lightly armed force.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was {{appointed}} {{to carry out the}} rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream <b>side</b> <b>was</b> removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream <b>side</b> <b>was</b> then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|E

5|$|A quadrangular castle, Wressle Castle {{was laid}} out with four ranges in a square around a courtyard.

Clockwise from north east the corner towers were named the Constable Tower (where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived), the Chapel Tower, the Lord’s Tower, and the Kitchen Tower.

Half-back Keogh played outstandingly for the Natives, while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition. Devonshire and Tauton suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders, before a strong Gloucestershire <b>side</b> <b>was</b> dismissed.

5|$|Ahead of the Australians' {{visit to}} England in 1930 {{there was some}} {{confidence}} in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 <b>side</b> <b>was</b> largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong, especially in batting. England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match.

5|$|Although {{it is now}} {{possible}} to reach the station through the Temple Quay office development (on the site of the goods shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company landing stage on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the main station for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other <b>side</b> <b>was</b> the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{started at}} this station in 1969, {{and as a}} result of the New York City fiscal crisis in 1975, the station did not open until 1989. Originally, the station was {{intended}} to be a transfer point between passengers from the Sixth Avenue–Queens service and from the Broadway–Second Avenue service. This station was designed to allow for cross-platform transfers. However, in 1975, while the station was being built, construction was halted on the Second Avenue Subway. As a result, the side of the station intended for service to Second Avenue, the BMT <b>side,</b> <b>was</b> walled off with a temporary orange brick wall. Also, space intended for an exit at Third Avenue was left unused. While the Sixth Avenue side opened for service in 1989, the other <b>side</b> <b>was</b> only used for storing Broadway Line trains. The station appeared as if it had one side platform on each level.|$|E
