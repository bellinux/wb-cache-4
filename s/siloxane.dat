40|$|<b>Siloxanes</b> in biogas are {{detrimental}} to engine, turbine, fuel cell, etc., {{thus it is}} necessary to remove <b>siloxanes</b> from biogas before biogas high-value utilization. At present, there are few domestic researches and related reports in view of <b>siloxanes</b> removal from biogas. This paper introduces the property of <b>siloxanes</b> as well as sampling and analysis method, and then presents the research progress of <b>siloxanes</b> removal from biogas. Three commercial technologies overseas are adsorption, absorption and cryogenic condensation. Among them, adsorption on activated carbon is the most widely used method. Other technologies, such as biological removal, catalytic processes, membranes, source controlling, etc. are under exploration and development. At last, this paper summarizes {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>siloxanes</b> removal technologies as well as the applicability and analyzes the future research trend and emphasis. This paper could provide a reference in the field of biogas high-value utilization...|$|R
40|$|<b>Siloxanes</b> {{belong to}} a group of {{substances}} used in a number of industrial applications and in consumer products such as additives in fuel, car polish, cleaners, anti foamiers and car waxes. Besides this, they are widely used in e. g. personal care and biomedical products. As a result of their wide use, <b>siloxanes</b> are presumably spread into the environment both via point sources and via diffuse sources and may be found in the environment. Recent studies have suggested that <b>siloxanes</b> may have direct or indirect toxic effects on various biological processes. The aim of this screening study was to obtain a snapshot of the occurrence of <b>siloxanes</b> in the Nordic environment. The here presented screening study involved six countries: Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Sampled media types were air, biota, sediment, sludge, soil and water. <b>Siloxanes</b> were found in all the analysed samples types except soils. The results indicate that there is a general pollution of <b>siloxanes</b> in the Nordic environment, close to dense population and major sources. There was, however, a great variation in concentrations. The cyclic <b>siloxanes</b> occurred in all media in significantly higher concentrations than the linear <b>siloxanes.</b> At present, the observed concentrations are not alarmingly high, and many background sites seem to be non-contaminated. However, the use of <b>siloxanes</b> is extensive and it is possible that continued use will lead to increased environmental levels, eventually reaching effect concentrations...|$|R
25|$|The {{heat source}} may be {{provided}} by the combustion of a fuel and, since the combustion products do not mix with the working fluid and hence do not {{come into contact with}} the internal parts of the engine, a Stirling engine can run on fuels that would damage other engines types' internals, such as landfill gas, which may contain <b>siloxane</b> which can deposit abrasive silicon dioxide in conventional engines.|$|E
25|$|When using a silyl chloride, {{no special}} {{precautions}} are usually required, {{except for the}} exclusion of large amounts of water. An excess of silyl chloride can be employed but is not necessary. If excess reagent is used, the product will require flash chromatography to remove excess silanol and <b>siloxane.</b> Silyl triflates are water sensitive and must be run under inert atmosphere conditions. Purification involves the addition of an aqueous acid such as saturated ammonium chloride solution. This quenches remaining silyl reagent and protonates amine bases, removing them from the reaction mixture. Following extraction, the product can be purified by flash chromatography.|$|E
25|$|Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), {{some other}} plastic {{materials}} {{may be used}} as the dielectric in film capacitors. Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), <b>Siloxane,</b> Polysulfone (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} the occurrence and distribution patterns of seven synthetic musks (SMs) and 17 <b>siloxanes</b> in anaerobic digested sludge samples {{collected at the}} dewatering process from 42 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in China. SMs in sludge from different WWTPs exhibited similar composition profiles, and their total concentrations ranged from 47. 3 ng/g to 68. 2 mu g/g dry weight (dw). On average, galaxolide (HHCB, 63. 8 %) and tonalide (AHTN, 31. 7 %) accounted for 95. 5 % of Sigma SMs. The total concentrations of cyclic <b>siloxanes</b> ranged from <LOQ (limit of quantitation) to 36. 1 mu g/g dw (mean: 1. 98 mu g/g), while from <LOQ to 13. 2 mu g/g dw (mean: 0. 937 mu g/g) for linear <b>siloxanes.</b> On average, cyclic <b>siloxanes</b> accounted for 68 % of the total <b>siloxanes.</b> High concentrations and detection frequencies of SMs and <b>siloxanes</b> in sewage sludge indicated {{that both of them}} were widely used in China. Among the sludge samples from 42 WWTPs, the concentrations of both Sigma SMs and Sigma <b>siloxanes</b> had considerable variations. We investigated the influence of potential factors (wastewater and sludge characteristics, the treatment capacity, serving population, and the treatment techniques of WWTPs) on the levels of target compounds in sludge, and found that SMs were significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated with the total organic carbon (TOC) of the sludge and the serving population of WWTP. There were also strong correlations (p < 0. 05) between the treatment capacity of WWTPs and cyclic <b>siloxanes,</b> as well as between the TOC of the sludge and linear <b>siloxanes.</b> In addition, the ecological risks of SMs and <b>siloxanes</b> in sewage sludge addressed to land application were assessed, which suggested that there was a low risk to the soil environment.

500|$|Drilling fluids {{are chosen}} {{to balance the}} {{pressure}} so that the hole remains stable. [...] The fluid must have a low kinematic viscosity to reduce tripping time (the time taken to pull the drilling equipment {{out of the hole}} and return it {{to the bottom of the}} hole). [...] Since retrieval of each segment of core requires tripping, a slower speed of travel through the drilling fluid could add significant time to a project—a year or more for a deep hole. [...] The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low toxicity, for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively easy to transport. [...] Historically, there have been three main types of ice drilling fluids: two-component fluids based on kerosene-like products mixed with fluorocarbons to increase density; alcohol compounds, including aqueous ethylene glycol and ethanol solutions; and esters, including n-butyl acetate.

40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) are currently receiving much attention for applications in new generation full-colour flat-panel and flexible displays and as sources for low energy solid-state lighting. Arylsilanes and <b>siloxanes</b> have been extensively studied as components of OLEDs, mainly focusing on optimizing the physical and electronic properties of the light-emitting layer and other functional layers within the OLED architecture.

2500|$|In {{cases where}} the post space {{is not a good}} match for a {{prefabricated}} post, a cast post and core can be custom fabricated for the tooth.

[...] When this is completed, the pattern resin/plastic post is removed from the tooth structure and attached to a sprue former, much {{in the same way as}} a is done with the wax pattern of a crown, and a single-unit cast post and core can thus be fabricated out of gold, titanium or another metal using the lost-wax technique.
