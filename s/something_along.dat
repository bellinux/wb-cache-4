500|$|However, {{there were}} some {{criticism}} directed at the list of drugs used in the chorus of [...] "Devil Pray". Chris Richards from The Washington Post criticized {{the fact that the}} [...] "lyrics on Rebel Heart feel almost violently resistant to wisdom", citing the menu of intoxicants used in the chorus and asking, [...] "Which one will best help us forget that this is happening?" [...] Andrew Unterberger of Spin also wrote about the [...] "laundry list of intoxicants" [...] referenced in the song, noting that it [...] "makes 'Devil Pray' sound like a mid-80s PSA." [...] Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media went on to criticize the list for being [...] "a strange, tender, comical thing, [...] but ultimately, it's a boring stadium-throb lite-EDM song about seeking sobriety and/or big-G, God. It's also a Madonna-doing-Madonna cliche , which is too often the downfall of Rebel Heart." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was negative about [...] "Devil Pray"'s production, claiming that [...] " [...] a pretty transparent attempt by Avicii to come up with <b>something</b> <b>along</b> the lines of his hit 'Wake Me Up'." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{story for}} this episode featured a non-lookalike female android who {{was intended to}} be a love interest for Data. The new android was intended to have been created as something that could be deployed into dangerous or hazardous situations, described in the premise as <b>something</b> <b>along</b> the lines of a female android version of Red Adair, the fire fighter. The [...] "evil twin" [...] story was suggested by Brent Spiner, instead, and was originally developed to include the creation of Data by an alien race. This was instead dropped and Dr. Noonien Soong was introduced. Soong was named by Gene Roddenberry after his Second World War friend, Kim Noonien Singh, who the character Khan Noonien Singh was also named after. It would be Roddenberry's final script credit on a Star Trek series. The script made mention of Isaac Asimov and the Laws of Robotics, something which had been suggested should be included {{at some point in the}} show as a spoken credit in a memo dated October 28, 1986 from executive producer Bob Justman. The episode suffered delays during pre-production caused by re-writes to the script, resulting in the script being switched with [...] "The Big Goodbye", which meant that director Joe Scanlan went on to direct that episode instead. Rob Bowman, who had previously been told by Justman that he was going to direct [...] "The Big Goodbye" [...] after his work on [...] "Too Short a Season", was instead assigned to direct [...] "Datalore".|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} production, {{what type of}} game it would be became crucial to whether Atlus or Fire Emblem {{developer}} Intelligent Systems would develop it. One {{of the problems that}} needed to be overcome was the form of the initial proposal, which was for a simulation game similar to Fire Emblem developed by Atlus. Atlus, who were better known for making traditional role-playing games, were unsure which series to emulate. The decision was eventually made to create <b>something</b> <b>along</b> the lines of a traditional RPG, so Atlus took on primary development. Their first concept {{turned out to be a}} grid-based strategy game with strategic positioning elements similar to Fire Emblem, but they were eventually convinced by Yamagami and staff from Intelligent Systems to keep within their own skillset rather than attempting anything radically different. The final product was visualized as a game only Atlus could make, incorporating elements from both series while standing as an original title that could be enjoyed by fans of both Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem. The game's platform was chosen based on the recent successful Fire Emblem entries for the 3DS: as Fire Emblem had appeared on the 3DS, Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE was to be a different [...] "expression" [...] designed for the Wii U. During these early stages, proposals were also made for a 3DS version, but this never materialized. Despite its ultimate form, some of the conceptual ideas were taken from early plans for Fire Emblem Awakening to take place in a modern-day setting. The inclusion of a sharp symbol in the title, which represents a semitone increase in pitch of a note in musical notation, denoted the game's status as a unique hybrid of the two series. The inclination of the logo was also designed to represent the game's altered perspective on the Fire Emblem series. The game's cutscenes were created by Studio Anima and Studio 4°C.|$|E

2500|$|Zheng {{started playing}} tennis {{when she was}} 10, after she saw her older sister play and thought tennis would be good exercise. At first, it was just for exercise.

(In fact, she was called [...] "xiao bu dier" [...] by her parents, which {{translates}} into <b>something</b> <b>along</b> the lines of [...] "small kid."

2500|$|... banchi grossi ("great banks"): {{the largest}} {{financial}} institutions in Florence, {{though not the}} most numerous (only 33 in 1469 according to Benedetto Dei). They were the major movers and shakers in the European economy. They had vast accumulations of capital, multi-generational projects, and were a mainstay of the Florentine economy, because {{not only did they}} deal in time deposits, demand deposits, and discretionary deposits (deposits a discrezione), they expended most of their efforts in funneling their capital into commerce and bills of exchange. Such bills could be a hidden and legal method to create loans bearing interest. The Medici Bank was such a bank. One Medici branch manager (Tommaso Portinari) said: [...] "The foundation of the [...] business rests on trade in which most of the capital is employed." [...] Similarly, the articles of association frequently said <b>something</b> <b>along</b> the lines of the purpose for the partnership being [...] "to deal in exchange and in merchandise with the help of God and good fortune." [...] Under Cosimo, the Bank had interests in wool, silk, alum and merchant vesselsentirely separate from the many financial instruments and relations it managed. Despite their membership in the Arte del Cambio (assuming they bothered to run a local bank in Florence itself), these merchant banks' focus were determinedly international in scope, where profits could be found, local markets being very competitive. Sometimes these banks were referred to as gran tavoli ("big table") or variants thereof, due to their origins as banchi in mercato; the difference between them and banchi grossi was more one of degree than kind.|$|E
