40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of faba beans (Vicia faba), Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus angustifolius), white lupins (Lupinus albus) and peas (Pisum sativum) grown in New Zealand for broilers were evaluated {{in terms of}} their nutritional characteristics, protein quality (protein efficiency ratio), apparent metabolisable energy, apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids and the effects on bird performance. The effects of dehulling and extrusion cooking on the nutritive value of legumes were also investigated. The first experiment discussed in Chapter 3 evaluated the effect of cultivars on the nutrient profile and protein quality of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum), Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> peas and soybeans (Glycine max). With the exception of white lupins, cultivars had no effect on the proximate and fibre composition of grain legumes. Starch was the primary carbohydrate component of chickpeas and peas, whilst non-starch polysaccharides were the major carbohydrates in lupins. The legume proteins were deficient in lysine, methionine, cystine and threonine. No differences were found in protein quality between cultivars of the different grain legume species. The lowest weight gain and protein efficiency ratio, in addition to the highest relative pancreatic weight and mortality rate was found in raw soybeans, suggesting that soybeans contained high a concentration of anti-nutritional factors, such as protease inhibitors. Birds fed chickpeas, lupins and peas had a low mortality rate and relative pancreatic weight, confirming that the level of anti-nutrients in these legume seeds was low. The apparent metabolisable energy and apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of faba beans, Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> white lupins and peas were determined in the second experiment (Chapter 4). Cultivar effect on the apparent metabolisable energy values was observed only for faba beans and white lupins. Faba beans, white lupins and peas had comparable apparent metabolisable energy values, but these values were higher than those of Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> and lower than that of soybean meal. No cultivar differences were found in the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of grain legumes. The apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of both lupin species was found to be comparable to that of soybean meal. The effects of feeding diets containing 200 g/kg faba beans, lupins or peas on the performance, digestive tract development and litter quality of broilers were investigated in the third and fourth trials. In the cage trial (Chapter 5), the results showed that the weight gain of birds fed diets containing grain legumes was similar to that of control diet. Feed intake and feed per gain of birds fed diets containing the majority of grain legume cultivars did not differ from those fed the maize-soy diet. Birds fed diets containing faba beans had more dry and friable excreta compared to other treatment diets. The performance of birds fed diets containing 200 g/kg grain legumes during the 35 d grow-out period, in the floor pen trial (Chapter 6), confirmed the results of the cage trial. In this trial, weight gain and feed per gain of birds fed diets without meat meal were superior to those with meat meal. In cage trials, the modification of some segments of digestive tract development was probably due to the dietary NSP. Whilst in floor pen trial, digestive tract development was not influenced by the inclusion of grain legumes. The effect of methodology of determination (direct vs. difference method) on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of wheat, maize, Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> peas and soybean meal for broilers was evaluated in the fifth study (Chapter 7). The influence of methodology on apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids was found to vary amongst the feed ingredients. In general, the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of test ingredients determined by the difference method was higher than those determined by the direct method, suggesting that the use of the direct method may underestimate the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids in low and medium protein ingredients. Data reported in Chapter 8 shows that dehulling increased the apparent metabolisable energy values of faba beans and Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> but it had no beneficial effect on peas. The increase of apparent metabolisable energy values may be attributed to the decrease in non-starch polysaccharides of these legume seeds after dehulling. The removal of hulls increased the amino acid concentrations, but it had no effect on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of most amino acids. These results suggest that dehulling of grain legumes would be nutritionally beneficial and, likely to be economical in view of the improved amino acid concentrations and energy values. The final experiment (Chapter 9) demonstrated that extrusion of peas markedly influenced the content of crude protein, non-starch polysaccharides, starch, and trypsin inhibitors. The soluble non-starch polysaccharides and trypsin inhibitor contents of the majority of extruded pea samples were higher than those of raw peas, but insoluble and total non-starch polysaccharides decreased with extrusion. Extrusion had no effect on the apparent ileal protein digestibility and the apparent metabolisable energy of peas, but it increased ileal starch digestibility...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test bitter and <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seeds for lipid-lowering and for their antioxidative activities in hypercholesterolemic rats. The levels of plasma lipid, malondialdehyde (MDA) and whole blood reduced glutathione (GSH), as well as the activities of transaminases (ALT and AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in plasma, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in erythrocytes and plasma glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) were examined. A hypercholesterolemia-induced diet manifested in the elevation of total lipids (TL), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), LDL-C and MDA levels, ALT, AST, LDH activities and the depletion of GSH and enzymic antioxidants. The supplementation of a hypercholesterolemia-induced diet with bitter and <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seeds significantly lowered the plasma levels of TL, TC, TG and LDL-C. ALT, AST and LDH activities slightly decreased in treated groups compared with the hypercholesterolemic group (HC). Furthermore, the content of GSH significantly increased while MDA significantly decreased in treated groups compared with the HC group. In addition, the bitter lupin seed group improved enzymic antioxidants compared with the HC group. In general, the results indicated that the bitter lupin seed supplements are better than those containing <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seeds. These results suggested that the hypocholesterolemic effect of bitter and <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seed supplements might be due to their abilities to lower the plasma cholesterol level as well as to slow down the lipid peroxidation process and to enhance the antioxidant enzyme activity.

The use of lupin in feed determined the highest (P < 0. 01) SFA percentage, the lowest PUFA incidence and the worst thrombogenicity index. In conclusion, the protein sources studied did not influence the physical characteristics of the meat. However, the acid composition improved with the use of pea, and especially of faba bean...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{principles}} of organic husbandry is that animal feed must be GMO free, and soya bean is well-known as a high risk GMO alimentary source. About 25 dry dairy cattle of the Italian Holstein breed, from the Cooperativa Emilio Sereni of Borgo S. Lorenzo (FI), were fed in two successive diets: the first with extruded soya bean (A), and the second in which bitter lupin, faba bean and proteinic pea substituted the soya bean (B). We evaluated both the consumption and the apparent digestibility (using acid insoluble ash as internal marker) of the two diets, repeating the trial twice. The presence of bitter lupin did not influence either the consumption of other feed, or the faecal water content. The apparent digestibility of the organic matter resulted satisfactory in both the diets, but was significantly higher in diet (A) than in diet (B) (71, 6 % vs 67, 3 %). In conclusion, even though we wish the cultivation of <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> would be increase in Italy, we retain that also bitter lupin (mixed with other feed to increase the palatability) {{could be used as}} alternative protein source in dairy cattle diets...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-five gilts grown between 18 and 55 kg {{live weight}} {{were used to}} examine the effects of feeding {{fermentable}} carbohydrate on voluntary food intake, performance, carcass characteristics, and large intestinal growth. Five diets were used. The first diet contained steam-flaked sorghum and a supplement based on animal protein sources and 40 g/kg soya-bean meal (diet SAP). Using this diet as a base, three other diets contained either (i) guar gum, a source of soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) (diet SAP + S-NSP), (ii) Novelose™, a source of resistant starch (RS) (diet SAP + RS), and (iii) a combination of both S-NSP and RS (diet SAP + S-NSP + RS). The final diet (diet WBL) was based on wheat, barley and Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins.</b> Diets (i), (ii) and (iii) were formulated such that the concentrations of soluble NSP, oligosaccharide and RS were similar to those contained in diet WBL. There was no relationship (P > 0. 05) between voluntary food intake and indices of hind-gut fermentation, although pigs given diets SAP + S-NSP and SAP + S-NSP + RS took longer to reach the slaughter weight of 55 kg (P 0. 05) with dressing proportion. These data suggest that the sources of fermentable carbohydrate used in this study, i. e. soluble NSP and RS, may not significantly depress voluntary food intake but can affect performance and have a significant effect on large intestinal growth and dressing proportion...|$|R
40|$|For 3 weeks, 128 male Sprague-Dawley rats, 3 weeks old, {{were fed}} on diets {{containing}} no protein, casein, soyabean meal, roasted or raw soyabeans, or <b>sweet</b> white <b>lupin</b> (Lupinus albus) cultivar Primorski or Ultra without or with 0. 1 % lysine or 0. 2 % methionine. Relative net protein ratio (RNPR) (casein = 100 %) of lupins Primorski and Ultra supplemented with methionine was 81. 1 and 79. 1 %, respectively, and {{was higher than}} that for roasted soyabeans (71. 4 %) (P< 0. 05) and {{similar to that of}} soyabean meal (83. 1 %). Supplementation of lupins with lysine improved (P< 0. 05) RNPR of Ultra (88. 0 %), but not that of Primorski (81. 9 %). RNPR values of soyabean meal, Ultra or Primorski supplemented with lysine and methionine were not different. ...|$|R
40|$|Five {{pelleted}} diets, {{based on}} barley, a roughage and five different protein sources (soybean meal solv. extd. (SBM), sunflower meal solv. extd. (SUN), <b>sweet</b> white <b>lupin</b> seeds (L), SBM/SUN, SBM/L) were investigated {{in a growing}} trial on 30 male Apennine lambs. Feeding consumption was not significantly affected by the diets however, lambs receiving the diet containing lupin, as main protein source, trended towards better feed conversion rates. Diets did not significantly affect final live weight, average daily gain, feed conversion rate and protein efficiency ratio (PER); also these parameters appeared slightly better in the lambs receiving the diet containing lupin, as main protein source. There {{were no significant differences}} in slaughtering animal performances among the diets. Results obtained indicate that sweet white lupine and sunflower meal can replace soybean meal as protein supplement...|$|R
