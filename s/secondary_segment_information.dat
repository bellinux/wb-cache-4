We use cumulative displacement profiles {{to analyze the}} two largest scales of segmentation of ∼ 900 normal faults in Afar, East Africa. We build upon a prior study by Manighetti et al. (2009) and develop a new signal processing method aimed at recovering the number, position, displacement, and length of both the major (i. e., longest) and the subordinate, <b>secondary</b> <b>segments</b> within the faults. Regardless of their length, age, geographic location, total displacement, and slip rate, 90 % of the faults contain two to five major segments, whereas more than 70 % of these major segments are divided into two to four <b>secondary</b> <b>segments.</b> In each hierarchical rank of fault segmentation, most segments have a similar proportional length, whereas the number of segments slightly decreases with fault structural maturity. The along-strike segmentation of the Afar faults is thus generic at its two largest scales. We summarize published fault segment data on 42 normal, reverse, and strike-slip faults worldwide, and find a similar number (two to five) of major and <b>secondary</b> <b>segments</b> across the population. We suggest a fault growth scenario that might account for the generic large-scale segmentation of faults. The observation of a generic segmentation suggests that seismogenic fault planes are punctuated with a deterministic number of large stress concentrations, which are likely to control the initiation, arrest and hence extent and magnitude of earthquake rupture...|$|R

Recent observations, however, show that the lamprey does not have any somite-like segments in the head. Coelomic head cavities that are most conspicuous in elasmobranch embryos, do not appear to represent universal vertebrate traits. From the perspective of generative constraint, segmental structures in the vertebrate body can be classified into primary segments, which arise as segmental embryonic primordia such as somites and pharyngeal pouches, and <b>secondary</b> <b>segments</b> whose patterns are determined by the presence of primary <b>segments.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>segments</b> include neural crest derivatives and epibranchial placodes that are not initially segmented.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{rigorous}} empirical {{investigation into the}} trade union response to contingent labour in the United Kingdom. It contributes to knowledge and understanding about trade union strategies and methods directed towards contingent workers and casts light on challenges and opportunities posed to trade unions {{by the rise of}} contingent labour. The thesis challenges a dual labour market theory that rests on the assumption that labour markets are structured homogeneously into primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>segments</b> populated by contingent workers and standard employees respectively. It demonstrates explicitly that at least within trade union membership dynamic converging and diverging tendencies between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>segments</b> distort a frontier between them and thereby affect employee behaviours. This has profound implications for trade unions, as their responses to contingent labour are still predicated upon the existence of dichotomous labour markets. The thesis uncovered internal inconsistency of strategies and methods employed by trade unions such that instead of being inherently inclusive they appear to be rather pragmatic and driven by dynamic tendencies between the membership segments. In general, trade unions confronted with a diverging tendency between their primary and <b>secondary</b> membership <b>segments</b> struggled to articulate systematic responses to contingent work. This occurred because trade unions have yet to address challenges emanating from such dynamic processes, especially in relation to the differences between contingent workers’ and standard employees’ attitudes towards trade unions. Taken together, these findings suggest that cohesion and inclusiveness of trade union responses to contingent labour depend largely on the trade unions’ ability to absorb converging and diverging tendencies between their membership segments...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} {{examination of the}} relationship between six firm characteristics, namely: firm size, industry membership, minority interest, financial leverage, firm diversification, ownership diffusion, and voluntary disclosure of <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> in a regulated environment. This study provides empirical evidence that there are incentives for Australian companies with specific firm characteristics to voluntarily disclose <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> in a regulated setting. The theoretical frameworks employed in this research study are agency theory and contracting theory. Compensation contracts are employed to resolve the potential conflicts of interest between the shareholders and managers giving rise to agency cost of equity. Debt contracts are employed to resolve the bondholders and shareholders/managers conflict giving rise to agency cost of debt. Management may voluntarily disclose additional <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> to reduce these agency costs. Compensation contracts and debt contracts align the interests of management with those of shareholders and debtholders. Managers are directly rewarded using a variety of compensation plans, such as stock option grants and stock appreciation rights. Managers have incentives to maximise firm value under these compensation plans as they may be rewarded with an increase in bonus payments and an increase in the value of their share options. In information costs (or proprietary costs), there are two forces influencing voluntary disclosure: (i) the cost of providing information and (ii) the corresponding associated benefits. Where there is a demand for private information by shareholders, debtholders and investors, its non-disclosure is likely to be interpreted as bad news and hence adversely affect firm value. Managers have incentives to voluntarily disclose additional <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> if there is a net benefit in disclosure. Certain industries may attract a disproportionate share of scrutiny from government agencies and special interest groups. These companies are more likely to voluntarily disclose additional <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> to reduce the likelihood of political costs. Political considerations include managers 2 ̆ 7 concern about attracting explicit and implicit taxes, or regulatory actions. The six hypotheses in this thesis focus on a test of the contracting theory and agency theory. The firm size and firm diversification hypotheses are used as a test of the contracting theory, information costs. The industry membership hypothesis is employed to test the contracting theory, political costs. The minority interest, financial leverage and ownership diffusion hypotheses are used as a test of the agency theory. This study is based on a sample of 185 companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange top 300 shares. Univariate and multivariate tests were performed on the six hypotheses in this thesis. The univariate test results provide evidence to support voluntary segment disclosure is significantly related to firm diversification, minority interest and financial leverage but no support was found for firm size, ownership diffusion and industry membership. The bivariate logistic regression test results found statistically significant support that voluntary disclosure of <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> in a regulated environment is related to firm diversification and firm size.

30|$|While {{non-standard}} {{forms of}} work can in fact {{allow for the}} creation of additional jobs, in particular in smaller firms and service occupations, they eventually result in a well-defined <b>secondary</b> <b>segment</b> of employment where transitions to permanent or regular employment can be difficult and working conditions are less favourable as contract type, employment stability or pay deviate from the standard. This divergence is also prevalent for socio-economic groups that typically enter this <b>secondary</b> <b>segment</b> with respect to age, gender, skill level or nationality. Hence, dualisation {{can be seen as a}} strategy of institutional reform creating a secondary institutional arrangement as well as an empirical phenomenon in terms of actual employment patterns that result from the changes in rules and the interaction of employers and employees in certain parts of the labour market (Emmenegger et al. 2012). In this sense, we define dualisation as specific and institutionally driven form of labour market segmentation. Still, depending on regulatory approaches to different form of atypical work, we can also see some competition between different flexible employment options from the employer’s (and employee’s) perspective when deciding which type of contract to use. Hence, it is also important to study the interaction of employment options that are possible in institutional terms on the one hand and employer and employee behaviour on the other hand.|$|R
