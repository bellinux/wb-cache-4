In effect, these pulses are discrete-time analog samples of the U signal. The pulses are then low-pass filtered so that the original analog continuous-time U signal is recovered. For V, a 90 degree shifted subcarrier briefly gates the chroma signal every 280 nanoseconds, and the rest of the process is identical to that used for the U signal.|$|E
50|$|Barrie Gilbert (born in 1937 in Bournemouth, England) is an English-American inventor. He is {{well known}} for his {{invention}} of numerous analog circuit concepts, holding over 100 patents worldwide, and for the discovery of the Translinear Principle. His name is attributed to a class of related topologies loosely referred to as the Gilbert cell, one of which is a mixer - a key frequency translation device - used in every modern wireless communication device. A similar topology, for use as a <b>synchronous</b> <b>demodulator,</b> was invented by Howard Jones in 1963. During the 1950s he pursued an interest in solid-state devices while at Mullard, working on the development of early transistors, and later, the first-generation planar ICs. After some pioneering development of sampling oscillography he emigrated to the United States in 1964 to pursue this interest at Tektronix, Beaverton, Oregon, where he developed the first electronic knob-readout system and other advances in instrumentation. He returned to England in 1970, where he was Group Leader at Plessey Research Laboratories, managing a team developing a holographic memory, OCR systems and integrated circuits (ICs) for communications applications. From 1972-1977 he consulted for Analog Devices Inc., Beaverton, OR, designing several ICs embodying novel nonlinear concepts. He returned to the USA and Tektronix in 1977 to pursue HF ICs and process development.|$|E

Several induction machine faults detection techniques have been proposed {{that are based on}} vibration, temperature, and currents/power monitoring, etc. Motor current signature analysis is a cost-effective method, which has been widely investigated. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that mechanical and electrical induction machine faults can be effectively diagnosed using stator currents demodulation.

The interface which has been implemented by Dr. Nabavi as a PhD project, consists of a low-power front-end oscillator and a <b>synchronous</b> <b>demodulator.</b> An excitation frequency of 20 MHz enables the accurate sensing of targets with only a few tens of ?m thick conductive surfaces.

The sampling frequency is obtained from the excitation frequency, which synchronizes the ADC and the interface. A ratio-metric measurement approach is applied to suppress the oscillator's noise contribution. The ratio-metric ADC has been realized in a 0. 35 ?m BiCMOS technology and consumes 1. 8 mW.

The aim of this work {{is to find a}} magnetic sensor, which could be integrated in a bioprosthesis, monitoring the prosthesis {{in such a way that}} allows to confidently forecast the failure. Several models of magnetic sensors have been tested in a hydro-dynamic setup specifically manufactured, where the heart pressure, frequency, and cardiac flow were simulated. Small pieces of amorphous soft magnetic material were stuck to the cusps of a bioprosthesis, and through a carefully designed electronic system, the movement of the cusps is detected at the same time that the image of the working valve is captured by a digital camera. The small pieces placed in the valve are under an external applied field of few Khz, and the magnetiza-tion signal of the pieces is acquired by means of two series connected coils. The movement of the pieces, at a cardiac simulated rhythm, induces a modulation in the amplitude of the signal detected in the secondary coils, with the same frequency as the valve movement. The modulated signal is analysed with a system consisting of an amplifier and a <b>synchronous</b> <b>demodulator.</b> The analysis of the electronic signal together with the image allows characterizing the signal changes when the valve begins to fail, preventing the bioprosthesis functional failure.

40|$|A {{method of}} using the SIMS (the {{selective}} modulation interferometric spectrometer) to measure {{the difference between the}} spectral content of two optical beams is given.

This optical differencing minimizes the dynamic -range requirements of the electronics and requires only a simple modification of the basic cyclic SIMS spectrometer. This technique can be used to suppress background radiation for the enhancement of target detection and tracking. Laboratory measurements demonstrating the application of this technique are reported. Introduction The capability of optically detecting targets in the presence of a radiating background can be increased by using double- beaming techniques to suppress the effects of a radiating background. Background suppression is accomplished by ascertaining the difference in power between an optical beam from the target plus the background and an optical beam from the background only. One method of ascertaining the difference between the optical power transmitted by these two beams is to sequentially measure the power of these two beams and then compute the difference. However, this method has two serious disadvantages. First, errors may result because the difference between two numbers that are nearly equal must be computed. Second, time variation in the instrument 2 Ì† 7 s response will cause errors because the measurements of the two beams are made at different times. Vanasse et al. (1) have proposed a double- beaming technique* for optical background suppression that does not have these two disadvantages. This technique does the differencing optically; the differencing is done simultaneously so the measured signal is proportional to the difference between the power in the two beams. This paper describes an analogous double- beaming technique for the spectromÃ¨tre interfÃ©rentiel Ã  modulation sÃ©lective (SIMS). The SIMS was introduced by Fortunato and MarÃ©chal(3),(4). It has been extensively analyzed by Fortunato(5) and described by Esplin(6). Fortunato(5) has done double- beaming with a birefringent SIMS configuration. This paper describes another method of double - beaming that uses the cyclic SIMS configuration. A cyclic SIMS configuration is shown schematically in Figure 1. Interference fringes analogous to the fringes formed in Young 2 Ì† 7 s double -pinhole experiment(7) are formed in the grill plane located in the focal plane of L 2. However, in contrast to Young 2 Ì† 7 s configuration, the SIMS, being an interferometer, has a very large optical throughput. The spatial distribution of the irradiance in the grill plane is analogous to the detector output of a conventional Fourier spectrometer: the SIMS forms a spatial Fourier transform of the source spectrum in the grill plane whereas a conventional Fourier spectrometer forms a temporal Fourier transform of the source spectrum. (8) The SIMS differs from the conventional Fourier spectrometer in the method used to recover the spectrum from the Fourier transform. An electromechanical method is used in the SIMS; a digital computer is used in the conventional Fourier spectrometer. The electromechanical inversion method used in the cyclic SIMS configuration of Figure 1 is accomplished by translating mirror M 1 while vibrating the grill in the focal plane of lens L 2. For this SIMS configuration, the central wavelength of the narrow band of wavelengths modulated by the vibrating grill is determined by the location of mirror M 1. Since the output of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>demodulator</b> is proportional to the modulated optical power, *First suggested by Fellgett.
