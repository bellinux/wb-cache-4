5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E
500|$|The Cincinnati CityBeat {{reported}} that the album had been titled Life Giver, but Heppner coined the album's current name while at a hotel on tour. Flipping through the channels on the hotel television in search of shows like CSI, he was {{just in time to}} see a segment on A where a detective commented on a woman's death in a house fire. He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect of, [...] "The amount of carbon monoxide in the victim's lungs proves that she had died prior to the fire," [...] and Heppner liked the way the last words sounded.|$|E
2500|$|Keith Hoerig: We got {{the name}} Five Iron Frenzy from a roommate {{of most of}} ours. He was kind of paranoid, and afraid that if he went outside on this {{particular}} night {{he was going to}} get jumped by some people. He had a golf club to defend himself and he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect of it being like [...] "putter mayhem". Scott looked at the golf club he was holding, and noting that it was a five iron said, [...] "No, more like a Five Iron Frenzy." [...] The name stuck.|$|E
6000|$|The Prince obeyed with {{remarkable}} alacrity. When {{he reached the}} head of the clearing, he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bird-faced man and they both, with an entire lack of dignity, RAN! ...|$|R

2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for sure. I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden he just sat down on the ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing or something, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect of [...] "What am I doing here? Where am I?" [...] So that was Frank.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley came up {{with the}} name while he, Simmons and Criss were driving around New York City. Criss {{mentioned}} that he had been in a band called Lips, so Stanley <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect of [...] "What about Kiss?" [...] Frehley created the now-iconic logo, making the [...] "SS" [...] look like lightning bolts, when he went to write the new band name over [...] "Wicked Lester" [...] on a poster outside the club where they were going to play. (Some of Wicked Lester's artwork included one lightning bolt for the [...] "S" [...] in Lester.) Later, Stanley designed the logo with a Sharpie and a ruler and accidentally drew the two S's nonparallel because he did it [...] "by eye." [...] The art department asked him if he wanted it to be redrafted to be perfect and he said, [...] "It got us this far, let’s leave well enough alone. Our number one rule has always been no rules.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Bunin {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in international myths and folklore, {{as well as}} the Russian folkloric tradition. But, (according to Georgy Adamovich) [...] "he was absolutely intolerant towards those of his colleagues who employed stylizations, the [...] "style Russe" [...] manufacturers. His cruel– and rightly so– review of Sergey Gorodetsky's poetry was one example. Even Blok's Kulikovo Field (for me, an outstanding piece) irritated him as too lavishly adorned... "That's Vasnetsov," [...] he commented, meaning 'masquerade and opera'. But he treated things that he felt were not masqueradery differently. Of the Slovo o Polku Igoreve... he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect that all the poets of the whole world lumped together couldn't have created such wonder, in fact something close to Pushkin's words. Yet translations of the legend... outraged him, particularly that of Balmont. He despised Shmelyov for his pseudo-Russian pretenses, though admitting his literary gift. Bunin had an extraordinarily sharp ear for falseness: he instantly recognized this jarring note and was infuriated. That was why he loved Tolstoy so much. Once, I remember, he spoke of Tolstoy as the one 'who's never said a single word that would be an exaggeration'." ...|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand rapper Scribe made {{headlines}} when he suggested on his Twitter account that Ryder must have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> prompt <b>the</b> attack. He later apologised for the remarks, and Ryder responded [...] "Thanks again <b>to</b> everyone for <b>the</b> support esp my good mate scribe. #NotManyIfAny".|$|R
60|$|An hour passed, and Roger was {{beginning}} <b>to</b> wonder what <b>the</b> next move would be, when a native entered and, saluting <b>the</b> chief, <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him. <b>The</b> {{women and children}} at once retired. A few minutes afterwards <b>the</b> chief went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, and motioned Roger to accompany him.|$|R
60|$|The {{door opened}} and like a shadow Nas Ta Bega slipped in. He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> in Navajo <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trader.|$|R
2500|$|With Aukerman away at college, the Descendents added Ray Cooper as both {{singer and}} second guitarist. They {{performed}} with this lineup, and occasionally as a quintet when Aukerman would make return visits to Los Angeles. Stevenson {{pushed for the}} band to tour, which Navetta and Lombardo were against: [...] "Bill kind of sat down with me and Frank and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect of {{we were at a}} point where we needed to grow by going on the road", Lombardo later said. [...] "Frank said no, and I had to say no also, so he said he had to leave the band and we were both kind of bummed out. I don’t think Frank even believed him at first. That was a bad scenario." [...] Navetta, Lombardo, and Cooper tried to start a new band, the Ascendants. [...] "We played one show", said Lombardo. [...] "Frank played in his underwear, and I don’t mean boxers. It was all a disaster, it was sad, for me anyway." [...] Navetta ultimately quit the band by setting all of his musical equipment on fire and moving to Oregon, where he became a full-time fisherman.|$|E

60|$|The merchant, however, {{through the}} clerk, assured Frank {{that he would}} not hear of his leaving, and {{producing}} a box of cigars, begged him to seat himself until the arrival of the interpreter. He then <b>said</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clerk, and the latter asked Frank if he wanted any supplies for the yacht, as his employer acted as agent for shipping.|$|R
60|$|The {{man turned}} aside and ignored him utterly--then <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> men opposite, {{and they all}} began to show their teeth in a grin.|$|E

6000|$|... "His father?" [...] he said, {{lifting his}} eyebrows. [...] "No. Oh! I remember, I <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> that effect <b>the</b> other night, {{but it was}} a mistake. I mixed up two names, as one often does after a lapse of many years." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Cherise explained the lyrical concept behind [...] "Say It:"It's so straightforward we hardly need to explain it!

6000|$|... "Look out, Leroux, I {{have got}} hold of a German," [...] Cuthbert {{said in a low}} voice, while at the same moment his {{antagonist}} <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same effect in German.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I saw {{as much as}} that. It is {{not that}} I am curious but one does feel about one's own son. I think he has bought another horse. A groom came here and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> servants.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Adjutant {{leaned forward}} {{across the table}} and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> quietly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Colonel, and neither of them spoke for the next minute or two. Dick was {{sensible}} of physical as well as mental strain as he stood stiffly {{in the middle of the}} tent. His knees felt weak, little quivers ran through his limbs, and a ray of hot sunshine struck through the hooked-back flap into his face, but he dared not relax his rigid pose.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that women {{appreciate}} cruelty, downright cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how delightful you looked. And, after all, you <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> me <b>the</b> day before yesterday that seemed <b>to</b> me at <b>the</b> time <b>to</b> be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds <b>the</b> key <b>to</b> everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} Kipps {{that one of}} the two ladies smiled faintly and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, and then {{certainly}} they glanced at Pierce. Kipps flushed scarlet. [...] "Did she?" [...] he answered.|$|E
60|$|The President {{lifted his}} hat politely to Cynthia and passed. He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> senator {{which they did}} not hear, and the senator laughed heartily. Ephraim and Cynthia watched them until {{they were out of}} sight.|$|E
60|$|The two {{men stood}} up in the automobile. Sabatini's face had darkened. He leaned over and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chauffeur. They drove on through the press of people, who gave way sullenly. A police {{inspector}} came {{to the side of}} the car.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} in this which at once shook, though it did not remove, the captain's belief, and he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> property. Then there came questions and answers, in which the captain did not reveal the story which had been told <b>to</b> him, but <b>the</b> barrister did assert that he had as yet heard nothing as to anything of importance. As <b>to</b> Tretton, <b>the</b> captain believed his brother's manner rather than his words. In fact, the barrister had heard nothing as yet {{of what was to}} be done on his behalf.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{interesting}} that Police Chief Laurie Pritchett was also known for suppressing civil right demonstrators in Albany, Georgia in 1962. The late Martin Luther King stated of Pritchett, during a talk at Stanford University on July 12, 1962, [...] "I sincerely believe that Chief Pritchett is a nice man, a basically decent man, but he's {{so caught up in}} a system that he ends up saying one thing to us behind closed doors and then we open the newspaper and he's <b>said</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press." ...|$|R
