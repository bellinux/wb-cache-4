5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people <b>sterilised</b> were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also <b>sterilised</b> to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous {{abortions in}} {{hospital}} <b>sterilising</b> staff were analysed {{using data from}} a postal questionnaire and a hospital discharge register. The study included all the <b>sterilising</b> staff employed in Finnish hospitals in 1980; the controls were nursing auxiliaries. Data from the questionnaire showed that the frequency of spontaneous abortions was 11. 3 % for the <b>sterilising</b> staff and 10. 6 % for the nursing auxiliaries. When the staff were concerned in <b>sterilising</b> procedures during their pregnancy the frequency was 16. 7 % compared with 5. 6 % for the non-exposed pregnancies. Adjustment for age, parity, decade of pregnancy, smoking habits, and intake of coffee and alcohol {{did not affect the}} differences. The increased frequency of spontaneous abortion correlated with exposure to ethylene oxide but not with exposure to glutaraldehyde or to formaldehyde. Analysis of spontaneous abortions from the hospital discharge register confirmed the findings. Thus the results from the two independent analyses suggest that exposure to ethylene oxide in hospitals may carry a risk of spontaneous abortion among <b>sterilising</b> staff...|$|R

25|$|In a {{monolithic}} state, psychiatry {{can be used}} to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials. In Nazi Germany in the 1940s, the 'duty to care' was violated on an enormous scale: A reported 300,000 individuals were <b>sterilised</b> and 100,000 killed in Germany alone, as were many thousands further afield, mainly in Eastern Europe.|$|E

25|$|Menstrual cups – A firm, {{flexible}} bell-shaped device worn {{inside the}} vagina {{for about half}} a day or overnight to catch menstrual flow. They are emptied into the toilet or sink when full, washed and re-inserted (washing hands with soap before doing so is crucial). Menstrual cups are usually made of silicone and can last 5 years or longer. At {{the end of the}} period, they are <b>sterilised,</b> usually by boiling in water.|$|E
25|$|The usually deep-red {{roots of}} garden beet can be baked, boiled, or steamed, and often served hot as a cooked {{vegetable}} or cold as a salad vegetable. They are also pickled. Raw beets {{are added to}} salads. A {{large proportion of the}} commercial production is processed into boiled and <b>sterilised</b> beets or into pickles. In Eastern Europe beet soup, such as cold borsch, is a popular dish. Yellow-coloured garden beets are grown on a very small scale for home consumption.|$|E
25|$|Polystyrene Petri {{dishes and}} other {{laboratory}} containers such as test tubes and microplates {{play an important}} role in biomedical research and science. For these uses, articles are almost always made by injection molding, and often <b>sterilised</b> post-molding, either by irradiation or by treatment with ethylene oxide. Post-mold surface modification, usually with oxygen-rich plasmas, is often done to introduce polar groups. Much of modern biomedical research relies on the use of such products; they therefore play a critical role in pharmaceutical research.|$|E
40|$|The <b>sterilising</b> {{efficiency}} of 0. 2 -mu m rated membranes is validated via a retention test using the small bacterium, Pseudomonas diminuta. Whilst {{the demand for}} such validation has increased, the tests are regarded as lengthy and are not always routinely carried out, Unfortunately, the results from integrity tests alone are not accurate enough to ascertain the <b>sterilising</b> ability of membranes. This review describes the current situation for the retention testing of 0. 2 -mu m rated membranes after first giving an outline {{of the process of}} <b>sterilising</b> filtration and of the retention test organism. Suggestions {{for the development of the}} standard retention test procedure are then given, namely the development of a rapid method of determining permeate sterility and also of a means of retention testing membranes during cross-flow filtration...|$|R

Residual ethylene oxide levels in plastic tubing after sterilisation have been estimated. Although initially the levels were very high, storage for four days at room temperature reduced them to a safe level. If adequate controls of the <b>sterilising</b> process and storage are carried out, sterilisation by ethylene oxide {{is considered to be}} safe for new plastics and clean equipment...|$|R

25|$|Traditionally {{draught beer}} came from wooden barrels, also called casks. In the 1950s these {{began to be}} {{replaced}} by metal casks of stainless steel or aluminium, mainly for quality reasons as they could be <b>sterilised</b> and the beer was therefore less likely to spoil, but also for economic reasons. An additional benefit of the switch to metal casks was that staling from oxygen in the air could be reduced. Subsequently, in the early 1960s a form of metal cask, known as a keg, was introduced which allowed for more efficient cleaning and filling in the brewery.|$|E
25|$|However, the mite-infested beetles {{were not}} {{destroyed}} and were instead used to breed new generations of beetles under sterile conditions. Dung beetle eggs were dipped in 3% formalin for 3 minutes to sterilise them, then packed into hand-rolled dung balls for incubation. These eggs successfully developed into adult beetles and {{were among those}} in the first batches released into the wild on 30 January 1968 in Lansdown, near Townsville, Queensland. This quarantine method was subsequently adopted at the CSIRO research base in Pretoria, South Africa, with the added step of the eggs being transported by air in sealed containers of <b>sterilised</b> peat moss.|$|E
25|$|Since tattoo {{instruments}} come {{in contact}} with blood and bodily fluids, diseases may be transmitted if the instruments are used on more than one person without being <b>sterilised.</b> However, infection from tattooing in clean and modern tattoo studios employing single-use needles is rare. With amateur tattoos, such as those applied in prisons, however, there is an elevated risk of infection. To address this problem, a programme was introduced in Canada as of the summer of 2005 that provides legal tattooing in prisons, both to reduce health risks and to provide inmates with a marketable skill. Inmates were to be trained to staff and operate the tattoo parlours once six of them opened successfully.|$|E

25|$|Those {{opposed to}} Patil {{becoming}} president claimed that she lacked charisma, experience and ability. They also highlighted her time spent away from high-level politics and queried her {{belief in the}} supernatural, such as her claim to have received a message from Dada Lekhraj, a dead guru. Various specific issues were raised, such as a comment made by her in 1975 that those suffering from hereditary diseases should be <b>sterilised.</b> Another alleged that while a Member of Parliament for Amravati she diverted Rs 3.6 million from her MPLADS fund to a trust run by her husband. This was in violation of Government rules which barred MPs from providing funds to organisations run by their relatives. The parliamentary affairs minister denied any wrongdoing on Patil's part, and noted that the funds utilized under MPLADS are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.|$|E
25|$|Lister {{continued}} to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection {{could be better}} avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led {{to the rise of}} sterile surgery. Lister instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands in 5% carbolic solution before and after operations, and had surgical instruments washed in the same solution. He also introduced the steam steriliser to sterilize equipment. His discoveries paved the way for a dramatic expansion to the capabilities of the surgeon; for his contributions he is often regarded as the father of modern surgery. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of <b>sterilised</b> equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.|$|E
500|$|Mayo {{played a}} central role in {{establishing}} Mareeba Hospital and forming its policy, serving as honourable physician at Mareeba, and as honorary responsible officer from 1921 to 1946. To combat the risks of cross-infection, she instituted a policy of strict isolation of babies from other patients. [...] Each child had their own locker, where their own equipment would be kept, gowns used by nurses to tend to one child would only be used for that child, and blankets, bottles and floors were all <b>sterilised.</b> Mareeba eventually became a 70-bed hospital, complete with a surgical unit and a ward for premature babies.|$|E

Sawdust is packed into polypropylene bags and then <b>sterilised</b> by steam for several hours. Once the sawdust has cooled, Sorghum grain spawn is added, and the bags are kept in moderately dark conditions. Once the sawdust is exposed to a humid environment, A.auricula-judae fruit bodies begin to grow. Elsewhere in the world, a study on the use of mushrooms by the Bini people inhabiting a remote village in southern Nigeria found that the local inhabitants collected and ate A.auricula-judae, but that it was not one of the mushrooms they used medicinally.|$|E

He then read two stanzas of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem on John Keats's death, Adonaïs, from a calf-bound book. After this recital, several hundred cabbage white butterflies were released, despite the Royal Parks authority having stipulated before the concert that any butterflies released by the Stones should be <b>sterilised</b> and should certainly not be of the voracious cabbage white genus (Pieris spp.). 2,500 butterflies were due to be released, but due to the hot weather, many of them died from lack of air in storage. Watts later said that the butterflies [...] "were a bit sad, there were casualties. It was like the Somme".|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} of British rule, the number of Chinese burial grounds in Singapore {{increased}} very rapidly and the colonial government had little power to control burial spaces {{because it did not}} possess sanctions of sufficient strength. Clan associations met all the physical and social needs of the Chinese majority, and the result was the creation of segmented Chinese immigrant communities separated by kinship ties and operating independently of the state, each conducting their own death rites and running their own cemeteries. The local authorities began to view these cemeteries as hazardous sources of disease-causing vectors such as mosquitoes, as well as a form of land waste. There were urgent demands on space in land-scarce Singapore in the name of national development. In the words of E. W. Barker, then the minister for law, environment, science and technology, [...] "The needs of Singapore's young population must require the use of <b>sterilised</b> land, for the economic and social good of all citizens of Singapore." ...|$|E
