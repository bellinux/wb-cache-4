5|$|Disorders of the maxillary <b>sinus</b> can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the <b>sinus.</b> The bone between the floor of the maxillary <b>sinus</b> and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the <b>sinus</b> floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the <b>sinus</b> (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E
5|$|The {{blood in}} the deep {{part of the brain}} drains, through a venous plexus into the {{cavernous}} <b>sinus</b> at the front, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides, and the inferior sagittal <b>sinus</b> at the back. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior saggital <b>sinus,</b> which rests in the midline on top of the brain. Blood from here joins with blood from the straight <b>sinus</b> at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E
5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous <b>sinus</b> stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous <b>sinus</b> thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse <b>sinus</b> stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral venography and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
50|$|Paranasal <b>sinuses</b> are a {{group of}} four paired air-filled spaces that {{surround}} the nasal cavity. The maxillary <b>sinuses</b> are located under the eyes; the frontal <b>sinuses</b> are above the eyes; the ethmoidal <b>sinuses</b> are between the eyes and the sphenoidal <b>sinuses</b> are behind the eyes. The <b>sinuses</b> are named for the facial bones {{in which they are}} located.|$|R
50|$|The {{dura mater}} has several {{functions}} and layers. The dura mater is a membrane that envelops the arachnoid mater. It surrounds and supports the dural <b>sinuses</b> (also called dural venous <b>sinuses,</b> cerebral <b>sinuses,</b> or cranial <b>sinuses)</b> and carries {{blood from the}} brain toward the heart.|$|R
50|$|The anal <b>sinuses</b> (rectal <b>sinuses)</b> are furrows in the anal canal, that {{separate}} the anal columns from one another. The anal <b>sinuses</b> end below in small valve-like folds, termed anal valves.|$|R
5|$|Venous <b>sinus</b> stenoses {{leading to}} venous {{hypertension}} appear {{to play a}} significant part in relation to raised ICP, and stenting of a transverse <b>sinus</b> may resolve venous hypertension, leading to improved CSF resorption, decreased ICP, cure of papilloedema and other symptoms of IIH.|$|E
5|$|The SA node {{is found}} in all amniotes but not in more {{primitive}} vertebrates. In these animals, {{the muscles of the}} heart are relatively continuous and the <b>sinus</b> venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the <b>sinus</b> venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial <b>sinus</b> venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium. The rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species, ranging from around 20 beats per minute in codfish to around 600 in hummingbirds and up to 1200 bpm in the ruby-throated hummingbird.|$|E
5|$|A self-expanding metal stent is {{permanently}} deployed {{within the}} dominant transverse <b>sinus</b> across the stenosis under general anaesthesia. In general patients are discharged the next day. Patients require double antiplatelet therapy {{for a period}} of up to 3 months after the procedure and aspirin therapy for up to 1 year.|$|E
50|$|The dural venous <b>sinuses</b> (also called dural <b>sinuses,</b> {{cerebral}} <b>sinuses,</b> or cranial <b>sinuses)</b> are venous channels {{found between}} the endosteal and meningeal layers of dura mater in the brain. They receive blood from internal and external veins of the brain, receive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid space via arachnoid granulations, and mainly empty into the internal jugular vein.|$|R

5000|$|Also {{visible in}} the {{posterior}} cranial fossa are depressions caused by the venous <b>sinuses</b> returning blood from the brain to the venous circulation:Right and left transverse <b>sinuses</b> which meet at the confluence of <b>sinuses</b> (marked by the internal occipital protuberance).|$|R
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous <b>sinus.</b> This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous <b>sinus</b> also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic nerve and {{the contents of the}} cavernous <b>sinus</b> are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{from here}} drains {{into the left}} and right {{transverse}} sinuses. These then drain into the sigmoid sinuses, which receive blood from the cavernous <b>sinus</b> and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. The sigmoid drains into the large internal jugular veins.|$|E
50|$|The {{medullary}} cords are cords of lymphatic tissue, {{and include}} plasma cells, macrophages, and B cells. The medullary <b>sinuses</b> (or sinusoids) are vessel-like spaces separating the medullary cords. Lymph {{flows into the}} medullary <b>sinuses</b> from cortical <b>sinuses,</b> and into the efferent lymphatic vessel. There is usually only one efferent vessel though sometimes there may be two. Medullary <b>sinuses</b> contain histiocytes (immobile macrophages) and reticular cells.|$|R

40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{prevalence}} of sinusitis in a general population. Patients with suspected intracranial neurological disease can be considered as representative of the general population. On magnetic resonance imaging nearly 60 % of the <b>sinuses</b> were affected. If the most common lesion (a maxillary polyp or cyst) was excluded, still 40 % of the <b>sinuses</b> were affected. Above all the maxillary <b>sinuses</b> are involved with 40 % abnormal images followed by the anterior ethmoidal <b>sinuses</b> with 14 %. The other <b>sinuses</b> are less likely to be affected with 2. 5 % of the sphenoidal, 2 % of the frontal and 1. 5 % of the posterior ethmoidal <b>sinuses.</b> © 1996 S. Karger AG, Basel.

5|$|Computer {{modeling}} of a well-preserved specimen of P. tubicen, with more complex air passages {{than those of}} P. walkeri, has allowed {{the reconstruction of the}} possible sound its crest produced. The main path resonates at around 30Hz, but the complicated <b>sinus</b> anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound.|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital <b>sinus</b> closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital <b>sinus</b> persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|Improvements on the {{diagnosis}} of cerebral venous <b>sinus</b> thrombosis in life were made {{with the introduction of}} venography in 1951, which also aided in the distinction from idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which has similar presenting signs and symptoms in many cases.|$|E

50|$|The {{emissary}} veins {{connect the}} extracranial venous {{system with the}} intracranial venous <b>sinuses.</b> They connect the veins outside the cranium to the venous <b>sinuses</b> inside the cranium. They drain from the scalp, through the skull, into the larger meningeal veins and dural venous <b>sinuses.</b> They are common in children.|$|R

5|$|In a {{systematic}} analysis of 19 studies with 207 cases, there was an 87% improvement in overall symptom rate and 90% cure rate for treatment of papilloedema. Major complications only occurred in 3/207 patients (1.4%). In the largest single series of transverse <b>sinus</b> stenting there was an 11% rate of recurrence after one stent, requiring further stenting.|$|E
5|$|In most patients, {{the direct}} {{cause for the}} {{cerebral}} <b>sinus</b> thrombosis is not readily apparent. Identifying a source of infection is crucial; it is common practice to screen for various forms of thrombophilia (a propensity to form blood clots).|$|E
5|$|Less {{commonly}} used tests might include trans-illumination (to detect congestion of the maxillary <b>sinus</b> or to highlight {{a crack in}} a tooth), dyes (to help visualize a crack), a test cavity, selective anaesthesia and laser doppler flowmetry.|$|E
50|$|The {{inferior}} petrosal <b>sinuses</b> {{are small}} <b>sinuses</b> {{situated on the}} inferior border of the petrous part {{of the temporal bone}} on each side.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{the apex}} of the petrous {{temporal}} meets the squamous temporal, the transverse <b>sinuses</b> lead into sigmoid (S-shaped) <b>sinuses</b> (one on each side).|$|R
50|$|Paranasal <b>sinuses</b> {{occur in}} many other animals, {{including}} most mammals, birds, non-avian dinosaurs, and crocodilians. The bones occupied by <b>sinuses</b> are quite variable in these other species.|$|R
5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary <b>sinus</b> and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary <b>sinus</b> is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|The normal rhythmical heart beat, called <b>sinus</b> rhythm, is {{established}} by the sinoatrial node, the heart's pacemaker. Here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart, causing the heart muscle to contract.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent <b>sinus</b> tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E

40|$|A cast {{was taken}} of the rabbit {{mesenteric}} lymph node by injecting Mercox resin into the lymphatic vessel, then excising the lymph node and removing the tissue with 20 % KOH. The resulting cast was observed under an SEM. The outer surface of the cast, corresponding to the marginal <b>sinuses,</b> consisted of an arrangement of dome-like structures of about 1 mm in diameter. A {{cross section of the}} cast showed that the marginal <b>sinuses</b> penetrate deeply into the cortex down to the trabecular and cortical <b>sinuses,</b> surrounding the secondary lymphoid nodules and connecting with the medullary <b>sinuses.</b> The cast of the diffuse lymphoid tissue showed numerous structures like tangled strings of beads, each bead with a maximum diameter of 40 u and minimun of 10 u. These were lymph pathways running through the reticulum cell network between the marginal <b>sinuses</b> and medullary ones. The cast of the primary lymphoid nodules showed a coral-like or irregular menbranous structure of 5 u in thickness just under the dome-like marginal <b>sinuses.</b> Blind ending lymph vessels filled with resin were demonstrated {{at the center of the}} secondary lymphoid nodules. The cast of the medullary <b>sinuses</b> showed tortous tubes of 100 - 150 u in diameter branching from or anastmosing with each other.
