5|$|After {{a series}} of poor finals' results Kuznetsova ended her {{relationship}} with the Sanchez-Casal academy in 2009 and moved to Moscow {{on the advice of}} Roger Federer to start training with experienced Russian coach Olga Morozova. They ended their relationship after the BNP Paribas Open in March 2009, after which Kuznetsova was without a coach. As of May 2009 her coach was former Russian tennis player and Fed Cup coach Larisa Neiland. She was coached for a short period by Loïc Courteau after trying unsuccessfully to convince Mauresmo to coach her. Her next coach was for a short time the former Spanish tennis player Carlos Cuadrado, until he was replaced with her former coach Neiland. After the loss in the Italian Open, Kuznetsova has switched to Morozova, then to Amos Mansdorf and finally in May 2012 to Argentine Hernán Gumy, former coach of Marat Safin. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview,</b> that she likes working with him and understands with him well. With his help she won three matches in straight sets at the 2012 French Open, including claiming the scalp of then-world No. 3 Agnieszka Radwańska.|$|E

From Boulder she runs a small business offering climbing courses and also works as a technical adviser for various climbing gear companies.

Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls {{her as if she were}} a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be." [...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E

I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, but I would love to transfer to Harvard. I think that would be pretty much ideal." ...|$|E
500|$|Development of Lady Gaga's third studio album, Artpop, began {{shortly after}} the release of her second one, Born This Way (2011), and by the {{following}} year, the album's concepts were [...] "beginning to flourish" [...] as Gaga collaborated with producers Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow. However, while on tour for the Born This Way Ball, Gaga had to undergo a hip surgery in February 2013 which forced the singer into a six month hiatus, and this rehabilitation became one of the inspirations behind the album. [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] was written by Gaga, Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, Martin Bresso, and William Grigahcine, and produced by Blair, Gaga, Nick Monson, and Dino Zisis. Its lyrics propose a sexual encounter with a lover whose boyfriend is gone for the weekend.

In 1999, {{while working on}} the record in New York City, Aaliyah called and asked Trent Reznor, one of her musical idols, to produce a song, {{but they could not}} coordinate their schedules. She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for Queen of the Damned (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> for Billboard, [...] "there were nights when I didn't go into the studio—I was too tired. On the weekends, I always made it."

500|$|Before filming began, Chopra {{prepared}} for three months. The preparations included building the physique of a boxer and learning the sport. Samir Jaura, who previously trained Farhan Akhtar for Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013), {{was brought in}} to train Chopra. She, at that time, was busy dubbing for Krrish 3 (2013), and filming for Gunday (2014). It was then decided that Jaura would accompany her to film shoots, so that continuity in training could be maintained. Though he did not get a chance to meet Kom, he used her videos to study her body language and prepare a workout plan for Chopra, who started training in April 2013. She found it hard to train vigorously to attain a boxer's physique. She was put on a low-carb, high-protein diet. [...] "As a girl {{it was very difficult to}} build those muscles. I had to build in three months what Mary did in 15 years", <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with Deccan Chronicle.|$|E

Like the book I, Robot is all about these robots that basically went nuts, and it's always because they were wrongly programmed by humans. It's like a mirror of our own psyche. It's almost like the wrong program could be a mental disease." [...] She elaborated that [...] "Fembot" [...] is not [...] "really about the future or about space or anything", {{saying that it is}} about the present time. [...] "Technology is becoming more organic, and using the word 'fembot' or 'robot' in a song makes things more human to me", <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with music website Stereogum, she explained that the song also chronicles her personal experience of [...] "turning 30 and contemplating children".

It was the most highly-charged read-through I've ever experienced. But I couldn't have asked for a better exit. I don't think it'll be what people expect." [...] A scene written by Chris Chibnall showing how Rory's father Brian (Mark Williams) became aware of Amy and Rory's fate did not make it into production. However, on 12 October 2012, the BBC released an animated storyboard entitled [...] "P.S." [...] that depicted the scene with narration by Darvill. It takes place one week later in Brian's timeline after [...] "The Power of Three" [...] when a man named Anthony delivers him a letter from Rory, telling him that they will never return and that Anthony is their son they adopted in 1946. The scene was written to be a DVD extra, and was not filmed due to time constraints.|$|E

Julie Benz was given a copy of the script in 2005 and was asked to audition for the part. She was surprised because the script was [...] "one of the best pilot scripts [...] ever read." [...] She also read for the part of Debra and joked that she would have auditioned for Dexter's role. Benz had been a fan of Michael C.

She then {{appeared}} in Killshot with Mickey Rourke, which was given a limited theatrical release before being released on DVD in 2009. While promoting Nights in Rodanthe, she expressed frustration with being typecast and stated that she was [...] "gunning for something that's not so sympathetic. I need to be a bitch, and I need to be in a comedy. I've decided. No more Miss Nice Guy." [...] Lane had even contemplated quitting acting and spending more time with her family if she is unable to get these kinds of roles. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview,</b> [...] "I can't do anything official.

500|$|According to the singer, she {{had written}} several songs prior {{to the release of}} Truth Serum. She confessed that both the writing and {{recording}} process of the EP was very emotional, and that the vocals of the songs were taken from her demos. Truth Serum is a concept record that details Lo's [...] "most intense" [...] relationship from beginning to end. That approach was unintentional, as Lo realized that the tracks talked about the relationship after she had picked them for the EP. She explained; [...] "I didn't plan to write it that way, but when I looked at the songs that I had when I was picking ones for the EP, I was like, 'Oh my god, here it is'. I didn't really figure out {{that it was going to}} be the full story right there until I looked and listened". Concerning the title of the EP, the singer decided to call it Truth Serum after she had picked the songs for it; <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that [...] "when you look at the songs, it's all about honesty and I'm really giving up a lot of myself in these songs; I'm not filtering anything.

Ivy Queen chose to cover [...] "Si Una Vez" [...] finding it to be identifiable to her and because of the song's message which the singer stood for. Jonathan Widran of AllMusic called her versions a [...] "reggaetón-ed up twist". In 2010, indie rock group Girl in a Coma recorded a punk cover of [...] "Si Una Vez". The group decided to record the song because it was their favorite recordings of Selena. Girl in a Coma performed the song live during the 2010 Tejano Music Awards as a homage to Selena. In April 2011, A.B.'s band Kumbia All-Starz performed their version of the song during their tour for La Vida De Un Genio (2010) in Bolivia. Colombian singer Kali Uchis performed [...] "Si Una Vez" [...] at the 2015 SXSW festival. Vibe magazine found Uchis' performance to have given them [...] "shivers".|$|E
