50|$|In 1999, the CHED Memorandum Order No. 18 s. 1999, which {{provides}} {{the guidelines for}} the integration of CHED Supervised Institutions (CSIs) to SUCs, was enacted. Pursuant to this order, the first CHED <b>supervised</b> <b>institution</b> that was integrated into the University is the Cauayan Polytechnic College at Cauayan Isabela in 2000. In 2002, another three CSIs were integrated into the system, namely: the Roxas Memorial Agricultural and Industrial School (RMAIS) with ISU Roxas Campus; the Delfin Albano Memorial Institute of Agriculture and Technology (DAMIAT) in San Mariano, Isabela; and, the Angadanan Agro-Industrial College (AAIC) in Angadanan, Isabela. With the enthusiasms of the Palanan and Santiago City Local Government Units (LGUs), the ISU and the said LGUs had entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) to establish extension campuses to their respective places. Palanan campus was established in 2004 while, Santiago City ISU campus last June 2008. To date, the university has 11 campuses grouped into four clusters strategically located in the four congressional districts of Isabela.|$|E

In 1948, during the administration of Oligario Lenon, girls trades courses in Dressmaking, Cosmetology and Food Trades were offered {{and with it the}} construction of buildings and shops By virtue of House Bill no. 2919 (R.A. 825), sponsored by Congressman Emilio Tible, and approved on August 15, 1952, {{the school was}} nationalized and renamed Camarines Sur National School of Arts and Trades (CSNSAT). Mr. Manuel T. Espinosa became its first Superintendent. In 1954, the two- year post- secondary trade- technical education was offered. Upon its conversion to a full pledged college by virtue of R.A. No. 5056 sponsored by Cong. Ramon H. Felipe, Jr. on June 17, 1967, the CSNSAT was converted into a College and renamed as Bicol College of Arts and Trades (BCAT) and was authorized to offer courses like Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE). This was during the term of Mr. Carlos Borjal, But before it formally assumed its name as BCAT, it was known as Camarines Sur National College of Arts and Trades (CSNCAT) until in the mid 1980s when it adapted its name BCAT. Tertiary level was immensely expanded to cover other fields of trade- technical education, thus the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology (BSIT) was opened in 1977. Under the Technical- Vocational Education Project (TVEP), it was selected as one of the pilot Technician Education Institutes (TEI) for Region V, by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS). The education component of the project was operationalized in school year 1984-1985, by the offering of the two- year Diploma in Industrial Technician (DIT) curriculum, with four major fields of specialization namely Automotive, Mechanical, Electrical, and Refrigeration and Air conditioning technologies. In 1984, Dr. Pacita S. Yorobe temporarily headed the school. Five months later, on April 1, 1985, Superintendent Augusto R. Nieves took over—the second alumnus to achieve such status. In 1988, by virtue of DECS Order no. 39, s. 1988, the Teacher-Education component was expanded through the offering of the Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd), major in Technology and Home Economics (THE), Mathematics, English and Physics; and Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BEEd) with the area of specialization in Home Economics and Livelihood Education (HELE). Under the administration of Mr. Honesto T. Aguilar, the 5th School Superintendent, BCAT started its offering of Engineering courses namely: Electrical Engineering (BSEE) Electronics and Communications Engineering (BSECE), Mechanical Engineering (BSME) and Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSA). The institution had first Engineering and Architecture graduates last March, 2001 and until now had steadily produced board passers and board topnotchers. BCAT continued its bid for excellence in technology and teacher education under Mr. Pedro F. Moreno, the 6th Superintendent of the College. It remained undefeated during the annual Skills Olympic among TECHVOC schools in the Region. Its students maintained its dominance in the FFP-FAHP contests for high school students. In December 2000, pursuant to Republic Act 8760, on the integration of CHED <b>Supervised</b> <b>Institution</b> (CSI’s) to State Universities and College (SUC’s), the Bicol College of Arts and Trades was integrated to the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) in Nabua, Camarines Sur with Dr. Lourdes B.

40|$|The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) {{agreed on}} a common {{reporting}} (COREP) and financial reporting (FINREP) frameworks which are to be adopted by <b>supervising</b> <b>institutions</b> in the member countries of the EU. Due {{to the amount of}} data that needs to be received by <b>supervising</b> <b>institution</b> from financial institutions as well as standardisation of the introduced frameworks the CEBS released two eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) taxonomies. XBRL which is addressed as the de facto standard of business reporting should introduce greater efficiency, speed and integrity which will make the European financial markets more competitive. The COREP taxonomy defines common reporting of the solvency ratio and the FINREP taxonomy serves as a common reporting framework for financial data. These initiatives take advantage of the fact that Basel II and International Accounting Standards (IAS) will require all supervisors to change their reporting requirements. Both taxonomies build up not only on the basic XBRL specification but also on XBRL Dimensional Taxonomies (XDT) specification allowing multidimensional modelling of reported data. However XDT provides multidimensional approach to data modelling is not clear, what is the relation to traditional multidimensional modelling approaches.

30|$|Cross-efficiencies are {{considered}} an interesting approach to evaluate DMUs’ efficiencies {{from the point}} of view of other DMUs. Whenever a <b>supervising</b> <b>institution</b> dismisses self-appraisal as a valid concept, crosswise evaluations might help to find a peer, a weight system acceptable for all DMUs. Earlier and recent DEA literature reports on such peer-appraisal concepts confer, e.g., Doyle and Green (1994), Rödder and Reucher (2012). Once such a concept is accepted and a peer is selected, his weight system not only appraises all DMUs efficiencies but becomes the transfer price system of the whole group. Do there exist cross-RTS similar to cross-efficiencies and which consequences do such cross-RTS have upon a DMUs scale-sizing. Such questions could be the issue of further research.|$|R
