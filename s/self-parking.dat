50|$|When {{established}} as a park in 1998, Pier 40 was zoned for exclusively entertainment and retail purposes, {{with half of the}} pier required to be set aside for recreation. Due to the facility's condition, however, several proposals have been floated to increase revenue to the park for repairs, which have been estimated to cost anywhere from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. A 2012 proposal from local real estate developer Douglas Durst (who served as the chairman of Friends of Hudson River Park group until late 2012) would consolidate the current parking facilities from a <b>self-park</b> to three-level stacked parking, freeing up 500,000 square feet on the roof for commercial space. The plan failed to gain support. A 2014 proposal would demolish and redevelop the St. John's Terminal Building across the street (owned by the Atlas Group) into a residential and retail facility over the course of 10 years, which would require the sale of Pier 40's air rights but would generate and estimated $100 million in revenue. This plan reportedly fell through due to public outcry and political opposition.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years {{automotive}} and technology companies have made significant advances in what has been traditionally a completely human function: driving. Crash avoidance features such as lane departure warning and forward collision warning are becoming increasingly more common and cheaper to obtain, even on non-luxury vehicles. Technology companies and auto manufacturers have announced plans to have self-driving vehicles ready for public use as early as 2020. The mass adoption of automated vehicles (AVs) could significantly change surface transportation as we know it today. This thesis is intended to provide a technical analysis of the potential impacts of AVs on current light-duty vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and parking decisions, the economic desirability of widespread deployment of partially automated technologies, and methods for existing roadways to transition to connected and automated vehicle (CAV) transportation, so that policymakers can make more informed decisions during the transition to CAVs. This work takes a look at AVs from a point in time where vehicles are equipped with driver assistance systems (Level 1) to a point in time where AVs are driverless (Level 5) and can <b>self-park.</b> The results of this work indicate that the fleet-wide adoption of partially automated crash avoidance technologies could provide net-benefit of about $ 4 billion at current system effectiveness and could provide an annual net-benefit up to $ 202 billion if all relevant crashes could be prevented. About 25 % of all crashes could be addressed by the crash avoidance technologies examined in this dissertation. Over time, as technologies become more effective and cheaper due to economies of scale, greater benefits than the $ 4 billion could be realized. As automated technologies become more advanced and widespread, existing roadways will {{need to be able to}} accommodate these vehicles. This work investigates the effects of a dedicated truck platoon lane on congestion on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and provides a method for existing roadways and highways to determine viable platoon demonstration sites. The initial results suggest that there are several sections of turnpike that could serve as commercial truck platoon demonstration site while still providing a high LOS to all other vehicles. Once AVs can safely and legally drive unoccupied, vehicles will no longer be limited to their driver’s destination and can search for cheaper parking in more distant parking locations. This work simulates a fleet of privately owned vehicles (POVs) in search of cheaper parking in Seattle, using a rectangular grid throughout the study area. Model results indicate that we are not likely to see significant increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and energy use from cars moving from downtown parking lots to cheaper parking in distance locations but at higher penetration rates, parking lot revenues could likely decline to the point where operating a lot is unsustainable economically, if no parking demand management policies are implemented. Driverless vehicles also promise to increase mobility for those in underserved populations. This work estimates bounds on the potential increases in travel in a fully automated vehicle environment due to an increase in mobility from the non-driving and senior populations and people with travel-restrictive medical conditions. Three demand wedges were established in order to conduct a first-order bounding analysis. The combination of the results from all three demand wedges represents an upper bound of 295 billion miles or a 14 % increase in annual light-duty VMT for the US population 19 and older. AV technology holds much promise in providing a more accessible and safe transportation system. This thesis can help policymakers and stakeholders maximize the benefits and minimize the challenges...|$|R

50|$|A valet {{is usually}} an {{employee}} of the establishment, or {{an employee of}} a third party valet service. When there is a fee, it is usually either a flat amount or a fee based on how long the car is parked. It is customary in the United States to tip the valet who actually parks the car. Valet parking is most often offered (and is most useful) in urban areas, where parking is scarce, though some upscale businesses offer valet parking as an optional service, even though <b>self-parking</b> may be readily available. For example, in wealthy suburban areas like California's Silicon Valley, some hospitals (like Stanford University Medical Center) offer valet parking for the convenience of patients and their visitors. On the other hand, where parking is not scarce, such as on the Las Vegas Strip, it is offered as a convenience to patrons. Some hospitals, like the Yale-affiliated Greenwich Hospital (Connecticut) on Connecticut's Golden Coast, have such limited space for parking that the emergency room is valet parking only, to fit as many cars in as possible.|$|E

Parking spaces angled from 45 ° to 90 ° were examined, in order to maximize the number of spaces in the lot. To minimize insurance claims uniformly, the access road width was computed depending on the angle of the space. The number of overall parking lot configurations was narrowed down to seven under the assumption that the fewer the number of turns in the access road of the lot, the greater the number of spaces which could be generated. Initially an analysis was done without considering entrances and exits or an attendant's station. A configuration was found which would hold 76 parking spaces. When the entrances and the booth were considered the configuration still generated more parking spaces (75) than any other configurations before these considerations.

30|$|Anderson et al. [7] have {{attributed}} {{three main}} {{factors related to}} AVs that affect congestion positively and sometimes negatively: (i) reducing traffic delay due {{to a reduction in}} vehicle crashes; (ii) enhancing vehicle throughput; and (iii) changes in the total vehicle-kilometer-traveled (VKT). An anticipated reduction in vehicle crashes would result in fewer delays and, in turn, higher reliability of the transport system. The changes in VKT due to the advent of the AV remain unclear, though some researchers hold the view that VKT in fact would increase (known as the “rebound effect”) [13]. For that, they speculate on a combination of factors such as additional VKT due to self-fueling and <b>self-parking,</b> increased use of AVs by those unable to drive 13, an increased number of trips (both unoccupied and occupied), a shift away from public transport and longer commutes [43, 44, 45].

40|$|Abstract. In {{this age}} of {{ubiquitous}} computing we are witnessing ever increasing dependence on sensing technologies.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{autonomous}} driving is rapidly expanding and extensive research is conducted in this field. Many of the autonomous functions may be simplified to {{the desire to}} follow a path, among them steer assist, <b>self-parking</b> and collision avoidance. The general idea is that an autonomous vehicle {{would be able to}} do the maneuver faster, safer and more accurate than a human driver. Model Predictive Control (MPC) utilizes a model of the system and therefore has detailed knowledge of the system’s future behavior. Based on this knowledge, an opti-mization problem can be solved to obtain an optimal input corresponding to a desired behavior. MPC can handle multiple variables and natively offers possibilities for per-formance trade-offs and actuator limitations. It can operate closer to constraints than conventional controllers.

40|$|Within the {{automotive}} industry, autonomous driving is a promising avenue with potentially major advantages {{in terms of}} safety, fuel economy, and convenience. In order to secure the engineering of autonomous vehicles, active safety systems {{will need to be}} combined to provide a 360 degree view around the vehicle at all times. Risks arise when the different sensors are contaminated or yield conflicting information, especially when determining a proper response in a critical situation. One area of special interest in active safety systems is geared towards parking applications, such as parking assistance or <b>self-parking</b> systems. These systems are primarily based on ultrasonic sensors that are used in a sonar-like fashion to detect potential obstacles in the proximity of the vehicle. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the strengths and limitations of ultrasonic sensors in applications like these, computer modeling can be used. In this report a proof-of-concept framework for ultrasonic simulations has been designed and implemented. High performance computational aspects have been considered and domain decomposition techniques have been investigated for large-scale simulations on computer clusters. The framework has a high level interface for building virtual parking simulation scenarios, where the following aspects can be controlled and/or specified: the three-dimensional simulation domain, various environment and control parameters, placement of cars and other potential obstacles, the exportation of data...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in autonomous vehicles {{has never been}} higher {{and there are several}} components that need to function for a vehicle to be fully autonomous; one of which is the ability to perform a parking {{at the end of a}} mission. The objective of this thesis work is to develop and implement an automatic parking system (APS) for a heavy-duty vehicle (HDV). A delimitation in this thesis work is that the parking lot has a known structure and the HDV is a truck without any trailer and access to more computational power and sensors than today's commercial trucks. An automatic system for searching the parking lot has been developed which updates an occupancy grid map (OGM) based on measurements from GPS and LIDAR sensors mounted on the truck. Based on the OGM and the known structure of the parking lot, the state of the parking spots is determined and a path can be computed between the current and desired position. Based on a kinematic model of the HDV, a gain-scheduled linear quadratic (LQ) controller with feedforward action is developed. The controller's objective is to stabilize the lateral error dynamics of the system around a precomputed path. The LQ controller explicitly takes into account that there exist an input delay in the system. Due to minor complications with the precomputed path the LQ controller causes the steering wheel turn too rapidly which makes the backup driver nervous. To limit these rapid changes of the steering wheel a controller based on model predictive control (MPC) is developed with the goal of making the steering wheel behave more human-like. A constraint for maximum allowed changes of the controller output is added to the MPC formulation as well as physical restrictions and the resulting MPC controller is smoother and more human-like, but due to computational limitations the controller turns out less effective than desired. Development and testing of the two controllers are evaluated in three different environments of varying complexity; the simplest simulation environment contains a basic vehicle model and serves as a proof of concept environment, the second simulation environment uses a more realistic vehicle model and finally the controllers are evaluated on a full-scale HDV. Finally, system tests of the APS are performed and the HDV successfully parks with the LQ controller as well as the MPC controller. The concept of a <b>self-parking</b> HDV has been demonstrated even though more tuning and development needs to be done before the proposed APS can be used in a commercial HDV...|$|E

Q. their compatibility. They will form a number of related but distinct districts ­each with its own special environmental and buil ding needs. In groupinp. the uses or activi ties the principle of cumulative attraction is also important. Two activities that are compatible will do better side £ 2 side, other things being equal. In developing a plan to organize the various land use activiti es at least three arrangements are possible: (1) Related activities could be arranged to­'!etllcr in compact groups clearly separated from each other. (To a degree this i s a natural condition), (2) Activities could be mixed with little regard to grouping those with common characteristics or (3) The distinction can be made be tween activities which function best when grouped and those which function best when dispersed, and a plan be developed to acconunodate each. TIle development of the "best" plan should be guided by the several st ate­ments which follow:. (1) distinction shoul;d be made between those activities which function best when grouped and those which function best when in dis­pe rsed locations, (2) broad groupings £f compatible activities should achieved controlled by some sort of permissive zoning or planned area development, (f or example, the main retail district), (3) Smaller grouoings which cannot be directly controlled should E!:. encouraged through land ac­quisiti on, and coordinated development. (4) Special attention should be Given to maintaining physical continuity between mutually supporting activities (for example, retail store fronts should not be interrupted by office, church, parking or other non-shopping activities) -.

Parking facilities in central shoul d be located. designed price d. E!!. four distinct. £i daily. Each of these types of parking has several criterion which guide the development of that,type of parking. ' Long term parking: located at the periphery of the area. concentrated in large facilities. in direct contact with major vehicle entry points; dis­tributed according to major directions of fl ow. and be e 6 sentially self supporting at relatively low cost to the user. Employee parkins for executi ves and others requiring the mid-day use of their cars should be: convenient for the users even to the extent of being within the building. limited in quantit y. of sufficiently high fee t o meet the relatively high cost of development. Short term or patron parking should' be: (1) conveniently located in relation to the downtown areas they serve -even to the extent of havin di rect access to places of business. (2) moderate in and related!£ the abi lity Q[­hicles 1 £ arrive depart.

Errand parking or high turnover facilities (especially to replace curb parking) should: be widely distributed in the area. be small in size and, have a rate structure which rigidly controls the length of stay (medium init ial rate but high increments beyond initial time period). Generally on-street parking should not be permitted. All parkinp. facilities should be designed for <b>self-parking.</b> Parking & 8 a land use should not conr lict with the conti nuity of other land use patterns. c,£Nr AL (p£DESrIIAN 1. /"ONt; T£' M (IMP/,OYl£ RA PARKING PUBLIC TRANSIT As a part of the access and circulation systems public transit should play an important role. The desire to drive an individual automobile to the central area is great. However, to better achieve the goals of downtown development an efficient public transit sys'tem must be developed. Efficient, convenient, and comfortable public transit must be maintained as an essential element of the transportation system, providing access to and circulation within the central area. The suggested goals which will aid transit service and its use to and within the central area include: maximum accommodation employee trips by transit to effectively reduce peak-hour vehicular traffic, special design features in streets 1 £ accommodate surface transit vehiclesi (transit malls, transit lanes, special ramps), transit facilities should serve ' their own distributors ££ passengers££ eliminate transfers, the focusing of all lines on a small, readily identi­fiable area where access to all or most of the system can be readily and naturally found (e. g. a transit mall on Superior Street a place where All lines move in one direction or the other.) and land uses should be located to capitalize on transit as well as maximize the market for transit.

TATIO CIRCULATION The first principle enunciated was access. Companion to access is circu­lation. I f the assumption is made that the vehicular traffic which finally enters t he CBD is f ree of vehicles which only use the streets there 8 S a "short cut" we can then deal with the CBD destined vehicles as a part of the central area system. At this time we put into this system the other elements, namely, pedestrians, service vehicles and transit vehicles. The basic principle of central circulation is that the system should provide of movement within central !!!! and should minimize conflicts between different forms £i movement s uch pedestrians, automobiles, transit vehicles and service vehicles. In developing a circulation system the following are also desirable attributes and be developed as a part of t he system. There should be in the circu­lation system: directness to avoid round-about travel, consistent pattern when intermixing one and two-way streets, the ability to circulate around those blocks which are high traffic generators, separation as much as possible of the routes used by various types of traf f i c, e. g. second level walkways, transit streets, underground delivery, parking on any major transportation elements, and emergency vehicle access to all parts of the central area.
