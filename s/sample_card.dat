40|$|Smart cards play an {{important}} role in a digital society. A smart card contains memory or an embedded microprocessor with the capability of enabling a wide variety of services, such as electronic cash in the case of memory cards and digital signature computation in the case of processor cards. A processor card can require a cardholder to authenticate herself in order to prevent others from using the card's services, from forging the cardholder's signature, for example. Authentication can be done by storing a personal identification number (PIN) or digitized fingerprint of the cardholder on the card itself. The PIN or fingerprint must always remain confidential no matter how the card is (ab) used. This thesis addresses the problem of preserving the privacy of information stored on smart cards. Volpano and Smith have developed a static analysis for analyzing source code for information flow violations. This technique is developed further here for a language called Java Card, in which smart card applications are written. A prototype analyzer is presented for a subset of Java Card and applied to a <b>sample</b> <b>card</b> application to demonstrate its utility in protecting private information stored on smart cards.

40|$|Purpose. Up to 30 % of {{international}} travelers {{are affected by}} travelers’ diarrhea (TD). Reliable data on the etiology of TD is lacking. Sufficient laboratory capacity at travel destinations is often unavailable and transporting conventional stool samples to the home country is inconvenient. We evaluated the use of Hemoccult <b>cards</b> for stool <b>sampling</b> combined with a multiplex PCR {{for the detection of}} model viral, bacterial, and protozoal TD pathogens. Methods. Following the creation of serial dilutions for each model pathogen, last positive dilution steps (LPDs) and thereof calculated last positive sample concentrations (LPCs) were compared between conventional stool <b>samples</b> and <b>card</b> <b>samples.</b> Furthermore, <b>card</b> <b>samples</b> were tested after a prolonged time interval simulating storage during a travel duration of up to 6 weeks. Results. The LPDs/LPCs were comparable to testing of conventional stool samples. After storage on Hemoccult cards, the recovery rate was 97. 6 % for C. jejuni, 100 % for E. histolytica, 97. 6 % for norovirus GI, and 100 % for GII. Detection of expected pathogens was possible at weekly intervals up to 42 days. Conclusion. Stool <b>samples</b> on Hemoccult <b>cards</b> stored at room temperature can be used in combination with a multiplex PCR as a reliable tool for testing of TD pathogens...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of blood}} spot {{collection}} cards was investigated {{as a means}} of obtaining small volume samples for the analysis of therapeutic drugs for the purpose of neonatal pharmacokinetic studies. We describe the development of two micro-analytical methods for the determination of captopril extracted from dried blood spots (DBS). Firstly a liquid chromatography ion-trap mass spectrometry method with selected ion monitoring (LC-MS(SIM)) of target ion at m/z 218. 0 was developed to determine captopril levels in 8 mm discs punched from each DBS. This was compared in terms of specificity and sensitivity to a simple accurate mass liquid chromatography high resolution TOF mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method in which MS detection was carried out in electrospray positive ion mode for target ions at m/z 218. 0845 for captopril and 377. 2084 for the IS. Dithiothreitol was used both to pre-treat the <b>sampling</b> <b>cards</b> and as part of the extraction medium in order to stabilise the DBS extracted captopril. Drug extraction efficiency from spiked blood spots was demonstrated to be 90 ± 10 % and the drug was stable in DBS for at least 12 weeks. Validation of both micro-analytical methods showed good precision and accuracy and the LC-HRMS method was linear within the tested calibration range 10 - 400 ng/ml for captopril and had improved sensitivity and specificity compared to the LC-MS(SIM) method. This method was applied to blood spots on <b>sampling</b> <b>card</b> from a neonate patient previously administered 1 mg/kg captopril orally. The amount of captopril in the DBS was 88 ng/ml. Requiring only a micro volume (30 µl) blood sample for analysis, the developed DBS based micro-analytical method has the potential to facilitate pharmacokinetic studies of captopril in children...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of blood}} spot {{collection}} cards was investigated {{as a means}} of obtaining small volume samples for the quantification of therapeutic drugs for assessing medication adherence. A liquid chromatography-high resolution TOF mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method, based on the measurement at the accurate mass to charge ratio of the target analyte, was used to ensure specificity for atenolol in the dried blood spot (DBS) samples. A working method was developed and validated. For the preparation of DBS samples whole blood spiked with analyte was used to produce 30 µl blood spots on specimen collection cards. A 5 mm disc was cut from the dried blood spot and extracted using methanol: water (60 : 40, v/v) containing the internal standard, atenolol-d 7. Extracts were vortexed, sonicated and then centrifuged. Gradient chromatographic elution was achieved using an Ascentis Express C 18 100 x 2. 1 mm column and a mobile phase flow rate of 0. 2 ml/min and the column oven temperature at 30 °C. MS detection was carried out in electrospray positive ion mode for target ions at accurate mass m/z 267. 1703 for atenolol and 274. 2143 for the IS. Drug extraction efficiency from spiked blood spots was demonstrated to be 96 ± 5 % and the drug was stable in DBS for at least 10 weeks. The developed LC-HRMS method was linear within the tested calibration range of 25 - 1500 ng/ml and validation showed the accuracy (relative error) and precision (coefficient of variation) values were within the pre-defined limits of ≤ 15 % at all concentrations with a limit of quantification of 25 ng/ml. Factors with potential to affect drug quantification measurements such as the matrix effects, volume of blood applied onto the collection card and effect of different <b>sampling</b> <b>cards</b> were investigated. The developed LC-HRMS method was applied to blood spots on <b>sampling</b> <b>card</b> taken from adult healthy volunteers previously administered a 50 mg atenolol tablet and a DBS concentration-time profile was obtained for atenolol.

Pulse shape analysis is of paramount importance in neutron detectors, such as NEDA, based on scintillators that are sensitive to γ-rays as well. High resolution and high speed are often two parameters which conform a trade-off and it is hard to achieve both simultaneously. The aforementioned constraints and the urge of building new sampling electronics to improve the signal analysis in nuclear physics experiments, led to the development of this FADC mezzanine This involves sampling rates up to 250 Msps preserving a high resolution of 11. 3 effective bits in order to satisfy the experiment demands.
