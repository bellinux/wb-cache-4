50|$|The {{original}} station {{opened in}} August 1848, being relocated from Whittlestone Head station to the north. A more substantial stone building {{was built in}} 1859, {{as part of a}} larger contract, with similar stations being erected along the branch at The Oaks, Bromley Cross and Turton, by Manchester firm Joseph Greenup and Co. Demolition took place around the mid-1970s, several years after the station closed. The station also exhibited a large outside wall platform clock, as still seen at 'sister' station Bromley Cross today. The 1859 contract was for both a station building and staff 'cottage' as erected at other stations along the branch. The 1891 O.S. map survey reveals that only two immediately nearby cottages existed - what is today the well-known Strawbury Duck (then called Bridge House) and also a divided cottage alongside, Bridge Cottages.Entwistle also served the factories at Know Mill. Until recently the remains of an overhead cable railway, connecting the factory to the railway goods yard, were visible in an adjoining woods. The mills were demolished when the level of the Wayoh Reservoir was raised and the station was reduced in size following the Beeching report of 1963 and the singling of the Bromley Cross to Blackburn section of the line a decade later. Entwistle goods yard closed in November 1959. One easily missed surviving historical feature alongside the station access path and close to the entrance gate, is the carved 'LYR' boundary marker stone, one of several that remain in place in the section between Bromley Cross and Entwistle. Entwistle also has in place its traditional 'York' platform flag stones, but much of this is now covered over by modern anti-slip rubberised boarding sheets. In winter, with vegetation died back, the fenced off central platform area reveals around nine exactly four feet long by 10in across stone blocks, with a <b>semi-circular</b> <b>groove</b> neatly cut along their full lengths. These were left behind in the mid-1970s following demolition of the original station and may have been part of the upper station building walls where the drainage guttering sat over.|$|E
40|$|A failed {{reduction}} gear shaft of indigenous rotary engine {{was sent to}} this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed fracture in the collar of the shaft adjacent to the <b>semi-circular</b> <b>groove</b> meant for locking purpose. Fractographic study showed that the fracture was intergranular in nature. Further examination revealed that the shaft was case carburized and hence, the intergranular mode of fracture was a consequence of overload failure. It was discovered that {{at the location of}} fracture, because of localized grinding, the collar thickness was reduced to less than one third of that of the original thickness. It was learnt that grinding was carried out because of the problem in fixing the locking bolt. Analysis suggests that the thickness of the collar after the grinding operation was not adequate enough to support the design load and hence, the occurrence of overload failure...|$|E
40|$|The {{boundary}} {{integral equation}} (BIE) numerical method for linear elastic stress analysis {{is applied to}} axisymmetric problems which also involve temperature variations due to steady-state thermal conduction. The boundary of the two-dimensional solution domain is discretized into isoparametric quadratic line elements, which provide an excel-lent modelling capability. Satisfactory agreement is obtained with both exact analytical solutions for test problems and numerical results obtained by the finite difference and finite element methods. The BIE method {{is applied to the}} problem of a hollow cylinder with an external <b>semi-circular</b> <b>groove,</b> subjected to axial tensile loading and a tem-perature difference across the cylinder wall. The results emphasise the very high stress concentrations which can be obtained when the effects of thermal and mechanical loading are superimposed. An important practical advantage of the BIE method is the small amount of labour involved in preparing the mesh data. ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} common types of cold chisels. These are the flat chisel, {{the most widely}} known type, {{which is used to}} cut bars and rods to reduce {{surfaces}} and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting <b>semi-circular</b> <b>grooves</b> for oil ways in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.|$|R
40|$|An {{explicit}} {{solution of}} the stress-distribution in notched plates under conditions of plane-stress is given in the elasto-plastic domain of straining. The material is considered as elastic-perfectly plastic and isotropic obeying the Mises yield condition and the Prandtl-Reuss incremental stress-strain relations. Elastic and plastic components of strains are determined by using information from birefringent coatings cemented {{on the surface of}} the specimens and observed in normal circularly or linearly polarized light. These measurements are complemented with data from an electrical analogy which yield the ε{lunate}x-strain distribution. Thin fat plates containing either symmetrical <b>semi-circular</b> <b>grooves</b> or deep notches of various flank angles are subjected to a uniform tension. Four cases of flank angles are considered lying between 0 and 120 deg. The minimum width of all plates is taken constant and equal to the half of the width of the plates. The analysis of the state of stress is restricted to the initial part of the loading path from an incipient plastic deformation up to an impending plastic flow. The variation of stress distribution with the evolution of plastic enclaves is studied and the influence of the severity of notches on the mode of spreading of plastic zones is determined. © 1965...|$|R
40|$|Journal {{bearing design}} and the {{lubricant}} characteristics are very influential in a rotating machine behaviour. The bearing geometry can drastically affect the lubricant flow and also the rotor dynamics. Approaching that issue, this paper presents an experimental study of the dynamic behavior of a horizontal rotor suported by journal bearings with <b>semi-circular</b> axial <b>grooves.</b> The journal bearings were manufactured with a varied number of axial grooves and a versatile test rig is used, making possible the analysis of different configurations. The acquired signals are analyzed with classical and non-linear tools and the differences among the rotors’ configurations can be shown...|$|R
40|$|Many {{researches}} {{are reported}} on the fatigue strength of unnotched specimens pre-strained. By their results， the fatigue limit of the pre-strained materials generally increase with increasing {{of the amount of}} pre-strain， but it is lower than that of the original when the pre-strain is small. While there are few investigations on the fatigue of notched specimens pre-strained. This paper is the results of experiment on the fatigue strength of the notched steel specimens having <b>semi-circular</b> <b>groove</b> of O. 54 mm radius，for which the tensile pre-strain and then the fatigue test by direct stress are conducted. And they are {{different from those of the}} previous investigations on the fatigue strength of the pre-strained unnotched materials. That is，the fatigue limit rises with the increasing of the amount of pre-stratin，even when the pre-strain is small. This pheomenon is made clear from the results of the measurement of micro-hardness on the cross section and the observation on the surface of the notch root，as following：the state of the notch root under small pre-strain corresponds to the large pre-strain of the unnotched specimen...|$|E
40|$|Delaying stall {{is always}} an {{attractive}} option in the aerospace industry. The major benefit of delaying stall is increased lift during takeoff and landings as well as during high angle of attack situations. Devices, such as fluidic oscillators, can be integrated into wing flaps to help delay the occurrence of stall by adding energized air to the airflow on the upper surface of the wing flap. The energized air from the oscillator allows the airflow to remain attached to the upper surface of the wing flap. The fluidic oscillator being integrated in this thesis is an active flow control device (AFC). One common method for integrating any device into a wing flap is to remove {{a section of the}} flap and mechanically secure the device. A current trend in the aerospace industry is the increased use of fiber-reinforced composites to replace traditional metal components on aircraft. The traditional methods of device integration cause additional complications when applied to composite components as compared to metal components. This thesis proposes an alternative method for integration of the AFC devices, which occurs before the fabrication of wing flaps is completed and they are attached to the aircraft wing. Seven design concepts are created to reduce the complications from using current methods of integration on composite wing flaps. The concepts are based on four design requirements: aerodynamics, manufacturing, maintenance, and structure. Four of the design concepts created are external designs, which place the AFC on the exterior surface of the wing flap in two types of grooved channels. The other three designs place the AFC inside the wing flap skin and are categorized as internal designs. In order for the air exiting the AFC to reach the upper surface of the wing flap, slots are created in the wing flap skin for the internal designs. Within each of the seven design concepts two design variants are created based on foam or ribbed core types. Prototypes were created for all of the external design AFC devices and the side inserted AFC and retaining pieces. Wing flap prototypes were created for the rounded groove straight AFC design, the <b>semi-circular</b> <b>groove</b> with straight AFC, and the side inserted AFC designs. The wing flaps were created using the VARTM process with a vertical layup for the external designs. The rounded groove and <b>semi-circular</b> <b>groove</b> prototypes each went through three generations of prototypes until an acceptable wing flap was created. The side inserted design utilized the lessons learned through each generation of the external design prototypes eliminating the need for multiple generations. The lessons learned through the prototyping process helped refine the designs and determine the ease of manufacturing {{to be used in the}} design evaluation. The evaluation of the designs is based on the four design requirements stated above. The assessment of the designs uses two levels of evaluation matrices to determine the most fitting design concept. As a result of the evaluation, all four of the external designs and one of the internal designs are eliminated. The two remaining internal designs' foam core and ribbed variants are compared to establish the final design selection. The vertically inserted AFC foam core design is the most fitting design concept for the integration of an AFC device into a composite wing flap.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{analysis}} and development of rigorous modal expansion techniques for determining the scattering properties of singly-periodic diffraction gratings. Both reflection and transmission gratings are considered, and although emphasis is given to a theoretical study of the formalisms, many numerical results obtained with the latter are also presented. Most of the formalisms pertain to gratings having specific groove geometries and infinitely-conducting surfaces. However, in two cases one or other of these constraints is removed. Several of the established formalisms, based {{on a variety of}} nonmodal techniques, are reviewed, and the essence of their method described. The advantages that modal treatments have over these methods are explained, and previous applications of the former are summarised. Initial theoretical investigations concern the rectangular-groove grating. Intensive studies reveal an alternative approach to the concept of diffraction resonance anomalies. They also provide new insight into the understanding of this grating 1 s overall behaviour, including its blazing and passing-off properties in the first-order Littrow mounting. These ideas are usefully extended throughout the thesis to encompass the behaviour of all gratings. The theoretical treatment for the rectangular-groove grating is adapted to account for the diffraction properties of three unusual profiles which also possess a rectangular geometry. Two of these structures consist of a transmission grating on a reflecting element, and are shown to exhibit a pronounced resonance action. Tuning of the various grating parameters governs the behaviour of the resonances and indicates the potential use of these devices as a type of reflecting Fabry-Perot interferometer. The third structure is a stepped reflection grating which proves capable of accurately mode l 1 i ng the performance of general profile gratings including those with sinusoidal and triangular profi 1 es. Single and bi-modal expansions are shown to provide useful field approximations for not only the conventional rectangular-groove grating, but also for two of the three related structures. These approximations aid in the examination of resonances and other spectral phenomena. Their regions of accuracy and validity are determined. The assumption of perfect conductivity is relaxed in a formalism which is described for dielectric and lossy metallic surfaces. The method is tailored specifically to the rectangular-groove profile {{and is one of the}} few modal expansion techniques appropriate to non-perfectly conducting gratings. The thesis concludes with the presentation of two formalisms which employ an impedance-related condition to completely specify a set of modal functions. The first formalism prescribes a solution for a grating whose grooves are semi-circular in cross-section. Eigenfunctions for a circular waveguide constitute the modal functions. The second formalism accommodates reflection profiles of general groove crosssection, and utilizes a superposition of the rectangular-waveguide eigenfunctions. The first formalism is employed to evaluate in detail the spectral performance of the <b>semi-circular</b> <b>groove</b> grating, while the second is applied, not only to this grating, but also to the triangular and sinusoidal groove gratings...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the building}} was rather modest. The book depository’s <b>semi-circular</b> and dihedral <b>grooved</b> abutments were topped with plain slabs with the lower corners sloped {{in the shape of}} trefoils. The roofings of the corner sections, designed on the false vault principle, are composed of triangles differing in size and shape and arranged {{in such a way as}} to form eight-pointed stars. The decoration and design of the base of the rotund belfry, which reproduces in stone modified details of the “glkhatun” wooden tent, is more imposing. The bell tower was taller than Grigor church, and therefore dominated Goshavank ensemble.|$|R
