5000|$|After {{studying}} {{the work of}} Gustav Spörer, who examined old records from the different observatories archives looking for changes of the heliographic latitude of sunspots, Maunder presented a paper on Spörer's conclusions to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1890 and analyzed the results to show {{the presence of a}} prolonged <b>sunspot</b> <b>minimum</b> in the 17-18th century in a paper published in 1894.

40|$|The Schwarzschild {{criterion}} {{governing the}} onset of convective instability has been modified to include magnetic field. This may be of importance for solar variability. The revised condition suggests that the underside of field layers are stabilizing and the upper side destabilizing. Absolute instability can be reached to achieve conventional magnetic buoyancy.

50|$|The Sq current {{depends on}} season. The summer vortex is {{intensified}} {{compared with the}} winter vortex and reaches into the winter hemisphere. A longitudinal dependence of the Sq current exists which {{is related to the}} inclined dipole component of the internal magnetic field, but probably also to nonmigrating tidal waves from below. In the course of the 11-year solar cycle, the amplitude of Sq increases by a factor of more than two from <b>sunspot</b> <b>minimum</b> to sunspot maximum. Two thirds of this increase may result from the enhancement of the electric conductivity with solar activity. The rest is probably due to the increase of the wind speed caused by the temperature increase with increasing solar activity. During the night, the electron density of the ionospheric E-layer diminishes much more strongly than that of the F-layer. Therefore, the height center of the dynamo region shifts upward.|$|E
5000|$|During the Maunder Minimum aurorae {{had been}} {{observed}} seemingly normally, {{with a regular}} decadal-scale cycle. This is somewhat surprising because the later, and less deep, Dalton <b>sunspot</b> <b>minimum</b> is clearly seen in auroral occurrence frequency, at least at lower geomagnetic latitudes. [...] Because geomagnetic latitude {{is an important factor}} in auroral occurrence, (lower-latitude aurorae requiring higher levels of solar-terrestrial activity) it becomes important to allow for population migration and other factors that may have influenced the number of reliable auroral observers at a given magnetic latitude for the earlier dates. Decadal-scale cycles during the Maunder minimum can also be seen in the abundances of the beryllium-10 cosmogenic isotope (which unlike carbon-14 can be studied with annual resolution) [...] but these appear to be in antiphase with any remnant sunspot activity.

Respected scientists and enthusiastic amateurs insisted they had found patterns reliable enough to make predictions. Sooner or later though every prediction failed. An example was a highly credible forecast of a dry spell in Africa during the <b>sunspot</b> <b>minimum</b> of the early 1930s.

40|$|Proxy {{evidence}} at decadal resolution from Late Holocene sediments from Pickerel Lake, northeastern South Dakota, shows distinct centennial cycles (400 - 700 years) in magnetic susceptibility; contents of carbonate, organic carbon, and major elements; abundance in ostracodes; and δ 18 O and δ 13 C values in calcite. Proxies indicate cyclic changes in eolian input, productivity, and temperature. Maxima in magnetic susceptibility {{are accompanied by}} maxima in aluminum and iron mass accumulation rates (MARs), and in abundances of the ostracode Fabaeformiscandona rawsoni. This indicates variable windy, and dry conditions with westerly wind dominance, including during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Maxima in carbonates, organic carbon, phosphorous, and high δ 13 C values of endogenic calcite indicate moister and less windy periods with increased lake productivity, including during the Little Ice Age, and alternate with maxima of eolian transport. Times of the Maunder, Spörer and Wolf <b>sunspot</b> <b>minima</b> are characterized by maxima in δ 18 O values and aluminum MARs, and minima in δ 13 C values and organic carbon content. We interpret these lake conditions during <b>sunspot</b> <b>minima</b> to indicate decreases in lake surface water temperatures of up to 4 - 5 °C associated with decreases in epilimnetic productivity during summer. We propose that the centennial cycles are triggered by solar activity, originate in the tropical Pacific, and their onset during the Late Holocene is associated with insolation conditions driven by precession. The cyclic pattern is transmitted from the tropical Pacific into the atmosphere and transported by westerly winds into the North Atlantic realm where they strengthen the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation during periods of northern Great Plains wind maxima. This consequently leads to moister climates in Central and Northern Europe. Thus, Pickerel Lake provides evidence for mechanisms of teleconnections including an atmospheric link bridging between the different climate regimes from the tropical Pacific to the North Atlantic and onto the European continent...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} annual {{variation}} in solar wind speed at Earth's orbit and in geomagnetic activity since mid 1960 's.

Annual variation has maximum amplitude around <b>sunspot</b> <b>minima.</b> The phase of annual variation reverses soon after solar maxima, following the Sun's polarity reversal and indicating {{a new type of}} 22 -year periodicity. Stronger solar wind is found at or close to the Earth's highest northern (southern, resp.) heliographic latitudes during solar minima with a negative (positive) magnetic polarity. This implies an asymmetric SW speed distribution across heliographic equator such that the minimum speed region during solar minimum times is displaced away from heliographic equator towards the northern magnetic hemisphere. This may result e. g. from a systematically larger extension of polar coronal holes from the Sun's magnetic south pole toward solar equator. We exclude the earlier explanations proposed for annual variation, such as accumulation of small comets within 1 AU, or internal solar variation...|$|R

The results showed that extreme climatic events on the Plateau, such as the Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age and 20 th Century Warming appeared synchronously with those in other places worldwide. The largest amplitude and rate of temperature change occurred during the Eastern Jin Event (343 - 425 AD), {{and not in the}} late 20 th century.

40|$|High-resolution {{records of}} the past 2000 yr are {{compared}} in a north–south transect (28 ° N to 24 ° N) of three cores from the eastern slopes of the Guaymas, Carmen, and Pescadero Basins of the Gulf of California (hereafter {{referred to as the}} “Gulf”). Evenly-spaced samples from the varved sediments in each core allow sample resolution ranging from ∼ 16 to ∼ 37 yr. Diatoms and silicoflagellates capture the seasonal variation between a late fall to early spring period of high biosiliceous productivity, that is driven by northwest winds, and a summer period of warmer, more stratified waters during which these winds slacken and/or reverse direction (monsoonal flow). As these winds decrease, tropical waters enter the Gulf and spread northward. Individual samples represent a composite of 7 to 23 yr of deposition and are assumed to record the relative dominance of the winter vs. summer floral components. Intervals of enhanced summer incursion of tropical waters, alternating with periods of increased late fall to early spring biosiliceous productivity are recorded in all three cores. Regularly spaced cycles (∼ 100 yr duration) of Octactis pulchra, a silicoflagellate proxy for lower SST and high productivity, and Azpeitia nodulifera, a tropical diatom, occur between ∼ A. D. 400 and ∼ 1700 in the more nearshore Carmen Basin core, NH 01 - 21 (26. 3 ° N), suggesting a possible solar influence on coastal upwelling. Cores BAM 80 E- 17 (27. 9 ° N) and NH 01 - 26 (24. 3 ° N) contain longer-duration cycles of diatoms and silicoflagellates. The early part of Medieval Climate Anomaly (∼ A. D. 900 to 1200) is characterized by two periods of reduced productivity (warmer SST) with an intervening high productivity (cool) interval centered at ∼ A. D. 1050. Reduced productivity and higher SST also characterize the record of the last ∼ 100 to 200 yr in these cores. Solar variability appears to be driving productivity cycles, as intervals of increased radiocarbon production (<b>sunspot</b> <b>minima)</b> correlate with intervals of enhanced productivity. It is proposed that increased winter cooling of the atmosphere above southwest U. S. during <b>sunspot</b> <b>minima</b> causes intensification of the northwest winds that blow down the Gulf during the late fall to early spring, leading to intensified overturn of surface waters and enhanced productivity.

40|$|The diurnal {{variations}} of electron content and shape factor observed at an equatorial station during <b>sunspot</b> <b>minimum</b> are {{shown to be}} consistent with the electron density profiles observed at Jicamarca during <b>sunspot</b> <b>minimum.</b> The rapid increase in electron content and the shape factor at sunrise results from the EUV production of ionization in the E and F regions.

The evening decrease in the shape factor results from an upward drift of the F region at sunset and the evening decay of the E and bottomside F regions. The nighttime peak or plateau in the shape factor is produced by the slow downward drift of the electron density profile. The deep predawn dip in the shape factor is caused by the main peak of the F layer reaching low altitudes where high loss rates cause a large reduction in ionization below 300 km and very flat electron density profile...|$|E

Two multi-decadal intervals of sustained high Mg/Ca values indicate GOM sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) were as warm or warmer than near-modern conditions between 1000 and 1400 yrs BP. Foraminiferal Mg/Ca values during the coolest interval of the Little Ice Age (ca. 250 yrs BP) indicate that SST was 2 - 2. 5 degrees Celcius below modern SST.

40|$|Abstract. In this Paper III, {{the last}} one of the series, {{additional}} evidences are given that the fluxes of solar high energy particles, with energies higher than 100 MeV (the solar cosmic rays), are a very {{important component of the}} “Sun–climate " relationship (see also Paper I and Psper II). It is known that the total solar irradiance and the galactic cosmic rays produce an integral climate effect of cooling in <b>sunspot</b> <b>minima</b> epochs and warming in sunspot maxima epochs. Contrariwise, the powerful solar corpuscular events cause cooling predominantly during the epochs of their high levels. By this reason subcenturial global and regional temperature quasi-cyclic changes with duration of approximately 60 years could be tracked during the last 150 years of instrumental climate observations. This paper shows that this subcenturial oscillation is very important in the group sunspot number data series since the Maunder minimum up to the end of 20 th century. Only a relatively short period, closely before and during the last centurial Gleissberg-Gnevishev’s minimum (AD 1898 - 1923), when this cycle is totally absent, is an exception there. Thus the solar eruptive activity make the total "Sun–climate " relationship essentially more complicated as it could be expected if only the total solar irradiance and the galactic cosmic rays variations ar...|$|R
