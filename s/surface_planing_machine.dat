40|$|Abstract For a {{portable}} structured light system, {{it must be}} {{easy to use and}} flexible. So the inconvenient and expensive equipment for calibration such as two or three orthogonal planes or extra fixed equipment should not be considered. For the purpose of fast 3 D acquisition, the projection matrices of {{a portable}} structured light system should be estimated. This paper proposes a flexible calibration method to meet the requirements of the portable structured light system through a <b>surface</b> <b>plane.</b> A calibration board is attached to the <b>surface</b> <b>plane,</b> and a reference pattern is also projected by an LCD projector onto the <b>surface</b> <b>plane.</b> The camera observes the <b>surface</b> <b>plane</b> at a few different positions. Then, the world-to-image point pairs for the camera and projector are obtained based on the cross ratio and epipolar geometry, and the system is thus calibrated. The experiments conducted for the proposed calibration method demonstrate its accuracy and robustness. Key words Projector calibration, camera calibration, portable structured light system Research on shape reconstruction and object recognition by projecting structured light stripes onto objects has been active since the early 1970 s. Due to their fast speed and non-contact nature, structured light techniques have found numerous applications.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{time domain}} free surface Green function {{is the sum}} of the potentials of a Rankine source and its image source and a wave integral. The wave integral is harmonic in the fluid domain upper bounded by the mean free <b>surface</b> <b>plane</b> $z= 0 $ and is highly oscillatory when field and source points are close to the mean free <b>surface</b> <b>plane.</b> It is obtained that the limit form of the wave integral in the dimensionless formulation is the elementary function $$\int^\infty_ 0 \sqrt{\lambda} J_ 0 (\lambda) \sin(s\sqrt{\lambda}) d \lambda=\frac{s}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\sin\left(\frac{s^ 2 } 4 \right) $$ on the mean free <b>surface</b> <b>plane.</b> The function $J_ 0 $ is the zero order Bessel function of the first kind. The velocity potential of the fluid motion problem of a surface piercing body advancing in waves is defined by a normal velocity boundary integral equation, which contains waterline contour integral of the normal derivative of the time domain free surface Green function. This elementary function form implies the ill-posedness of the boundary integral equation due to the unboundedness of the waterline integral...|$|R

For semantic classification we propose to first reconstruct <b>surface</b> <b>planes</b> in the point cloud. Using an OWL-DL ontology, we automatically analyze relations between <b>surface</b> <b>planes</b> in a cluster to generate hypotheses for present objects. To check these hypotheses we surface sample appropriate CAD models and use standard ICP to fit the scan data with {{the model of the}} hypothesized object. The final result is a hybrid semantic map, in which all identified objects have been replaced by their corresponding CAD models. I...|$|R

40|$|The charge {{distribution}} around the VO bonds in V 2 O 5, V 6 O 13, and V 2 O 4 {{was calculated by}} using an empirical formula. The same expression was also {{used to calculate the}} oxygen bond strengths on the surface. The surfaces of lower oxides were treated as though they were in an oxidized state which is believed to correspond to the conditions in oxidation and ammoxidation processes. The result is that O 2 −, in the form of VO surface groups, is responsible for the catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons. O− is hindered by the formation of stable OH− groups. The positions of lower valent oxygens are considered to be vacant because of a slow reoxidation rate. In V 2 O 5 the VO groups are located on the (010) plane, while in V 6 O 13 they are mainly located on the (001) <b>surface</b> <b>plane.</b> But in this case the (100) and (010) <b>surface</b> <b>planes</b> also have some VO groups. The catalytic activity of the rutile form of V 2 O 4 is limited by sterical factors, but the (110) <b>surface</b> <b>plane</b> has oxygens pointing perpendicular out of the surface...|$|R
