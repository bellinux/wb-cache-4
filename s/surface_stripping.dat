Study Design: A prospective fine-section histological study of formalin-stored ossicles, harvested from cholestea-tomatous ears, to evaluate for existence of residual cholesteatoma after surface disease clearance under the operating microscope. Methods: One hundred four ossicles were harvested from 76 patients with cholesteatoma for the study. These malleus heads and incudes were categorized into three groups: group 1, ossicles with retained shape and useful bulk, treated by microscopic stripping alone; group 2, ossicles with retained shape and useful bulk, treated by micro-scopic stripping and drilling; and group 3, badly eroded ossicles, treated by microscopic stripping alone. These treated ossicles were then subjected to 4 -m histopathological study. Results: Residual dis-ease was identified in 6 of the 104 ossicles. Residual disease was found only in badly eroded ossicles that are not suitable for reconstruction. All the usable os-sicles were free of disease.

40|$|A polyacrylamide-based molecularly {{imprinted}} polymer (MIP) {{was prepared}} for bovine haemoglobin (BHb). A 3 mg/ml solution of BHb was injected over a dual polarisation interferometer (DPI) sensor to form a physisorbed layer typically of 3. 5 ± 0. 5 nm thickness. Onto the pre-adsorbed protein layer, MIP and NIP (non-imprinted polymer) were separately injected to monitor the interaction of BHb MIP or NIP particles under different loading conditions with the pre-adsorbed protein layer. In the case of NIP flowing of the protein layer, there was negligible <b>surface</b> <b>stripping</b> of the pre-adsorbed protein. When a protein-eluted sample of MIP particles was flowed over a pre-adsorbed protein layer on the sensor chip, the sensor detected significant decreases in both layer thickness and mass, suggestive that protein was being selectively bound to MIP after being stripped-off from the sensor surface. We also integrated thin-film MIPS for BHb and BSA onto the DPI sensor surface {{and were able to}} show that whereas BHb bound selectively and strongly to the BHb MIP thin film (resulting in a sustained increase in thickness and mass), the BHb protein only demonstrated transient and reversible binding on the BSA MIP. MIPs were also tested after biofouling with plasma or serum at various dilutions. We found that serum at 1 / 100 dilution allowed the MIP to still function selectively.

40|$|Transcutanous {{immunization}} (TCI) is {{a promising}} alternative to conventional injections, because {{in contrast to}} muscle and fat tissue, the skin is especially rich in antigen-presenting cells, e. g. Langerhans cells (LC). Different techniques have been proposed to overcome the barrier function of the skin. Recently, a newly developed protocol based on cyanoacrylate skin <b>surface</b> <b>stripping</b> (CSSS), which facilitates penetration via hair follicles, {{has been shown to}} be safe and effective in inducing cellular immune responses, possibly via targeting of hair follicle-associated LC. Barrier disruption as well as possible immunostimulatory effects caused by CSSS were postulated key factors. In order to assess the effects of CSSS on the distribution and the activation of LC in human skin, we investigated the expression of CD 1 a (specific for LC), CD 83 and CD 86 (known as activation markers) and HLA-DR by immunofluorescence on epidermal sheets and on cryosections prepared from excised human skin obtained from six patients undergoing plastic surgery. Changes of morphology, density and expression of activation markers in response to one CSSS, two CSSS procedures or topical application of TNF-alpha were studied, respectively. LC morphology and density were compared to epidermal sheets obtained by suction blister induction in eight healthy human volunteers. With 508 cells/mm 2 in suction blister epidermis compared to 550 cells/mm 2 in excised breast skin, LC density was similar in vivo and in vitro. Analysis of the cryosections revealed that LC dendricity, but not density was greater in hair follicle-associated LC (8, 42 cells/mm) compared to LC in the interfollicular epidermis (13, 85 cells/mm). 24 hrs after CSSS, distinct retraction of dendrites and rounding of the cell body of CD 1 a+ cells and a higher expression of HLA-DR, CD 83 and CD 86, was found in both CSSS- and TNF-alpha-treated samples. A marked decrease of LC was observed, which was most prominent 24 hrs after 2 CSSS procedures (288, 5 /mm 2) and which was most likely a result of LC migration in response to CSSS-induced activation. In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence, that treatment of skin with CSSS exerts immunostimulatory effects. Our studies further confirm that human skin explants are a valuable in vitro model and yield highly relevant preclinical data not only on penetration properties of topically applied compounds, but also on cell function. Due to its combination of immunostimulation and facilitated penetration, CSSS, which is non-invasive and well tolerated in humans, is a highly promising new approach in transcutaneous vaccination...|$|E

40|$|Tungsten carbide was {{synthesized}} by calcination {{of carbon}} cryogel with embedded tungsten {{in a form}} of metatungstate. This material {{was used as a}} support for Pt nanoparticles. XRD pattern of W-C support indicates the presence of WC, W 2 C, and unreacted W, as well as graphitized carbon. According to the previous TEM analysis of W-C support, it contains particles with core-shell structure, where W particle was covered with the shell of a mixture of WC and W 2 C. The average Pt grain size calculated from XRD pattern was about 6 nm. Cyclic voltammogram of W-C support was recorded within potential range relevant for its application as a catalyst support in fuel cells. Pair of anodic/cathodic peaks close to the negative potential limit could be ascribed to the intercalation of hydrogen within hydrous tungsten oxide, which is always present on the surface of WC in aqueous solutions. Cyclic voltammogram of Pt/W-C indicated that tungsten oxide species are present on tungsten carbide shell {{as well as on the}} surface of Pt nanoparticles. Pt surface is only partially covered by hydrous tungsten oxide. Hydrogen intercalation in hydrous tungsten oxide is enhanced in the presence of Pt nanoparticles. Also, the presence of hydrated tungsten oxide leads to the decrease of OH chemisorbed on Pt <b>surface.</b> <b>Stripping</b> of underpotentially deposited copper was used for the assessment of Pt surface area and the specific surface area of Pt was estimated to 41 m 2 g- 1. Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction was examined on the synthesized Pt/W-C catalyst and compared with the results on the commercial Pt/C catalyst. It was found that the current densities at Pt/W-C are almost double as those on Pt/C. The Tafel plots for both catalysts are characterized with two Tafel slopes: - 0. 060 V dec- 1 at low current densities, and - 0. 120 V dec- 1 at high current densities. From the rotational dependence of the reaction rate, it was found that oxygen reduction on both Pt/W-C and Pt/C follows the first order kinetics with respect to O 2 and that four electrons are transferred per O 2 molecule. The results show that the presence of tungsten carbide in support material i. e. hydrous tungsten oxide on Pt surface, leads to promotion of oxygen reduction on the Pt/W-C catalyst. It was assumed that oxophilic hydrated tungsten oxide hinders OH adsorption on Pt surface, thus increasing Pt surface area available for O 2 adsorption and its electrochemical reduction...|$|E
40|$|Regarding the topical {{application}} of substances distinction is essentially {{made between the}} penetration pathway through the Stratum corneum (SC), transcellular or intercellular, and penetration through physiological openings in the skin surface, such as the hair follicle. Particles tend to aggregate in hair follicle openings depending on their size. Especially micro- and nanoparticles (NP) {{can be used as}} carriers for active agents to target hair follicle associated structures like the sebaceous gland or antigen presenting cells (APC). The objective of this work was the improvement of the penetration of particles through human skin. The penetration of 40 nm and 200 nm solid fluorescent polysterolparticles was examined in human excised skin regarding the influence of formulation – aqueous solution or DAC Basiscreme - and different application techniques. Particles were either applied on non- treated or Cyanoacrylate Skin <b>Surface</b> <b>Stripping</b> (CSSS) pre- treated skin or were massaged in after application. Using CSSS, hair follicles could be opened, in which a surface of corneocytes and sebum would be removed. The Differential Stripping can be used to study the penetration of topical applied substances in the SC and the follicular infundibula selectively. Horny layer profiles, in which the whole SC is removed by the tape- stripping method, allow the determination of a relationship between a single tape and the removed corneocytes. The concentration of particles on every single tape can be measured and their penetration into the SC visualized in a penetration profile. With frozen sections the anatomic localization of the NP in the hair follicles was visualised and hence a qualitative analysis of the investigated factors was made possible. Using the penetration profile, it could be shown that 90 % of the applied particles remain in the upper layers of the SC. The role of the follicular infundibulum for the deeper penetration of substances could be underlined. After the application of 40 nm NP the follicular reservoir and penetration rate increased compared to 200 nm NP. Penetration enhancing effects were observed after CSSS application and also after massage. Particles penetrated better in aqueous solution. An optimal effect of the application techniques was shown here. According to {{the results of this study}} an application protocoll for particle associated actice agents would recommend the use of 40 nm particles, applied in aqueous solution, pre- treatment of the skin with CSSS and the application of a massage. Apart from improving penetration CSSS shows immunstimulating effects by activating APZ. On one hand by improving penetration of NP in the follicular infndibulum, the follicular reservoir and storage of topical applied drugs can be increased. On the other hand the hair follicle associated structures can be targeted. This is important for skin-celltherapy, stemcelltherapy and, by targeting APZ, transcutaneous immunization strategys...|$|E
