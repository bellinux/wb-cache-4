Carrick never grew large—the {{population}} varied from around 200 to 439—and {{today it is}} largely a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised water supply and sewerage, though reticulated services for both are now connected. Volunteer labour enabled piped water supply, from the Liffey, from 1961 and a <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> {{was built in the}} mid-1970s on the towns outskirts. The local councils' strategic plan aims for the town to stay small with only infill development.|$|E

There is significant contamination by ions of mercury and copper, organochlorine pesticides, phenols, petroleum products and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Cleaning of waste water in Saint Petersburg was started in 1979 and by 1997 about 74% of wastewater was purified. This number rose to 85% in 2005, to 91.7% by 2008, and as of 2009 was expected to reach 100% by 2011 with {{the completion of the}} expansion of the main <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant.</b> Nevertheless, in 2008, the Federal Service of Saint Petersburg announced that no beach of Saint Petersburg is fit for swimming. Moreover, in 2011 the City Council of Saint Petersburg voted to close one of the city's four sewage plants, causing the inability of the city in 2016 to handle record rains after a tropical storm and hurricane.|$|E

50|$|Drinking {{water is}} {{supplied}} from two springs near the Grün Lake and a further one from Kornock. The {{quality of the}} drinking water and of the Turrach lakes is very good, since the community is connected to a public sewerage system which was built from 1967 through 1972, so that the accumulated waste water is diverted over the Reichenau plain to purification plants in Feldkirchen. The Turracher Lake was the first lake in Carinthia for which a <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> was entirely completed.|$|E
50|$|Water {{pollution}} {{in the form of}} effluent from municipal <b>sewerage</b> <b>plants,</b> agriculture and mine water return flows perhaps pose the most serious threat to yellowfish in the middle to lower Vaal river and several of its tributaries. Whereas most of the ingredients of the effluent are not directly toxic to fish, the enriched water facilitates algal blooms that reduce dissolved oxygen concentration to lethal levels.

In the past rivers had been used for pollution discharges from factories and municipal <b>sewerage</b> <b>plants.</b> With increasing environmental awareness and {{the passing of the}} Resource Management Act 1991, these sources of pollution are now less problematic. Water abstraction, especially for irrigation, is now a major threat to the character of rivers. An upsurge in conversion of land to dairy farming is stretching water resources. Also, since dairy farming is becoming more intensified in New Zealand and requires large amounts of water, the problem is therefore being exacerbated.|$|R

50|$|The flow, and {{effective}} catchment area, {{are affected by}} irrigation diversion. Excess flow from the Cressy-Longford irrigation scheme is diverted into the river increasing summer flow in the river's lower reaches. This irrigation diversion originates at the Poatina Hydroelectric Power Station's tailrace and enters the river near Bracknell. Though the upper hills {{are known for their}} cool temperate rainforest, land along most of the river's length is used for agriculture.Water quality in the lower reaches is affected by agricultural run-off and for a small length by discharge from a <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> at Carrick. The plant, which also handles sewerage from nearby Hadspen, discharges treated waste-water into a tributary of the Liffey.|$|E
50|$|The first land grant at Carrick was in 1818 and {{a decade}} later William Bryan was {{building}} a wooden mill on the river's bank.

He was first taken to Ravensbrück and then to Berlin at the Tegel prison (from September 1944) where his wife visited him twice and reported the torture done to a hand and both his arms. From prison he sent letters to his wife including the farewell letter just moments before he died. On 15 January 1945 he was sentenced to death at the Volksgerichtshof (Roland Freisler condemned him) and was hanged on 23 January 1945 at the Plötzensee prison in Berlin.

50|$|By 1901, the town's {{population}} had reached 5,102, and by 1931 had doubled to 10,104. The early 20th century saw {{a period of}} increased urbanization of the area. The land immediately back from Hamilton Terrace, bounded by Robert St, Priory Road and Great North Road was now completely built upon. During World War I, the town welcomed many Belgian refugees from Ostend, {{many of whom had}} known the area through landing fish. They bolstered the fishing fleet, depleted by war service, and later erected a memorial in gratitude. In the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built in a variety of locations, including estates at Hakinville, Prioryville, Glebelands and Prescelly Place. In 1926 the Urban District Council completed work on an electricity plant, thereby completing the electrification of the town, at a cost of £70,000. A <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> followed in 1930, the Prescelly Waterworks in 1932, and in the same year the original toll bridge linking Milford and Hakin was replaced with Victoria Bridge. The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath. During the Second World War Milford Haven was chosen as a base for allied American troops, and roughly 1,000 American military personnel were housed in the town at this time. They manned an amphibious base which included a hospital built in Hakin and a docks complex at Newton Noyes. The base had a complement of 71 officers and 902 enlisted men, and played a role in preparations for D-Day. Milford escaped serious damage from German bombings during the Second World War. Despite its strategic importance as the home of a large fish market, a mines depot, a flax factory, and housing numerous military personnel, a co-ordinated attack on the town never materialised. In the summer of 1941 a bomb fell in fields near Priory Road, and later that year, a bomb damaged a house in Brooke Avenue. In neither instance were there casualties.|$|E
40|$|All of us produce {{large volume}} of {{wastewater}} every day. But we care about the environment more and more which brings building of new sewerage plants as well. Nowadays, there is an intensification of old sewerage plants and many new ones are being built. In the past, sewerage plants belong only to the cities, but now they can be found even in the villages. People should also know what they release into sewerage {{and they should be}} aware of it. We should not rely only on a <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> because it can not remove all the unwanted substance either. In my bachelor´s work on the theme ?Wastewater and its treatment in the <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> in the village Ostrožská Lhota?, I deal with the present status of the <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> in the village, the wastewater treatment system and wastewater in general as the theme indicates. The work is divided into two essential parts ? the theoretical and the practical one. Firstly, I described the former wastewater discharge in the theoretical part. Then I described the wastewater division and wastewater itself. Finally, I wrote about the <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant,</b> mainly about wastewater supply and its subsequent circulation. The next part is the practical one. My own research was a part of it. It was a quantitative form of research. The research was done by the method of questioning, in the form of questionnaires. The questionnaires were distributed to the residents of Ostrožská Lhota, people above 18. It was a random sample of people. 130 questionnaires were distributed in total. The obtained data are processed and analysed by means of charts. The secondary data analysis which was done by means of measuring data on inflow and outflow belonged to the practical part as well. Afterwards, the data were processed into charts. I set three goals in the work. The first goal was to evaluate the wastewater quality before the construction of the <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> in the village Ostrožská Lhota. The second goal was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} wastewater treatment in the <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> in the village. I tried to reach these two goals by means of secondary data analysis where I use the chart of measuring data on water inflow and outflow. I compared these figures with the limits of measurement ? limits which are set for the <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> by the water resource management. I found out that the <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> meets all the requirements and it does not exceed the limits. The measuring data are even below the limits. Lastly, the third goal was to find out the households´ opinion on wastewater pollution. I investigated on this goal by the help of the questionnaires. All the set goals were fulfilled. The testing results show that wastewater satisfies the limits of the water resource management and the people are aware of the discharged wastewater quality. This bachelor´s work can function as a recommendation when potential insufficiency is found. It can be also an educational material for non-professionals who do not know this topic and questions...|$|E

40|$|Classification schemes are an {{important}} issue in the collective use of large document collections. We have investigated the classification of technical documentations in two engineering domains: a steel mill and a <b>sewerage</b> <b>plant</b> company. In both cases we found a coexistence of different classification schemes and problems resulting from distributed local archives. In supporting human actors to maintain different classifications schemes while working on a common archive, we developed the concept of context grabbing. It allows assigning context information efficiently {{in the form of}} metadata. Based on a document management system, a tool kit for context grabbing was developed. Its evaluation in a sewerage service company allows us to comment on important aspects of understanding the role of classifications in collaborative work...|$|E
