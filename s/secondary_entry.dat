50|$|Architectural Features: Ruplal BlockRuplal {{block was}} {{designed}} in the Neo-classical style. This grand wing was square in plan with a square central courtyard. The lighter plain columns give the court sense of light and proportions. The rooms were arranged around this central courtyard {{in order to give}} privacy. Its main entry is from the northern portico with a triangular pediment over fluted columns with Corinthian capitals, which emphasizes the entry and its <b>secondary</b> <b>entry</b> from the front court through the series of archways which is also inviting. Service block lowering height is slightly detached from the main block.|$|E

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on November 15, 2013). Most {{empirical}} literature on Walmart Supercenters quantifies the price effect of Supercenter entries using lower frequency data (annual or monthly) {{and does not}} take into account finer geographical detail of retail markets experiencing Walmart entries. There is also very little empirical research on quantifying the impact of <b>secondary</b> <b>entries</b> by Walmart Supercenters in retail markets. We fill this gap by quantifying the price effect of <b>secondary</b> Supercenter <b>entries</b> into a specific retail market: Columbia, Missouri. We make use of hand-collected weekly price data spanning four time periods from 2006 to 2008 and do not find any evidence of negative price effect either in immediate term or in medium term following the opening of the two Walmart Supercenters in Columbia, Missouri. This result holds for all types of products and for grocery stores of all sizes. There is a dearth of economic literature that quantifies price pass-through following minimum-wage changes. We fill this gap by using a dataset of U. S minimum-wage histories from 1993 - 2012 along with micro-level price data on specific food products in the fast-food industry during the same time period. We find evidence that minimum-wage increases are associated with statistically significant increases in fast-food prices. However, we also find evidence that minimum-wage hikes are in fact endogenous to prevailing costs of living and correlated with the error term. This endogeniety bias suggests that that actual minimum-wage price elasticity may be much smaller than as estimated in earlier empirical literature on the subject...|$|R
50|$|A {{photograph}} taken in 1895 shows these two buildings, which {{were very similar}} in style. Both have prominent gables facing the street, corbelled chimneys, single level verandahs with decorative timber-work and rendered quoins, string courses and dressings to the windows. Whilst the verandah extended across the whole facade of the semi-detached houses, St George's House has two separate verandahs {{on each of the}} two larger gable fronts and a small awning covering a <b>secondary</b> <b>entry</b> of the western side of the building. A photograph dated 1894, shows St George's House in more detail, including turned balustrades to the verandahs above the main entry porch and a further entry to the building on the eastern side similar to that on the west. The building was basically symmetrical.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, Asaru can release Carter, {{but only}} to willingly merge with either Dr. Weir, Agent Weaver, or Director Faulke. The new host will knock Carter {{unconscious}} and the remaining agents will abandon the base. They discover that Origin still exists within {{what remains of the}} Mosaic network, and has transported itself to Earth's orbit in order to command the Outsiders stranded on the planet. The crew of the Avenger mounts their final attack against Origin's ship, with Asaru providing the new host with the powers it had given Carter. During the mission, one of the other two host options must be sacrificed while the other is rescued, and Carter, who believes that Asaru is no different from the Outsiders, must be either executed or incarcerated. Eventually, Asaru's host discovers a <b>secondary</b> <b>entry</b> point for Mosaic and psionically integrates with the network, destroying Origin and its influence over the Outsiders.|$|E
50|$|The Vernon House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a {{hip roof}} {{topped by a}} low balustrade.

A retrospective cohort study compared reusable steel cone-shaped non-cutting instruments to a historical group where disposable sharp cutting shielded instruments were used (n[*]=[*] 600) for <b>secondary</b> <b>entry</b> [18]. A reduced risk was found for port site herniation [OR 0.09 (95  % CI 0.01 – 0.69)] and for port site bleeding [OR 0.27 (95  % CI 0.07 – 0.97)] when non-cutting instruments were used.|$|E
30|$|Minor port-related {{complications}} are port site herniation, port site bleeding or postoperative wound hematoma, port site infection, extraperitoneal insufflation {{and other}} injuries {{that did not}} require IC or ICU management or a subsequent surgical, and endoscopic or radiological intervention under general anesthesiology. In the meta-analyses of the Cochrane review, some differences were found for minor port-related complications. REA instruments compared to standard port instruments for primary entry were associated with a reduction of port site bleeding [OR 0.31 (95  % CI 0.15 – 0.62), three studies, 421 participants]. Comparing instruments with a cutting versus a blunt tip for primary port entry, no difference in port site bleeding [OR 0.33 (95  % CI 0.09 – 1.23), two studies, 195 participants] or wound infection [OR 7.76 (95  % CI 0.15 – 386.69), one study, 165 participants] was found. For <b>secondary</b> <b>entry,</b> radially expanding instruments were associated with lower rates of port site bleeding compared to conventional instruments with a cutting tip [OR 0.12 (95  %CI 0.02 – 0.92) one study, 68 participants].

40|$|AbstractWhile {{influenza}} viruses {{are typically}} considered respiratory pathogens, the ocular system represents a <b>secondary</b> <b>entry</b> point for virus {{to establish a}} productive respiratory infection and the location for rare instances of virus-induced conjunctivitis. We used the ferret model to conduct a side-by-side comparison of virus infectivity, kinetics of viral replication, and induction of host responses following inoculation by either the intranasal or ocular routes with two viruses, A/Netherlands/ 230 / 03 (H 7 N 7) and A/Panama/ 2007 / 99 (H 3 N 2). We show that ocular inoculation resulted in delayed virus replication and reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcript in respiratory tract but not ocular tissues compared with intranasally inoculated animals. We identified numerous proinflammatory mediators with known roles in ocular disease elicited in ferret eye tissue following influenza virus infection. These findings provide {{a greater understanding of}} the modulation of host responses following different inoculation routes and underscore the risk associated with ocular exposure to influenza viruses...|$|E

Relevant database entries have been identified and categorized according to relevance to ENFE subissues. The goal of the evaluation is to provide guidance to NRC/CNWRA staff involved in issue resolution and review plan development activities, and to assess DOE's scenario development process. ENFE-related entries composed 35 percent ofthe 1, 786 database entries and 50 percent of the 310 primary entries. Deficiencies in the exclusion of FEPs have been identified, typically due to an inadequate technical basis. Four ENFE-relevant FEPs that {{were not in the}} database, but may be important to repository performance, have been identified. Conclusions on DOE's scenario development process and the FEP database related to structure, transparency, and usability, have been enumerated. Two key findings are that the combination of <b>secondary</b> <b>entries</b> into primary entries-a key component of the FEPs classification process-is problematic, and the database may not permit ready assessment of DOE's approach to interactions and couplings among FEPs.
