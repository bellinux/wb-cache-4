60|$|After that, {{as he had}} {{to leave}} the university, his trustee, Mr. Boulder, put Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> into business. It was, of course, his own business, one of the many {{enterprises}} for which Mr. <b>Spillikins,</b> ever since he was twenty-one, had already been signing documents and countersigning cheques. So Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> found himself in a mahogany office selling wholesale oil. And he liked it. He said that business sharpened one up tremendously.|$|E
60|$|Norah, of course, thought Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> a {{wonderful}} player. She was glad--in fact, it suited them both--when he beat her six to nothing. She didn't know and didn't care {{that there was}} no one else in the world that Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> could beat like that. Once he even said to her.|$|E
60|$|In this congenial company Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> {{spent the}} next three days.|$|E
5000|$|Glendalough - Quartz Gully (grade HS), Prelude/Nightmare (VS), Fanfare (VS), <b>Spillikin</b> Ridge (now harder at E3, climbed by Winder {{with several}} points of aid), Lethe (VS), Forest Rhapsody (VS), CÃºchulainn Groove (HS) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Alec, I {{wish you}} wouldn't use the mailed fist in your conversation. It's so very {{difficult}} {{to play a game}} with a <b>spillikin</b> {{on one side and a}} sledge-hammer on the other.' ...|$|R
50|$|In 1973 {{the park}} added its second roller coaster, the Mountain Express, a compact Schwarzkopf Wildcat model steel coaster. In 1974 the park also {{installed}} a new complex of spinning rides {{in what would}} later be known as Back Street. The new additions consisted of the Himalaya, Electric Rainbow, and Tumble Drum. In 1975, the Grand Centennial Railway opened in the Back Street. It took riders on a train journey to <b>Spillikin</b> Corners and back.|$|R
60|$|Incidentally Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> {{felt that}} it was all right to call her Miss Philippa, because she had a sister who was really Miss Furlong, so it would have been quite wrong, as Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> realized, to have called Miss Philippa by her surname. In any case, the beauty of the morning was against it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say," [...] said Mr. <b>Spillikins,</b> {{straining}} {{his short}} sight to the uttermost, [...] "what perfectly wonderful golden hair, eh?" [...] "Why, it's--" [...] Norah began, {{and then she}} stopped. It didn't seem right to explain that Mrs. Everleigh's hair was dyed. [...] "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?" [...] said Mr. <b>Spillikins.</b>|$|E
60|$|The last remark was ironical. It {{referred}} to the two quite large steamer trunks of Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> that were being loaded, together with his suit-case, tennis racket, and golf kit, on to the fore part of the motor. Mr. <b>Spillikins,</b> {{as a young man}} of social experience, had roughed it before. He knew what a lot of clothes one needs for it.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 Magic Mountain added Psyclone, {{modeled after}} the Coney Island Cyclone. The <b>Spillikin</b> Corners area of the park was re-themed as Cyclone Bay to suit the new coaster, drawing guests into this area. The change was largely cosmetic, as the earlier theme relied on retail establishments that had been removed previously. The Glass Blower had been {{replaced}} by the Shooting Gallery, and the Candy Kitchen viewing area was redesigned. With Psyclone, the crowds returned. Due to the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Psyclone's structure was damaged causing a very bumpy ride and the coaster was never the same. (Psyclone was later removed in 2007.) After adding Ninja, Viper, and Psyclone within 4 years, the park was getting a large repertoire of big roller coasters.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 {{the park}} was sold to Six Flags and became known as Six Flags Magic Mountain in 1980. In 1981, Six Flags Magic Mountain {{introduced}} a ride {{that was on the}} west coast for the first time called Roaring Rapids. It was developed by Intamin in conjunction with the now defunct Six Flags Astroworld, which had opened a similar ride in 1979. Along with Rapids came the completion of the midway near <b>Spillikin</b> Corners to link with Revolution's area. Finally, a complete circuit could be made around the park. It was originally designed as a dual-sided station, but only one was fully developed, and all that exists of the possible second side is a few supports. It uses large pumps to circulate water, and each of the two pumps can circulate 88,500 gallons per minute. The reservoir can hold 1.5 million gallons of water, and one of the innovations used on it was the introduction of guide boards to help eliminate jam ups.|$|R
50|$|The first climbs at Fair Head {{were done}} in the mid-1960s by some Belfast-based climbers {{and members of the}} Dublin-based <b>Spillikin</b> Club. Most of these climbs {{followed}} loose and dirty chimneys and are rarely repeated nowadays, but the seed had been planted, and {{before the end of the}} sixties development of the crag had started in earnest. However, it was not long before the increasing political violence in the North started making its presence felt; the Fair Head area was generally unaffected, but development of the crag slowed to a trickle during the early 1970s. However the attractions of Fair Head eventually proved irresistible and development picked up again in the late seventies, led by the husband-and-wife team of Calvin Torrans and Clare Sheridan and a number of other Dublin climbers. This small band devoted themselves to developing Fair Head, founded the Dal Riada Climbing Club (named after the ancient kingdom which included this area), and acquired a climbing hut nearby to accommodate themselves and other visiting climbers. There is still unclimbed rock at Fair Head; opportunities, mainly in the higher grades, are waiting for those who have the talent and dedication.|$|R
60|$|Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> {{himself was}} fascinated with his studies. The professors {{seemed to him}} living wonders.|$|E
60|$|But just at {{that moment}} Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> looked up, and he said in quite an altered tone.|$|E
60|$|The whole thing, {{from the}} point of view of Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> or Dulphemia or Philippa, {{represented}} rusticity itself.|$|E
60|$|He {{would have}} married any of them. But {{when a girl}} can work out {{trigonometry}} at sight, what use can she possibly have for marriage? None. Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> knew this and it kept him silent. And even when the most beautiful girl in the class married the demonstrator and thus terminated her studies in her second year, <b>Spillikins</b> {{realized that it was}} only because the man was, undeniably, a demonstrator and knew things.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't say so!" [...] said Mr. <b>Spillikins,</b> lost {{in amazement}} at the {{wonderful}} physical strength that Mr. Newberry must have.|$|E
60|$|And naturally, {{with such}} a {{sympathetic}} listener, {{it was not long}} before Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> had begun to talk of Dulphemia and his hopes.|$|E
60|$|And {{as to who}} Tom was, or {{what was}} the {{relation}} between Tom and the Newberrys, Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> neither knew or cared; nor did it interest him in the least that Philippa had met Tom in Bermuda, and that she hadn't known that he even knew the Newberry's nor any other of the exuberant disclosures of the moment. In fact, {{if there was any}} one period rather than another when Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> felt corroborated in his private view of himself, it was at this moment.|$|E
60|$|For {{she could}} see from the poise of his head how awfully clever he was; and {{from the way he}} stood with his hands in his side pockets {{she could see}} how manly and brave he must be; and of course there was {{firmness}} and strength written all over him. In short, she saw as she looked such a Peter <b>Spillikins</b> as truly never existed, or could exist--or at least such a Peter <b>Spillikins</b> as {{no one else in the}} world had ever suspected before.|$|E
6000|$|During their {{walks on}} Plutoria Avenue one may hear the four boys {{addressing}} Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> as [...] "father" [...] and [...] "dad" [...] in deep bull-frog voices.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove!" [...] said Mr. <b>Spillikins,</b> as {{he looked}} about him at {{the house and the}} {{beautiful}} lawn with its great trees, [...] "it's a lovely place." ...|$|E
60|$|Almost any day, on Plutoria Avenue or thereabouts, you may {{see little}} Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> out walking with his four tall sons, who are {{practically}} as old as himself.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> {{started to}} say, [...] "I didn't know--" [...] and then checked himself and said, [...] "By Gad! what a fine-looking little chap, eh? I'm awfully fond of boys." ...|$|E
60|$|So tickled was he {{that after}} a few weeks of oil-selling Mr. Boulder urged Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> to retire, and wrote off many {{thousand}} dollars from the capital value of his estate.|$|E
60|$|And {{that morning}} when Dulphemia was carried {{off in the}} motor to the station, Mr. <b>Spillikins,</b> without exactly being aware how he had done it, had somehow {{transferred}} himself to Philippa.|$|E
6000|$|... "Goodbye," [...] said Norah, and as {{she said}} it and put out her hand there were tears brimming up into her eyes. But Mr. <b>Spillikins,</b> being short of sight, didn't see them.|$|E
60|$|And then Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> checked himself, for he noticed--this {{was on the}} {{verandah}} in the morning--that Norah had a hat {{and jacket}} on and that the motor was rolling towards the door.|$|E
6000|$|In {{those days}} {{the first thing}} that one noticed about Mr. Peter <b>Spillikins</b> was his exalted view of the other sex. Every time he passed a {{beautiful}} woman in the street he said to himself, [...] "I say!" [...] Even when he met a moderately beautiful one he murmured, [...] "By Jove!" [...] When an Easter hat went sailing past, or a group of summer parasols stood talking on a leafy corner, Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> ejaculated, [...] "My word!" [...] At the opera and at tango teas his projecting blue eyes almost popped out of his head.|$|E
60|$|He was {{standing}} {{at the corner of the}} lawn where it sloped, dotted with great trees, to the banks of the little lake, and was showing Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> the beauties of Castel Casteggio.|$|E
60|$|But now, of course, since Mrs. Everleigh has {{remarried}} {{and become}} Mrs. Everleigh-Spillikins {{there is no}} need to keep them at Mr. Wackem's any longer. Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> is able to look after them.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, boys," [...] says Mr. <b>Spillikins.</b> And a {{few minutes}} later one may see them all hustling up the steps of the Everleigh-Spillikins's mansion, quite eager at the prospect, and all talking together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it fine," [...] whispered Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> to Mr. Newberry, [...] "to see {{a set of}} {{men like}} these all going into a thing like this, not {{thinking}} of their own interests a bit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear chap," [...] said Mr. <b>Spillikins,</b> [...] "that's all right. After all, thirty cents isn't much, eh what? Dash it, old man, we won't {{fight about}} thirty cents. How {{much do you}} want?" ...|$|E
60|$|Later on, when <b>Spillikins</b> {{went into}} {{business}} and into society, {{the same fate}} pursued him. He loved, {{for at least six}} months, Georgiana McTeague, the niece of the presbyterian minister of St. Osoph's. He loved her so well that for her sake he temporarily abandoned his pew at St. Asaph's, which was episcopalian, and listened to fourteen consecutive sermons on hell. But the affair got no further than that. Once or twice, indeed, <b>Spillikins</b> walked home with Georgiana from church and talked about hell with her; and once her uncle asked him into the manse for cold supper after evening service, and they had a long talk about hell all through the meal and upstairs in the sitting-room afterwards. But somehow <b>Spillikins</b> could get no further with it. He read up all he could about hell so as {{to be able to talk}} with Georgiana, but in the end it failed: a young minister fresh from college came and preached at St. Osoph's six special sermons on the absolute certainty of eternal punishment, and he married Miss McTeague as a result of it.|$|E
60|$|For the Little Girl in Green {{looked at}} Mr. <b>Spillikins</b> with wide eyes, {{and when she}} looked at him she saw all at once such {{wonderful}} things about him as nobody had ever seen before.|$|E
