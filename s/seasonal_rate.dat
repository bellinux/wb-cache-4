40|$|The water soft path (WSP) {{has been}} {{formulated}} as a progressive paradigm in water management. The WSP {{has four main}} principles: water {{should be viewed as}} a service; ecological sustainability is of utmost importance; water quantity and quality should be conserved; and planning should be done from the future backwards, not projected from the present. It may be possible to use conservation-based water pricing programs, especially at the residential level, in order to incrementally implement the WSP. Moreover, the implementation of residential <b>seasonal</b> water <b>rates</b> has been suggested as a method to curb peak demand in municipal water systems, thereby deferring infrastructure expansion. The purpose of this thesis is to answer the question: what are the barriers to implementing residential <b>seasonal</b> water <b>rates</b> in the Region of Waterloo? This question is addressed using a variety of data sources, with the majority of the information coming from academic and non-academic literature, and from interviews with water professionals and local councillors. The results provide a descriptive case study concerning the barriers to implementing <b>seasonal</b> water <b>rates</b> in one particular region of southwestern Ontario, but the conclusions can be generalized to describe some of the barriers to the implementation of <b>seasonal</b> water <b>rates</b> in Ontario.

40|$|Lindblad (1967) has {{concluded}} that there was an inverse relation between meteor rates and the solar cycle brought about by an increase in atmospheric density gradient at the height of meteor ionization. The present paper investigates Lindblad's conclusion more fully by using three long series of continuous radar meteor data from New Zealand and Canada. The results confirm a clear variation of total rate from year to year, inversely correlated with the annual sunspot number. Although meteor rates call for a density gradient variation inversely related to the solar cycle, direct evidence for such a variation remains nonexistant. Possibly the effect is being obscured by other density changes occurring at these heights.

When poplar trees were grown under low K+ or Ca 2 + regimes, the cambial activity as well as the <b>seasonal</b> <b>rate</b> of wood increment and the vessel size were significantly re-duced. Molecular, biochemical and electrophysiological in-vestigations indicate (i) a strong involvement of specific K+ channels in the regulation of xylem cell expansion and (ii) a significant influence of Ca 2 + on the onset of cambial reactiva-tion after winter dormancy as well as on wood structure and chemistry.

Mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures were used to analyse and establish recent temperature trends on an annual and seasonal basis. The year was divided into rainy and dry seasons for the seasonal trends. Mean monthly relative humidity at 6 am and 3 pm from 1961 to 2012 were considered to show recent trends in humidity since temperature and humidity interact to determine the heat exposure for outdoor workers. Regression {{analysis was used to}} illustrate trends and calculate mean yearly and <b>seasonal</b> <b>rate</b> of change. A Durbin-Watson statistical test was employed to verify autocorrelation of the residuals of the trend models and none was detected. Results showed a gradual and statistically significant rise in both mean minimum and mean maximum temperatures at two stations (Manga and Garu).

40|$|Brandt&# 039;s voles (Microtus brandti) {{are small}} native mammals that inhabit the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China. The species is {{considered}} a pest, particularly during population outbreaks, which have increased in frequency since 1970 from 1 every 7 years to 1 every 3 to 5 years. Using historical records taken between 1948 and 1998, we {{found that there was}} significant correlation between years for which the monthly averages of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were consistently high, and years in which outbreaks occurred. Also there was a tendency for outbreaks not to occur in years with precipitation above or below average. For some years at some sites, annual or biannual estimates are available for the density of Brandt&# 039;s vole populations. We found that the <b>seasonal</b> <b>rate</b> of increase over the non-breeding season from autumn to spring was negatively correlated with the density in autumn. The rate of increase over the breeding season from spring to autumn was independent of the density in spring but instead, reflects the species&# 039; preference for habitat with short, sparse grass; populations do not persist in highly degraded grasslands or in tall, dense grassland. The link between outbreaks and climatic indices, and the numerical response of Brandt&# 039;s voles to particular habitat characteristics, suggest that current grazing intensity tends to maintain grass at low height in years with average precipitation. The substantial increase in livestock numbers over the last 50 years appears to have increased the number of years when the balance of grazing and plant growth favours high rates of increase in Brandt&# 039;s vole populations, and hence, there has been an increase in the frequency of outbreaks...|$|E

Cryptosporidiosis was diagnosed in 120 (2. 8 %) patients. Among the 1296 individuals with complete follow-up until death, cryptosporidiosis occurred in 69 (5. 3 %). The <b>seasonal</b> <b>rate</b> of cryptosporidiosis showed a modest bimodal trend with the highest rates occurring in March-May and September-October. There {{was no difference in}} the rate of cryptosporidiosis for the periods of heaviest rainfall (December-March) and low rainfall (April-November). Infection rates were higher among males (1. 59 per 100 person-years) than females (0. 92) and lower in blacks (0. 98) than other racial/ethnic groups (1. 80). A significant trend of decreasing cryptosporidiosis was observed with increasing age, with the highest rate (2. 34) in the 13 - 34 year age group. A strong association between cryptosporidiosis and CD 4 + count was noted. These data suggest that cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected individuals in Los Angeles County exhibits a modest spring and fall seasonality. This pattern of occurrence of cryptosporidiosis appears temporally unrelated to local rainfall patterns. Our findings suggest that HIV-infected men, individuals in younger age groups and those with CD 4 + lymphocyte counts < 100 x 10 (6) /l are at increased risk of cryptosporidiosis.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the behaviour of an earthflow in a marine origin clay shale of the Southern Italian Apennines, and analyses the first {{results of an}} experimental remedial measure of soil improvement based on KCl wells. The main features of the structure and kinematics of the earthflow have been evaluated {{on the basis of}} geomorphologic analyses, geotechnical laboratory and field investigations, monitoring of deep/superficial displacements and pore water pressures, and modelling by phenomenological and physically-based approaches. The results of the study show that the landslide movement corresponds to a very slow sliding on a deep shear surface, along a fault line, in the residual shear strength conditions. Internal viscous strains also occur locally, above all in the weathered and softened soil, and contribute to the constancy of soil discharge along the channel. The average yearly rate of displacement, over the past ten years, has been in the order of few cm/year in the head zone and one/two orders of magnitude lower in the accumulation. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>rate</b> variations are apparently influenced by rain which can influence, besides pore pressures, pore fluid composition. The pore fluid is a composite saline-sodic solution, the concentration of which decreases dramatically from the stable soil to the landslide body and to the uppermost soil horizon. Laboratory results show that with sodium concentration decreasing, the shear strength decreases and the shear displacement rate under constant effective stresses increases. On the other side, the laboratory results show that exposure to potassium chloride solutions makes the soil shear strength increase greatly and permanently. First results of a chemical treatment by KCl wells in the head zone of the earthflow show that, locally, the ion transport in the surrounding soil is rather fast...|$|E

Claws are metabolically inert, keratinous tissues that grow continuously and can be sampled at any point in the annual cycle, thus providing potentially useful clues about an individual&# 039;s previous movements. However, variation in the rate at which claws incorporate local &# 948;D values is not well described. We measured &# 948;D values in claws of two species of Neotropical-Nearctic migrant wood-warblers (Golden-winged Warbler and Cerulean Warbler) breeding in eastern Ontario, Canada to investigate the rate of &# 948;D change through the breeding season and the utility of claw &# 948;D values for estimating migratory origins. &# 948;D values of claw tips from 66 different individuals, each sampled once during the breeding season, showed an average change of - 0. 3  to - 0. 4  per day {{in the direction of the}} expected local Ontario value.

Information on given and family names is also presented and these data are important to discover connections of Murter population with other villages and towns. Registers also show the social differences among Murter population. Wealthier families obviously developed contats with nobility and merchants, because members of these families can be traced in registers as godfathers and witnesses. Members of more influential and wealthier Murter families often took part in the local administration (dux, sergente, capitanio, serdar) and clergy. The important feature of Murter population is continuity of traditional families. In the period of almost one century only three or four new families temporary appeared in Murter. Extinction of male members of the family was usually resolved through marriage and husband took his wife’s family name. Husbands from matrilineal marriages usually came from other Murter families and rarely from other villages. This article gives general information on demographical and statistic developments of the Murter population during 18 th and early 19 th century, but further research will surly give new important discoveries...|$|E
50|$|Time of use (TOU) net {{metering}} employs a special reversible smart (electric) meter that is programmed to determine electricity usage {{any time during}} the day. Time-of-use allows utility rates and charges to be assessed based on when the electricity was used (i.e., day/night and <b>seasonal</b> <b>rates).</b> Typically the generation cost of electricity is highest during the daytime peak usage period, and lowest at night.Time of use metering is a significant issue for renewable-energy sources, since, for example, solar power systems tend to produce energy during the daytime peak-price period, and produce little or no power during the night period, when price is low. Italy has installed so many photovoltaic cells that peak prices no longer are during the day, but are instead in the evening. TOU {{net metering}} affects the apparent cost of net metering to a utility.|$|R

40|$|Influenza is {{a common}} {{infection}} among travelers, and attack rates are well documented in short-term travelers and holiday makers. Little data exists on long-term, non-expatriate travelers. This was a prospective mono-centre study of immunocompetent, Dutch travelers aged ≥ 18 to 64 years. It was conducted at the Public Health Service travel clinic in Amsterdam from December 2008 to September 2011, and included all travelers intending to travel to a tropical or sub-tropical country. Among 602 Dutch long-term travelers to tropical regions, 82 % had protective influenza antibody titres pre-travel. The influenza attack rate of serologically confirmed infection during travel was 15 %, and of symptomatic infection was 6. 3 % (fever alone) and 2 % (ILI), respectively. The attack rate {{in this study is}} similar to <b>seasonal</b> <b>rates</b> of infection in the general population. Influenza vaccination pre-travel is therefore most important for people at risk of medical complications due to influenz...|$|R
