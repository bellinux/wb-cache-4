40|$|To {{determine}} whether egocentric distance judgments are accurate {{in a virtual}} environment with different ground surface textures. Observers were immersed within a virtual environment consisting of a large L-shaped room with a column located down one corridor and a flagpole located down the other. The observer's task was to view the column, then turn 90 degrees to view the other corridor where the flag was positioned. The observer then moved the flag's position (by using the joystick) until {{the distance between the}} observer and the flag was the same as the distance between the observer and the column. A within- subject design with column size (2 levels), column distance (4 levels), and surface texture (9 levels) was used. The texture beneath the column and the flag was varied from a high-density texture (grass), to medium-density (brick), to a low-density <b>texture</b> pattern (<b>carpet).</b> A within-subject design with column size (2 levels), column distance (4 levels), and surface texture (9 levels) was used. Subjects' distance estimates were significantly better when the brick texture was used underneath the column, than when the grass or <b>carpet</b> <b>texture</b> was used. U. S. Navy (U. S.

2500|$|The {{tradition}} of precise realism among Western painters {{of the late}} 15th and 16th century provides pictorial material which is often detailed enough to justify conclusions about even minute details of the painted carpet.

The method {{is able to}} isolate the hand {{from a wide variety}} of background <b>textures</b> such as <b>carpets,</b> fabric, glass, grass, soil or stones. The evaluation was carried out by using a publicly available synthetic database with 408, 000 hand images in different backgrounds, comparing the performance in terms of accuracy and computational cost to two competitive segmentation methods existing in literature, namely Lossy Data Compression (LDC) and Normalized Cuts (NCuts). The results highlight that the proposed method outperforms current competitive segmentation methods with regard to computational cost, time performance, accuracy and memory usage...|$|R

40|$|The {{domestic}} {{architecture in}} the rural villages of ̄zmir comprises a unique built environment with their masonry wall <b>textures,</b> <b>semi-open</b> sofas, round tiled-hipped roofs, and chimneys, and represents {{an important part of}} the cultural and architectural heritage. This assessment is mainly based on field observations that focus on the architectural and structural layout of intact, damaged, and destroyed houses. During field observation and the analysis of data certain plan typologies and relationships between the geological formations of the region and choice of materials and construction techniques were observed. While load-bearing masonry and timber skeleton systems are common, extensive use of timber laces, stone, and fired or adobe brick masonry with mud mortar and timber frames infilled with masonry materials were frequently seen. Generally, round timber elements such as wall plates, laces, lintels, posts, and frames of flooring systems are used. Architectural degenerations in authentic houses, defective details and partially due to the earthquake-prone nature of the region seismicity have been evaluated. An overall approach for the preservation and sustainability of this heritage is suggested. Special Provincial Administration of Izmir Governorshi...|$|R
5000|$|A natural {{behavior}} in cats is to hook their front claws periodically into suitable surfaces and pull backwards. Cats, like humans, keep their muscles trim and their body flexible by stretching. Additionally, such periodic scratching serves {{to clean and}} sharpen their claws. [...] Indoor cats may benefit from being provided with a scratching post {{so that they are}} less likely to use carpet or furniture, which they can easily ruin. However, some cats may simply ignore such a device. Commercial scratching posts typically are covered in carpeting or upholstery. Using a plain wooden surface, or reversing the carpeting on the posts so that the rougher <b>texture</b> of the <b>carpet</b> backing, may be a more attractive alternative to the cat than the floor covering. Scratching posts made of sisal rope or corrugated cardboard are also common.|$|R

However, the most common global localization technology - GPS - has limited accuracy and can be unusable in dense urban areas and indoors. We introduce an image-based global localization system that is accurate to a few millimeters and performs reliable localization both indoors and outside. The key idea is to capture and index distinctive local features in ground textures. This {{is based on the}} observation that ground <b>textures</b> including wood, <b>carpet,</b> tile, concrete, and asphalt may look random and homogeneous, but all contain cracks, scratches, or unique arrangements of carpet fibers. These imperfections are persistent, and can serve as local features. Our system incorporates a downward-facing camera to capture the fine texture of the ground, together with an image processing pipeline that locates the captured texture patch in a compact database constructed offline. We demonstrate the capability of our system to robustly, accurately, and quickly locate test images on various types of outdoor and indoor ground surfaces...|$|R

The village consists of several families namely: Yılmaz, Usanmaz, Akçora, Polat, Kaya, Karakaş, Karakuş, Yilmaz, Akkoyun, Akkaya, Palavan, Aydınlar, Taşdemir, Şahin, Beyazgül, Demir, Ergüner,Erdaş, Saraç. Also some immigrant families Ataç, Parlak. Cross marriages within the families made the ties between families very strong that made the war times relatively easier for the population.

50|$|The main {{element in}} the Mordvinian costume was a white canvas shirt, {{decorated}} with embroidery. Erzya shirt is made from two cloths, which beaned in two. In the middle, at the central suture there was a seam left to slit for the collar and the slit on the hem for a step. In the side seams on the top at right angle there were sewed sleeves. Traditional chest fastener in the Erzya costume was «fibula syulgamo». It was an oval buckle made of thick wire with a movable pin which was used for chipping the collar. Rich lower part covered a deep chest slit. In the 19th century, the collar was usually fastened by two fibulas, one of which had no decoration.Complex belt elements played a particular importance in Mordovian women`s costumes.Costume was loincloth- pulay, which was worn over a shirt. As a sign of pubescence, girls begin to wear a pulay since 13-14 years old and then it remained the woman`s costume accessory until her death. Mordvinian woman could not appear in men society without a «pulay». Depending on the place of existence, it had a different form: square, trapeziform or as a belt with magnificent fringe.Holiday « pulay» was decorated with shells, chains, copper buttons, badges, colored beads and along the edge with long, black, red, green or blue wool and with tassels on each side. As a result, the weight of such a «pulaya» was up to 6 kilograms. Waist decoration «pulay» was of two types. The {{right side of the}} cloth was decorated with embroidery. Then, almost to knees there was a fringe from the wool, usually of black, but on holidays it could be of red or green wool. Wool decorated with copper chains and on each side attached tassels of beads.Typical thing for Erzya costume was a canvas over clothes- “rutsya”. It was the clothing accessory of married women and had options for different situations in life and ritual. Over the shirt or rutsya they wore an apron - « ikelga patsya». It was tied low on the abdomen to close the hem of her shirt. In the complex adornments, which included several tiers of necklaces, especially distinguished original round collars on a firm basis covered with a canvas embroidered with rows of beads, buttons and chains. All of them perfectly matched with massive embroidery “rutsi”.The quality of clothing was defined by the type of embroidery. Spruce Erzya shirt was embroidered all along longitudinal stripes. Erzya embroidery was characterized by a beautiful <b>carpet</b> <b>texture,</b> borders and planes distinguished high relief. Although the ornament was pretty simple: rhombus, crosses and polylines. Decorating clothes women choose the best patterns - «sermat». In the old days they were the symbols of family belonging. Erzya woman naturally endowed with a sense of proportion. Intuitively, without the knowledge of designing and modeling clothes, she sewed a masterpiece. Red and black vertical stripes on a white canvas looked noble. A wide belt, «pulay» with long black strands emphasized hips and women looked slimmer. Removable adornments -were an obligatory addition to the clothes. This is a necklace with different lengths and materials, beaded collars, fibula-syulgamo, badges and bells.|$|R
