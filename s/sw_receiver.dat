In the context of the European Commission 6 th Framework Programme, GJU has initiated the Galileo Receiver Preliminary Development. Presently the GAlileo Receiver Development Activities (GARDA) project is running at this scope. This paper focuses on the Galileo Receiver ANAnalysis and Design Application (GRANADA), a new concept of Galileo <b>SW</b> <b>Receiver</b> Simulator, which development is part of the GARDA project [1], [2]. The tool has been developed by Deimos Space under Alenia Spazio specification. A Software (<b>SW)</b> <b>Receiver</b> is a key element in the GARDA project. GRANADA covers a dual role: test-bench for integration and evaluation of receiver technologies on one side, and <b>SW</b> <b>receiver</b> as asset for GNSS application developers on the other side. GRANADA is conceived as a modular and configurable tool, in which the user can embed and test his/her own algorithms with a user-friendly interface. It runs on a standard Windows PC, allowing the maximum use form people not involved in the development. The application recreates the bit-true signal processing chain of a Galileo receiver. It models the RF front-end, and processes IF measurements, including the correlation and 1 This paper has been published at the conference ENC-GNSS 2005, held in MUNICH, GERMANY from 19 to 22 JULY 2005. filtering, signal and data processing and PVT computation, allowing the use of GPS combined with Galileo.

It is shown {{that there is}} a one-to-one correspondence between DoA in the receiver parameter space and those in the global (or combined channel-receiver) parameter space. For general noiseless channels, DoA of <b>SW</b> <b>receivers</b> in the global response space are the minimum distance decision regions on a unit sphere. In the presence of noise and for the class of orthogonal channels, DoA of <b>SW</b> <b>receivers</b> for independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) input signals are the minimum distance decision regions on an ellipsoid determined by the channel coefficients and the noise variance. The DoA in the receiver parameter space are also characterized for the general nonuniformly distributed sources. The size of the DoA is shown to be affected by the signal power, the signal constellation, the noise level, and the channel condition. It is also demonstrated that although the optima of the Shalvi [...] Weinstein algorithm and those of the constant modulus algorithm are one-to-one correspondent, their DoA are different in general...|$|R
40|$|To improve {{localisation}} {{accuracy and}} multipath rejection, the Galileo-OS signal {{offers a new}} modulation with efficient power distribution technique between the two data and pilot navigation components. To achieve the full benefits of this modulation, a robust acquisition and tracking methods must be deployed. For example, using two parallel correlation channels to acquire these data and pilot will gain 3 dB over using a single channel acquisition correlating with either one of them. However, dual channel <b>SW</b> <b>receivers</b> cost more processing overheads. In this paper, the authors propose to orthogonalise the received data and pilot signals so to enable their acquisition in a single correlation channel bandpass sampling receiver. Our simulation results, using Simulink, prove that OGSR performance is maintained (preserving the 3 dB gain) with less processing time while the implementation complexity is reduced by 50 %...|$|R
40|$|Convergence {{properties}} of the constant modulus (CM) and the Shalvi [...] Weinstein (SW) algorithms {{in the presence of}} noise remain largely unknown. A new geometrical approach to the analysis of constant modulus and Shalvi-Weinstein receivers is proposed by considering a special constrained optimization involving norms of the combined channel-receiver response. This approach provides a unified framework within which various blind and (nonblind) Wiener receivers can all be analyzed by circumscribing an ellipsoid by norm balls of different types. A necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence among constant modulus, Shalvi-Weinstein, zero forcing, and Wiener receivers is obtained. Answers to open questions with regard to CM and <b>SW</b> <b>receivers,</b> including their locations and their relationship with Wiener receivers, are provided for the special orthogonal channel and the general two-dimensional (2 -D) channel-receiver impulse response. It is also shown that in two dimensions, each CM or [...] ...|$|R
40|$|For {{remote sensing}} purposes, the Earth's surface can be {{characterized}} analysing the reflection of a signal generated from a dedicated sensor which, in turn, must receive the scattered waves. Among the possible choices, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signals represent an innovative active source for the Earth remote sensing in L band. In this framework, we started {{the design of a}} GNSS-R (GNSSReflectometry) receiving system based on the N-Gene Navigation <b>SW</b> <b>receiver,</b> developed by the NavSas group of ISMB. Experimental characterization activities will be performed both on ground and on-board a small U. A. V (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) platform. Together with the system design, a feasibility study based on simulations was carried out to get ready the acquisition and processing stages for the future experimental campaign.

40|$|Modern mobile mapping systems (MMS) {{include one}} or several laser {{scanners}} and cameras complementing the core INS/GNSS navigation system. The {{idea of using}} the information available from the image and laser systems as additional source for navigation has been studied for some time. Hybridization of INSS/GNSS with LiDAR and imaging sensors, in combination with advanced signal processing in the receiver architecture, improves drastically the availability and reliability in urban environments. When GNSS fails, the navigation uses the LiDAR observations to keep controlled the inertial sensor errors. A conceptual receiver based on this approach {{was developed in the}} frame of ATENEA project [1], [2], in which a deep integration GNSS/INSS/LiDAR was prototyped in a <b>SW</b> <b>receiver</b> [3], including LiDAR-obtained planes as constraint for navigation. A comprehensive test campaign with simulated (GPS L 1, Galileo E 1 and Galileo E 5 -AltBOC) and real (GPS L 1) GNSS data was carried out. A real INS and LiDAR data acquisition van test was also performed in order to assure the concept feasibility. ATENEA results showed that hybridization with LiDAR data adds more reliability to the navigation solution when the GNSS signal was contaminated with interferences or multipath in urban scenarios or simply when the satellites were shadowed by scenario buildings. After having proved the concept, DEIMOS Space (DMS) and the former Institute of Geomatics (IG, currently integrated within the CTTC) have extended the research and development activity in the frame of the so-called ATENEA+ concept. One of the aims of this research is to adapt the processing chain of the raw data to a real-time architecture receiver. This would allow the implementation of the system on a hardware prototype based on DEIMOS advanced GNSS receiver [4] and [5]. In addition, the processing algorithms have been refined and adapted in order to allow the processing of imaging cameras and odometers, and to identify and use for navigation additional features from the 3 D point clouds such as lines. The camera and odometer provide more robustness and additional information {{that can be used to}} make the navigation solution more reliable. This paper presents the conceptual architecture for a real-time receiver navigation system that uses GPS/Galileo signals, INS measurements, LIDAR features, optical cameras images, and odometer observables. The feature extraction strategy from LiDAR and image data is presented, as well as the approach to combine them with GNSS and inertial data within the navigation SW. This paper also describes the processing algorithms and presents the test results obtained with simulated and real datasets demonstrating the increased accuracy and reliability. Finally, the lines of an implementation plan in a real receiver based on FPGA (as the GRIP receiver developed by DEIMOS [4]) are described...|$|E
