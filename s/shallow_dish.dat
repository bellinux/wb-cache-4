25|$|A Windsor {{chair is}} a chair built {{with a solid}} wooden seat into which the chair-back and legs are round-tenoned, or pushed into drilled holes, in {{contrast}} to standard chairs, where the back legs and the uprights of the back are continuous. The seats of Windsor chairs were often carved into a <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> or saddle shape for comfort. Traditionally, the legs and uprights were usually turned on a pole lathe. The back and sometimes the arm pieces (if arms are present) are formed from steam bent pieces of wood.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} two decades of the 1st century, the Dragendorff 37, a deep, rounded vessel with a plain upright rim, overtook the 29 in popularity. [...] This simple shape {{remained}} the standard Gaulish samian relief-decorated form, from all Gaulish manufacturing regions, for more than a century. [...] Small relief-decorated beakers such as forms Déchelette 67 and Knorr 78 were also made in South Gaul, as were occasional 'one-off' or very ambitious mould-made vessels, such as large thin-walled flagons and flasks. [...] But the mass of South Gaulish samian found on Roman sites of the 1st century AD consists of plain dishes, bowls and cups, especially Dr.18 (a <b>shallow</b> <b>dish)</b> and Dr.27 (a little cup with a distinctive double curve to the profile), many of which bear potters' name-stamps, and the large decorated forms 29, 30 and 37.|$|E
60|$|They {{decided at}} last, {{in view of}} the early {{departure}} of the train, and the probability that they would be more hurried at a hotel, to breakfast at the station, and thither they went and took places at one of the many tables within, where they seemed to have been expected only by the flies. The waitress plainly had not looked for them, and for a time found their presence so incredible that she would not acknowledge the rattling that Basil was obliged to make on his glass. Then it appeared that the cook would not believe in them, and he did not send them, till they were quite faint, the peppery and muddy draught which impudently affected to be coffee, the oily slices of fugacious potatoes slipping about in their <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> and skillfully evading pursuit, the pieces of beef that simulated steak, the hot, greasy biscuit, steaming evilly up into the face when opened, and then soddening into masses of condensed dyspepsia.|$|E
60|$|A fat brown goose lay {{at one end}} of {{the table}} and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, {{stripped}} of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes.|$|E

5000|$|Mould-press or cast glass: it {{was first}} practiced by the Hellenistic glassworkers from the 3rd century BC onwards. Although {{different}} decorative results were achieved by variations in colours, the technique was virtually the same for mosaic, monochrome hemispherical bowls, transparent tableware and gold-sandwich vessels, both luxurious fine ware and more affordable types. Mould-press or cast vessels were mainly open bowls, <b>shallow</b> <b>dishes</b> and jars, but some closed vessels were produced as well. They were made from a single mould on which a piece of glass was slumped.|$|R
50|$|He {{not only}} created many large market and pantry scenes and game still lifes, usually {{including}} dead deer. He also painted smaller works which were {{reminiscent of the}} breakfast pieces and still lifes that originated in northern art around 1600. Rather than continue the descriptive manner of the Antwerp painter Osias Beert, Snyders’ innovative still lifes combined objects in groups to form a geometrically structured composition. Recurring motifs were dead hares and birds, tazze (<b>shallow</b> <b>dishes</b> on a tall foot), baskets with grapes and other fruit, enamelled pitchers and Chinese Kraak porcelain.|$|R

25|$|Plain sigillata table vessels, which {{included}} large platters, <b>shallow</b> <b>dishes</b> in several sizes, slightly deeper bowls, and small cups, {{were made on}} the wheel using a range of templates to create very precise profiles. The sizes were also standardised, which would have facilitated the firing, storage and transport of the huge numbers that were made. The evolution in forms matches in many respects that seen in silver and glass table vessels of the same periods, and the precise forms can sometimes be closely dated. The forms archaeologically classified as 'plain' do sometimes bear decoration of a simple kind, often {{in the form of}} a ring of rouletting within the flat interior base of a dish. Plain wares also often bear name-stamps.|$|R
50|$|During {{the second}} half of the 3rd century BC, mosaic glass, also known as 'millefiori', literally, a {{thousand}} flowers, emerged. The group consists mostly of fused and slumped broad plates and <b>shallow</b> <b>dishes</b> with upright or out-splayed rims or hemispherical bowls. Sub-groups of mosaic glass production are 'network' or 'lacework' hemispherical bowls and vessels with meandering or spiral decorative patterns that imitate onyx. Often these bowls had a rim formed of a single ‘network’ cane of spirally twisted threads which gives a 'striped' effect. It is best represented in burial contexts from several large tombs in Canosa di Puglia (ancient Canusium) in Italy. They are open vessels since they are made with a mould but still opaque, like the widely produced core-formed vessels.|$|R
