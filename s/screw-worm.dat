5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World <b>screw-worm</b> fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E

25|$|This {{technique}} {{was used to}} eradicate Cochliomyia hominivorax <b>screw-worm</b> fly from the USA where the flies were endemic, and from Libya where {{there had been an}} accidental importation from South America. Although this species of blowfly under natural conditions has larvae of the obligate myiasis type, it is possible to colonize the entire life-cycle in large factory conditions. Massive numbers pupae are sterilized by irradiation. When released these flies mate with the wild flies and the matings produce no offspring. The reproductive rate of the wild flies can be reduced to the level of eradication. Eradication schemes are being extended in the Americas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction {{fragment}} length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) {{analysis was}} used to characterize mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in <b>screw-worms,</b> Cochliomyia hominivorax, and secondary screwworm, C. macellaria, from the Caribbean, North America and South America. Four amplicons, totaling 7. 1 kb, were analysed with sixteen restriction enzymes. A total of 133 restriction sites was observed in the two species, 104 in C. hominivorax, of which nineteen were variable, and ninety-five in C. macellaria, none of which was variable. Fourteen mtDNA haplotypes were observed among eighteen C. hominivorax examined. Mean divergence between C. hominivorax haplotypes (d) was 0. 0064 substitutions per base-pair and genotypic diversity (G) was 0. 97. Mean divergence between C. hominivorax and C. macellaria was 0. 0824. Cochliomyia hominivorax haplotypes could be divided into three assemblages representing North America, South America and Jamaica, based on UPGMA clustering with d values. The assemblages did not exhibit complete geographic fidelity. These data were discordant with previously published allozyme data indicating little differentiation between screwworm populations. A scenario invoking historically isolated populations coming into contact with the introduction and movement of European livestock is proposed to explain the observed population structure of screwworm.

50|$|Cochliomyia hominivorax, the New World <b>screw-worm</b> fly, or <b>screw-worm</b> for short, is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} fly that {{is well known for}} the way in which its larvae (maggots) eat the living tissue of warm-blooded animals. It is present in the New World tropics. There are five species of Cochliomyia but only one species of <b>screw-worm</b> fly in the genus; there is also a single Old World species in a different genus (Chrysomya bezziana). Infestation of a live vertebrate animal by a maggot is technically called myiasis. While the maggots of many fly species eat dead flesh, and may occasionally infest an old and putrid wound, <b>screw-worm</b> maggots are unusual because they attack healthy tissue.

50|$|Raymond Bushland and Edward Knipling {{developed}} the SIT to eliminate screw-worms preying on warm-blooded animals, especially cattle.

The larvae of these flies invade open wounds and eat into animal flesh, killing infected cattle within 10 days. In the 1950s, screw-worms caused annual losses to American meat and dairy supplies that were projected at above $200 million. <b>Screw-worm</b> maggots can also parasitize human flesh.Bushland and Knipling began searching for an alternative to chemical pesticides {{began in the late}} 1930s when they were working at the United States Department of Agriculture Laboratory in Menard, Texas.

5000|$|<b>Screw-worm</b> females lay 250-500 eggs in {{the exposed}} flesh of warm-blooded animals, {{including}} humans, such as in wounds and the navels of newborn animals. The larvae hatch and burrow into the surrounding tissue as they feed.

The maggots are capable of causing severe tissue damage or even death to the host. About three to seven days after hatching, the larvae fall to the ground to pupate. The pupae reach the adult stage about seven days later. Female <b>screw-worm</b> flies mate four to five days after hatching. The entire lifecycle is around 20 days.

50|$|A female wasp of {{this species}} may take {{anywhere}} from 30 to 60 flies as food to provision each one of her nests; she makes a new nest for every egg she lays. Nests are simple burrows some 15 cm deep, with a single enlarged chamber at the bottom.

Numerous females often excavate nests within a small area where the soil is suitable, creating large and sometimes very dense nesting aggregations.

The methodology adapted to study these chromo-somes and the salient features of the polytene chromosome karyotype are described. CYTOGENETIC STUDIES of the <b>screw-worm</b> fly, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), have been limited to the description of mitotic kar-otypes 2 - 7 ' 10 - 12, and the meiotic chromosomes in a translocation 9.

40|$|Interest in {{sterilization}} as {{a possible}} method for controlling insects of public health importance {{can be said to}} have arisen first in the mid-fifties, when the <b>screw-worm</b> fly was successfully eradicated from the island of Curaçao by the release over the entire island of large numbers of male flies sterilized by gamma-radiation. Since then, many studies on the sterilization of various insect vectors of disease have been carried out. This paper reviews these studies and discusses the present position regarding vector control by sterilization procedures, with special reference to the use of chemosterilants. These compounds have certain advantages over radiation since they can be used not only as a substitute for X-rays or gamma-rays in the sterilization of insects specially reared for release in large numbers, but also as a means of inducing sterility in natural populations of insects. The author emphasizes that chemosterilants cannot at present be recommended as a practical control or eradication procedure for any vector species of insect, but considers that this extension of the sterilization method holds great promise and merits intensive investigation...|$|E
40|$|Screwworms are obligate, {{invasive}} parasites of warm-blooded animals. The female flies lay {{batches of}} eggs {{at the edge}} of wounds or other lesions. These eggs hatch to larvae or screw-worms which feed on affected animals for 6 - 7 days, burrowing deeply into subcutaneous tissues and causing severe trauma to animals, production loss and potentially death. Susceptible sites include wounds resulting from management practices such as castration, de-horning and ear tagging and lesions caused by the activities of other parasites such as buffalo flies and ticks. The navels of the new born and the vulval region of their mothers following parturition are highly susceptible and body orifices such as nose and ears are also frequent targets for ovipositing screwworm flies. The Old World <b>screw-worm,</b> Chrysomya bezziana (OWS) {{is considered one of the}} most serious exotic insect pest threatening Australia's livestock industries and is endemic in a number of our closest neighbouring countries. New World screwworm (NWS), Cochliomyia hominivorax, endemic to South America, has also entered Australia on at least 2 occasions. Many tropical and subtropical areas of Australia are suitable for the establishment of OWS and the potential range is expected to increase with climate change. The Australian screwworm preparedness strategy indicates a program of containment with chemical treatments followed by eradication of OWS using sterile male release and parasiticides. However, there is no longer an operational OWS sterile insect <b>screw-worm</b> facility anywhere in the world and establishing a large scale production facility would most optimistically take at least 2 years. In the interim, containment would be almost totally dependent on the availability of effective chemical controls. A review of chemical formulations available for potential use against OWS in Australia found that currently only one chemical, ivermectin administered by subcutaneous injection (s. c.) is registered for use against OWS and that many of the chemicals previously shown to be effective against OWS were no longer registered for animal use in Australia. 18 From this review a number of Australian-registered chemicals were recommended as a priority for testing against OWS. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) can issue an emergency use permit for use of pesticides if they are registered in Australia for other animal uses and shown to be effective against OWS. This project tested the therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of chemicals with potential for use in the treatment and control of OWS...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{compare the}} {{sensitivity}} of inspections of cattle herds and adult fly trapping for detection of the Old World <b>screw-worm</b> fly (OWS). ProceduresThe incidence of myiases on animals {{and the number of}} OWS trapped with LuciTrap (R) /Bezzilure were measured concurrently on cattle farms on Sumba Island (Indonesia) and in peninsular Malaysia (two separate periods for the latter). The numbers of animal inspections and traps required to achieve OWS detection at the prevalent fly densities were calculated. ResultsOn Sumba Island, with low-density OWS populations, {{the sensitivity of}} herd inspections and of trapping for OWS detection was 0. 30 and 0. 85, respectively. For 95 % confidence of detecting OWS, either 45 inspections of 74 animals or trapping with 5 sets of 4 LuciTraps for 14 days are required. In Malaysia, at higher OWS density, herd inspections of 600 animals (twice weekly, period 1) or 1600 animals (weekly, period 2) always detected myiases (sensitivity = 1), while trapping had sensitivities of 0. 89 and 0. 64 during periods 1 and 2, respectively. For OWS detection with 95 % confidence, fewer than 600 and 1600 animals or 2 and 6 LuciTraps are required in periods 1 and 2, respectively. ConclusionsInspections of cattle herds and trapping with LuciTrap and Bezzilure can detect OWS populations. As a preliminary guide for OWS detection in Australia, the numbers of animals and traps derived from the Sumba Island trial should be used because the prevailing conditions better match those of northern Australia...|$|E
