5000|$|Most {{individuals}} and companies {{doing business in}} the District of Columbia must obtain a Basic Business License from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. Separately, organizations (including non-profits and cooperatives, but not including sole-proprietorships and general partnerships) must register their business. Many types of businesses require additional certification or permits beyond the Basic Business License and registration. D.C. requires a [...] "Clean Hands Self-Certification" [...] from most applicants, which is an affidavit stating that the applicant does not owe more than $100 to the District. Tour Guides must submit a Physician's Certificate. Fees for businesses licenses vary. The fee for a Special Event license such as a marathon is $209.

5000|$|The fees {{charged by}} {{endowment}} style outsourced managers vary widely {{based upon a}} number of factors including size and complexity. In general, fees charged by endowment outsourcing managers tend to be higher than generalist outsourcers. The primary difference stems from the experience and expertise that endowment-style firms usually have in areas such as hedge funds, private equity and real assets. Outsourcers that grew out of consulting firms as a general rule tend to be weak in these areas. Endowment outsourcers fees range between 35 bps and 150 bps with most groups charging an incentive fee as well. [...] One endowment outsourcer, Global Endowment Management (GEM), quoted their fees as follows: 0.75% on the first $100 million, 0.675% on the next $150 million, and 0.60% on all amounts above $250 million. GEM also levies a 5% incentive fee above an 8% return net of all manager fees with a high water mark. CommonFund (and its affiliates CommonFund Capital and CommonFund Asset Management), one of the true pioneers in the outsourced endowment model, quote a complex <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> which they summarize this way: [...] "Commonfund Capital’s fees for separate accounts ranges from 50-100 basis points, with varying ranges with respect to the carried interest." [...] An analysis of CommondFund Asset Management's Form ADV Part 2 filing with the SEC for a hypothetical $1 billion account with a 50% equity allocation, 30% in hedge funds and 20% in fixed income would result in total management fees of 85 basis points plus an unspecified level of carried interest.|$|E

40|$|Intensive import/export {{quarantine}} {{operations were}} commenced in 1948 by the Forest Service with costs being {{met by the}} taxpayers. The first Regulations came in 1956 and contained a simple <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees.</b> These were extended in 1966 but still covered only sawn timber, box snooks, and timber in round form. In 1986 the Government decided that, under its "user-pays " policy, net funding for forestry services (including quarantine) would be reduced to zero over 5 years. New fee schedules were introduced in 1987 by the Ministry of Forestry. There was client resistance to paying for regulatory quarantine inspections. Some "national good " content was recognised by the Government. The impact of user-pays may initially have had some detrimental effect on import inspection effectiveness. Some countries do not need phytosanitary certificates for exports. Inspections ceased for these destinations and exporter costs were consequently reduced. At entry ports in Japan and Korea fumigation or some other form of sterilisation is automatically carried out. On the other hand, forest produce exported to Australia must meet very precise quarantine inspection standards, and some other countries demand a phytosanitary certificate based on the International Plant Protection Convention format. The introduction of user-pays also had an initial impact on forest health surveys. The Government may reorganise border control services...|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{contained in}} this article also supports {{the main thrust of}} research on ECEC reform in Canada that stresses how agency can bring about or block systematic change. For instance, Jenson claims that feminist bureaucrats or ‘femocrats’ {{played an important role in}} the creation of Quebec's US$ 5 a day childcare program ([2002], [2009 a]), and Mahon ([1999]) and Martin ([2001]) focus on the importance of childcare advocates in pressuring the federal Canadian government to make reforms. However, it is important to note that the bureaucratic champions and childcare advocates in this interview sample were uneasy with the suggestion that they were ‘feminists’ and their arguments in favor of improving ECEC were generally based on ideas of social investment as opposed to increasing gender equality. For his part, Langford ([2001], [2011]) argues that the influence of private childcare operators worked against the reform of childcare in Alberta. Analogous to Langford's findings, several interviewees in this study clearly pointed to how owners of multiple centers in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia played a role in preventing movement towards inclusive liberal reforms such as the creation of more public and nonprofit childcare as well as a uniform <b>fee</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> parental <b>fees</b> and stricter quality standards. On the other hand, interviewees pointed out how private childcare center operators in PEI and New Brunswick were generally supportive of inclusive liberal reforms in those provinces. It appears that the difference in attitudes among private operators towards the inclusive liberal ECEC model can be attributed to the fact that the private childcare sector in PEI, and to a lesser extent New Brunswick, was dominated by ‘owner-operators’ who owned only one center. Rather than forming their own lobbying group, these owner-operators were subsumed into the large umbrella group representing the childcare sector and saw inclusive liberal ECEC reforms as positive supports for their center as opposed to a threat.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} seven {{experiments that}} investigate {{the application of}} Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory (1979) to litigation, paying {{particular attention to the}} role of framing. Litigation is treated as a form of crisis bargaining which varies significantly from negotiation undertaken in more normative circumstances (for example, managerial conflict and two-party price negotiations). The first two experiments made use of the scenario evaluation paradigm, used in previous studies by Rachlinski (1996), van Koppen (1990) and Korobkin and Guthrie (1994, 1998), in which they argued that framing is dependent on litigant role with plaintiffs adopting a positive or gain frame and defendants adopting a negative or loss frame. The aim of these experiments was to manipulate the reference points of both plaintiffs and defendants in order to determine whether it is possible to alter the frame adopted by each. The results revealed that it is possible for defendants and plaintiffs to be induced to adopt a positive frame and negative frame respectively. Furthermore, regardless of role, positively framed litigants {{were significantly more likely to}} settle than their negatively framed counterparts (an average increase of approximately 20 percent). This is a new finding in litigation research. Studies 3 and 4 sought to determine whether the dissociation of role and frame is still evident in a more realistic experiment using simulated negotiations. This methodology has previously been used by Margaret Neale, Max Bazerman and others in the field of organisational conflict, and by Linda Babcock and colleagues (1997) in considering bias in litigation. However, the studies presented here are the first to use simulated negotiations to investigate the effects of framing during litigation. In contrast to the scenario-based studies, Study 3 found no effect of either role or frame. Study 4 was conducted in order to determine if this was due to the requirement, to maintain comparability with the scenario-based experiments, that the parties ignore court costs and legal fees. However, despite including a <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees,</b> Study 4 also found no evidence of framing effects. The aims of studies 5, 6 and 7 were to determine whether the failure to observe framing effects in studies 3 and 4 could be attributed to the implementation of costs and other changes or whether the direct manipulation of reference points simply does not transfer to more dynamic negotiation environments. While the results of these experiments did not reach a clear outcome on this question, it was possible to conclude that prospect theory's prediction of framing effects is not a major determinant of litigant behaviour.
