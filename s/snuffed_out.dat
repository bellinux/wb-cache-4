5|$|Although {{the current}} owner Charles Spencer professes to have never {{witnessed}} a ghost at Althorp or anywhere else, {{over the years}} numerous ghostly sightings {{have been reported in}} the mansion. In the mid 19th century the Dean of Lincoln was invited to stay at the property by Fredrick, 4th Earl Spencer. He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be the ghost of the deceased servant of the 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles and checking that they were <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> around the bed. Margaret Douglas-Home professed to being aware of a ghost of a girl with grey slippers in the gallery.|$|E

In one shot, she <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> the flame with a {{whizzing}} bullet. Sitting Bull watched her knock corks off of bottles and slice through a cigar Butler held in his teeth.|$|E

25|$|The Dolphins defense {{shut out}} the Chargers, holding San Diego quarterback Stan Humphries to just 18 of 44 {{completions}} for 140 yards and intercepting him four times as they <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> San Diego's eight-game winning streak. Overall, San Diego gained just 202 yards and 10 first downs, while losing five turnovers. The Chargers had seven sacks in their wild card win against Kansas City, but none in this game.|$|E
25|$|The 2008–09 {{season was}} decided quite {{early in the}} season as Munster claimed the title without playing, as they were {{preparing}} for their Heineken Cup semi-final against Leinster. The final challenge from Ospreys was <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> when the Dragons denied them a bonus point win on 30 April. Munster had led pretty much {{from the start of the}} season with a team largely captained by Mick O'Driscoll showing Munster's squad depth. Munster lost only four games, three to the other Irish teams, including a double loss to Ulster. Felipe Contepomi finish as league top scorer for Leinster, the year they went on to win the Heineken Cup.|$|E
25|$|However, any {{momentum}} Denver {{might have}} gained was quickly <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> as Seattle tight end Zach Miller recovered Prater's onside kick attempt {{on his own}} 48-yard line. He also caught a 10-yard reception as the Seahawks subsequently drove 52 yards, featuring a 24-yard reception by Kearse, and scoring on Wilson's 10-yard touchdown pass to Baldwin, increasing their lead to 43–8. There were more than 11 {{minutes left in the}} game, but this would be the final score, as Denver's last three drives would result in a turnover on downs, a Manning fumble that was forced and recovered by Seattle defensive end Chris Clemons (the only sack of the game for either team), and time expiring in the game.|$|E

Having fled to the Portuguese capital via Spain, Rezala made {{a phone call to}} his girlfriend from a public call box – unaware that investigators in France had tapped her phone. On January 11, 2000, Rezala's hiding place was <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> by Portuguese police, who arrested the man in Barreiro, south of Lisbon. He had been staying in Almada with friends of a Spanish acquaintance and was planning to leave within 24 hours for Spain's Canary Islands.|$|E
25|$|One {{play into}} the second quarter, Steelers {{receiver}} Antwaan Randle El fumbled a Browns punt, and Chris Akins recovered the ball for Cleveland on the Steelers 32-yard line. On the next play, Cleveland took a 14-0 lead with Holcomb's 32-yard touchdown pass to Dennis Northcutt. The Browns seemed to be {{taking control of the}} game now, particularly when another Steelers drive into field goal range was again <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> by a McCutheon interception (the Steelers' third turnover in less than six minutes). But suddenly Randle El brought the team right back into the game by returning a punt 66 yards for a touchdown, making the score 14-7. Cleveland stormed right back, as Holcomb's 29-yard pass to Johnson and two completions to running back Jamel White for 22 total yards earned the team a Phil Dawson field goal that made the score 17-7 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins {{running back}} Marc Logan {{returned}} the ensuing kickoff 30 {{yards to the}} Dolphins 43, and Marino completed a 23-yard pass to Mark Clayton on the next play. Then Smith ran twice for 18, bringing up first down on the Bills 13-yard line. Miami was on a roll and didn't stop until Marino completed the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to guard Roy Foster, who had checked in as an eligible receiver. His touchdown brought Miami back within three points {{less than two minutes}} into the fourth quarter. However, their comeback hopes were swiftly <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> by the Bills offense, who stormed back 63 yards in 10 plays, including Kelly's 5-yard completion to tight end Keith McKeller on fourth and 2, and retook a 10-point lead with Thomas' 5-yard touchdown run. Then linebacker Hal Garner forced a fumble from Logan on the ensuing kickoff, which Norwood recovered for Buffalo on the Dolphins 29. Two plays later, Kelly essentially put the game away with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Reed, giving the Bills a 44-27 lead with 9:42 left in regulation. Miami still tried to fight back, driving to the Bills 35, but lost the ball as Marino threw four straight incompletions. Following a Bills punt, Miami drove 91 yards in 15 plays to score on Marino's 8-yard pass to receiver Tony Martin, but by then on 1:15 was left on the clock. The Bills recovered Miami's onside kick attempt and went on to win, 44–34.|$|E

500|$|Hiryū, {{the sole}} {{surviving}} Japanese aircraft carrier, wasted {{little time in}} counterattacking. Hiryūs first attack wave, consisting of 18 D3As and 6 fighter escorts, followed the retreating American aircraft and attacked the first carrier they encountered, Yorktown, hitting her with three bombs, which blew {{a hole in the}} deck, <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> her boilers, and destroyed one anti-aircraft mount. The damage also forced Admiral Fletcher to move his command staff to the heavy cruiser [...] Repair teams were able to temporarily patch the flight deck and restore power to several boilers within an hour, giving her a speed of [...] and enabling her to resume air operations. Thirteen Japanese dive bombers and three escorting fighters were lost in this attack (two escorting fighters turned back early after they were damaged attacking some of Enterprises SBDs returning from their attack on the Japanese carriers).|$|E
500|$|In 1891, {{after many}} failed {{attempts}} at reconciliation by the pair, Tom Chappell, the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, {{stepped in to}} mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded. [...] Two more operas resulted: Utopia, Limited (1893) and The Grand Duke (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (His Excellency, 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protegée from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal. Utopia, concerning an attempt to [...] "anglicise" [...] a south Pacific island kingdom, was only a modest success, and The Grand Duke, in which a theatrical troupe, {{by means of a}} [...] "statutory duel" [...] and a conspiracy, takes political control of a grand duchy, was an outright failure. After that, the partnership ended for good. Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later. In 1904, Gilbert would write, [...] "...Savoy opera was <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> by the deplorable death of my distinguished collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan. When that event occurred, I saw no one with whom I felt that I could work with satisfaction and success, and so I discontinued to write libretti." ...|$|E

He was largely critical of the episode's story, which he felt was a rip-off of The Insider, as well as the make-up effects for the episode, which he called [...] "fairly fake" [...] looking. VanDerWerff, however, was complimentary towards Tobin Bell's performance, calling him [...] "charismatic and interesting", as well as the fact that he plays [...] "a great schemer". Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "Tobacco beetles, dismembered noses and some really bad second-hand smoke permeate this installment, but it gets <b>snuffed</b> <b>out</b> with a lazy payoff." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. Despite praising the plot, writing [...] "it's a great premise, with lots of gore and larvae", the two lament its loss in direction: [...] "halfway through, once the episode reveals what its concept is, the story is left with nowhere to go." ...|$|E
500|$|Historians today {{generally}} {{dismiss the}} authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184. William of Malmesbury's history of the English kings stated [...] "Arthur’s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return" [...] and his work [...] "On the Antiquity of the Glastonese Church"—larded as it is with known and suspected pious forgeries—nowhere mentions a connection between the abbey and either Arthur's grave or Avalon. The fact that the search for Arthur's body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well. Gerald, a constant supporter of royal authority, in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King's Arthur's messianic return: [...] "Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [...] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is known, I have taken the trouble to add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been <b>snuffed</b> <b>out,</b> and the true and indubitable facts are made known, so that what really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject." ...|$|E
