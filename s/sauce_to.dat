5|$|The Chicken Big King {{was added}} April 2014. This new {{variation}} on the original Big King sandwich {{was part of a}} corporate menu restructuring that began the previous year. This was part of Burger King CEO Alex Macedo's plan to introduce simpler products that require few or no new ingredients in order to simplify operations. This new sandwich uses the company's existing Crispy Chicken Jr patty in place of the beef and adds an extra layer of King <b>sauce</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the product stays moist.|$|E

50|$|This {{style of}} using sauces is popular amongst Chinese who tie certain <b>sauces</b> <b>to</b> {{particular}} meats such as chili and soy for shrimp and vinegar and garlic for goose.

25|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the idea of using tomato <b>sauce</b> <b>to</b> give pasta its flavour was revolutionary since it was {{originally}} eaten plain. The consumption of pasta has changed over time; it was once a small, simple item, but it is now often eaten in much larger portions and as part of complex, sophisticated dishes. Factors such as low prices and ease of cooking contribute to the growing popularity of this staple item.|$|E
25|$|By the 19th century, sauces {{had been}} {{classified}} into four distinct categories by Chef Marie-Antoine Carême. One of Carême's family of sauces was allemande, {{which was a}} stock-based sauce using egg and lemon juice. Auguste Escoffier updated that list in the early 20th century by replacing allemande with Hollandaise sauce {{as part of his}} family of five mother sauces of Haute cuisine. While many believe that a true Hollandaise sauce should only contain the basic ingredients of eggs, butter and lemon, Prosper Montagne suggested using either a white wine or vinegar reduction, similar to a Béarnaise <b>sauce,</b> <b>to</b> help improve the taste.|$|E

25|$|Dried mopane worms can {{be eaten}} raw as a crisp snack; however, in Botswana people {{tend not to}} eat the head. Alternatively, mopane worms can be soaked to rehydrate, before being fried until they are crunchy, or cooked with onion, {{tomatoes}} and spices and then served with pap or sadza. The flesh is yellow, and the gut may still contain fragments of dried leaf, which is not harmful to humans. The taste of dried leaves, if not removed, is somewhat reminiscent of tea leaves. Dried mopane worms are frequently canned/packaged in tomato sauce or chili <b>sauce</b> <b>to</b> enhance the flavor.|$|E
25|$|Despite its humble ubiquity {{among the}} poor, {{it is also}} popular as a main entrée when cooked {{with a variety of}} meats. For example, cháo gà is cooked with chicken, garlic, and ginger. The rice {{porridge}} is cooked in the broth in which a whole chicken had been boiled, and once the chicken is cooked, the meat is sliced and layered on a bed of shredded raw cabbage and sliced scallions and drizzled with a vinegar-based <b>sauce,</b> <b>to</b> be eaten as a side dish to the porridge. Other combinations include cháo vịt (duck porridge), which is cooked in the same fashion as the chicken porridge, but with duck. Cháo lòng heo is made with lòng heo, a variety of offal from pork or duck with sliced portions of congealed pork blood. Cháo is typically served with quẩy on the side.|$|E
25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} a simple dish, but comes in many varieties {{due to its}} versatility. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or food processor and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and <b>sauce</b> <b>to</b> serve together, {{there is a general}} rule regarding compatibility. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten is often mopped up with a piece of bread. Pasta is largely carbohydrates (mainly as starch), with moderate amounts of protein and manganese.|$|E

500|$|Fried chicken {{has been}} {{described}} as being [...] "crunchy" [...] and [...] "juicy", as well as [...] "crispy". In addition, the dish has also been called [...] "spicy" [...] and [...] "salty". Occasionally, fried chicken is also topped with a chili like paprika, or hot <b>sauce</b> <b>to</b> give it a spicy taste. This is especially common in fast food restaurants and chains such as KFC. The dish is traditionally served with mashed potato, gravy, coleslaw and biscuits.|$|E
500|$|The {{new version}} of the {{sandwich}} was originally made with two of the chain's [...] hamburger patties, but after negative consumer response regarding the size of the patties the sandwich was reformulated to use two [...] Whopper Jr. patties instead. A chicken variant was introduced in May 2014. The new chicken variant swapped out the burger patties with two chicken patties used for the chain's value menu chicken sandwiches and added a third layer of <b>sauce</b> <b>to</b> increase the moisture content of the sandwich. The sandwich was introduced nationwide in the U.S. after a period of testing in Indiana. While the chicken version of the sandwich was new to Burger King, it again copied a product from McDonald's—in the Middle East the competing chain offers a Chicken Big Mac sandwich.|$|E
500|$|Cincinnati chili {{originated}} with immigrant restaurateurs from the Macedonian region {{who were trying}} to expand their customer base by moving beyond narrowly ethnic styles of cuisine. Tom and John Kiradjieff began serving a [...] "stew with traditional Mediterranean spices" [...] as a topping for hot dogs which they called [...] "coneys" [...] in 1922 at their hot dog stand located next to a burlesque theater called the Empress. Tom Kiradjieff used the <b>sauce</b> <b>to</b> modify a traditional Greek dish, speculated to have been pastitsio, moussaka or saltsa kima {{to come up with a}} dish he called chili spaghetti. He first developed a recipe calling for the spaghetti to be cooked in the chili but changed his method in response to customer requests and began serving the sauce as a topping, eventually adding grated cheese as a topping for both the chili spaghetti and the coneys, also in response to customer requests. To make ordering more efficient, the brothers created the [...] "way" [...] system of ordering. The style has since been copied and modified by many other restaurant proprietors, often fellow Greek and Macedonian immigrants who had worked at Empress restaurants before leaving to open their own chili parlors, often following the business model to the point of locating their restaurants adjacent to theaters.|$|E
50|$|A {{general way}} to {{estimate}} {{the heat of a}} <b>sauce</b> is <b>to</b> look at the ingredients list. <b>Sauces</b> tend <b>to</b> vary in heat based on the kind of peppers used, and the further down the list, the less the amount of pepper.|$|R
