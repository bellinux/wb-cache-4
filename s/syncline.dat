5|$|The four lower cheekteeth—the fourth lower premolar (p4) {{and first}} through third lower molars (m1–m3)—are high-crowned teeth. Like the upper teeth, they bear four cusps (metaconid, protoconid, entoconid, and hypoconid), four lophs (metalophid, mesolophid, hypolophid, and posterolophid) and three valleys. Each {{of the lower}} cheekteeth lacks an {{additional}} loph, the ectolophid, which is present in Arikareeomys. The p4 is larger {{than any of the}} molars and longer than it is wide. Among the molars, m1 and m2 do not differ appreciably from each other and are a little wider than they are long, while m3 is a little smaller and its back side is more rounded and narrower. <b>Syncline</b> IV, which is located {{at the back of the}} tooth, between the hypolophid and posterolophid, is closed at the margins; this valley is open in Megapeomys bobwilsoni. <b>Syncline</b> IV also opens into the centrally located <b>syncline</b> III; this opening is absent in Arikareeomys. There are two roots under p4 and three under each of the molars, fewer than in Megapeomys bobwilsoni, which shows three under p4 and four under the molars.|$|E

5|$|The Clearfield-McIntyre <b>Syncline</b> {{runs through}} the western {{lower part of the}} Kettle Creek {{watershed}} in a southwest-to-northeast direction. North of this <b>syncline</b> lies the Wellsboro Anticline. South of it lies the Hyner Dome. A set of fractures in the watershed causes the tributary Huling Branch to have a straight and narrow valley and for Kettle Creek itself to make a sharp 90-degree turn near the mouth of the tributary Twomile Run. Lateral bars that are nearly or completely devoid of vegetation can be found throughout the main stem of Kettle Creek. In the southern reaches of the watershed, where Pennsylvanian-epoch sandstones are located, the creek flows through steep valleys with narrow floodplains. In the central and northern reaches of the watershed, the main rocks are Mississippian and Devonian rocks. This part of the watershed is characterized by wider floodplains, less steep valleys, and some plateaus, enabling agricultural and residential development to a limited extent. Several miles upstream of the Alvin R. Bush Dam, the creek makes two 180-degree turns. This may eventually cause an oxbow lake to form.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{geological}} {{formation in the}} valley is the Supra-Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous period. It is a significant feature towards the north-eastern part of the area and {{is represented by the}} Pensford <b>Syncline</b> coal basin, which formed part of the Somerset coalfield. It is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales. The landscape is typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone. Most of the area around Stanton Drew have neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils. Soils to {{the eastern part of the}} area are slowly permeable clayey and fine silty soils. They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra-Pennant Measures. They are frequently waterlogged where the topography dictates. They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour. In the south and south east of the area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near the surface for coal mining to have taken place around Clutton and High Littleton. In the eastern area of the valley as the River Chew flows through Publow, Woollard and Compton Dando before joining the River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils.|$|E
25|$|The Mundubbera {{district}} is bounded {{on the east}} by the Binjour Plateau and on {{the south and west}} by the Burnett River. Devonian, Carboniferous, Triassic, and Post-Triassic sediments have all been found in the district. Devonian and Carboniferous sediments are incorporated into the late or post-Permian folds which affect the Yarrol Basin. A large <b>syncline</b> is exposed, commonly called the Mundubbera <b>Syncline.</b> Folded Triassic strata are found {{in the western part of}} the district in a fault block. There is evidence of Tertiary or post-Triassic sediments in horizontal sandstone. Near Riverleigh, fossil corals were found in limestone during the 1920s. These were studied by Dorothy Hill of the University of Queensland.|$|E

25|$|The Devonian {{and older}} rocks of Orkney are cut {{by a series}} of WSW-ENE to N-S {{trending}} faults, many of which were active during deposition of the Devonian sequences. The largest of these faults are the North Scapa Fault, East Scapa Fault and Bring-Risa Fault. Both the North Scapa and Brims-Risa faults show evidence of local reversal along part of their lengths, thought to be due to a period of transpressional deformation along the Great Glen Fault system that lies just to the east of the islands, during the Carboniferous. Small-scale folding is common and one large-scale fold is developed, the north-south trending Eday <b>syncline.</b> This <b>syncline</b> is parallel to neighbouring normal faults and thickess variations in the lower Eday Sandstone indicate that this structure was active during the middle Devonian.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} dark green, massive and pillowed iron-rich tholeiitic basalt lava flows compose an unnamed upper {{volcanic}} {{formation of the}} Younger Volcanic Complex. It is situated {{in the core of}} the Tetapaga <b>Syncline.</b> Not much is known about this volcanic formation because {{only a small portion of}} it remains exposed in western Strathy Township.|$|E
25|$|The Alpine Orogeny {{that took}} place about 50 million years ago was {{responsible}} for the shaping of the London Basin <b>syncline</b> and the Weald anticline to the south.

50|$|Geologically {{the range}} {{is made up}} of Paleozoic schist, slate and quartzite, as well as {{greywacke}} and sandstone. Structurally the range comprises a succession of wide anticlines and <b>synclines</b> in a Hercynian WNW-ESE direction.|$|R
40|$|The Quadrilátero Ferrífero is {{a portion}} of the Brazilian Precambrian shield {{containing}} a granite–greenstone terrain characterized by granite–gneiss domes encircled by kilometre-scale <b>synclines.</b> Integration of porphyroblast-matrix microtextures, c-axis fabrics analysis and strain analysis with outcrop-scale structural relationships indicates that the main phase of domes and <b>synclines</b> evolution occurred during the westerly directed 0. 8 – 0. 6 Ga Pan-African-Brasiliano regional shortening. This tectonic event has produced the single pervasive foliation observed in the folded supracrustal sequences of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero. Dip-slip ductile shear zones developed at the dome–supracrustal interface are synchronous with dome evolution during the Pan-African-Brasiliano deformation, as indicated by contemporaneous growth of aureole porphyroblasts in the shear planes. These shear zones facilitated steeply directed downward flow of country rock material around the granite–gneiss domes. The marked density contrast between granite–gneiss material and the iron-rich supracrustals provided a gravitationally favourable environment for downward wallrock flow. Variations in shear zone kinematics away from the domes, combined with kilometer-scale viscous drag, contributed to produce kilometre-scale <b>synclines</b> in the supracrustal rocks constrained between upward moving domes...|$|R
50|$|The {{structural}} pattern {{within the}} region shows a series of anticlines and <b>synclines</b> that plunge towards {{the core of the}} belt. <b>Synclines</b> are the dominant folding structure {{within the region}}. However, there is a major anticline, called the Onverwacht Anticline, located in the central portion of the BGB. Granite-greenstone terrains are characterized by broad domiform TTG bodies underlying tight synclinal basalts and komatiites. This common structure associated with greenstone belts is called a 'dome-and-keel' structure (shown to the right). The formation of this particular structure is not yet fully understood but there are numerous models that attempt to explain it as well as the overall evolution of the greenstone belt.|$|R
25|$|Compressive {{deformation}} {{during the}} Penokean orogeny reactivated the GLTZ, which followed deposition of the Marquette Range Supergroup sediments {{and resulted in}} a north-side up motion along steep brittle-ductile faults in the eastern, low-grade portion of the Marquette Trough In the western portion of the Marquette <b>syncline,</b> a second episode of GLTZ reactivation {{took place during the}} uplift of the post-Huronian 2,400- to 2,100-million-year-old granitic Southern Complex.|$|E

25|$|These {{bands of}} chalk {{form the basis}} of the London Basin, a <b>syncline</b> the outcrop of which is {{v-shaped}} opening to the east and bounded by chalk outcrops forming hills: the North Downs to the south of London, and the Chilterns to the north. The chalk is a soft white limestone that is different in appearance to other limestones because it is porous and earthy whilst others are compact and crystalline.|$|E

50|$|These boudins of {{material}} range from centimetre-scale to ~100m thick and one kilometre long and, {{based on their}} position within anticlines and <b>synclines</b> in the Mount Narryer area, are interpreted to have intruded subparallel to bedding and are now strung out by shearing.|$|R
25|$|Lying on {{the edge}} of the Scafell <b>Syncline,</b> the various strata dip to the east.

Around Beck Head is evidence of the Crinkle Member, welded rhyolitic tuff and lapilli-tuff with some breccia. A dyke of andesite and hybridised andesite porphyry is responsible for Kern Knotts.|$|E
25|$|Rio Tinto {{declared}} its intent {{to expand the}} Hope Downs mine, spending a further A$1.78 billion on its new Hope Downs 4 project, scheduled to produce 15 million tonnes of iron ore annually by 2013. Rio has commenced construction on its new Western Turner <b>Syncline</b> project. Rio Tinto allocated a further A$1.24 billion in early December 2010, to expand the Brockman 4 mine to 40 million tonnes per annum, from 22, as well as develop its Western Turner <b>Syncline</b> project, raising planned production there from 6 to 15 million tonnes, {{with the aim of}} increasing the Pilbara production to 283 million tonnes per annum by late 2013. The expansion would make Brockman 4 Rio Tinto's second-largest mine in the Pilbara. The company has also begun further construction at the port at Cape Lambert, which is scheduled to undergo a further expansion, to be completed by 2012. The new expansion is scheduled to cost A$276million. The expansion is part of a plan to raise Rio's annual production from the Pilbara from 220 to 330 million tonnes annually by 2016. To achieve this, the Cape Lambert port capacity will be expanded to handle an additional 100 million tonnes annually.|$|E
25|$|A major {{geological}} {{feature of}} the Upper Carboniferous sub-period in South Wales is the South Wales Coalfield <b>syncline.</b> The rocks comprising this important area were laid down during the Westphalian Geological Series (or epoch) approximately 314-308 million years ago (Ma), when climatic conditions were equatorial. This Westphalian succession includes a sequence with a thickness of more than 1800 m in the west. The Coal Measures were laid down on a low-lying waterlogged plain with peat mires immediately south of an ancient geological feature known as the Wales-London-Brabant High.|$|E

25|$|The geology of the undersea {{portion of}} the tunnel {{consists}} of volcanic rock, pyroclastic rock, and sedimentary rock of the Neogene Period. The area is folded into a nearly vertical <b>syncline,</b> {{which means that the}} youngest rock is in the centre of the strait and encountered last. Divided roughly into thirds, the Honshū side consists of volcanic rocks (andesite, basalt etc.); the Hokkaido side consists of sedimentary rocks (Tertiary period tuff, mudstone, etc.); and the centre portion consists of Kuromatsunai strata (Tertiary period sand-like mudstone). Igneous intrusions and faults caused crushing of the rock and complicated the tunnelling procedures.|$|E
25|$|The Ordovician period {{gave rise}} to a {{sequence}} of sedimentary rocks which stretch from Pembrokeshire eastwards through Carmarthenshire up the Vale of Towy and which are intricately intermixed with those of the succeeding period northwards to the Vale of Conwy. In Snowdonia many Ordovician volcanic rocks give rise to a more rugged landscape than elsewhere in the country. Snowdon itself is largely formed of volcanic ash (tuff) with some sedimentary rock and igneous intrusions folded into a <b>syncline.</b> Cadair Idris is also largely formed of Ordovician igneous rocks. Anglesey and Llŷn are also Ordovician territory. The Ordovician rocks of Wales are typically intensely faulted and folded, having been affected by the earth movements of the Caledonian Orogeny.|$|E
25|$|A {{new view}} is {{developing}} that the regional tectonic boundary is not under Hood Canal, {{but just to}} the west, involving the Saddle Mountain fault zone (discussed below) and associated faults. This is supported by geologically recent scarps and other signs of active faulting on the Saddle Mountain faults, and also discovery of a geophysical lineament running through Pleasant Harbor (south of Brinnon) that appears to truncate strands of the Seattle Fault. In this view Hood Canal is only a <b>syncline</b> (dip) between the Olympic Mountains and the Puget Lowland, and such faults as have been found there are local and discontinuous, ancillary to the main zone of faulting to the west. North of the Seattle Fault accommodation of regional movement may be along the northwest-striking Dabob Bay Fault Zone.|$|E

40|$|Conglomerate – the lithified {{equivalent}} of gravel- forms nearly the whole Bakhtyari Formation, and alternates with sandstone and mudstone {{in the upper}} parts of the Aghjari Formation in the Folded Zagros Zone, and hence in the studied region. In addition to some low and high anticlines, the region consists of two elevated <b>synclines</b> reaching to over 3000 meters. The <b>synclines</b> are {{parallel to each other}} and, unlike in most of the Folded Zagros, overhang adjacent anticlines. Polymictic conglomerates form excellent outcrops in the central parts of these <b>synclines.</b> From the viewpoint of its (coarse) clast composition, the Bakhtyari Formation consists of two types of conglomerates: 1. Limestone-Chert Clast-Supported Conglomerate (LCCSC) and 2. Limestone Clast-Supported Conglomerate (LCSC). The chronological and spatial relationships between these conglomerates are not easily determined due to existence of some thrust faults at their approximate boundaries, and it seems that each has its own independent chronological and spatial setting. In the vertical succession, various lithofacies are recognized; their textural characteristics and sedimentary structures specify a non-marine depositional system and are considered "standard " lithofacies of alluvial fans and braided rivers. Epirogenic movements in the region began in the Oligocene, indicated by a chert micro-conglomerate bed at the Jahrum – Asmari Formation boundary. These movements then changed to orogenic ones with the deposition of gravelly alluvium now known as Aghajari (upper parts) and Bakhtyari Formations...|$|R
50|$|An {{overturned}} anticline is an asymmetrical anticline with a limb {{that has}} been tilted beyond perpendicular so that the beds in that limb have basically flipped over and may dip {{in the same direction}} {{on both sides of the}} axial plane. If the angle between the limbs is large (70-120 degrees), then the fold is an open fold, but if the angle between the limbs is small (30 degrees or less), then the fold is a tight fold. If an anticline plunges (i.e., the anticline crest is inclined to the Earth's surface), it will form Vs on a geologic map view that point in the direction of plunge. A plunging anticline has a hinge that is not parallel to the earth's surface. All anticlines and <b>synclines</b> have some degree of plunge. Periclinal folds are a type of anticlines that have a well-defined, but curved hinge line and are doubly plunging and thus elongate domes.Folds in which the limbs dip toward the hinge and display a more U-like shape are called <b>synclines.</b> They usually flank the sides of anticlines and display opposite characteristics. A <b>syncline's</b> oldest rock strata are in its outer limbs; the rocks become progressively younger toward its hinge. A monocline is a bend in the strata resulting in a local steepening in only one direction of dip. Monoclines have the shape of a carpet draped over a stairstep.|$|R
