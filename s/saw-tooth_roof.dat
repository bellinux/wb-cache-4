5|$|Following the urgings of Superintendent George {{and various}} {{official}} enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. The western workshops, located between the entry complex and the Female Division, were built from 1900–1901 of squared limestone rubble with openings dressed in brick. An open <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>roof</b> with southern skylights covered the five spaces {{designed for the}} five traditional workshops: tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters. The two northern shops were later amalgamated by removing the dividing wall.|$|E
5|$|The prison's {{workshops}} provided {{activities and}} training for the prisoners. They also reduced the cost of maintenance, repairs, and construction by providing an in-house service. The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, {{one of the first}} buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop. The West Workshops were built {{at the start of the}} twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop. The five western workshops are a single storey squared limestone rubble building with openings dressed in brick, with an open <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>roof</b> with southern skylights, concealed behind a parapet wall. In 1993 the western workshops were adapted for use as TAFE art workshops.|$|E
25|$|Internally, the {{building}} is one large open space with the <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>roof</b> supported by steel trusses on I-section columns. Twelve sets of large skylights run at 45 degrees across the space providing natural light. The ceiling is lined with sheet material and the floor is bitumen. The building is mechanically ventilated.|$|E

5000|$|In 1906, {{the firm}} {{designed}} factory buildings for the Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company in Buffalo, New York. In 1908 the Highland Park Ford Plant {{was designed by}} the firm. It {{was similar to the}} Packard factory just a few miles away, however different from the Pierce-Arrow factory buildings that were of one-story only and had <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>roofs</b> with skylights. The Ford factory building had four stories.It was however, of reinforced concrete design using the patented Kahn System of his brother Julius, just like the Packard and Pierce-Arrow factory buildings. The Ford plant was 860 feet long and 75 feet wide. The steel reinforced concrete building designs were fireproof. The [...] "Model factory" [...] featured what was referred to as Truscon's [...] "Daylight System" [...] because of the many large windows.|$|R
5000|$|Waste spinning, reeling, {{doubling}} {{and throwing}} put little {{strain on the}} building, but power-looms were a different matter. From preference they were operated in single-storey sheds with <b>saw-tooth</b> north-facing <b>roof</b> windows: {{if they were to}} be operated on an upper-floor, box-beams and cast-iron columns increased the floor strength and load-bearing capacities.|$|R

25|$|Of all {{the architects}} {{associated}} with Blacket, {{the one who}} would become most famous was John Horbury Hunt, who worked with him from 1863 to 1868. It was at this time, that Blacket's architecture developed bolder forms, based upon Norman, Transitional and Early French Gothic architecture, rather than the more refined Gothic. This is particularly noticeable in the presence of simple round windows divided by four circles of tracery in the gables of several churches of this time. Blacket permitted his staff to enter competitions, and it was while at Blacket's office that Horbury Hunt won the commission for Newcastle Cathedral, to be executed in his preferred material of brick. The brick church at Tumut, consecrated in 1873, is ascribed to Blacket, but appears to owe much to Hunt. Hunt, who lived most of his early life in North America, had previously worked under Edward Clarke Cabot. One of the innovations that he introduced to Australian architecture while working for Blacket was the <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>roof</b> for industrial building, which was employed at Mort's Woolstore. Hunt appears to have been influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly Philip Webb, and ultimately he created buildings of great originality such as the Anglican Cathedrals of Grafton and Armidale.|$|E

50|$|A <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>roof</b> is a roof {{comprising}} {{a series}} of ridges with dual pitches either side.

5000|$|Originally, {{the site}} was used for shanty housing, before being turned into a wool storage and {{treatment}} facility around 1900. Wool was brought from all over Tasmania to be pressed, then shipped to Hobart.The {{top floor of the}} building was used for wool treatment and therefore required the natural light offered by the striking <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>roof</b> line. This style of roofing allowed the maximum amount of light into the room for the weaver's benefit.It was because of this history that The Old Woolstore was able to be awarded the [...] "Best Redeveloped Industrial Building" [...] in 1997 by the National Trust. The original floors have been maintained, and rather than destroy original equipment used at the wool store, many have been retained and incorporated as features in the corridors and common areas of the apartment hotel.|$|E

50|$|From {{the arrival}} of the railway in Hamilton, Frankton was a railway town. In 1923, the suburb became even more railway-orientated when the Frankton Junction Railway House Factory opened, {{producing}} the famous George Troup designed railway houses sent to many North Island railway settlements, which are now sought-after pieces of real estate. Its 60 workers produced almost 1400 pre-fabricated railway houses at a peak rate of 400 a year, using rimu and matai from the railway's central North Island forests. The sawmill also produced everything else such as signal masts and boxes, bridges, sleepers, and even furniture for railway stations. It was too efficient for private builders, who got the housing factory closed in 1929. When it finally closed in the 1990s it was very dilapidated, but NZHPT supported restoration of the Category 1 historic place, retaining original windows, big sliding doors and the <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>roof.</b> It is now home to a range of businesses.|$|E
