5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express {{was a special}} target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; some 16 employees were killed and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and <b>station</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{not to mention the}} loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the food}} aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags. Cans are rare because they are heavy and {{expensive}} to transport. Preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew, and taste is reduced in microgravity. Therefore, effort is made to make the food more palatable, such as using more spices than in regular cooking. The crew looks forward {{to the arrival of}} any ships from Earth, as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables. Care is taken that foods do not create crumbs. Sauces are often used to avoid contaminating <b>station</b> <b>equipment.</b> Each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley. The galley features two food warmers, a refrigerator added in November 2008, and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water. Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption. Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws. Solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away. Any food that floats away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station's air filters and other equipment.|$|E
500|$|As {{well as the}} {{restored}} pumping <b>station</b> <b>equipment,</b> the complex has {{a wide range of}} exhibits: more than 1,500 were in place {{less than a year after}} it opened. [...] These include a 19th-century horse-drawn fire engine, traction engines, veteran motorcycles, Victorian household equipment and old tools. [...] A French-built horizontal steam engine dating from 1859 is the principal exhibit. [...] The Engineerium has always used its exhibits to educate and promote the study of industrial history: it has been called [...] "the world's only centre for the teaching of engineering conservation", and was central to the activities of the English Industrial Heritage Year in 1993. For many years, the larger and indigenous exhibits were fully operational and in steam at weekends.|$|E

2500|$|Most serious {{competitive}} stations log their contest contacts using contest logging software, {{although some}} {{continue to use}} paper and pencil. [...] There are many different software logging programs written specifically for radio contesting. [...] Computer logging programs can handle many additional duties besides simply recording the log data; they can keep a running score based upon the formula of the contest, track which available multipliers have been [...] "worked" [...] and which have not, and provide the operator with visual clues about how many contacts are being made on which bands. Some contest software even provide a means to control the <b>station</b> <b>equipment</b> via computer, retrieve data from the radio and send pre-recorded morse code, voice or digital messages. [...] After {{the conclusion of a}} contest, each station must submit its operational log to the contest sponsor. [...] Many sponsors accept logs by e-mail, by upload on web sites, or even by postal mail.|$|E

30|$|As a {{component}} of technical equipment which ensures safe, punctual, fast, convenient, high-density, ceaseless operation of the train, signaling system {{plays an important role}} in rail transit system [1, 2, 3]. The signaling system consists of four subsystems: automatic train supervision system (ATS), automatic train protection subsystem (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO), and computer-based interlocking subsystem (CI). The four subsystems form a closed-loop system via message switching network—automatic train control (ATC) that manages to combine ground-control and train-control, local control, and central control together. In order to facilitate safety in operation, an ATC system which integrates the functions of traffic control, operating adjustment, and automatic driving is constructed. The signaling system operates in modes of distributed management and centralized control. Distinguished from the distribution of section, the centralized signaling system is made up of controlling equipments in the center, <b>station</b> <b>equipments,</b> vehicle-based equipments, trackside equipments, and on-board equipments.|$|R
