This agitation, which became known as the [...] "Land War", became very violent when Land Leaguers resisted evictions of tenant farmers by force and the British Army and Royal Irish Constabulary was used against them. This upheaval eventually resulted in the British government subsidising the sale of landlords' estates to their tenants in the Irish Land Acts authored by William O'Brien. It also provided a mass base for constitutional Irish nationalists who had founded the Home Rule League in 1873.

40|$|Abstract: Regularization with radial basis {{functions}} is an eective {{method in}} many machine learning applications. In recent years classes of radial basis functions with compact support {{have been proposed}} in the approximation theory literature and have {{become more and more}} popular due to their computational advantages. In this paper we study the statistical properties of the method of regularization with compactly <b>supported</b> <b>basis</b> functions. We consider three popular classes of compactly <b>supported</b> radial <b>basis</b> functions. In the setting of estimating a periodic function in a white noise problem, we show that regularization with (periodized) compactly <b>supported</b> radial <b>basis</b> functions is rate optimal and adapts to unknown smoothness up to an order related to the radial basis function used. Due to results on equivalence of the white noise model with many important models including regression and density estimation, our results are expected to give insight on the performance of such methods in more general settings than the white noise model. Key words and phrases: method of regularization, nonparametric estimation, radial basis functions, rate of convergence, reproducing kernel. 1...|$|R
