40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method of}} generating an image scaling curve, where local saliency is detected in a received image. The detected local saliency is then accumulated in the first direction. A final scaling curve {{is derived from the}} detected local saliency and the image is then possibly rescaled in a second direction by using the derived scaling curve, wherein the second direction is <b>substantially</b> <b>orthogonal</b> to the first direction...|$|E

40|$|A {{lightweight}} search-coil antenna or {{sensor assembly}} for detecting magnetic fields and including a multi-turn electromagnetic induction coil wound on a spool type coil form through which is inserted an elongated coil loading member comprised of metallic glass material {{wrapped around a}} dielectric rod. The dielectric rod consists of a plastic or a wooden dowel having a length which is relatively larger than its thickness so as to provide a large length-to-diameter ratio. A tri-axial configuration includes a housing in which is located three <b>substantially</b> identical mutually <b>orthogonal</b> electromagnetic induction coil assemblies of the type described above wherein each of the assemblies include an electromagnetic coil wound on a dielectric spool with an elongated metallic glass coil loading member projecting therethrough...|$|R
40|$|The benzodiazepine, Lorazepam {{enhances the}} {{efficiency}} of inhibitory GABA-A synapses in the cortex, which stabilize postsynaptic, excitatory activity by synchronizing their own discharges at around 40 Hz. Lorazepam treatment also affects contour integration processes, suggesting GABAA-mediated synchronization may be of direct influence during visuo-perceptual organization. By adding contours orthogonal (but at varying distances) to the unspecified continuances formed by the collinear arrangement of cross elements that flicker asynchronously but in a regularly arranged 3 x 3 element matrix, we found priming by means of 4 synchronized crosses presented in square arrangement was <b>substantially</b> increased when <b>orthogonal</b> contours were placed directly adjacent to the virtual continuances between the crosses, but only following lorazepam administration. We conclude that GABAA-induced inhibition influences directly the coding of relations between spatially separate visual stimuli related to the Gestalt principle of good continuation...|$|R
40|$|Although the genotype-phenotype map plays {{a central}} role both in Quantitative and Evolutionary Genetics, the {{formalization}} of a completely general and satisfactory model of genetic effects, particularly accounting for epistasis, remains a theoretical challenge. Here, we use a two-locus genetic system in simulated populations with epistasis to show the convenience of using a recently developed model, NOIA, to perform estimates of genetic effects and the decomposition of the genetic variance that are orthogonal even under deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg proportions. We develop the theory for how to use this model in interval mapping of quantitative trait loci using Halley-Knott regressions, and we analyze a real data set to illustrate the advantage of using this approach in practice. In this example, we show that departures from the Hardy-Weinberg proportions that are expected by sampling alone <b>substantially</b> alter the <b>orthogonal</b> estimates of genetic effects when other statistical models, like F 2 or G 2 A, are used instead of NOIA. Finally, {{for the first time}} from real data, we provide estimates of functional genetic effects as sets of effects of natural allele substitutions in a particular genotype, which enriches the debate on the interpretation of genetic effects as implemented both in functional and in statistical models. We also discuss further implementations leading to a completely general genotype-phenotype map...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{compressive}} domain filtering and interference cancelation processes compressive measurements to eliminate or attenuate interference while preserving the information or {{geometry of the}} set of possible signals of interest. A signal processing apparatus assumes that the interfering signal lives in or near a known subspace that is partially or <b>substantially</b> <b>orthogonal</b> to the signal of interest, and then projects the compressive measurements into an orthogonal subspace and thus eliminate or attenuate the interference. This apparatus yields a modified set of measurements that can provide a stable embedding of the set of signals of interest, in which case it is guaranteed that the processed measurements retain sufficient information to enable the direct recovery of this signal of interest, or alternatively to enable the use of efficient compressive-domain algorithms for further processing. The method and apparatus operate directly on the compressive measurements to remove or attenuate unwanted signal components...|$|E
