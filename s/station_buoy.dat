40|$|Abstract. Some science domains {{have the}} {{advantage}} {{that the bulk of}} the data comes from a single source instrument, such as a telescope or particle collider. More commonly, big data implies a big variety of data sources. For example, the Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction (CMOP) has multiple kinds of sensors (salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll A & B) on diverse platforms (fixed <b>station,</b> <b>buoy,</b> ship, underwater robot) coming in at different rates over various spatial scales and provided at several quality levels (raw, preliminary, curated). In addition, there are physical samples analyzed in the lab for biochemical and genetic properties, and simulation models for estuaries and near-ocean fluid dynamics and biogeochemical processes. Few people know the entire range of data holdings, much less their structures and how to access them. We present a variety of approaches CMOP has followed to help operational, science and resource managers locate, view and analyze data, including the Data Explorer, Data Near Here, and topical “watch pages. ” From these examples, and user experiences with them, we draw lessons about supporting users of collaborative “science observatories ” and remaining challenges...|$|E

40|$|Long-range transported {{nutrients}} {{and the status}} of the sugar kelp on the south coast of Norway A large shift in the coastal marine vegetation, from sugar kelp forest to silty turf algae communities, took place at the Norwegian Skagerrak Coast between 1996 and 2002, after decades of eutrophication and recent climatic events causing elevated sea temperature. The eutrophication of these coastal waters is largely influenced by long-range transported nutrients from the Southern North Sea. The nitrate concentration in the coastal current running along the coast was doubled in 1980 - 1995 and 75 % of the winterspring nitrate originated from the German Bight. Reductions in discharges from the continental rivers are lately reflected in reduced input from long-range transported {{nutrients and}} reduced nutrient concentrations in the Norwegian Coastal Current. Modelled results indicate that the 2005 riverine input from Continental rivers, the Kattegat (including the Baltic) and local Norwegian rivers to the affected coastline may have the proportions 45, 25 and 30 %. The Norwegian discharges of nutrients to the south coast of Norway are now of more relative increasing importance than the long-range transported nutrients. Figure 2.

Here {{we show that}} near-coastal generation is generally the dominant source region. This determination is based on observations at land and ocean seismic <b>stations,</b> <b>buoys,</b> gravity wave hindcasts, and on beamforming results from continental seismic arrays. Interactions between opposing ocean wave components generate a pressure excitation pulse at twice the ocean wave frequency that excites pseudo-Rayleigh (pRg) wave DF microseisms. pRg generated in shallow coastal waters have most of their energy in the solid Earth (“elastic ” pRg) and are observed by land-based and seafloor seismometers as DF microseisms. pRg generated in the deep-ocean have most of their energy in the ocean (“acoustic ” pRg) and are continuously observed on the ocean-bottom, but acoustic pRg does not efficiently transition onto continents. High amplitude DF signals over the [0. 2, 0. 3] Hz band observed on the deep seafloor are uncorrelated with continental observations, and are not clearly detectable at individual continental stations or by land seismic-array beamforming.

The study of the T and S characteristics reveals important seasonal changes and highlights the particular characteristics of each basin. Dense water production in the Northern Aegean {{is found to be}} hindered by the presence of the surface Black Sea Water (BSW) mass. On the other hand, the intermediate water mass in the Cretan Sea is shown to be ventilated during the winter season. A significant temperature and salinity increase has been monitored over both the Central Cretan and Eastern Ionian Seas starting from the middle of 2008 and 2009 respectively. This could possibly be attributed to changes in the intermediate water masses of the Eastern Mediterranean, without ruling out the possibility of water mass exchanges between the two basins...|$|R

40|$|Although {{wind and}} wave {{modeling}} is rather {{successful in the}} open ocean, modeling enclosed seas, particularly seas with small basins and complex orography, presents challenges. Here, we use data assimilation to improve wind and wave simulations in the Red Sea. We generated two sets of wind fields using a nested, high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model implemented with (VARFC) and without (CTL) assimilation of observations. Available conventional and satellite data were assimilated using the consecutive integration method with daily initializations over one year (2009). By evaluating the two wind products against in-situ data from synoptic <b>stations,</b> <b>buoys,</b> scatterometers, and altimeters, we found that seasonal patterns of wind and wave variability were well reproduced in both experiments. Statistical scores for simulated winds computed against QuikSCAT, <b>buoy,</b> and synoptic <b>station</b> observations suggest that data assimilation decreases the root-mean-square error to values between 1 and 2 m s- 1 and reduces the scatter index by 30 % compared to the CTL. Sensitivity clearly increased around mountain gaps, where the channeling effect is better described by VARFC winds. The impact of data assimilation is more pronounced in wave simulations, particularly during extreme winds and {{in the presence of}} mountain jets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Results show that excluding rainy days and days affected by typhoon, the sea breezes occur nearly every day during this period. When Qingdao {{is located at the}} edge of the subtropical high at 500 hPa, the sea breeze is usually stronger, around 3 – 4 m s − 1. It starts at around 1100 to 1300 LST and lasts about 6 hours.

When Qingdao is under the control of the subtropical high, the sea breeze is usually weaker, less than 2. 5 m s − 1 throughout the day, and begins later, between 1300 and 1500 LST. In this case, the direction of the sea breeze is variable from easterly to southeasterly. Most sea breezes in Qingdao are very shallow, up to 300 meters deep.

The sea breezes are categorized into two types as being {{under the control of}} or {{at the edge of the}} subtropical high. The influence of the large-scale subtropical high on the local sea breezes is investigated. Results show that excluding rainy days and days with typhoon, the sea breezes occur nearly everyday during this period. When Qingdao is located at the edge of a subtropical high, the sea breeze usually starts at around 1100 to 1300 LST and lasts about 6 hours. When Qingdao is under the control of a subtropical high, the sea breeze usually begins later between 1300 and 1500 LST. Under the control of subtropical high, the wind speed near the sailing sites is very weak and is usually less than 2. 5 m s- 1 throughout the day, and the wind direction is variable. The direction of the sea breeze is easterly to southeasterly. When Qingdao is at the edge of the subtropical high, the sea breezes are stronger and usually begin earlier. The wind speed is around 3 - 4 m s- 1 when the sea breeze forms, it is usually the strongest at this formation stage. In this case, the direction of the sea breeze tends to be southeasterly.
