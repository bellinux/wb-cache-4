5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in <b>some</b> <b>respect,</b> although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, {{striking}} workers in Chicago met near the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant. Union molders {{at the plant}} had been locked out since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had come under attack from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers <b>some</b> <b>respect</b> and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 general strike, strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed the picket lines.|$|E

5|$|Homer applies {{for a job}} at {{the power}} plant once more, this time marching into Mr. Burns's office and telling him that he will be the perfect employee. Mr. Burns is so {{impressed}} that he hires Homer on the spot. When Homer returns to Marge's house, he discovers from Jacqueline that she has gone into labor and is already at the hospital. He quickly gets there and sees Marge with Selma and an angry Patty, who starts berating him. Fed up with her disrespect, Homer lashes out at Patty and angrily tells Patty (as well {{as the rest of the}} Bouvier family) to start showing him <b>some</b> <b>respect</b> for he has a job, a piece of news that Homer promptly tells Marge before she finally gives birth to Bart. After Homer finishes telling his flashback story, he admits to Bart that he received the greatest gift a man can have the day Bart was born. At that time, Marge arrives home with the news that she is not pregnant. They are both overjoyed and high-five.|$|E
5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, the elements {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) {{are determined by the}} electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to <b>some</b> <b>respect</b> in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.|$|E

In 1921 he became editor of the journal Ter Waarheid and in this role his ideological outlook developed further as he shifted to the right. Although he had always been a nationalist Van Severen had held <b>some</b> <b>respect</b> for international socialism but by the early 1920s had abandoned this position in favour of a harder-edged nationalist Jacobinism.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{the image}} he builds of Tiberius {{throughout}} {{the first six}} books of the Annals is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly positive in the first books, and predominantly negative after the intrigues of Sejanus. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book {{is dominated by the}} hypocrisy of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, <b>some</b> <b>respect</b> is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{high-profile}} pieces of legislation, inherited from Prodi and initiated by the President Commission.

25|$|Otto {{granted the}} various bishops and abbots {{of the kingdom}} the rank of count {{as well as the}} legal rights of counts within their territory. Because Otto {{personally}} appointed all bishops and abbots, these reforms strengthened his central authority, and the upper ranks of the German Church functioned in <b>some</b> <b>respect</b> as an arm of the royal bureaucracy. Otto routinely appointed his personal court chaplains to bishoprics throughout the kingdom. While attached to the royal court, the chaplains would perform the work of the government through services to the royal chancery. After years within the royal court, Otto would reward their service with promotion to a diocese.|$|E
25|$|It {{is shown}} that York had gained a little freedom {{while on the}} {{expedition}} with Lewis and Clark. It is mentioned in journals that York went on scouting trips and going to trade with villages so he saw what freedom was like while doing that. He might have also been shown respect by Clark because Clark named two geographic discoveries after him; York's Eight Islands and York's Dry Creek. Also they took a poll of where they should stay over one winter and York's opinion was recorded {{even though it was}} last. This shows that York had a taste of freedom and possibly gained <b>some</b> <b>respect</b> by the fellow travelers on the expedition.|$|E
25|$|To gain <b>some</b> <b>respect,</b> in {{the fall}} of 1888, it was decided that the 1889 Cornell crew would switch from a four-oared varsity crew to an eight-oared varsity crew. Courtney was {{hindered}} by a lack of equipment. He had to coach from the bank of the lake since Cornell did not have a launch. The practice shell was weak and in poor condition, and the team did not receive their eight-man shells until they arrived in New London for the first race. Courtney's Cornell crew easily beat Pennsylvania and Columbia University at New London, and then a few weeks later broke the world record for an eight-oared 1Â½-mile race versus Pennsylvania at the Schuylkill in Philadelphia. These victories created great enthusiasm for the rowing program at Cornell.|$|E

25|$|Finally, Wessels was {{included}} in the Australian XI, for a one-day game against the WSC World XI, which included four fellow South Africans. He scored 20, made 21 in the next game and then got 92 against the Cavaliers side. A Supertest against a 'Rest of the World' side followed in Melbourne, but Wessels scored only eight in the first innings. In the second innings, he managed to get to 46. He regained <b>some</b> <b>respect,</b> however, during the next Supertest against the WSC West Indies, by scoring 126 in his first innings. During the Supertest final between Australia and the World XI, Wessels scored 27 in his first innings, but experienced a miserable second one. Australia lost by five wickets.|$|E
25|$|Mannock had {{initially}} to overcome {{his fear of}} combat. On 13 April he crossed into no mans land {{for the first time}} during the opening days of the Arras offensive and was subjected to German anti-aircraft artillery for the first time. He mishandled his aircraft and dropped out of formation. Subsequent patrols did not abate his fear. A man who performed in such a manner was suspect and he was shunned in the mess. On 19 April 1917, and in view of the entire squadron, Mannock finally won <b>some</b> <b>respect</b> when he landed his aircraft during a firing practice after the lower right wing tore away. Mannock forced himself into the air again and continued to practice. Eventually he adopted the tactic of closing to within 20 or 30 yards to open fire.|$|E
25|$|A {{purpose trust}} in English {{law is a}} trust created for the {{fulfillment}} of a purpose, not {{for the benefit of}} a person. These are normally considered invalid by the courts because they have no legally recognized beneficiaries, therefore nobody to enforce the trust, with the exception of charitable trusts, which are enforceable by Attorney General as they represent public interest. As well as charitable trusts, there are several exceptions to the rules against purpose trusts. If the requirement to fulfill a purpose is a request, rather than an obligation, the trust is valid; a trust will also be found valid if, while being for a purpose, it involves beneficiaries in <b>some</b> <b>respect.</b> Purpose trusts can also be valid if they are for the erection or maintenance of tombs and memorials (assuming such memorials are not overly grandiose), the maintenance of animals, and arguably the saying of masses, although these must all obey the rule against perpetuities and not continue for more than 21 years after the testator's death.|$|E
