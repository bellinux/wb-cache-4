One such limitation arises from the inherent toxicity of solvent-like biofuel compounds to production strains, such as Escherichia coli.

Using systems biology data, we selected 40 genes that were upregulated following isopentenol exposure and subsequently overexpressed them in E. coli.

Emerging {{data suggest that}} membrane associated glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors may directly regulate synaptic excitability during times of stress when adrenal hormones are elevated. As the key neuron signaling interface, the synapse is involved in learning and memory, including traumatic memories during times of stress. The lateral amygdala is a key site for synaptic plasticity underlying conditioned fear, which can both trigger and be coincident with the stress response. A large body of electrophysiological data shows rapid regulation of neuronal excitability by steroid hormone receptors. Despite {{the importance of these}} receptors, to date, only the glucocorticoid receptor has been anatomically localized to the membrane. We investigated the subcellular sites of mineralocorticoid receptors in the lateral amygdala of the Sprague-Dawley rat. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of mineralocorticoid receptors in the amygdala. Using electron microscopy, we found mineralocorticoid receptors expressed at both nuclear including: glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and extra nuclear sites including: presynaptic terminals, neuronal dendrites, and dendritic spines. Importantly we also observed mineralocorticoid receptors at postsynaptic membrane densities of excitatory synapses. These data provide direct anatomical evidence supporting the concept that, at some synapses, synaptic transmission is regulated by mineralocorticoid receptors.

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} p 53 is a {{transcription factor}} that responds to {{various kinds of}} cellular <b>stress.</b> In <b>respons</b> to the sensed stress {{it is able to}} induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In order to achieve these effects it transactivates target genes. Thus knowledge about p 53 target genes and their function is vital for the understandnig of this important tumor suppressor. We previously identified a novel p 53 -induced mouse gene, wig- 1, that encodes a 290 amino acid zinc finger protein. Here we have identified and characterized the human homolog of mouse wig- 1. The human wig- 1 protein is 87 % identical to the mouse protein and contains three zinc finger domains and a putative nuclear localization signal. Human wig- 1 mRNA and protein is induced following activation of wild type p 53. Northern blotting detected low levels of wig- 1 mRNA in normal human tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapped human wig- 1 to chromosome 3 q 26. 3 - 27. FLAG-tagged human wig- 1 localizes to the nucleus. Ectopic overexpression of human wig- 1 inhibits tumor cell growth in a colony formation assay. These results suggest that human wig- 1 has a role in the p 53 dependent growth regulatory pathway. To further characterize the effect of Wig- 1 on cell growth and survival, we generated Saos- 2 osteosarcoma cells expressing tetracycline-inducible Flag-tagged human Wig- 1. We found that induction of Wig- 1 expression by addition of doxycycline caused a significant inhibition of growth but no changes in cell cycle distribution could be detected, nor did we see an increased fraction of cells with sub-G 1 DNA content indicative of apoptosis. Colony formation assays in Saos- 2 cells with wild type and zinc finger mutants of Wig- 1 indicated that the first zinc finger domain is important for Wig- 1 mediated growth suppression. Wig- 1 also inhibited colony formation in U 20 S osteosarcoma cells that carry wild type p 53. Colony formation assays in HCT 1 16 colon carcinoma cells revealed that the growth inhibitory effect of Wig- 1 is more pronounced in the presence of wild type p 53. Furthermore, we show that human wig- 1 has a functional p 53 binding motif within its first intron, confirming its status as bona fide p 53 target gene. Using a polyclonal Wig- 1 antiserum, we show that the basal levels of the two Wig- 1 protein species vary in human tumor cell lines. We also demonstrate that the two forms are generated by translation initiation from different AUG initiation codons. Wig- 1 was induced by gamma irradiation and 5 fluorouracil (5 -FU) in a p 53 -dependent manner, whereas UV light only caused a modest induction of Wig- 1 expression. Hypoxia did not induce any increased expression of Wig- 1 despite accumulation of p 53. Thus, Wig- 1 is differentially regulated by p 53 in response to stress stimuli. In search of wig- 1 orthologs we demonstrate its presence in Gallus gallus (chicken), Silurana tropicalis (frog) and Fugu rubripes (fish) by assembly of EST sequence data from a range of data bases into putative cDNAs. The zinc finger regions of Wig- 1 are almost completely conserved from fish to man. A short upstream open reading frame is conserved in mammals and birds but not in amphibians. Sequence information from clones of Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque), Sus scrofa (pig), Danio rerio (Zebra fish) and Tetraodon nigroviridis (fresh water puffer fish) indicates that Wig- 1 orthologs exist also in these species. No genes with striking similarities to wig- 1 were found in invertebrates, Our results suggest that Wig- 1 and particularly the zinc finger domains has an important biological function in the p 53 pathway in vertebrates...|$|R

Variations of HSP response were observed under environmental conditions, correlated with differences in environmental temperature and degree of heterogeneity across geographic thermal gradients and through time. Laboratory experiments characterized the expressions of different protein isoforms and coding genes, which are induced by heat as a prototypical stimulus. Nevertheless, other physical and chemical factors significantly induce HSP gene and protein expressions in bivalves, that can be different depending on tissues {{and the nature of}} the insult. Multiple alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the bivalve HSP 70 proteins share common structural and evolutionary features with the mammalian HSP 70, while some appear to be exclusive. The rate at which new findings are made regarding the bivalve HSP response is still increasing. However, some major questions remain unanswered.

Methods - This study quantified shoot and root development {{and patterns of}} water and nitrate capture of two lettuce cultivars subjected to temporary drought at two development stages (Trial 1) or to continuous, localized drought and/or nitrate shortage (Trial 2). Results - In Trial 1, early drought slowed down shoot and root growth, whereas late drought enhanced root proliferation in the top 0. 1 m. Nitrate capture during drought was sustained by increased nitrate inflow from deeper layers. Plants did not recover fully from drought after re-watering. In Trial 2, root proliferation was stimulated in the drier soil compartment partially compensating reduced water availability and nitrate mobility. Under nitrate shortage, root proliferation was enhanced in the compartment where nitrate was more abundant, irrespective of water availability.

The study of the signaling and regulatory mechanisms that control acclimation is particularly important for understanding the genetic basis of cold tolerance in plants. Previous microarray analysis has identified a number of genes that have altered expression during cold acclimation, some of which have characteristics of signaling or regulatory proteins.

Cold induction of transcript level of J 822 is higher in cold tolerant winter cultivars than in spring wheat cultivars. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that J 822 interacts with two phospholipase C proteins. J 822 and the phospholipase Cs were found to be regulated by cold, drought and salt stress and may be involved in stress-induced phospholipid signaling.

This formulation from the ‘‘modern synthesis’ ’ of the 1930 s was embraced decades before molecular understanding of genes or mutations. Since then, our labs {{and others have}} elucidated mutation mechanisms activated by stress responses. Stress-induced mutation mechanisms produce mutations, potentially accelerating evolution, specifically when cells are maladapted to their environment, that is, when they are stressed. The mechanisms of stress-induced mutation that are being revealed experimentally in laboratory set-tings provide compelling models for mutagenesis that pro-pels pathogen–host adaptation, antibiotic resistance, cancer progression and resistance, and perhaps much of evolution generally. We discuss double-strand-break-dependent stress-induced mutation in Escherichia coli. Recent results illustrate how a stress response activates mutagenesis and demonstrate this mechanism’s generality and importance to spontaneous mutation. New data also suggest a possible harmony between previous, apparently opposed, models for the molecular mechanism.

Using an automated cell-counting technique for measuring conidial longevity, we show that the clock-associated genes lag- 1 and ras- 1 (bd) are true chronological longevity genes. For example, wild type (WT) has an estimated median life span of 24 days, while the double mutant lag- 1, ras- 1 (bd) has an estimated median life span of 120 days for macroconidia. We estab-lish the biochemical function of lag- 1 by complementing LAG 1 and LAC 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with lag- 1 in N. crassa.

Since these conditions produce stress and result in extensive losses to many agriculturally important crops, they have been the main subject of intense research. It is well documented that, under harsh conditions, plants develop various strategies to cope with stress and its negative effects. As a result, they are able to sustain their normal function before being attacked or subjected to an otherwise lethal environment. In order to respond to stress, plants adapt in a multitude of physiological and biochemical ways in addition to inducing an array of functional or regulatory genes (Bartels and Sunkar 2005). The accumulation of some functional substances, such as compatible solute and protective proteins, is an important element of the physiological and biochemical response to the stressful conditions.

The resulting transcriptional profiles revealed how this bacterium fine-tunes gene expression in response to acid stress. This adaptation involves the differential expression of respiratory pathways, the induction of genes for phosphate transport, and the repression of energy generation and intermediary metabolism genes. We also generated and screened a transposon-based mutant library to identify genes required for wild-type levels of growth under mildly acidic conditions. This screen highlighted the important role played by cell surface components (flagella, the outer membrane, capsular polysaccharides, and lipooligosaccharides) in the acid stress response of C. jejuni.

The presence of CART peptide 55 – 102 immunoreactivity in dense core vesicles of axon terminals suggests that the peptide may be released and may act as a neuromodulator (Smith et al., 1997) to induce neurophysiological and behavioral effects. Little is known, however, about CART peptide-responsive cells, receptor(s), or intracellular signaling mechanisms that mediate CART peptide action. Here we show that CART peptide 55 – 102 inhibits voltage-dependent intracellular Ca 2 � signaling and attenuates cocaine enhancement of depolarization-induced Ca 2 � influx in rat hippocampal neurons. The inhibitory effect of CART peptide 55 – 102 on Ca 2 � signaling is likely mediated by an inhibition of L-type voltage-gated Ca 2 � channel activity via a G-protein-dependent pathway.

We further demonstrate that the adrenal and vascular responses are differentially regulated: the adrenal response is adrenocorticotropin dependent, whereas the vascular response is under adrenergic control. In addition, the adrenal response is restricted to members of the HSP 70 gene family, whereas in vascular tissue the low molecular weight HSP, HSP 27, is also induced by restraint. Further char-acterization of the vascular response revealed that HSP 70 in-duction occurred in both the thoracic and abdominal aortas {{as well as in the}} vena cava. However, no HSP 70 induction was apparent in the heart or in a wide variety ofother tissues exam-ined. In situ hybridization showed that the vascular expression was localized to the aortic smooth muscle cells with minimal expression in the endothelium.

Maximum HSP 70 protein levels were seen within 3 - 12 h after restraint, but declined thereafter.

Traditional preoperative anesthesia consultations capture only some of the information needed to identify older patients (defined as ≥ 65  years of age) undergoing elective surgery who are at increased risk for postoperative complications, prolonged hospital stays, and delayed or hampered functional recovery. As a catalyst to this review, we compared traditional risk scores (eg, cardiac-focused) to geriatric-specific risk measures from two older female patients seen in our preoperative clinic who were scheduled for elective, robotic-assisted hysterectomies. Despite having a lower cardiac risk index and Charlson comorbidity score, the younger of the two patients presented with more subtle negative geriatric-specific risk predictors – including intermediate or pre-frail status, borderline malnutrition, and reduced functional/mobility – which may have contributed to her 1 -day-longer length of stay and need for readmission. Adequate screening of physiologic and cognitive reserves in older patients scheduled for surgery could identify at-risk, vulnerable elders and enable proactive perioperative management strategies (eg, strength, balance, and mobility prehabilitation) to reduce adverse postoperative outcomes and readmissions.

The time of exposure was randomly changed every day during light phase (7 Am to 7 Pm) of the day to avoid habituation. There was a significant increase in serum corticosterone levels on PND 8 and 11 in stress group rats compared to controls indicating stress response in these pups. The ovary of both control and stressed rats contained oocytes and primary follicles on PND 8 and 11 and in showed progress of follicular development upto to pre-antral and early antral follicle formation on PND 11 and 15. However, mean number of healthy oocytes and all categories of follicles at all ages studied were significantly lower in stressed rats compared to controls. Concomitant with these changes, number of atreatic follicles showed an increase over control values in stressed rats. The increase in atresia of follicles was due to apoptosis as shown by increase in the percentage of granulosa cells showing TUNEL positive staining and caspase 3 activity. On the other hand, pre-treatment with CRH- receptor antagonist (CRH 9 - 41) 2 ng/ 0. 1 ml / rat prior to undergoing stress regime on PND 1 to 7, prevented alterations in pre- pubertal follicular development thereby indicating that the ovarian changes were due to effects of stress induced activation of HPA axis.

My proteomic analysis and experimental results from Dr. Titorenko's laboratory show that CR yeast are able to meet their metabolic requirements by remodeling their carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, which relies on functional lipid metabolic pathways in the peroxisome. These findings suggest that peroxisomal Ý-oxidation of fatty acids significantly affects the rate of chronological aging in CR yeast by defining the rate of ATP production in their mitochondria but not by making ROS. I also present my research findings on longevity regulation in S. cerevisiae by a novel anti-aging molecule "LA" identified recently in Dr. Titorenko's laboratory. Comprehensive analysis of the proteome remodeling in yeast placed on a CR diet and exposed to LA, along with experimental data obtained through various metabolomic and functional studies in Dr. Titorenko's laboratory, demonstrate that LA extends yeast chronological lifespan by maintaining the mitochondrial production of ROS at an optimal level that does not excessively damage cellular macromolecules but triggers a potent cellular <b>stress</b> <b>respons...</b>|$|E
40|$|Only {{recently}} identified, the CDGSH {{family of}} proteins is highly conserved across species. It {{is represented in}} humans by three homologs, {{the first of which}} was discovered upon binding to the anti-diabetes drug pioglitazone (ActosTM). This protein, mitoNEET, is a 2 Fe- 2 S binding protein with a novel fold and a unique ligand arrangement. In order to understand this family of proteins more extensively, we employed a variety of biochemical and structural techniques to probe the characteristics that are shared and differ across human homlogs and across species. Because the 2 Fe- 2 S mitoNEET coordination is so rare, we investigate the biophysical and possible functional properties that may be impacted upon mutation of the sole histidine ligand. Results indicate this histidine ligand is important in retaining properties of this protein, but does not stabilize it, which may argue this residue is evolutionarily conserved for its specific stability. We venture beyond mitoNEET and explored the second human homolog, Miner 1, the lack of which causes Wolfram's Syndrome 2. This orphan disease results in diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness followed by early death. We show this ER-localized protein retains many of the CDGSH characteristics, including optical and redox properties, but differs in its cluster stability and structural packing in its Beta-Cap domain, properties that could influence protein/ligand binding as well as function. Finally, to investigate an ortholog outside of humans, and {{to take advantage of a}} system with only one CISD gene, we characterize the properties of the AtNEET, an Arabidopsis thaliana protein, in vitro as well as in vivo. We show AtNEET is the first plant CDGSH protein to retain this family's optical and structural characteristics. We show that this protein is localized to the chloroplast, and we also conclude that the importance of this family in cellular health spans species, as plants with inhibited expression experience late-bolting and early senescence. Taken together, evidence shows this family maintains its unique 2 Fe- 2 S binding across multiple homologs and species. In addition, problems arising from the lack of this protein indicate its fundamental importance in normal physiological health and the <b>stress</b> <b>respons...</b>|$|E

However, in some TKI responders, {{the benefits of}} such targeted therapies are limited by the rapid development of resistance, and strategies to overcome this resistance are urgently needed. Studies of drug resistance in cancer cells typically involve long term in vitro induction to obtain stably acquired drug-resistant cells followed by elucidation of resistance mechanisms, but the immediate responses of cancer cells upon drug treatment have been ignored. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the immediate responses of NSCLC cells upon treatment with EGFR TKIs. Results: Both NSCLC cells, ie, PC 9 and H 1975, showed immediate enhanced adhesion-related responses as an apoptosis-countering mechanism upon first-time TKI treatment. By gene expression and pathway analysis, adhesion-related pathways were enriched in gefitinib-treated PC 9 cells. Pathway inhibition by small-hairpin RNAs or small-molecule drugs revealed that within hours of EGFR TKI treatment, NSCLC cells used adhesion-related responses to combat the drugs. Importantly, we show here that the Src family inhibitor, dasatinib, dramatically inhibits cell adhesion-related response and greatly enhances the cell-killing effects of EGFR TKI (gefitinib for the PC 9 cells; afatinib for the H 1975 cells) in NSCLC cells, which would otherwise escape the TKI-induced apoptosis. Conclusion: Results from this study indicate that NSCLC cells can employ the adhesion response as a survival pathway to survive under EGFR-targeted therapy. Simultaneous targeting of EGFR signaling and adhesion pathways would further boost the efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapy in NSCLC.

40|$|The highly conserved Cap Binding Complex (CBC) is {{comprised}} of two subunits, Cbp 20 and Cbp 80, and binds to the 5 ' end of pre-mRNA as it emerges from the transcribing RNA polymerase (Pol II). Evidence suggesting a role for the CBC in multiple reactions during gene expression, including transcription, splicing, 3 ' end processing, and RNA export, prompted us to hypothesize that the CBC is involved in coupling these reactions, and that this coordinated regulation facilitates {{the ability of a}} cell to respond to stress. The research presented in this dissertation specifically dissects the roles of the CBC in splicing and in transcription and provides insight into a mechanism by which the CBC might contribute to the coupling of these two reactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have demonstrated that the CBC is specifically required for the splicing of two intron- containing genes with a particular non-consensus 5 ' splice site, SUS 1 and GCR 1. Through its effects on splicing, we found that the CBC contributes to the regulation of a histone modification and the acitivity of a key glycolytic transcription factor, resulting in genome-wide changes to gene expression when the CBC is deleted. We discovered that the CBC is down-regulated at multiple levels in response to nutrient stress, suggesting that the coordinated activities of the CBC are particularly important under these conditions. One of these levels of regulation appears to be proteolysis by the proteasome. Furthermore, a role for the CBC in repressing expression of Rpn 4, a critical regulator of proteasome levels, suggests that the CBC is involved in a feedback loop in which its targeting to the proteasome is determined by its ability to influence gene expression. Directed mutagenesis of evolutionarily-conserved domains of Cbp 80 allowed us to uncouple the functions of the CBC in gene expression revealing a role for the CBC in transcription that is independent of its ability to act in splicing. In sum, the findings presented here demystify the role of the CBC in gene expression by enhancing our understanding of the CBC's role in splicing, demonstrating novel functions for the CBC in transcription, identifying multiple mechanisms by which the CBC is regulated, and illustrating a requirement for the CBC in the cellular <b>stress</b> <b>respons...</b>|$|E
40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences {{that have}} the ability to jump from one location of the genome to another and create copies of them during the process. Although their activity can create mostly harmful mutation, it also represent an important source of genetic variation that have been shown to rewire and fine-tune regulatory networks. Stress response mechanisms are highly conserved across organisms and a major target of natural selection. Despite the latest advances in evolutionary biology, adaptation process remains poorly understood. Therefore, studying stress pathways provide a great opportunity to study how adaptive processes occur. In this study we aim to identify genome-wide putatively adaptive TEs that are candidates to modulate stress response by the addition of stress response elements (SREs) in the promoter of Drosophila melanogaster genes. We combine bioinformatics and population genetics approaches to discard SREs found by chance and select TEs having SREs that {{are more likely to be}} involved in stress response. We found 3, 381 TEs out of 5, 416 annotated TEs that contain at least one SRE. Because only TEs inserted in the promoter region are likely to have a biological impact in the gene modulation we reduce our dataset to 406 TEs. Moreover, we select TEs present at high frequency in the populations since they are more likely to be adaptive. Finally, our curated dataset contain 108 TEs with at least one SRE, inserted at a promoter region of a gene and at high frequency in at least one of the 8 worldwide studied populations. Out of this list we in silico validate 18 TEs thanks to modENCODE project and other chromatin immuneprecipitation studies. Additionally, we analyzed the promoter of the 127 genes nearby the 108 TEs. The function of 22 out of this list was related to stress by genome wide association studies and gene ontology term annotations. Eighty-five TEs add preexisting or novel SREs while other 26 introduce SREs to the regions without any previous SREs. Having several SREs make the promoter region and/or the TE more likely to have an impact on the gene expression. Seventy-three TEs out of the 108 TEs contain more than one SRE and hence are more likely to be involved in stress response regulation. Our final candidate list is the starting point to functionally analyze the role of these putatively adaptive TEs in <b>stress</b> <b>respons...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{product of}} the {{chestnut}} wood cleaning was placed in aerated static piles, composed directly in the wood and consisting of fresh shoots, chipboard, mowing the undergrowth and leaves and curly dry. The composting process and mature compost was sampled and characterized for physic-chemical parameters and microbiological composition. The present doctorate thesis enlightens the composting process of biomass from chestnut woods handling. Physical, chemical parameters and their interaction with biological aspects were examined. Bacterial and fungal populations were detected and characterized during the composting process {{in order to identify}} species and their potential beneficial effects on plants. Agronomic studies were conducted to evaluate effects of the compost on plant fitness and suppressive activity. The results of the characterization of the process showed the potential in agriculture of the mature product. Main results of the study are: a) The temperature values in the internal part of the pile were strongly affected by the seasonal climatic conditions. Averagely, the decomposition process occurred at low temperature; b) The agronomic valuations allow the classification of the compost obtained as a good quality amendant; c) Parameters analyzed for stability evaluation, respiration test and phytotoxicity bioassay, as well as sanitary checks, indicated the product absolute suitability; d) Parameters of plant fitness and agronomic evaluation showed that plants grown in compost activate their response to stress; e) The suppression capability was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo; f) The trends of functional populations (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) during the bio-oxidative process were affected by the decrease of activity water and the temperature; g) DGGE patterns of eukaryotic populations showed a predominance of Ascomycota, including species of Penicillium, Moristroma, Paraconiothyrium, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Aspergillus. Selected 117 prokaryotic bands were affiliated with Bacilli, followed by Actinobacteria, Flavobacteriia, and -Proteobacteria; h) Extraction and SEM-TEM characterization of humic substances from wheat straw co-compost including lignocellulosic fungi and metallic oxides, reveales the importance of metallic oxides in controlling morphology stablility of HA-ion aggregates. This {{is the first time that}} the chestnut in situ composting process is characterised in all the phases. Moreover, this is the first time that the microbial dynamics during the process as well as the microbial characterization and its suppressive activity on soil-borne plant pathogens, was investigated. The results are encouraging and indicate that biomasses from forest and agricultural origin could represent a new and underspeculated source of agriculture amendant, pathogen and pests control, income for marginal areas, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity preservation. It is advisable that the research will keep on truck investigating the way to optimize the process to: amplify carbon sequestration, investigate the process in different matrices, and unravel the transcriptome of the plant <b>stress</b> <b>respons...</b>|$|E
