25|$|The {{most modern}} method of loading and {{unloading}} a revolver is {{by means of the}} <b>swing</b> <b>out</b> cylinder. The cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is parallel to the chambers, and the cylinder <b>swings</b> <b>out</b> and down (to the left in most cases). An extractor is fitted, operated by a rod projecting {{from the front of the}} cylinder assembly. When pressed, it will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in top break models, the travel is designed to not completely extract longer, unfired rounds). The cylinder may then be loaded, singly or again with a speedloader, closed, and latched in place.|$|R

Some designs, such as the Ruger Super Redhawk or the Taurus Raging Bull, use a latches at the front and rear of the cylinder to provide a secure bond between cylinder and frame.|$|R
