40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{experiments}} to investigate surface roughness and burr formation during the <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> of Aluminum 6061. The experiment was carried out with small cutting tool diameter and several of spindles speed and federate. Generally, cutting parameters will influence on surface roughness {{and the formation of}} burrs in small <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> operations. Although {{it is not possible to}} avoid burr formation by modifying the cutting parameters, the burr size can be reduced by selecting the appropriate values. The results showed that <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> with cutting tool with diameter 2. 0 mm and 3. 0 mm have a similar behavior for surface roughness with respect to federate and spindle speed. The larger cutting tool diameter results in a larger burr formed. Burr height increased due to larger chip load as the spindle speed increased.

40|$|Nowadays due {{to global}} competition, {{manufacturing}} industries must provide high quality products on time and within the cost constraints to remain competitive. High quality mechanical parts include those with better surface finish and texture, dimension and form accuracies, reduced tensile residual stress and burr-free. The burr formation {{is one of the}} most common and undesirable phenomenon occurring in machining operations, which reduces assembly and machined part quality. Therefore, it is desired to eliminate the burrs or reduce the effort required to remove them. Amongst machining operations, <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> has a more complex burr formation mechanism with multiple burrs appear in machined part edges with non-uniform dimensions. The ultimate goal of this research work is burr minimization in <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> operation. To this end, new strategies for understanding, modeling and optimizing burrs during <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> of aluminum alloys are proposed for improving the part quality and ultimately reducing the non-value added expenses caused by deburring processes. In order to have a better understanding of <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> burr formation mechanism, multi-level experimental studies and statistical methods are used to determine the effects of machining conditions, tooling and workpiece materials on burrs size (height and thickness) when using dry high speed condition. It was found that optimum setting levels of process parameters to minimize each burr are dissimilar. The analysis of results shows that cutting tool, feed per tooth and depth of cut have certain level of influence on <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> burrs. However most of the burrs are strongly affected by interaction effects between process parameters that consequently complicate developing burr size prediction models. An analytical model is proposed to predict the thickness of the largest burr during <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> of ductile materials. The model is based on the geometry of burr formation and continuity of work at the transition from chip formation to burr formation, which also takes into account the effect of the cutting force involved in the machining process. A computational model is also developed to predict the exit up milling side burr thickness based on the use of cutting parameters and material properties such as yield strength and specific cutting force coefficient, which are the only unknown variables in the model. Both analytical and computational models are validated using experimental results obtained during <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> of 2024 -T 351 and 6061 -T 6 aluminium alloys. Machining parameters optimization to minimize the burr size could have a negative impact on other machining performance characteristic, such as surface finish, tool life and material removal rate. Therefore, surface finish is also investigated with burr formation in this research work. For simultaneous multiple responses optimization, a new modification to the application of Taguchi method is suggested by proposing fitness mapping function and desirability index. The proposed modification is validated by simultaneous minimization of surface roughness and thickness of five burrs during <b>slot</b> <b>milling</b> of 6061 -T 6 aluminium alloy. The optimization results demonstrate the potential and capability of the proposed approach...|$|E
