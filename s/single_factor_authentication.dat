40|$|Abstract — <b>Single</b> <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> such as {{password}} authentication is {{no longer}} considered as secure in the Internet world. There is a rapid growth in demand for strong authentication on the highly critical web-based applications. A higher level security mechanism is needed to access the financial and banking applications. Existing system provides authentication mechanism based on the static password, personal identification number (PIN) etc. These methods are vulnerable against eavesdropping and replay attack. In this work, a two factor authentication scheme is proposed for user authentication. The presented scheme generates dynamic password for two factor authentication. This scheme will provide user assurance of authentication and will improve authentication level. The proposed scheme provides strong protection against cryptanalysis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — As {{social media}} {{increases}} in functionality and popularity, {{it has become}} more vulnerable. It is no secret that social media vendors exclude security during development, hence leaving it to users ’ discretion which raises a serious cause for concern. The aim of this research is to study existing vulnerabilities of online social media and propose practical solutions. The importance of studying social media vulnerabilities provides a clear understanding in developing a new security model to prevent social engineering attacks. In this paper; we investigate key security vulnerabilities eroding the trust placed on social media such as profile cloning, <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> <b>authentication,</b> weak password creation, weak account activation systems, privacy vulnerabilities, unethical posts and multiple login sessions. We develop and propose a novel social media security model (SMSM) to reduce the aforementioned vulnerabilities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Session {{hijacking}} is {{an important}} bottle-neck on online business; especially internet banking suffers fraudulent transactions. Two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> provides much stronger authentication than simply username and password authentication. One {{of the most popular}} two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> involves hardware tokens that enable constantly changing session strings at set intervals. In this method to authenticate users, a password presented and used with these constantly changing strings. However, Sophisticated attacks can steal session id even within the shortest window opportunity. But besides authenticating session, if the transaction is authenticated before it is completed with one time password, the hijacker can be thwarted. The success of the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> depends on encryption strategies and application logic. We discuss the effectiveness of two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> for preventing fraudulent transactions during session hijacking attacks on online business...|$|R

40|$|Host-to-network {{authentication}} is a {{weak link}} {{in the chain of}} modern network security systems. There is no widely accepted method of validating a computers identity on a network. Currently, the best commercial methods entail using the hardware address of an Ethernet network interface controller, but those can easily be changed. Spoofing the hardware address can lead to unauthorized entry and possible data theft on sensitive networks. In this work a possible solution for this problem is proposed and evaluated. The proposed solution is to use device specific analog characteristics of the IEEE 802. 3 normal link pulse (NLP) as a <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> feature. Two sub-problems, inter-model and intra-model, are addressed in order to establish the effectiveness of the NLP as an authentication feature.

40|$|Abstract Organizations are {{deploying}} wireless based {{online payment}} applications {{to expand their}} business globally, it increases the growing need of regulatory requirements {{for the protection of}} confidential data, and especially in internet based financial areas. Existing internet based authentication systems often use either the Web or the Mobile channel individually to confirm the claimed identity of the remote user. The vulnerability is that access is based on only <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> which is not secure to protect user data, there is a need of multifactor authentication. This paper proposes a new protocol based on multifactor authentication system that is both secure and highly usable. It uses a novel approach based on Transaction Identification Code and SMS to enforce another security level with the traditional Login/password system. The system provides a highly secure environment that is simple to use and deploy with in a limited resources that does not require any change in infrastructure or underline protocol of wireless network. This Protocol for Wireless Payment is extended as a two way authentications system to satisfy the emerging market need of mutual authentication and also supports secure B 2 B communication which increases faith of the user and business organizations on wireless financial transaction using mobile devices...|$|E
40|$|In {{the light}} of recent {{security}} incidents, leading to compromise of services using <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> mechanisms, industry and academia researchers are actively investigating novel multi-factor authentication schemes. Moreover, exposure of unprotected authentication data is a high risk threat for organizations with online presence. The challenge is: how to ensure security of multi-factor authentication data without deteriorating the performance of an identity verification system? To solve this problem, we present a novel framework that applies random projections to biometric data (inherence factor), using secure keys derived from passwords (knowledge factor), to generate inherently secure, efficient and revocable/renewable biometric templates for users ’ ver-ification. We evaluate the security strength of the framework against possible attacks by adversaries. We also undertake {{a case study of}} deploying the proposed framework in a two-factor authentication setup that uses users ’ passwords and dynamic handwrit-ten signatures. Our system preserves the important biometric information even when the user specific password is compromised – a highly desirable feature but not existent in the state-of-the-art transformation techniques. We have evaluated the performance of the framework on three publicly available signatures datasets. The results prove that the proposed framework does not under-mine the discriminating features of genuine and forged signatures and the verification performance is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art benchmark results...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{performs}} {{an investigation}} into issues concerning the broad area ofIdentity and Access Management, {{with a focus on}} open environments. Through literature research the issues of privacy, anonymity and access control are identified. The issue of privacy is an inherent problem {{due to the nature of}} the digital network environment. Information can be duplicated and modified regardless of the wishes and intentions ofthe owner of that information unless proper measures are taken to secure the environment. Once information is published or divulged on the network, there is very little way of controlling the subsequent usage of that information. To address this issue a model for privacy is presented that follows the user centric paradigm of meta-identity. The lack of anonymity, where security measures can be thwarted through the observation of the environment, is a concern for users and systems. By an attacker observing the communication channel and monitoring the interactions between users and systems over a long enough period of time, it is possible to infer knowledge about the users and systems. This knowledge is used to build an identity profile of potential victims to be used in subsequent attacks. To address the problem, mechanisms for providing an acceptable level of anonymity while maintaining adequate accountability (from a legal standpoint) are explored. In terms of access control, the inherent weakness of <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> mechanisms is discussed. The typical mechanism is the user-name and password pair, which provides a single point of failure. By increasing the factors used in authentication, the amount of work required to compromise the system increases non-linearly. Within an open network, several aspects hinder wide scale adoption and use of multi-factor authentication schemes, such as token management and the impact on usability. The framework is developed from a Utopian point of view, with the aim of being applicable to many situations as opposed to a single specific domain. The framework incorporates multi-factor authentication over multiple paths using mobile phones and GSM networks, and explores the usefulness of such an approach. The models are in tum analysed, providing a discussion into the assumptions made and the problems faced by each model. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{authentication}} mechanism is a security service that establishes {{the difference between}} authorised and unauthorised users. When used as part of certain website processes such as online banking, it provides users with greater safety and protection against service attacks and intruders. For an e-banking website to be considered effective, it should provide a usable and secure {{authentication mechanism}}. Despite existing research on usability and security domains, {{there is a lack}} of research on synthesising the contributions of usable security and evaluating multifactor authentication methods. Without understanding the usability and security of authentication mechanisms, the authenticating process is likely to become cumbersome and insecure. This negatively affects a goal of the authentication process, convenience for the user. This thesis sought to investigate the usability and security of multifactor authentication and filled an important gap in the development of authenticating processes. It concentrated on users’ perspectives, which are crucial for the deployment of an authenticating process. To achieve the thesis goal, a systematic series of three studies has been conducted. First, an exploratory study was used to investigate the current state of the art of using multifactor authentication and to evaluate the usability and security of these methods. The study involved a survey of 614 e-banking users, who were selected because they were likely long-term users of online banking and they had two different bank accounts, a Saudi account and a foreign account (most foreign accounts were British). The study indicated that multifactor authentication has been widely adopted in e-banking in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom, with high levels of security and trustworthiness as compared to <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> <b>authentication.</b> The second study was a descriptive study of the most common authentication methods. This study aimed to learn more about commonly used methods that were identified in the previous study and sought to propose an appropriate combination of authentication methods to be evaluated in the third study. The third study was an experimental study with 100 users to evaluate the usable security of three different multifactor authentication methods: finger print, secure device and card reader. A web based system was designed specifically for this study to simulate an original UK e-banking website. One of the main contribution of this study was that the system allowed users to choose their preferred authentication method. Moreover, the study contributed to the field of usable security by proposing security evaluation criteria based on users’ awareness of security warnings. The key result obtained indicated that fingerprinting was the most usable and secure method. Additionally, the users’ level of understanding security warnings was very low, as shown by their reaction to the security indicators presented during the experiment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There {{are several}} systems {{for dealing with}} two way mobile {{authentication}} which may differ in delivering the password to the authorized user or a different entity based on the security constraints. One of the disadvantage of the one <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> systems is {{the ease with which}} they can be cracked. This threat has increased over time as new and modern methods can be used for guessing and cracking authentication systems. The need for better and more secure systems has given rise to the concept of the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> system. In system mentioned here, two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> for android client is provided. Android client is accessing different resources such as users files in a network. One factor is username and password which user gets when they become user of active directory and the second factor is OTP which is generated at client side and encrypted using RSA algorithm and at server side it is decrypted using same algorithm. OAuth is used to authorize the android client and providing it limited access in network. Client gets access token and only by using that client can access user’s resources...|$|R

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} use of internet around the world has without doubt increased the usage of internet based services, e-business models, easier ways of communication and information sharing. Such drastic increase in usage of network based systems has made the current cyber security systems old dated as the hackers and attackers of networked systems {{is on the rise}} with new and modern attack methodologies. This has necessitated the need of more secure ways of communications. The issues of Confidentiality, Integrity and the Availability of systems are of prime importance and more research towards these issues has been called for around the world. One of the major areas of security improvement {{is the way in which}} authentication of users is carried out. Even though many organizations still rely on static ID and password authentication system, this method is getting old and there is a requirement for a better way of authentication which is required. One of the solutions for this issue is the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> technique as a fundamental security function. Our thesis proposal explores the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> technique and implementation issues which can be used for the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> technique. Two-factor authentication method is implemented in two main phases. In the first phase, the authenticator gets a request generated by the application to authenticate a specified user. When the request is received, it generates a one-time password and sends it through a SMS to a GSM cell phone registered for that specified user. The one-time password has a default timeout 5 minutes which is configurable. In the second phase of the authentication, a request is sent with the user id and a hash of the one-time password. If both the one-time and user specified password is valid then the user will be authenticated.

Customers can access their banking accounts from anywhere in the world using their login ID and password. However, the use of password does not provide adequate protection against Internet fraud such as phishing. Phishing exploits this vulnerability to fraudulently acquire sensitive personal information, such as username, passwords and/or credit card details. Usually this is achieved by masquerading as a trustworthy person or business with an apparently legitimate request for information.

40|$|Nowadays, web {{authentication}} is {{the main}} and important measure which guarantees the information security and data privacy. Web authentication provides the basis of user accessibility and data security. In the last few years, frequent outbreaks in the password databases lead to a main concern in the data security. The default method for the web authentication is password only mechanism. There are many security {{problems associated with the}} password only approach. Many users have a tendency to reuse the same password in different websites. So when one password is being compromised, it may lead to the password break of the other websites due to the password reuse. In order to improve the security, Two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> (TFA) is strongly recommended. But despite of this, TFA has not been widely accepted in the web authentication mechanism. Due to the high scale and drastic popularity of the mobile phone and an inbuilt function of the barcode scanning through camera lead to a new two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> method. In this paper, the proposed two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> protocol uses mobile phone with one or more camera as the second <b>factor</b> for the <b>authentication.</b> The proposed TFA in web authentication counter various attacks such as man in the middle attack (MITM), phishing attacks and so on. Here password is the first factor and mobile is used as the second factor for the web authentication. The communication between the mobile phone and the PC is with the help of visible light. Visible light communication has many advantages as compared with other communication mechanisms.
