500|$|The Court {{stated in}} United States v. Matlock (1974) {{that a third}} party co-occupant could give consent for a search without violating a suspect's Fourth Amendment rights. However, in Georgia v. Randolph (2006), the Supreme Court ruled that when two co-occupants are both present, one consenting and the other rejecting the search of a <b>shared</b> <b>{{residence}},</b> the police may not make a search of that residence within the consent exception to the warrant requirement. Per the Court's ruling in Illinois v. Rodriguez (1990), a consent search is still considered valid if police accept in good faith the consent of an [...] "apparent authority", even if that party is later discovered to not have authority over the property in question. A telling case on this subject is Stoner v. California, in which the Court held that police officers could not rely in good faith upon the apparent authority of a hotel clerk to consent to the search of a guest's room.|$|E

5000|$|This was the {{approach}} in D v D (<b>Shared</b> <b>Residence</b> Order) (2001) 1 FLR 495 http://www.familieslink.co.uk/pages/law_ukcases_dvd.htm, {{in which it}} was held that residence of the children involved could be shared, even when one of the parents was hostile to the idea. The principle was clearly stated: {{it is not necessary to}} show that exceptional circumstances exist before a <b>shared</b> <b>residence</b> order may be granted. Nor is it probably necessary to show a positive benefit to the child. What is required is to demonstrate that the order is in the interest of the child in accordance with the requirements of s1 Children Act 1989 which makes the interests of the children the first and paramount concern of the Courts in any litigation. In the case of very young children, there is an informal rebuttable presumption in disputed cases that a very young child's interests are more likely to be served by having a single 'base' with one parent, regardless of how the other has performed. This may be rebutted by evidence to demonstrate that the child's interests will be better served by <b>shared</b> <b>residence,</b> or by sole residence with one spouse or with other significant persons.
