The balance of power was held by 13 mostly conservative independents. Many had gained from discontent over Butler's relatively liberal social stances, so Playford sought to assuage them by having his LCL colleagues refrain from upsetting <b>social</b> <b>conservatives.</b> He also used the threat of an early election to deter the independents from stalling his initiatives—with their lack of party infrastructure and funding, {{they would be the}} most vulnerable to election campaigns.|$|E
