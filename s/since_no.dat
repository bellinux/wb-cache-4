5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, <b>since</b> <b>no</b> enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.|$|E

5|$|Following {{rumors of}} a planned assault on Nova Scotia, a small British fleet {{carrying}} 1,000 men attempted to take Machias at the Battle of Machias (1777). The battle took place on August 13, 1777, and continued until August 14, 1777. The locals were able to successfully fight off the British forces {{with the help of}} Indian allies. The rumors of the assault on Nova Scotia ended up being only partly true <b>since</b> <b>no</b> significant military planning had taken place.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings were {{described}} as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, <b>since</b> <b>no</b> skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to just below the ears.|$|E
5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, <b>since</b> <b>no</b> successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E

5|$|Since {{there is}} no MRT station near Pathlight School and only bus pass by the school, one can take 45, 55, 261 and CT8 to both campuses, except that the Townsville Primary School Stop does not serve CT8. 55 is {{accessed}} to Bishan MRT Station while 261 is accessed to Ang Mo Kio MRT Station. <b>Since</b> <b>no</b> bus entered to Ang Mo Kio Street 44 for Campus 2, they have to walk.|$|E

5|$|Twin {{depth charge}} tunnels were {{built into the}} rear hull of the Mogador-class ships. Each tunnel housed eight Guirard depth charges, with another sixteen stowed in the rear magazine.

5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known {{today as the}} Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would have {{incorporated}} a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, <b>since</b> <b>no</b> copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of shark fins. They were in bundles on the deck, the shipping container and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor {{was so strong that}} the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through his mouth since it burned his nose. <b>Since</b> <b>no</b> corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a stateless person was lawful. The case concerned Ahmed Al-Kateb, a Palestinian man born in Kuwait, who moved to Australia in 2000 and applied for a temporary protection visa. The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, <b>since</b> <b>no</b> country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of mandatory detention.|$|E
5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. <b>Since</b> <b>no</b> state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E

Pipe Dream met with poor reviews, and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale.

5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him <b>since</b> <b>no</b> signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be <b>since</b> <b>no</b> funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
