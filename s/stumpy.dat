5|$|Successive World Cup tournaments have {{generated}} increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket {{has become more}} established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa {{was the first to}} sport a mascot, Dazzler the zebra. An orange mongoose known as Mello was the mascot for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. <b>Stumpy,</b> a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with <b>stumpy</b> forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, New South Wales {{cattle farmer}} Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The {{resulting}} dogs {{were known as}} Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates. They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian <b>Stumpy</b> Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski, who wrote the first standard for the breed, was influential in its development.|$|E
5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were {{much smaller than the}} hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a <b>stumpy</b> creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} Georgia netted Tech the Southern title. Several Tech players {{received}} postseason honors. Tackle Frank Speer, Center Peter Pund, and Halfbacks Warner Mizell and <b>Stumpy</b> Thomason were all selected All-Southern.|$|E

25|$|Tech's first {{touchdown}} {{came on a}} {{pass from}} Warner Mizell to quarterback Bob Durant. The second one came shortly after <b>Stumpy</b> Thomason returned an interception 57 yards to Georgia's 22-yard line. Thomason scored on a 13-yard end run.|$|E
25|$|Lice {{differ from}} other hematophagic ectoparasites such as fleas in {{spending}} their entire lifecycle on a host. Head lice cannot fly, and their short, <b>stumpy</b> legs render them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces.|$|E
25|$|As a young woman, she was introspective, shy, but clever with an {{intellectual}} bent. She disliked ceremony. Her physical appearance, like her personality, was rather peculiar. She had thick, curly blonde hair, but was short, <b>stumpy</b> and extremely plain.|$|E
60|$|<b>Stumpy's</b> visage fell. The basket {{could not}} serve him here, {{and the rate}} at which the soup was being ladled out {{convinced}} him that if he were to return for a jug there would not be much left for him.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the reader may be aware that I thought John <b>Stumpy's</b> secrets important. Such was a fact. Try as hard as I was able, I could not but imagine that they {{concerned}} {{my father and his}} alleged downfall.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1970s, {{the movie}} itself {{fell into the}} public domain, {{occasionally}} airing on television {{to a new generation}} of viewers. Renewed interest in some of the actors helped those players that might have been considered down-and-out, most notably Stump and <b>Stumpy's</b> Jimmy Cross and Harold Cromer.|$|R
25|$|The Oglethorpe Stormy Petrels led the Tornado {{through three}} {{quarters}} 7–6, threatening to upset Tech {{just as it}} had last year. Oglethorpe scored on a <b>Stumpy</b> Thomason fumble. Tech managed to survive the scare by pulling ahead 19–7 in the final quarter. Warner Mizell saved the day with two touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stumpy,</b> a young elephant, was the {{official}} mascot for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He was unveiled at a function in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 2 April 2010, {{and his name}} was revealed on 2 August 2010 after an online competition conducted by the ICC {{in the last week}} of July.|$|E
25|$|Alabama had the upperhand in {{the first}} quarter, {{advancing}} the ball steadily to Tech's 14-yard line before being stopped on downs. The Jackets tipped the scale with a drive in the second quarter, highlighted by a 30-yard touchdown run by <b>Stumpy</b> Thomason. After a scoreless, see-sawing second half, the last touchdown was scored by Warner Mizell in the final minute.|$|E
60|$|Each {{fleeting}} moment {{increased the}} light on <b>Stumpy's</b> upturned nose, until it tipped the dimpled chin and cheeks and at last kissed his eyelids. This appeared to suggest pleasant dreams, for the boy smiled like a dirty-faced angel. He even gave vent to an imbecile laugh, and then awoke.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} I was {{staggered}} by John <b>Stumpy's</b> announcement. Was it possible {{he was telling}} the truth? If so, the chances of recovering the Widow Canby's money would assume a different shape. To arrest him would prove a moral satisfaction, but it would not restore the stolen dollars.|$|R
50|$|The Scots Dumpy is a {{breed of}} chicken from Scotland. The moniker dumpy, meaning short and stout, {{refers to the}} breed's thick-set {{appearance}} and extremely short legs. Through history they have been known under a host of names such as: Bakies, <b>Stumpies,</b> Dadlies, Hoodies, or Creepies. They are classed as an endangered breed by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.|$|R

Warner Mizell ran off tackle for 50 yards for the first, and had a 1-yard run for the second.|$|E
25|$|The Clyde puffer {{is a type}} {{of small}} {{coal-fired}} and single-masted cargo ship built mainly on the Forth and Clyde canal and which provided a vital supply link around the west coast and Hebrides islands of Scotland. Built between 1856 and 1939, these <b>stumpy</b> little steamboats achieved an almost mythical status thanks largely to the short stories Neil Munro wrote about the Vital Spark and her captain Para Handy, which produced three television series.|$|E
25|$|Among {{terrestrial}} invertebrates {{there are}} a number of leg forms. The arthropod legs are jointed and supported by hard external armor, with the muscles attached to the internal surface of this exoskeleton. The other group of legged terrestrial invertebrates, the velvet worms, have soft <b>stumpy</b> legs supported by a hydrostatic skeleton. The prolegs that some caterpillars have in addition to their six more-standard arthropod legs have a similar form to those of velvet worms, and suggest a distant shared ancestry.|$|E
60|$|<b>Stumpy's</b> {{eyes were}} huge and blue. The opening {{of them was}} like the {{revealing}} of unfathomable sky through clouds of roseate hue! They sparkled with a light all their own {{in addition to that}} of the sun, for there was in them a gleam of mischief as their owner poked his companion in the ribs and then tugged his hair.|$|R
5000|$|O'Heir {{first became}} active in Chicago theater and improv {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s {{as part of the}} comedic theater troupe [...] "White Noise", and {{appeared}} in such plays as The Book of Blanche, <b>Stumpy's</b> Gang and Ad-Nauseam with the group. O'Heir has appeared in several films and made guest appearances on such shows as Friends, Boston Legal, Malcolm in the Middle, Star Trek: Voyager, 3rd Rock from the Sun, ER, and Parenthood.|$|R
50|$|James 'Jimmy' Cross and Edward 'Eddie' Hartman, {{traveled}} around the United States on what was often called the 'Black Vaudeville' circuit, under management of Nat Nazarro. In 1943, Cross was cast in the United States Army's This Is the Army film, with William Wycoff as his 'partner'. Stump and <b>Stumpy's</b> first big success was appearing in the movie Boarding House Blues (1948), after which Hartman had become unreliable as a performer, and was replaced with Cromer.|$|R
25|$|Cats That Look Like Hitler is a satirical website {{featuring}} {{photographs of}} cats that bear an alleged resemblance to Adolf Hitler. Most of the cats {{have a large}} black splotch underneath their nose, much like the dictator's <b>stumpy</b> toothbrush moustache. The site was founded by Koos Plegt and Paul Neve in 2006, and became widely known after being featured on several television programmes across Europe and Australia. The site is now only run by Neve. As of February 2013, the site contained photographs of over 8,000 cats, submitted by owners with digital cameras and internet access and then approved by Neve as content.|$|E
25|$|The barge Lady of the Lea {{was built}} of wood in Rotherhithe in 1931 by boat-builders Hyam & Oliver (who {{operated}} {{well into the}} 1960s) for the War Department, following the original plans of canal barges from a century earlier. She was built small enough to pass under the low bridges of the River Lea and Bow Creek in London and was originally tiller steered and <b>stumpy</b> rigged, without top mast or topsail. The bottom was built of pine (doubled up) and the sides of oak and elm with copper fastenings and brass knees. Unusually, the sails were white and not the normal russet colour (of other Thames barges). Her original tonnage and dimensions are not known.|$|E
25|$|Goldsmith's {{cross is}} located in the Fox Tor Mire area between Childe's Tomb and Nun's Cross, on the Monks' Path. It was named for Lieutenant M. Lennon Goldsmith who {{discovered}} the socket, head and lower part of the shaft in 1903, making it the last major discovery of a cross on the moor. He reported his find to William Crossing whose detailed book on the crosses of Dartmoor had just been published. Crossing was unwilling to believe in its existence, so Goldsmith re-erected it with the help of four sailors from his ship. He passed the details to Crossing who conceded and included it in the 1910 edition of his Guide to Dartmoor. The cross is short and <b>stumpy</b> because {{the upper part of the}} shaft was never found.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1990, O'Heir {{appeared}} in White Noise's <b>Stumpy's</b> Gang, a one-act black comedy play by Patrick Cannon. The show played at Stage Left and Strawdog Theatres in Chicago, where it developed a cult following. O'Heir played Frank Bubman, the janitor for a genetics laboratory {{whose job is}} to destroy the unsuccessful experiments, which are portrayed by puppets. Frank secretly uses the experiments to stage private shows reminiscent of early television programs. Mary Shen Barnidge of the Chicago Reader said of his performance, [...] "The grotesquely sexy Jim O'Heir adds a new dimension {{to the role of the}} enfant terrible with his uninhibited and enthusiastic portrayal of Frank, who will break your heart even as he turns your stomach." [...] Ernest Tucker of the Chicago Sun-Times described O'Heir's performance as very funny and [...] "unforgettable", and said he [...] "held together this funny yet sick apocalyptic fantasy". <b>Stumpy's</b> Gang closed in the fall of 1991. Also with White Noise, O'Heir {{appeared in}} the play Ad-Nauseam, about a pair of writers who create an ad campaign about a character named Rim Shot, played by O'Heir. Rim Shot, dressed as a gladiator costume made up of bristle brushes and toilet detritus.|$|R
5000|$|... 1863, 1864 and 1865 saw {{the first}} Thames Barge Races. These {{continued}} unbroken until 1938. The aim of the founder William Henry Dodd, [...] "The Golden Dustman", was to raise {{the status of the}} bargemen, and to improve the performance of the barges. There were two classes, one for <b>stumpies</b> (under 80 tons) and one for heavier (under 100 tons) topsail barges. These were fiercely competitive - and soon new barges were being built, using the improved techniques learnt, to win the next years race. The Medway races started in 1880.|$|R
5000|$|Bob's two sidekicks are [...] "Stumpy" [...] (a talking tree stump) and [...] "Freddie the Flying Fetus" [...] (self-explanatory). While <b>Stumpy's</b> {{appearance}} and demeanour epitomise existential ennui, Freddie [...] - [...] as befits his tender years [...] - [...] {{is a vital}} and innocent spirit, insuppressibly enthusiastic and trusting; the pair provide two different counterpoints to the single-minded irascibility of the protagonist.Other recurring minor characters include robots (and their natural enemies, bears), ninjas, Daleks (from Doctor Who) and various evil masterminds. Dick Cheney, Kofi Annan, and other world leaders have also appeared as characters on occasion.|$|R
