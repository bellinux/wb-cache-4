A <b>pump</b> with a calibrated flow rate in ml/min is normally placed on a worker’s belt and it draws a known volume of air through the sorbent tube.

5000|$|A {{nephelometer}} [...] is {{an instrument}} for measuring concentration of suspended particulates in a liquid or gas colloid. A nephelometer measures suspended particulates by employing a light beam (source beam) and a light detector set to one side (often 90°) of the source beam. Particle density is then {{a function of the}} light reflected into the detector from the particles. To some extent, how much light reflects for a given density of particles is dependent upon properties of the particles such as their shape, color, and reflectivity. Nephelometers are calibrated to a known particulate, then use environmental factors (k-factors) to compensate lighter or darker colored dusts accordingly. K-factor is determined by the user by running the nephelometer next to an air <b>sampling</b> <b>pump</b> and comparing results. There is a wide variety of research-grade nephelometers on the market as well as open source varieties.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to characterize pulsations {{generated by}} personal <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps</b> relative to a nominal flow rate at the inlet of different respirable cyclones. Experiments were conducted using a factorial combination of 13 widely used <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps</b> (11 medium and 2 high volumetric flow rate pumps having a diaphragm mechanism) and 7 cyclones [10 -mm nylon also known as Dorr-Oliver (DO), Higgins-Dewell (HD), GS- 1, GS- 3, Aluminum, GK 2. 69, and FSP- 10]. A hot-wire anemometer probe cemented to the inlet of each cyclone type was used to obtain pulsation readings. The three medium flow rate pump models showing the highest, a midrange, and the lowest pulsations and two high flow rate pump models for each cyclone type were tested with dust-loaded filters (0. 05, 0. 21, and 1. 25 mg) to determine the effects of filter loading on pulsations. The effects of different tubing materials and lengths on pulsations were also investigated. The fundamental frequency range was 22 - 110 Hz and the magnitude of pulsation as a proportion of the mean flow rate ranged from 4. 4 to 73. 1...|$|R
50|$|IOM {{scientists}} {{have developed a}} strong interest in the assessment of dermal exposure, leading to the enumeration of new principles of exposure assessment, the development of predictive exposure models, and investigations into dermal exposure under specific working conditions. Estimating historical skin exposures of farmers dipping sheep in pesticide solutions for an epidemiological study proved particularly challenging, but this research demonstrated a strong association between concentrated organophosphate pesticides and neurological symptoms. As a consequence the UK government withdrew these pesticides from the market until safer handling systems were devised. In addition, new sampling instruments to measure dermal exposure to chemicals and new theoretical models to help understand how skin exposure may arise. These instruments and models may in the future help provide more reliable assessments of the risks from chemicals to the skin. IOM scientists are also developing a molded cassette with a 15mm inlet for use as a personal <b>sampling</b> <b>pump</b> to test inhalable dust levels.|$|E

50|$|Two {{types of}} {{chemically}} absorbent tubes {{are used to}} sample {{for a wide range}} of chemical substances. Traditionally a chemical absorbent 'tube' (a glass or stainless steel tube of between 2 and 10 mm internal diameter) filled with very fine absorbent silica (hydrophilic) or carbon, such as coconut charcoal (lypophylic), is used in a sampling line where air is drawn through the absorbent material for between four hours (minimum workplace sample) to 24 hours (environmental sample) period. The hydrophilic material readily absorbs water-soluble chemical and the lypophylic material absorbs non water-soluble materials. The absorbent material is then chemically or physically extracted and measurements performed using various gas chromatograph or mass spectrometry methods. These absorbent tube methods have the advantage of being usable {{for a wide range of}} potential contaminates. However, they are relatively expensive methods, are time consuming and require significant expertise in sampling and chemical analysis. A frequent complaint of workers is in having to wear the <b>sampling</b> <b>pump</b> (up to 1 kg) for several days of work to provide adequate data for the required statistical certainty determination of the exposure.|$|E
