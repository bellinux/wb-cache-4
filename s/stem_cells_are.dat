40|$|Objective To {{establish}} a procedure for culturing amniotic fluid-derived multipotential <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro,and study their biological characteristics and differentiation potency. Methods Amniotic fluid-derived <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> isolated from second-trimester amniotic fluid by adherence. The phenotypes of amniotic fluid-derived <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> detected by flow cytometry. The amniotic fluid-derived <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> induced to differentiate into osteoblasts,adipocytes and neurocytes by specific culture medium. Results The <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> successfully isolated from 8 of 10 second-trimester amniotic fluid samples. The amniotic fluid-derived <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> spindle {{in shape and}} proliferated rapidly. Primary cultured cells grew slowly,and then the growth became rapid following passaging. The chromosome karyotype of the 20 th passage was normal,remaining to be 46,XX or 46,XY. These cells shared immunophenotype of both multipotential <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> and embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> markers,as they <b>were</b> positive for Oct- 4,SSEA- 4,CD 29,CD 44,CD 105 and CD 117 expressions,and negative for CD 45 and CD 133 expressions. Amniotic fluid-derived <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> could differentiate into osteoblast,adipocyte and neurocyte in vitro by specific culture medium. Conclusions The <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from second-trimester amniotic fluid have a great potential of proliferation,they may express both embryonic and multipotential <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> markers,and they <b>are</b> in accordance with that of multipotential <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Amniotic fluid-derived <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{have the ability to}} differentiate into osteoblast,adipocyte and neurocyte in suitable condition...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{validate}} fluorescent quantum dots QD as a cell marker for tracking human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo, using a pre-clinical model of acute myocardium infarction. Methods: Human umbilical cord mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> isolated and expanded in vitro. Mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> labeled with QD 655. Myocardium infarction induction in pigs was performed by occluding the left descending coronary artery for 60 minutes, with a balloon catheter. One day after the myocardium infarction, intracoronary injection of mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>was</b> performed. One week after cell transplantation, the animals were killed; their hearts were removed and underwent histological examination Rresults: All the mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> labeled with QD 655. The labeling process did not affect viability, proliferation, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential of the <b>cells.</b> Labeled mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> easily tracked in the histological sections of the infarcted area. <b>Cells</b> <b>were</b> observed with a frequency of two per section, while no <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> observed in the remote myocardium.

40|$|International audienceTransplanted mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> migrate toward brain lesions and {{differentiate}} into neurons, glial <b>cells,</b> and neural <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in diseased {{or injured}} animal models. The migratory routes and differentiation patterns of mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in normal rats are, however, unknown. Here, labelled human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (or saline) <b>were</b> transplanted into the striatum of adult rats to observe their migration and differentiation. METHODS:Labelled human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> transplanted {{into the right}} striatum of adults rats (n = 24). Brain sections were examined for migratory routes of labelled human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> by immunohistochemistry method, fluorescence microscope and laser scanning confocal microscopy observation, and Prussian blue staining. Moreover, the differentiation of human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>was</b> detected by double immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:After 3 days, most human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> resided around the injection sites. Human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> found in or around the corpus callosum and the subependymal layer after 7 days. A great number of human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> detected throughout the brain on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides after 14 days.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{isolated}} from amniotic fluid are a promising source for autologous perinatal cell therapy. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop a routine isolation, selection and expansion protocol of clonal <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> lines from redundant clinical amniocentesis samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Amniotic fluids were collected between 15 - 22 [*]weeks of gestation and <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> isolated by CD 117 based and mechanical selection protocols. <b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> characterized by mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> marker expression and differentiation protocols. <b>Cells</b> <b>were</b> manipulated with a lentiviral vector system expressing the Î²-galactosidase reporter gene and were injected into immunodeficient newborn mouse pups. Qualitative assessment was performed to detect the infused cells after 1 [*]week. RESULTS: 78 Clonal amniotic fluid <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations <b>were</b> successfully isolated by mechanical selection from 21 consecutive amniocentesis samples. They were positive for mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> CD markers and could be differentiated into the different lineages. <b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> stably labeled using Î²-galactosidase and were detected in the lungs and hearts of the neonatal mice. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can <b>be</b> routinely isolated and clonally expanded from mid-gestation human amniotic fluid using mechanical isolation.
