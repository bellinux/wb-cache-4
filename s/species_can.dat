5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is {{the only}} species of Hemilepistus to have {{developed}} parental care of its offspring, {{and it is only}} because of this development that the <b>species</b> <b>can</b> survive in the desert. It is monogamous, and, unusually, both parents tend the young.|$|E

50|$|The upward {{shift of}} species caused by climate change also holds the {{potential}} to cause both mountaintop extinction and lowland biotic attrition. This is because the lowland tropics lack <b>species</b> that <b>can</b> cope with increasing temperatures. An overall loss of <b>species</b> richness <b>can</b> occur due to there being fewer migratory species to replace lost ones.|$|R
5|$|Ticks are parasitic, {{and some}} {{transmit}} micro-organisms and parasites {{that can cause}} diseases in humans, while the saliva of a few <b>species</b> <b>can</b> directly cause tick paralysis {{if they are not}} removed within a day or two.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the mineral {{contents}} of various edible mushrooms found that C.micaceus contained the highest concentration of potassium in the 34species tested, close to half a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom. Because the <b>species</b> <b>can</b> bioaccumulate detrimental heavy metals like lead and cadmium, it has been advised to restrict consumption of specimens collected from roadsides or other collection sites that may be exposed to or contain pollutants.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major <b>species</b> <b>can</b> {{be divided into two}} distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E

500|$|Inocybe praetervisa is an ectomycorrhizal <b>species,</b> and <b>can</b> {{be found}} on the ground in mixed, {{deciduous}} or even coniferous woodland. It typically favours beech. Mushrooms grow solitarily or in [...] "trooping groups" [...] in late summer and throughout autumn, though it is not commonly encountered <b>species.</b> It <b>can</b> be found in Europe, Asia and North America.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the venom}} {{of a few}} spider and {{scorpion}} <b>species</b> <b>can</b> be very dangerous to humans, medical researchers are investigating {{the use of these}} venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test for the presence of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria <b>species</b> <b>can</b> produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E
5|$|At {{low tide}} {{extensive}} areas of mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and over-wintering grounds for waders (shorebirds). Invertebrate fauna including six nationally rare species and eighteen nationally scarce <b>species</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in}} the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve, and is managed by Natural England. Some of the potential risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E

5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle emits a pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The <b>species</b> <b>can</b> stridulate to communicate.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{calls and}} songs, which are {{produced}} in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. This communication can be very complex; some <b>species</b> <b>can</b> operate {{the two sides of}} the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>species</b> <b>can</b> be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the lesser striped swallow has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|E

5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling <b>species</b> <b>can</b> run and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The <b>species</b> <b>can</b> occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E
5|$|Forty-two {{species of}} birds have been {{observed}} on the site, 25 of which are breeding there. Twenty-two species are protected nationally; five are listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention, which aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range. However, no <b>species</b> <b>can</b> be considered as heritage. The northern goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding. The common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers exemplify a {{range of}} anti-predator adaptations, {{enabling}} them to avoid detection, to escape if detected, {{and in some cases}} to avoid being eaten if captured. Grasshoppers are often camouflaged to avoid detection by predators that hunt by sight; some <b>species</b> <b>can</b> change their coloration to suit their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum cultivars and <b>species</b> <b>can</b> {{be grown}} inside in pots or outside in warmer climates (Hardiness 7B-11).

5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several {{nightjar}} <b>species</b> <b>can</b> slow their {{metabolism and}} go into torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks. The European nightjar has been observed in captivity {{to be able to}} maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown.|$|E
