5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E

Flowers have been engineered to display colours that they cannot do <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> (in particular the blue color in roses). A few crops, like the genetically modified papaya, are engineered to resist viruses. Other modifications alter the plants composition, with the aim of making it more nutritious, longer lasting or more industrially useful.

Critic Kirk Honeycutt referred to Connelly as [...] "a bland and minimally talented young actress" [...] Writing for The Miami News, Jon Marlowe stated, [...] "Connelly {{is simply the}} wrong person for the right job. She has a squeaky voice that begins to grate on you; when she cries, {{you can see the}} onions in her eyes."

500|$|Whether or {{not such}} {{language}} {{is an accurate}} reflection of the vernacular of blacks in Mississippi at the time, the effect of its usage has offended some critics, who see it as perpetuating racial stereotypes. The character Queenie (who sings the above verses) in the original production was played not by an African American but by the Italian-American actress Tess Gardella in blackface (Gardella was {{perhaps best known for}} portraying Aunt Jemima in blackface). Attempts by non-black writers to imitate black language stereotypically in songs like [...] "Ol' Man River" [...] was alleged to be offensive, a claim that was repeated eight years later by critics of Porgy and Bess. But such critics sometimes acknowledged that Hammerstein's intentions were noble, since [...] "Ol' Man River"' was the song in which he first found his lyrical voice, compressing the suffering, resignation, and anger of an entire race into 24 taut lines and doing it <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> that it's no wonder folks assume the song's a Negro spiritual." ...|$|E

[...] In Semigran's view, [...] "From the cute choreographed claps to the unconventional (but oddly fitting) choice to have Tina and Mercedes sing the tune, I wish they'd save this one for regionals. It was a winner", while VanDerWerff wrote, [...] " [...] 'Dog Days Are Over' is right in this show's wheelhouse, <b>so,</b> <b>naturally,</b> it hits the song out of the park."

500|$|Several {{reviews of}} 2011's A Dance with Dragons noted {{the return to}} the {{narrative}} of Jon, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister, the three popular characters whom fans had missed most from the previous volume, A Feast for Crows. These [...] "favorites" [...] had last been featured 11 years before in Martin's A Storm of Swords. In A Dance with Dragons, Jon's leadership of the Night's Watch is complicated by several unprecedented challenges, including a wildling alliance, the demands of would-be-king Stannis Baratheon and the conflicting factions developing within the Watch itself. The New York Times notes that [...] "Jon’s leadership is the best hope of Westeros, <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> he’s in imminent danger throughout A Dance With Dragons." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Jon's final chapter in A Dance with Dragons [...] "a harsh chapter in terms of fan expectations.

He batted [...]264 with 63 hits, no home runs, and 24 RBI, failing to make the league's all-rookie team. In 1979, Ripken moved up to the Single-A Miami Orioles of the Florida State League. Shortly into the season, Miami manager Lance Nichols decided to move Ripken to third base, saying, [...] "Cal was having some problems at short, <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> I decided to shift him to third ... Third base was a perfect fit for Cal and our team." [...] On July 2, Ripken hit his first professional home run, a game-winner in the 12th inning against Gary Abone of the West Palm Beach Expos. Ripken batted [...]303, hit five home runs, led the league with 28 doubles, and had 54 RBI while playing in all 105 of Miami's games. He was named an All-Star after the season. His performance earned him a brief call-up to the Charlotte Orioles of the Double-A Southern League; Ripken batted [...]180 in a month with them, albeit with three home runs.|$|E
500|$|Lyricist {{and lead}} singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed {{commentary}} on the subject: when asked in 2008 if the members were [...] "a Christian band" [...] or [...] "Christians in a band", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, [...] "I'm {{not sure what the}} difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian." [...] Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated [...] "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh {{maintained}} his reputation in 1942, with Put Out More Flags, which sold well despite wartime restrictions {{on paper and}} printing. Its public reception, however, did not compare with that accorded to Brideshead Revisited three years later, {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic Ocean. Bridesheads selection as the American Book of the Month swelled its US sales to an extent that dwarfed those in Britain, which was affected by paper shortages. Despite the public's enthusiasm, critical opinion was split. Brideshead's Catholic standpoint offended some critics who had greeted Waugh's earlier novels with warm praise. Its perceived snobbery and its deference to the aristocracy were attacked by, among others, Conor Cruise O'Brien who, in the Irish literary magazine The Bell, wrote of Waugh's [...] "almost mystical veneration" [...] for the upper classes. Fellow writer Rose Macaulay believed that Waugh's genius had been adversely affected by the intrusion of his right-wing partisan alter ego and that he had lost his detachment: [...] "In art <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> ironic and detached as his, this is a serious loss". Conversely, the book was praised by Yorke, Graham Greene and, in glowing terms, by Harold Acton who was particularly impressed by its evocation of 1920s Oxford. In 1959, at the request of publishers Chapman and Hall and in some deference to his critics, Waugh revised the book and wrote in a preface: [...] "I have modified the grosser passages but not obliterated them because they are an essential part of the book".|$|E

500|$|... "Call My Name" [...] is a dance-pop song {{written in}} E major {{with a time}} {{signature}} in common time and a tempo of 125 beats per minute. The vocal range from the singer spans from C4 to C5. [...] "Call My Name" [...] borrows similarities to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love" [...] (2011) and Scissor Sisters' [...] "Only the Horses" [...] (2012), tracks that were also produced by Harris. Brogan Driscoll of The Huffington Post speculated that the [...] "dance anthem" [...] title, [...] "Call My Name", could be linked Cheryl's recent decision to drop her married name from her professional career. Sarah Deen of Metro stated that the track features a [...] "typical Calvin Harris beat and singalong chorus", the chorus of the song was considered a departure from Cheryl's previous works, namely [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] (2009) and [...] "Promise This" [...] (2010), while Marie Claire columnist Eleanor Young described [...] "Call My Name" [...] as a [...] "fast paced party track". When Peter Robinson of Popjustice compared the song to [...] "We Found Love" [...] during {{an interview with the}} singer, she responded, [...] "that's going to be natural because it's Calvin. They're both Calvin-produced songs. <b>So</b> <b>naturally</b> you're going to think that. But if you play them side by side they don't sound the same. Although you might naturally think that, because it's the same producer. It's not a bad thing."

500|$|Of the reviewers, Time rated it an A-minus and added, [...] "Burton and Depp infuse the {{brilliant}} cold steel of Stephen Sondheim's score with a burning passion. Helena Bonham Carter and a superb supporting cast bring focused fury to this musical nightmare. It's bloody great." [...] Times Richard Corliss named the film {{one of its}} top ten movies of 2007, placing it fifth. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it four stars out of four, lauding Burton's visual style. In his review in Variety, Todd McCarthy called it [...] "both sharp and fleet" [...] and [...] "a satisfying screen version of Stephen Sondheim's landmark 1979 theatrical musical ... things have turned out uniformly right thanks to highly focused direction by Tim Burton, expert screw-tightening by scenarist John Logan, and haunted and musically adept lead performances from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Assembled artistic combo assures the film will reap {{by far the biggest}} audience to see a pure Sondheim musical, although just how big depends on the upscale crowd’s tolerance for buckets of blood, {{and the degree to which}} the masses stay away due to the whiff of the highbrow." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-plus in its Movie Reviews section and stated, [...] "To stage a proper Sweeney Todd, necks must be slit, human flesh must be squished into pastries, and blood ought to spurt in fountains and rivers of death. Enter Tim Burton, who... has tenderly art-directed soup-thick, tomato-red, fake-gore blood with the zest of a Hollywood-funded Jackson Pollock." [...] She went on to refer to the piece as [...] "opulent, attentive... so finely minced a mixture of Sondheim's original melodrama and Burton's signature spicing that it's difficult to think of any other filmmaker <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> suited for the job." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1901, {{the newly}} created American League had {{attracted}} several of the top players in the competing National League to join its ranks. Rogers declined Lajoie's request {{for an increase in}} salary and as a result, Lajoie jumped to the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics, owned by former Phillies' part-owner Benjamin Shibe and managed by Connie Mack. Frank Hough offered Lajoie the contract on behalf of Mack. [...] "Hough offered me $24,000 ($ in current dollar terms) for four years. You can bet I signed in a hurry", Lajoie said. Lajoie was considered [...] "the first superstar" [...] to join the newly formed AL. He was also the first player whose yearly salary was for $4,000 ($ in current dollar terms). [...] "The Phillies opened their season and drew 6,000 fans. A week later, when we opened, there were 16,000 in the stands. The American League was here to stay", Lajoie later said. Lajoie's batting average that year was [...]426 (it was originally recorded at [...]405, later changed to [...]422 before finally revised again to [...]426). The batting average mark became the all-time AL record after the number was revised. Previously, Ty Cobb and George Sisler had been credited with having the AL's all-time mark. That same year in a game against the Chicago White Sox' Clark Griffith, Lajoie became the second Major Leaguer to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded in an 117 game after Abner Dalrymple in 1881. For the 1901 season, Lajoie led the majors in doubles (48), and led the majors in hits (232), batting average (.426), runs (145), on-base (.463) and slugging percentage (.643), and total bases (350). His 125 RBIs led the AL and his 14 home runs were a career-best and his 48 doubles are a Philadelphia Athletics' record. Mack said of Lajoie, [...] "He plays <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> and so easily it looks like lack of effort." [...] Author Robert Kelly writes: ...|$|E

500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came <b>so</b> <b>naturally</b> to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E
