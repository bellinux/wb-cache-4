5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Nerva lacked {{widespread}} {{support in the}} Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist, his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> initiative of the Senate, within hours after {{the news of the}} assassination broke. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy.|$|E

Adding to the volume of material are groups of international admirers who consider Waffen-SS to have been incorrectly judged by history.|$|E

Accordingly, a congiarium of 75 denarii per head was bestowed upon the citizens, while the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard received a donativum which may have amounted to as much as 5000 denarii per person. This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy Romans.|$|E
