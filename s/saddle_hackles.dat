5000|$|The Cream Legbar male has cream neck hackles {{which are}} sparsely barred. The <b>saddle</b> <b>hackles</b> are cream barred with dark grey and are tipped with cream. The back and {{shoulders}} are mostly cream barred with dark grey. The wings are dark grey and faintly barred, with the wing coverts grey barred and tipped with cream. The breast and tail are barred dark grey while the sickles are paler. The crest is cream and grey.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Lefty's Deceiver {{was tied}} with white <b>saddle</b> <b>hackles</b> tied in at the bend of a standard, short shank saltwater hook. Four to six hackles were used with tips curved to the outside. Flash was added {{on top of the}} hackles. The original body was silver tinsel. A collar of white buck tail was layered at the top, sides and bottom of the front of the hook. The buck tail extended just beyond the hook bend.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, striped bass {{populations in the}} Chesapeake Bay were healthy and Lefty Kreh pursued them {{on a regular basis}} along the lower Eastern shore of the bay. He and his fishing {{partners}} faced a rather common issue with the big streamer flies of the time—feathers fouling around the hook. <b>Saddle</b> <b>hackles</b> secured near the eye of the hook, as was the common practice of the time, had a tendency to twist and foul around the hook bend during retrieves. [...] Fouled flies rarely deceived the wily striped bass. Lefty’s goal as he put it was: [...] "I'm going to design a fly that won't foul on the cast! It will have a fish shape, but can be made in many lengths. You can vary the color combinations; it will also swim well but when lifted for the back cast it will be sleek and have little air-resistance." [...] The original Deceiver was all white and mimicked the prolific smelt that the Chesapeake Bay stripers foraged on.|$|E
25|$|Fly tying {{material}} {{can be anything}} used to construct a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and <b>saddle</b> <b>hackle,</b> so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer. Whereas lead wire was the traditional method of weighting flies, today's weighting materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead. Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.|$|R
50|$|Males of most chicken breeds {{distinguish}} {{from their}} females in having longer, sharp and more scalloped feathers in neck, <b>hackle,</b> <b>saddle</b> and wing bows. But in some breeds, like the fancy breeds Sebright and Campine and some game breeds like Pettai Madhirione can see males {{that have a}} plumage completely similar in all aspects to that of females. This unusual type of feathering called so much the interest of biologists that was studied from different points of view, and as a consequence, the inheritance of this condition has been well understood, while the biochemical basis determining this condition is still under study.|$|R
