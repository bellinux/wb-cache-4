40|$|Consideration {{is given}} to the problem of {{allotting}} GEO locations to communication satellites so as to maximize the smallest aggregate carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio calculated at any test point (assumed earth station). The location allotted to each satellite must be within the satellite's <b>service</b> <b>arc,</b> and angular separation constraints are enforced for each pair of satellites to control single-entry EMI. Solutions to this satellite system synthesis problem (SSSP) are found by embedding two heuristic procedures for the satellite location problem (SLP), in a binary search routine to find an estimate of the largest increment to the angular separation values that permits a feasible solution to SLP and SSSP. Numerical results for a 183 -satellite, 208 -beam example problem are presented...|$|E
40|$|With {{over forty}} {{satellites}} in geostationary orbit, {{and many more}} planned, {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult to find suitable orbit positions for new systems operating at 4 and 6 GHz. Efficient spectrum-orbit utilization can be achieved with frequency-reuse techniques - orthogonal polarization, earth-station antenna discrimination, and satellite antenna discrimination - provided that service-area geography is considered. <b>Service</b> <b>arc</b> - that portion of the orbit which affords useful service to all points in a given area - {{is a function of the}} area's climate, terrain, and location as well as its size and shape. Of the three techniques, satellite antenna discrimination is the most sensitive to these factors. According to the BSS (broadcasting-satellite service) antenna reference pattern, the maximum discrimination possible is the on-axis gain, which can be as high as 49 dB for a beamwidth of 0. 6 degrees, or as low as 32 dB for a 3. 5 -degree beamwidth. Unlike the Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS), the BSS will normally have beams that cover no more than one or two time zones...|$|E

A., ''Image based 3 D {{reconstruction}} and its application'', Proefschrift voorgedragen tot het behalen van het doctoraat in de ingenieurswetenschappen, KU Leuven, July 2013, Leuven, Belgium. The dissertation aims {{to advance the}} state-of-the-art in image based 3 D {{reconstruction and}} its applications. Emphasis will be made upon exploiting the information available in the inputimages as much as possible. Thus, one important aspect is the abilityto process images having different resolutions and different intrinsicsettings. This {{comes down to the}} development of new algorithms for structure-from-motion and dense reconstruction. Not only the geometric, but also the visual appearance of the resulting 3 D model is of importance. To that end, one aspect will be to refine the texturing of the models beyond the direct image-based texture mapping of single depth maps. In other words, the aim is to fuse textures form several images into one single texture atlas. Practical implementation includes upgrading VISICS automatic 3 D reconstruction web <b>service</b> (<b>ARC</b> 3 D) as well as creating applications for various fields, such as Space exploration, automatic landmark reconstruction and Cultural Heritage. nrpages: 144 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{generalization}} of the Directed Rural Postman Problem where not all arcs requiring a service {{have to be}} visited provided that a penalty cost is paid if a <b>service</b> <b>arc</b> is not crossed. The problem, known as Directed Profitable Rural Postman Problem, looks for a tour visiting the selected set of service arcs while minimizing both traveling and penalty costs. We add different valid inequalities to a known mathematical formulation {{of the problem and}} develop a branch-and-cut algorithm that introduces connectivity constraints both in a “lazy” and in a standard way. We also propose a matheuristic followed by an improvement heuristic (final refinement). The matheuristic exploits information provided by a problem relaxation to select promising service arcs used to solve optimally Directed Rural Postman problems. The ex-post refinement tries to improve the solution provided by the matheuristic using a branch-and-cut algorithm. The method gets a quick convergence through the introduction of connectivity cuts that are not guaranteed to be valid inequalities, and thus may exclude integer feasible solutions. All proposed methods have been tested on benchmark instances found in literature and compared to state of the art algorithms. Results show that heuristic methods are extremely effective outperforming existing algorithms. Moreover, our exact method is able to close, in less than one hour, all the 22 benchmark instances that have not been solved to optimality yet...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{computing}} {{has evolved}} considerably {{in the past}} years. Scientific applications became more complex and require {{an increasing number of}} computing resources to perform well on a large scale. Grid computing became widely used and is the chosen infrastructure for many scientific calculations and projects, although it demands a high learning curve. Computing and storage resources in grid are limited, heterogeneous and often overloaded. Heterogeneity is not present only in the hardware setups, but also in software composition, where configuration permissions are limited. This heterogeneity hardens the portability of scientific applications. Usage of cloud resources could eliminate those constraints. In cloud, resources are provisioned on demand and can scale up and down, scientists can easily customize their execution environments in the form of virtualization. The interest for grid and cloud integration is big, since the new infrastructure would enable a relatively simple migration of scientific applications from grid to cloud (or vice versa). The utilization of resources would be more efficient and it would provide scalability, sustainability and reliability of the hybrid infrastructure. In the IaaS domain, Advanced resource connector (ARC) middleware could have a role of distributed high throughput batch computing as a <b>service.</b> <b>ARC</b> has an ability to facilitate distributed computing across organizations. It is strongly committed to open standards and interoperability and in a good position to enable users and research communities to access new resources and new platforms using existing and well-established interfaces and standards. It could provide a way to seamlessly evolve its interfaces to enable existing users and communities {{to take full advantage of}} new resources and technologies as they become available. Some integration models exist, but usually only correspond to a specific use case. In this thesis we introduce a new model of grid and cloud integration which enables users to benefit from additional private and public cloud resources via ARC, with no modifications of the code, workload or execution scripts on their side, by setting up a virtual grid cluster on demand in automated way. The solution can be globally used, on all private and public clouds, it is scalable and corresponds to the cloud bursting paradigm...|$|E

40|$|Historically, utility {{customers}} have been differentiated into various customer classes, {{based on their}} utility service demand characteristics. In this paper we argue that greater differentiation, if based on value and cost of service, can be justified on grounds of economic efficiency, and if done properly can also promote economic equity. This would require a break with traditional customer classifications. With this break, more detailed information on how and why certain utility <b>services</b> <b>arc</b> consumed would be required.

The state sector has schedules for buses. and crews, but private sector buses are operated by individual operators and the permits are issued to only one selected route. As a result. the passenger transport services are difficult to manage due to the existing ownership structure. As a solution. the National Transport Commission recently introduced the formation or passenger bus companies. In this study, {{it is assumed that}} the buses are operated by well organized passenger transport companies. In order to provide reliable and comfortable service to the passengers, the passenger transport companies should consider two important factors buses and crews. These two factors should be scientifically designed in order to provide the best possible service to the passengers at the lowest possible cost. Time tabling is the process of determining how frequently buses must operate on routes based on passenger demand. Bus schedules are process of assigning buses to trips to ensure that the total cost is minimized. Scheduling is carried out by assuming that the start and end time as well as the start and end locations of all trips arc fixed. Crew scheduling is an important problem or a public transport company. since the crew cost arc mostly dominant.
