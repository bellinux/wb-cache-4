40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the analysis of the}} influence of Nitrate Directive on agricultural business. In an agricultural enterprise ?A? is analysed livestock manure and mineral fertilization in the years 2007 - 2010. The theoretical part describes Government Order 103 / 2003 on the designation of nitrate vulnerable zones and on the use and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and livestock manure, crop rotation, and the implementation of erosion control measures in these zones. The Nitrates Directive requires application of a general landspreading limit of 170 kg per hectare for nitrogen from livestock manure. The analytic part of the thesis contains characteristics of the enterprise A. In this part, the consumption of fertilizers applied on the arable land and on the grassland for each year are calculated including the fertilization costs.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a quantitative thermodynamic description of the NH 4 H 2 PO 4 -(NH 4) 2 H 2 P 2 O 7 -KH 2 PO 4 -K 2 H 2 P 2 O 7 -NH 4 NO 3 -KNO 3 -NH 4 Cl-KCl-H 2 O system, which is of great importance for fertilizers applications. The liquid phase and all solid solutions were modeled using the Modified Quasichemical Model for short-range ordering. The liquid model includes the reaction of dimerization of AH 2 PO 4 (where A = NH 4 + or K+) according to: 2 AH 2 PO 4 (liquid) ↔ A 2 H 2 P 2 O 7 (liquid) + H 2 O(liquid or gas). The model parameters are mainly obtained by the critical evaluation and optimization of available thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data for the lower-order subsystems. The model is then used to estimate the properties of multicomponent salts from these assessed parameters for the lower-order subsystems, using interpolation methods along with Gibbs energy minimization software. When {{used in conjunction with}} thermodynamic databases for solids, solid solutions, and gases, these databases permit the calculation of complex multiphase equilibria in multicomponent systems, using the FactSage thermochemical software. In particular, calculations of interest for the production and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertilizers</b> may be performed...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{activities}} are frequently associated with water contamination. The spreading and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> for instance, {{may result in}} groundwater contamination due to pollutants leaching into an aquifer. Nitrates and fecal bacteria are two important contaminants associated with agriculture. Thus, the development of efficient strategies for groundwater protection in agricultural areas requires an assessment of these two contaminants. Given this perspective, groundwater quality monitoring was carried out over the whole capture zone of a municipal well located in an agricultural area in the St. -Lawrence Lowlands in Québec. Thirty-eight piezometers were installed within the roughly 2 km 2 capture area of the well to measure physico-chemical parameters such as major ions, field measured parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, water level, temperature), and isotopic ratios, bacteriological parameters (Heterotrophic Plate Count [...] HPC, enterococci, total coliforms, Escherichia coli) and their variations in space and time. Groundwater was sampled from the pumping well and the piezometers during 25 field campaigns in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The results demonstrate the impact of agricultural activities on nitrate contamination. They indicate high spatial and temporal variations in nitrate concentrations, from 6 to 125 mgNO 3 -/L within the capture area, with 40 % of the samples exceeding the Québec drinking water limit of 45 mgNO 3 -/L. Nitrate pollution in the municipal well exceeded 45 mgNO 3 -/L during 2005, but no bacteriological contamination was observed. The results also show a high variability of nitrate concentration with depth within the capture zone. Electrical conductivity appears as a good indicator {{of the presence of}} nitrate and calcium ions in this capture zone. Correlations between nitrate, calcium and chloride suggest that these ions come from the same source of fertilizer. Nitrate isotopic composition suggests that nitrate in groundwater originates from both chemical and organic fertilizers. The bacteriological results show that the extracted volume of water during sampling of a piezometer has {{a significant impact on the}} bacteria count. The variability of bacteriological pollution is important in space and time, showing a higher contamination during summer. Only 2 % of the raw water samples exhibit contamination exceeding the drinking water standard for treated water. Total coliforms seem to be a good precursor of E. coli or enterococci contamination. Globally, the physico-chemical and bacteriological groundwater quality within the studied capture area and the pumping well shows contamination by nitrates, but low contamination levels by fecal bacteria.

40|$|International audienceMotivated by {{both the}} Toulouse explosion, {{and a series of}} recent {{unexpected}} handling and storage accidents in well-developed countries, the safety issues associated with the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> grades <b>of</b> ammonium nitrate (AN) are considered with a focus on low storage capacity premises. Such facilities are numerous and, in large agricultural countries, include thousands of end-users and hundreds of small distributors. The strong oxidative (sometimes explosive) properties of products containing significant amounts of AN have led to a long history of major accidents including mass explosions in large storage units and pre 1950 s, to mass explosions in ships. A major breakthrough in safety was achieved in the 1950 s, with the promotion - amongst other improvements - of better anti-caking agents. Although modem AN fertilizers complying with current standards are not considered as explosive material per se, the latent risk of accidental detonation under specific conditions remains a real issue, and from a scientific point of view, cannot be completely ruled out-as dramatically demonstrated by the Toulouse disaster in France. The new insight provided here is derived from: (1) a literature review on hazardous properties of AN and AN-based fertilizers; (2) a review of accidents focusing more particularly on the reporting of recent new cases involving relatively small quantities of previously 'thought safe' products; (3) an examination of both the relevant regulatory framework and the level of hazard control achieved; (4) appropriate discussions of the economical, technical and organizational factors that could lead to some underestimation of the risk compared to large scale storage facilities. In terms of research requirements, the complex potential scenario 'mass explosion following a fire' requires further attention, as does the role and properties of molten ammonium nitrate, which could be the precursor for such an event to occur. Beyond research needs, reinforced legislative control by the authorities and further promotion <b>of</b> safe <b>storage</b> practices must be encouraged by the industry for end-users particularly. Such users have inherently the highest potential for undesirable situations, due both to the nature of their activities and also a possible lack of awareness of the real danger...|$|R

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBrian C. BriggemanGarden City Co-op, Inc. is a farm {{cooperative}} in Southwest Kansas. It provides marketing and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> grain, <b>fertilizer,</b> crop protection products, seed, and petroleum to both member and non-member accounts. The cooperative also operates a transportation company called Western Transport. Western Transport provides transportation of anhydrous ammonia (NH 3), liquid fertilizer (32 - 0 - 0 or 10 - 34 - 0), diesel, gasoline, and propane utilizing semi-tractors and trailers to Garden City Co-op, Inc. {{as well as}} to other agribusinesses in the region. The purpose of this thesis is to integrate and optimize the supply chain strategies for the cooperative’s fertilizer and petroleum products as it relates to <b>storage</b> and transportation <b>of</b> those commodities. Utilizing the framework of an aggregate production plan, a model is constructed to minimize costs associated with inventory holding, net storage asset depreciation after tax savings, net transportation asset depreciation after tax savings, labor, operations, and freight. By varying the quantities <b>of</b> petroleum and <b>fertilizer</b> the cooperative purchases, sells, and stores each month over a one-year period, an optimum mix <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> and transportation assets is determined. Two different demand scenarios are evaluated that relate to demand during a drought year versus demand during a non-drought year. Also, different model scenarios include varying beginning period inventory and ending period inventory to stress transportation assets versus storage assets. The model is optimized using a genetic algorithm solver in the software program Evolver produced by Palisade Corporation. Results of the optimization provided two feasible strategies for the cooperative. By continuing services to non-member accounts, there was a greater investment placed on transportation. Investments included additional trucks, NH 3 trailers, petroleum trailers, and drivers. The strategy favored a just-in-time inventory approach versus inventory smoothing with storage. When discontinuing services to non-member accounts, investment between storage and transportation assets were relatively equal. The model favored a reduction in NH 3 trailers, liquid fertilizer trailers, trucks, and drivers. However, additional storage was necessary as well as petroleum trailers. The scenario favored an inventory smoothing approach across the model year...|$|R
