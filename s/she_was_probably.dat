5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Suwo {{served as}} the {{flagship}} for the Japanese squadron during the Battle of Tsingtao from 27 August to 7 November 1914. The ship served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915–16 before becoming a gunnery training ship {{for the rest of}} the war. In April 1922, in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty, Suwo was disarmed at the Kure Naval Arsenal. While her armor was being removed, the ship capsized on 13 July. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> scrapped in 1922–23, but at least one source suggests she was refloated and hulked, serving until being broken up at Kure in 1946.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 1815, {{three months}} after his father's death, Cofresí married Juana Creitoff in San Miguel Arcángel parish, Cabo Rojo. Contemporary {{documents}} are unclear about her birthplace; although it is also listed as Curaçao, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> born in Cabo Rojo to Dutch parents. After their marriage, the couple moved to a residence bought for 50 pesos by Creitoff's father, Geraldo. Months later Cofresí's father in-law lost his humble home in a fire, plunging the family into debt. Three years after his marriage Cofresí owned no property and lived with his mother-in-law, Anna Cordelia. He established ties with residents of San Germán, including his brothers-in-law: the wealthy merchant Don Jacobo Ufret and Don Manuel Ufret. The couple struggled to begin a family of their own, conceiving two sons (Juan and Francisco Matías) who died soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|She {{was known}} for her honesty and {{moderate}} life style. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 {{as soon as she}} began earning her keep. She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.|$|E

5|$|Talbot {{was the son}} of Geoffrey Talbot, {{who owned}} lands at Swanscombe in Kent. The younger Talbot's mother was Agnes, wife of the elder Talbot. Her ancestry is unclear, with David Crouch stating {{she was a member of}} the de Lacy family. The Complete Peerage states <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the {{daughter}} of Walter de Lacy and Emma, and sister of Roger and Hugh de Lacy. Katharine Keats-Rohan, however, states that Agnes was probably the daughter of Helto Dapifer. Talbot's father is recorded as the holder the lands around Swanscombe in the 1166 Cartae Baronum, which states that the elder Talbot had the lands sometime before his death and that they passed to the younger Geoffrey. These holdings around Swanscombe are considered by some historians as probably comprising the feudal barony of Swanscombe.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's second (or third) wife, Maria of Mangup, was of {{the family}} of the princes of Theodoro. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> also cousins with the Muscovite Grand Princess Sophia Palaiologina, and was related to Trebizond's royal couple, Emperor David and Empress Maria. The Stephen–Maria {{marriage}} took place in September 1472, but she died in December 1477. During her brief stay in Moldavia, Maria supported the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople, contributing to the friendly contacts between Stephen and Catholic powers. Stephen's third (or fourth) wife, Maria Voichița, was the daughter of Radu the Fair, Voivode of Wallachia. She was the mother of Stephen's immediate successor, Bogdan, and a daughter named Maria Cneajna. The latter married into the House of Sanguszko. Stephen is known to have fathered two other sons who died in childhood, {{at a time when he}} was married to Maria Voichița: Bogdan died in 1479, and Peter (Petrașco) in 1480. Scholars are divided as to whether their mother was Evdochia or Maria. Archivist Aurelian Sacerdoțeanu believes that Bogdan also had a twin, Iliaș.|$|E
5|$|Suwo was re-designated as a 1st class coastal defense ship on 28 August 1912 {{and became}} a {{training}} ship for cadets and engineers.

Suwo served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915–16 before becoming a gunnery training ship at Yokosuka {{for the rest of the}} war. In April 1922, in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty, Suwo was disarmed at the Kure Naval Arsenal.

5|$|The American Cream is {{the only}} breed of draft horse {{developed}} in the United States that is still in existence today. The breed descends from a foundation mare named Old Granny. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> foaled between 1900 and 1905, and was first noticed at an auction in Story County, Iowa, in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin, a well known stock dealer. She was eventually sold to Nelson Brothers Farm in Jewell, Iowa. Her breeding is not known, but she was cream-colored and many of her foals were as well; they sold for above-average prices because of their color. Her cream-colored coat, pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed, and the color {{is now known as}} gold champagne. In 1946, two years after the breed registry was formed, 98 percent of the horses registered could be traced back to Old Granny.|$|E
