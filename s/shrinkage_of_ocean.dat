40|$|Based on {{satellite}} altimeter {{data and}} global atlases of temperature, salinity, wind stress and wind-driven circulation we investigate the seasonal {{variation of the}} South Indian tropical gyre and its associated open-ocean upwelling system, known as the Seychelles–Chagos Thermocline Ridge (SCTR). Results show a year-round, altimeter-derived cyclonic gyre where the upwelling regime appears closely related to seasonality <b>of</b> the <b>ocean</b> gyre, a relationship {{that has not been}} previously explored in this region. An analysis of major forcing mechanisms suggests that the thermocline ridge results from the constructive interaction of basin-scale wind stress curl, local-scale wind stress forcing and remote forcing driven by Rossby waves of different periodicity: semiannual in the west, under the strong influence of monsoonal winds; and, annual in the east, where the southeasterlies prevail. One exception occurs during winter, when the well-known westward intensification of the upwelling core, the Seychelles Dome, is shown to be largely a response of the wind-driven circulation. At basin-scale, the most outstanding feature is the seasonal <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ocean</b> gyre and the SCTR. From late autumn to spring, the eastward South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC) recirculates early in the east on feeding the westward South Equatorial Current, therefore closing the gyre before arrival to Sumatra. We find this recirculation longitude migrates over 20 ° and collocates with the westward advance of a zonal thermohaline front emerging from the encounter between (upwelled) Indian Equatorial Water and relatively warmer and fresher Indonesian Throughflow Water. We suggest this front, which we call the Indonesian Throughflow Front, plays an important role as remote forcing to the tropical gyre, generating southward geostrophic flows that contribute to the early recirculation of the SECC...|$|R
40|$|Drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> {{concrete}} {{has been}} found to cause cracking, water leakage and other serviceability problems and is thus an important research topic. In early studies, it {{has been found}} that the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concrete varies with the rock aggregate used. This is partly because the aggregate also shrinks and the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> aggregate is dependent on the type of rock from which the aggregate is derived. However, there have been few studies on the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> rock and how the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> aggregate would affect the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concrete. In this study, the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> the granite rock in Hong Kong was measured. It has been found that the rock shrinks quite substantially upon drying and that its shrinkage is dependent on the initial moisture condition. Based on such observation, two alternative methods of treating the aggregate before use so as to reduce the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concrete are proposed. Long-term <b>shrinkage</b> measurement <b>of</b> concrete made with untreated and treated aggregates revealed that the proposed methods of aggregate treatment, which are still rudimentary, can significantly reduce the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concrete. © 2010 Thomas Telford Ltd. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The {{present study}} {{investigated}} experimentally effects of temperature on drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concrete in different water cement ratio and containing mineral admixture. Concrete {{was exposed to}} a controlled environment of 20 ± 1 ºC, 35 ± 1 ºC, 50 ± 1 ºC, and 60 % ± 5 RH, respectively. The drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concretes with water cement ratio of 0. 3, 0. 4 and 0. 5 were evaluated. The resuluts showed that {{with the increase of}} temperature from 20 ºC to 50 ºC, the influence of water cement ratio on drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concrete was gradually weakened. The <b>shrinkage</b> strain <b>of</b> concretes with replacement of cement by 20 % of ground granulated blast- furnace slag (GGBS), 10 % of silica fume (SF), and 20 % of fly ash (FA) were measured, respectively. Test results showed that GGBS had a little impact on drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concrete; Silica fume could increase the drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concrete significantly in the early and later ages, especially when concrete was subjected to high temperature; Fly ash reduced drying shrinkage in early ages and increased drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> concrete in the later ages...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the effect of silica fume on expansion of cement and drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> mortars is reported. Tests were conducted on cylindrical specimens of 30 mm diameter and 30 mm height for expansion of cement pastes. The drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> mortars was studied on bars of 25 mm square cross-section and 250 mm length. The variables of the study were percentage replacements of cement with silica fume.

The 28 -day drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> mortar bars increases as does the percentage of silica fume, whereas the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>of</b> mortar bars at 405 days for all replacements of silica fume was observed to be about 2. 65 +/- 0. 11 %.
