5|$|In September 2013, Farrands {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a second documentary film on the Friday franchise, this time directly inspired by Bracke's book. Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th discusses each of the twelve films, from the original to the 2009 remake, {{as well as the}} television series. It is narrated by Corey Feldman, and also features interviews with key individuals in the franchise's history. Farrands has suggested that his work on the well-received 2010 film, , which documented the making of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, demonstrated the possibility for a documentary film that was more in depth and more comprehensive than his previous effort, His Name Was Jason. In making such a film, Farrands turned to Bracke's book, which he had also worked on, and drew from its <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>content.</b> Curious Goods: Behind the Scenes of Friday the 13th: The Series by Alyse Wax, a retrospective focusing on the 1987 television series, was released in October 2015 by BearManor Media.|$|E

25|$|Several {{variations}} on the game of quiz bowl exist that affect question <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>content,</b> rules of play, and round format. One standardized format is the pyramidal tossup/bonus format, which is used in ACF (or mACF) and NAQT competitions. ACF/mACF tossups are written in pyramidal style and are generally much longer than College Bowl and NAQT questions. It has a rigorous emphasis on academics, with very little popular culture. Games are usually untimed and last until a total of 20 tossups are read. NAQT is another common variation on the tossup/bonus format that balances academic rigor with {{a wider variety of}} subjects, including popular culture and an increased amount of current events and geography content. Unlike many mACF events, most questions used in this format are written and sold by NAQT themselves. NAQT also uses powers their in tossups, which reward players with 15 points instead of 10 for a tossup answered before a predetermined point. Games played on NAQT rules consist of two nine-minute halves and a total of 24 tossups. NAQT tossups are typically shorter than most other pyramidal tossups because of a character limit enforced on the questions. The format used for the now-defunct College Bowl tournament uses comparatively shorter questions. Gameplay is relatively quick as it is played in eight-minute halves, to a usual total of 22–24 tossups read. The Honda Campus All Star Challenge and University Challenge use similar formats.|$|E

Various levels and characters designs are altered drastically from the original, with some levels removed altogether.

Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending; Dan still ascends to the Hall of Heroes regardless of whether he collects all of the chalices or not.|$|E

500|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Leipzig for the Fifth Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday {{were from the}} First Epistle of Peter, [...] "Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts", and from the Gospel of Luke, , Peter's great catch of fish. The text of this cantata and six others is similar in <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> to cantatas texts set by Johann Ludwig Bach, his second cousin. The theme {{is derived from the}} gospel. A related verse of Jeremiah (...) opens the cantata. The prophecy referred originally to the return from the captivity in Babylon. The central movement, opening the second part to be performed after the sermon, is the quotation of verse 10 from the gospel. The cantata is closed by the final stanza of Georg Neumark's hymn [...] "" [...] (1641). This chorale had served as the base for Bach's chorale cantata for the same occasion in 1724, , part of his second annual cycle.|$|E

[...] As other {{commentators}} have also noted, some problems were innate to the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> of the opera, while others were external to it. Bellini discusses the tiredness of the singers (after rehearsing the entire second act on the day of the premiere) as well as noting how certain numbers failed to please—and failed to please the composer as well! But then he explains that most of the second act was very effective. It appears from the letter that the second evening's performance was more successful and Weinstock reports it was from this performance forward that it [...] "was recognised as a successful and important opera" [...] with 208 performances given at La Scala alone by the end of the 19th century.|$|E

2500|$|Rather than {{inferring}} {{the ancestral}} DNA sequence, {{one may be}} interested in the larger-scale molecular <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> of an ancestral genome. This problem is often approached in a combinatorial framework, by modelling genomes as permutations of genes or homologous regions. Various operations are allowed on these permutations, such as an inversion (a segment of the permutation is reversed in-place), deletion (a segment is removed), transposition (a segment is removed from one part of the permutation and spliced in somewhere else), or gain of genetic content through recombination, duplication or horizontal gene transfer. The [...] "genome rearrangement problem", first posed by Watterson and colleagues, asks: given two genomes (permutations) and a set of allowable operations, what is the shortest sequence of operations that will transform one genome into the other? [...] A generalization of this problem applicable to ancestral reconstruction is the [...] "multiple genome rearrangement problem": given a set of genomes and a set of allowable operations, find (i) a binary tree with the given genomes as its leaves, and (ii) an assignment of genomes to the internal nodes of the tree, such that the total number of operations across the whole tree is minimized. [...] This approach is similar to parsimony, except that the tree is inferred along with the ancestral sequences. [...] Unfortunately, even the single genome rearrangement problem is NP-hard, although it has received much attention in mathematics and computer science (for a review, see Fertin and colleagues).|$|E
