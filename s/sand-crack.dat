40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding the beta-adrenergic agonist {{salbutamol}} to pigs at levels between 0. 5 and 5. 0 mg/kg feed for different periods were studied in six experiments. The feet {{and ability to}} walk of pigs weighing 30 to 100 kg were examined at intervals. False <b>sand-crack,</b> white-line and heel erosion lesions were classified as mild or severe, and corns and wall haemorrhages were also recorded. At each examination the pig was given a grade for the overall severity of its foot lesions. Salbutamol fed at 1. 0 to 5. 0 mg/kg feed, {{for as little as}} 21 to 28 days, increased the frequency (P < 0. 05 to 0. 001) and often the severity (P < 0. 05) of the foot lesions, the higher doses tending to produce more severe lesions, and the overall foot grades deteriorated (P < 0. 001). The effects on both sexes were similar. No changes were observed when 0. 5 mg/kg was fed for 56 days. Despite the severity of many of the foot lesions, the pigs became lame in only one experiment. Electron microscopy indicated that salbutamol was interfering with horn production, but light microscopy revealed no changes in skin sections. These findings suggested that salbutamol was not directly affecting the function of keratinocytes. Supplementing the diet of the pigs with biotin and methionine did not delay, or prevent, the effects of salbutamol...|$|E
60|$|For the estate, {{which was}} all set at a rack rent, was {{strictly}} entailed; and as Jonas had always lived beyond his income, {{there would be little}} to leave to a younger son. When their mother died the two young men, together with a sister, had been left to the father's care. She also had learnt to ride, and ride hard--to go to the stable and see that her own horse was made up--and to rate her groom in no gentle terms, if things in that department were not as they should be. She also could be eloquent on thrush, <b>sand-cracks,</b> and overreaches--could detect a splint or a spavin at a glance--knew all the parts and portions and joints of a horse much more accurately than she did of a sheep, and was a thorough judge of condition. Rumour also not unfrequently hinted, among the tabbies of Carrick-on-Shannon, that Miss Julia could not only ride with her brothers in the morning, but that she was also occasionally not ill inclined to drink with them of an evening.|$|R
