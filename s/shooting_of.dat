5|$|In December, 2,000–3,000 people {{gathered}} at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, to protest the killings of unarmed black men by police. At least twenty members of a protest that had been using the slogan were arrested. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, BLM protested the police <b>shooting</b> <b>of</b> Dontre Hamilton, who died in April.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{comparatively}} to examine herbal traits of the cultivars such as Rubin, Summit, Holland Dwarf, Heritage, Tulameen, Aksu Red, Nuburg, Canby and Willamette red raspberries cultivated at Ankara Condition, in the capital of Turkey between 2002 and 2005. According to Repeated Random Complete Design (RRCD) (which was composed of four random plot design experiments) used in the experiment, the effects of cultivar, year and cultivar by year interaction on herbal traits such as the height <b>of</b> <b>shoot,</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>shoot,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>shoot,</b> fruitfulness <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> and weight <b>of</b> fruit were further more significant (p< 0. 0001). Besides, determination coefficients of RRCD for traits ranged from 95. 60 to 99. 94 % (very-high). As a result, we concluded in Ankara condition that as to herbal traits such as the height <b>of</b> <b>shoot,</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>shoot,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>shoot,</b> fruitfulness <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> and weight <b>of</b> fruit, Willamette cultivar were more superior to others. In addition, we can suggest that researchers should analyze using RRCD because Determination Coefficients of RRCD for all traits were much more found...|$|R

40|$|The {{henequen}} (Agave fourcroydes Lem.) is a crop {{of great}} economic importance. This study was aimed to characterize the leaf surface of henequen plants variety `Sac Ki' obtained by asexual propagation methods. In vitro plants, <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> bulbils of in vitro plants, <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> rhizomes of in vitro plants, <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> bulbils of field plants and <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> field rhizomes were used. At 7 and 15 months after planting in the nursery, the epidermis was characterized through the stomatal index and stomatal density. Moreover, the conductor vessels and fiber bundles in leaf mesophyll, were characterized. It {{was found that the}} leaf surface of henequen plants variety `Sac Ki' obtained by different methods of asexual propagation showed similar anatomical structures. However, it was observed that in vitro plants were different from the rest in terms of stomatal index and stomatal density in both time points. It was suggesting a accommodate response to environmental conditions. Key words: stomatic density, stomatic index, in vitro plant...|$|R

40|$|In {{alternate}} bearing olive trees, {{high yield}} on-crop years alternate with low yield off-crop years. Research was undertaken {{in support of}} the California olive industry to determine how fruit number one year impacts floral intensity and yield the following year. Removing the on-crop of fruit before endocarp hardening (mid-July) restored summer vegetative shoot growth and inflorescence number the following spring. Delaying fruit removal to 75 days after endocarp hardening (September) significantly reduced spring bud break and floral intensity. Quantification of the fate of buds on nonbearing and bearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> off- and on-crop control trees provided striking results. The majority of buds on nonbearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> off-crop trees produced inflorescences, whereas most buds on nonbearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> on-crop trees remained inactive through spring bloom. In sharp contrast, 74 % of buds on bearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> on-crop trees had abscised prior to spring bloom. A putative O. europaea FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, known to upregulate flowering in woody perennials, was expressed in buds on nonbearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> off-crop trees from June through March, but was repressed in buds of bearing and nonbearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> on-crop trees starting in September and October, respectively. Whereas the lack of OeFT expression in buds on bearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> on-crop trees {{may be due to the}} abscission of 51 % of the floral buds by September, this result taken together with the repression of OeFT in buds on nonbearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> on-crop trees in October, for which floral bud abscission was not a factor, suggests the possibility that the on crop may inhibit determination of the floral meristem between September and October. Buds on nonbearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> off-crop trees subsequently expressed two floral organ identify genes in March; these genes were not expressed in buds of nonbearing and bearing <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> on-crop trees. This study is the first to provide evidence that several mechanisms in addition to inhibition <b>of</b> summer vegetative <b>shoot</b> growth, including inhibition of spring bud break, inhibition of floral development at the level of gene expression, and abscission of potential floral buds, contribute to the perpetuation of alternate bearing in olive...|$|R

40|$|The Effect {{of various}} NaCl levels on the <b>shoot</b> content <b>of</b> trace elements, in the {{seedlings}} of five citrus species namely: Bakraei (Citrus reteculata X C. limetta), Volkamer lemon(C. volkameriana), Sour orange(C. aurantium), Sweet lime (C. limetta) and Mexican lime(C. aurantifolia), were studied in a glasshouse, by a randomized complete block design with factorial arrangement and four replications. One-year old seedlings of each species were {{grown in the}} pots, containing native soil (pH= 8. 2) and irrigated with water supplemented with 0 (control), 20, 40 and 60 mM NaCl. At the end of experiment, the amount of Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cl and B in shoots were determined. The amount of trace elements varied among the species even in the control plants (no salt). Salinity had different effects on the <b>shoot</b> content <b>of</b> trace elements. Salinity reduced Fe content in the <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> all species except in Bakraii and sweet lime and increased the amount of Zn in the <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> all species except in Bakraii. The Mn content was reduced in the all species but increased in sour orange. Salinity reduced the amount of Cu in the <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> volkamerina but had no effect in the other species. The amount of Cl increased in the <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> all species with salinity. Boron content in the <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> all species except in sour orange, increased with low salinity level but decreased with increased salinity levels. However in sour orange, salinity in the all levels decreased the amount of B in the <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> seedlings...|$|R
