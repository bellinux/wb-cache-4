The Hotel was {{the location}} for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). Three people in the street were killed – two council workers and a policeman – and several others injured.

In 1985, the Director-General of <b>Security</b> <b>issued</b> a specific denial of the allegation. In 1991 the New South Wales parliament unanimously called for a joint State-Federal inquiry into the bombing. However, the Federal government vetoed any inquiry.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse if the UN today {{constructs}} the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> and to argue about in which way the organization in that case does so alternatively why it can be said that the UN doesn’t construct the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue.</b> In order to reach this purpose the following questions will be answered: •Does the UN construct the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> today? -If yes, in which way? -If no, why can it be said that the organisation doesn’t? The methods used are qualitative literature studies of policy documents on water from the UN. The focus is to analyze the ideas about water and to apply my theory on the concept of security, which is Barry Buzan’s framework on security, to these ideas. The main results showed that the UN strongly constructs the water issue as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for environments and species and in relatively strong terms also constructs it as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for civilisations. In rare cases the organisation constructs it as a societal <b>security</b> <b>issue,</b> but the UN doesn’t construct the water issue as a military, political or economic <b>security</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|R
