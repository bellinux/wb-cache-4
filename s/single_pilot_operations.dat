The flight controls make use of fly-by-wire technology to reduce physical demands upon the pilot as well as enable the execution of precision maneuvers; the pilot uses a single joystick to steer the airship across the three dimensions. The Zeppelin NT is certified for <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>operations,</b> the second seat is often used by a flight attendant during tourist operations. Elements of the airship's avionics, including navigation, communication, and air data systems, can be directly interfaced with the mission support systems; an 8kVa additional electrical power system is also present. In early 2012, ZLT and Goodyear signed an agreement to replace the Zeppelin NT's instrumentation and display systems, upgrading the cockpit to feature a glass cockpit.|$|E

Piloting aids such as the Vehicle and Engine Multifunction Display (VEMD) is claimed to reduced pilot workload, thereby increasing ease-of-use and overall safety. Dependent on customer demand and role, tactical instrumentation and equipment consoles may also be installed in the cockpit. Typically the cockpit is configured for <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>operations,</b> the pilot being seated on the left-hand side of the forward cabin {{to reduce the risk}} of passenger interference with the controls posed by a right-hand position; dual controls can be optionally installed.

5000|$|Further {{development}} of the type continued as the company wanted to establish itself as an aviation engineering and production concern although its postwar work primarily centred on instrument and camera production, especially in creating {{a copy of the}} German Leica.When Royal Air Force high-speed research explored high g-forces encountered in manoeuvres, a number of prone-pilot experimental aircraft including the Gloster Meteor F8 [...] "Prone Pilot" [...] were produced. To investigate low-speed applications, the R.S.4 Bobsleigh was a radical conversion of the R.S.3 reconfigured into a <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>operation</b> with a prone pilot station in the new rounded nose. This section was equipped with a transparent cone which covered a large section of the nose and two separate transparent ports to give minimal sideways and rearwards views. The R.S.4 was first flown in this form on 13 June 1951. Although useful data was obtained, the R.S.4's prone pilot did have difficulty with the initial control setup. Today's hang glider pilots have found the prone position an ideal means of controlling flight as well as providing a streamlined profile.Experimental testing was conducted by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough and continued until January 1956 when the R.S.4 returned to the UK civil registry, again as G-AGOS. It was used at one time as an air photo aircraft by Film Aviation Services and remained in flyable condition until 1973. The Snibston Discovery Park (as part of the Leicester Museum of Science & Technology), Ashby Park, Coalville, Leicestershire, presently stores the R.S.4 for future restoration and display.|$|R

40|$|History {{has shown}} that a larger flight crew does not per se imply that {{aircraft}} operations will be safer. The goal of this thesis {{is to determine the}} technical hurdles to <b>Single</b> <b>Pilot</b> Commercial <b>Operations</b> (SPCO). Continued technological developments, the upsurge of commercial Unmanned Aerial Systems, the non-negligible cost of air crews, and yet, stagnation in commercial crew reductions since 1980 are reasons to clarify the current technical hurdles to SPCO. The research was initiated with a broad literature survey. It was found that advances in technology and human factors understanding have made each historical crew reduction possible, through a redistribution of tasks across (fewer) humans, automation, supporting infrastructure and accompanying procedures. An exhaustive list was then formulated of all issues that could potentially affect a reduction to SPCO. Consequently, in-depth research of each issue determined the most predominant challenges to SPCO are; a. providing the <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> with the correct situational awareness at a manageable workload; b. ensuring adequate monitoring of pilot performance without an on-board human co-pilot; and c. ensuring redundancy in case of incapacitation. Finally, <b>Single</b> <b>Pilot</b> Incapacitation Redundancy (SPIR) solutions were explored by means of a scenario analysis and functional analysis. The greatest challenge to SPIR {{turns out to be the}} setting of the incapacitation detection sensitivity threshold; avoiding excessive false warnings (alarm problem) yet retaining immediacy for timely recovery of stable flight; both incapacitation detection and seem-less control take-over are tasks more suited to the adaptability of humans. A concept for a SPCO flight deck has been presented in which these issues become obsolete. Master Aerospace Engineering.

This next move is motivated by cost reduction, and must satisfy the same or better level of safety currently guaranteed with two-crewmen cockpit. This is a human-centered design (HCD) problem where decision-makers have to take risks. This paper presents an approach to risk taking in systems engi-neering.

A number of procedural changes are likely to result when such changes in roles and responsibilities are undertaken. Automation is expected to relieve the PoB and GSO of some tasks (e. g. radio frequency changes, loading expected arrival information). A major difference in the SPO environment is the shift to communication-cued crosschecks (verbal / automated) rather than movement-cued crosschecks that occur in a shared cockpit.
