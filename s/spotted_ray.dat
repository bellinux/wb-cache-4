Although Bonnaterre's name was published first and thus would have had precedence, later authorities have regarded Forsskål's uarnak as the earliest available name even though it was not initially part of a binomial. Consequently, modern sources give uarnak as the valid specific epithet and either Gmelin or Forsskål as the species authority.

Blue spotted rays, Dasyatis kuhlii were treated for 12 days by using different concentrations of lead nitrate (Pb(NO 3) 2), that is, 0 ppm as control (treatment A), 0. 2 ppm (treatment B), 0. 5 (treatment C), 0. 9 ppm (treatment D) and 1. 8 ppm (treatment E).

40|$|Using {{polyclonal}} antibodies, {{we examined}} the localization of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) as markers of the site of steroidogenetic activity during the spermatogenesis of Torpedo marmorata. These enzymes {{play a central role}} in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, including androgen and oestrogen production. We demonstrated that in the <b>spotted</b> <b>ray</b> testis, Sertoli and Leydig cells, as well as spermatogonia, show a positive reaction to anti 3 beta-HSD and 17 beta-HSD antibodies. In particular, we demonstrated that Sertoli cells show a positive reaction to anti 3 beta-HSD and 17 beta-HSD antibodies in cysts containing spermatogonia and spermatozoa, while Leydig cells present a positive reaction only when they are located between cysts containing meiotic cells. This study strongly suggests that, as hypothesised in our previous study [Prisco, M., Liguoro, A., D'Onghia, B., Ricchiari, L., Andreuccetti, P., Angelini, F., 2002. Fine structure of Leydig and Sertoli cells in the testis of immature and mature <b>spotted</b> <b>ray</b> Torpedo marmorata. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 63, 192 - 201. ], Sertoli and Leydig cells are differently involved in the hormonal control of spermatogenesis: Sertoli cells before the beginning of meiosis and after spermiation, Leydig cells only during meiosis phase. Moreover, the present paper deals with the possibility that also spermatogonia are engaged in the production of androgen hormones, as they are characterized by the presence of 3 beta-HSD and 17 beta-HSD enzymes, and show the ultrastructural features of steroid hormone-producing cells...|$|E

A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a <b>spotted</b> eagle <b>ray</b> in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first.

40|$|The {{structural}} organisation of the nucleolar apparatus during oogenesis of the <b>spotted</b> <b>ray</b> Torpedo marmorata was investigated. The observations {{showed that}} unlike other cartilaginous fishes, in T. marmorata the nucleolar apparatus was always represented {{by one or}} two conspicuous nucleoli, whose organization significantly changed during oocyte development. In the smallest follicles (follicles < 300 μm in diameter) the nucleolus {{was made up of}} granular and fibrillar components, and actively incorporated 3 H uridine; later it becomes more and more electron‐dense so in follicles of 400 μm in diameter its components and 3 H uridine incorporation were no longer evident.

After nucleolus inactivation, the synthesis of rRNA may be substained by granulos...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the presence of}} cadherins, Ca++ dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, during the development and maturation of cysts in the testis of the <b>spotted</b> <b>ray</b> Torpedo marmorata. Using different anti-cadherin antibodies, we provide evidence by means of immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting that cadherins {{are involved in the}} interaction between Sertoli and germ cells. During the development and maturation of cysts, in fact, cadherins occur between Sertoli and germ cells when they begin to interact to build a cyst. Later on, the presence of cadherins between Sertoli and germ cells persists; furthermore, during the formation of spermatoblast, it is also evident at the level of indentations, arising from Sertoli cells and encompassing germ cells. Finally, the present findings strongly suggest that cadherins are also involved in the spermiogenesis as germ cells, when male gamete differentiation starts, are intensively stained, while, when spermiation is completed, the spermatozoa appear unlabeled...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of morphological and histological maturity {{was conducted on}} a representative sub-sample of 98 individuals from a total database of 538 specimens of the <b>spotted</b> <b>ray,</b> Raja montagui.

Morphological evidence indicates that nidamental gland width, in females and clasper length, in males, are reliable indicators of maturity in R. montagui when related to total length and the physiological histology of the testes. On the basis of these results the development of an objective measure of maturity for rajids is both possible and practical using these structures. In addition, these measurements provide finer resolution of the process of maturation during the life history of both sexes, without a significant increase in data collection effort. A greater degree of reliability than that provided by the partly subjective nature of current, maturity scales is therefore possible, permitting an improvement in the user confidence of rajid maturity data, for fisheries management purposes...|$|E
