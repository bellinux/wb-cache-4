When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a <b>score</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs.

40|$|Objectives—This report {{examines}} {{two measures}} that identify children with {{emotional and behavioral}} problems: high <b>scores</b> based <b>on</b> questions in <b>the</b> brief version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and a single question about serious (definite or severe) overall emotional and behavioral difficulties. Children were classified into four groups, those with: only high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brief SDQ, only serious overall difficulties, both high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brief SDQ and serious overall difficulties, and neither high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> brief SDQ nor serious overall difficulties. Children’s characteristics, conditions, and service use in these four groups were compared. Methods—Data from the 2001 – 2007 National Health Interview Survey identified the emotional and behavioral problems, characteristics, conditions, and service use of children aged 4 – 17 years. Results—Approximately 7 % of children had either high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brief SDQ or serious overall difficulties, with 2 % having only high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brief SDQ, 3 % having only serious overall difficulties, and 2 % having both high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brief SDQ and serious overall difficulties. Characteristics {{of the three groups}} of children identified with emotional and behavioral problems differed from each other and from children without problems.

After the next two drives ended with punts, Alshon Jeffery caught a ten-yard touchdown pass from Jay Cutler to draw the Bears within three points. On the following series, the Vikings responded when Teddy Bridgewater escaped a blitz to throw a pass to Jerick McMcKinnon, who beat Shea McClellin to <b>score</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 17-yard play.
