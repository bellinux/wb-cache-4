40|$|The "Rossland {{volcanic}} group" is {{subdivided into}} two volcanic formations, {{separated by a}} dominantly sedimentary formation of Jurassic age. These rocks were folded along north-south axes and subsequently faulted and bent into an arc around a protuberance of the Cretaceous(?) Nelson granodiorite batholith during or just prior to its intrusion. A quartz-diorite stock and tongues, partly sheared, antedate the batholithic stage. Metadiorite, a feldspar-hornblende gneiss with coarse pyroxene-hornblende border facies, was formed by assimilation or metasomatic reconstitution of chiefly volcanic rocks prior to the batholithic stage. Syenite intrudes it in places, in others a gradational contact shows evidence of metasomatic action. The syenite may be Tertiary. Porphyry, aplite, lamprophyre and diabase dykes cut the granodiorite and some veins. These and monzonite chonoliths may be Tertiary. Gold-quartz, and gold and <b>silver</b> <b>bearing</b> copperlead- <b>zinc</b> sulphide deposits occur in bedded rocks, metadiorite, and quartz diorite tongues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{mechanical}} activation of gold- and <b>silver</b> <b>bearing</b> sulphide minerals. Mechanical activation belongs to methods of physical pretreatment and was applied in Russia, South Africa and Australia for ultrafine grinding {{of gold and}} <b>silver</b> <b>bearing</b> arsenopyrite and pyrite concentrates. The new method of mechanochemical leaching has been developed at the Institute of Geotechnics of the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Koice. The method proved to be succesful as pretreatment step for silver leaching from the tetrahedrite concentrate...|$|R

50|$|They {{may have}} been formed in argentiferous (<b>silver</b> <b>bearing)</b> lead sulfide {{containing}} spotty amounts of copper and zinc. These deposits are usually deeply oxidized and enriched by irregular replacement bodies along mineralized fissure zones and anticlinal rolls cut by Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary formations. Ore bodies are often closely associated with newer cross-cutting intrusive dikes of Laramide.|$|R

As late as the 5th century, the mines were abandoned by Romans, but were exploited in the Middle Ages for iron, so spurring the construction of many foundries around. The mines kept on running up to 1984, when the exploitation license expired.|$|R
