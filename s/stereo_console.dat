5000|$|A <b>stereo</b> <b>console</b> (or [...] "console stereo," [...] {{as it was}} {{sometimes}} called) is a stereo system containing audio components (such as a stereo record changer and a stereo FM radio) housed into a cabinet, as was popular in the 1960s and into the 1970s. A stereo consolette (as identified by one of its manufacturers from that period, Delmonico/Nivico) is a smaller, more compact <b>stereo</b> <b>console</b> that often stands on splayed legs. The corresponding term for console in British English is radiogram.|$|E
50|$|A console {{television}} is {{a television set}} housed into a cabinet {{in the same manner}} as a <b>stereo</b> <b>console.</b> Production of console televisions lasted much longer than stereo consoles, with units manufactured throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s before being replaced by flat-screen televisions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stereo</b> <b>consoles</b> would {{ultimately}} {{be replaced by}} high-fidelity component stereo systems with separate speakers (sometimes called [...] "rack systems") in the late 1970s, which offered much higher performance without being attached to furniture or being tied to one brand of equipment. Some of these systems had speakers with removable covers, exposing the woofer and tweeter. Production of these systems continued throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s, until smaller, table-top or countertop units (such as the Bose Wave System) began dominating.|$|R
5000|$|... 1974 The M82 {{range of}} {{portable}} <b>stereo</b> mixing <b>consoles</b> was eventually expanded {{to a full}} line of multitrack, broadcast and live mixers. Units from this era in pristine condition regularly appear on eBay.|$|R
50|$|Masonite {{was also}} a popular {{protective}} backing for wooden <b>console</b> <b>stereo</b> and television cabinets, from the 1960s to the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The Luxury Coupe had a Holley 2 Barrel Carb {{version of}} the 1.9 L engine rated at 90 hp (67 kW), along with a {{tachometer}} and trip odometer, reclining low-back bucket seats trimmed in cloth/vinyl (or all vinyl), AM/FM <b>stereo</b> radio, overhead <b>console,</b> and left remote mirror.|$|R
5|$|In {{professional}} concert {{sound system}} design, subwoofers {{can be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono full-range system by using an active crossover. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or <b>stereo</b> mixing <b>console</b> mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|R
50|$|The Luxury Coupe had a throttle-body {{injected}} (which Ford termed CFI, for Central Fuel Injection) {{version of}} the 1.9 L engine rated at 90 hp (67 kW), along with a tachometer and trip odometer, reclining low-back bucket seats trimmed in cloth/vinyl (or all vinyl), AM/FM <b>stereo</b> radio, overhead <b>console,</b> and left remote mirror.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, Electrohome {{continued}} to manufacture consumer products including organs, radios, <b>console</b> <b>stereos,</b> and televisions, {{as it became}} {{the first and only}} Canadian company to make colour television sets. By 1965, Electrohome products were being sold in 23 countries. Total sales in 1968 were $44.5 million. Over the years the company had ten manufacturing plants and two administrative offices in the Kitchener-Waterloo area.|$|R

The Skifta app is currently available at the Android Market, having launched the beta version of the service in January 2010 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. [...] In early 2011, the Skifta app for Android became the first DLNA Certified(R) third party application. Skifta 1.0 officially launched in October 2011.|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, with $3,000 {{from his}} father-in-law, he founded Clairtone with {{business}} partner David Gilmour, an importer of Scandinavian furniture. Clairtone manufactured high-end <b>console</b> <b>stereos</b> and later televisions, which were recognizable icons of their day. The most celebrated Clairtone designs were the striking [...] "Project G" [...] series, introduced in 1964, composed of sleek rosewood cabinets with cantilevered black aluminum [...] "sound globes" [...] (speakers). The Project G and G2 {{were seen in}} the films [...] "Marriage on the Rocks" [...] and The Graduate, awarded a silver medal for excellence in design at the Milan Triennale, and endorsed by Frank Sinatra and Oscar Peterson. The firm's fans included Hugh Hefner.|$|R
5000|$|... 3) Equipment obsolescence: By {{the end of}} the 1990s, {{the demise}} of {{analogue}} electronics ensured the technological obsolescence of many of the traditional mainstays of the consumer audio/video service industry, such as cathode ray tube (CRT) television sets, videocassette recorders, LaserDisc players, as well as <b>console</b> <b>stereos</b> and component stereo systems. These items were being replaced in favor of much less costly and/or more portable, higher-technology devices using digital signal processing that were either difficult-to-service or not economically feasible to repair. Today, the even more rapid pace of technological advancement often seems to ensure that sets become obsolete in {{a relatively short period of}} time after purchase.|$|R
5000|$|First V-M {{designed}} a two speed changer after Columbia Records introduced the LP in 1948. V-M then added the 45rpm speed after RCA brought that innovation to market in 1949. Finally V-M added the fourth speed (16â…” rpm) for [...] "talking books" [...] in 1954. The changer mechanism, {{used throughout the}} fifties, sixties, and the seventies was developed in 1950. The basic design was retained until record changer production was terminated. The changer mechanism, responsible for operating the tone arm and the dropping of the records, was updated throughout the years to keep V-M's record changers competitive with their competitors, as technology advanced. The speed control mechanism was, however, completely redesigned in 1961. V-M Corporation claimed that their record changers were jam proof. These V-M record changers had a reputation of being both well built and reliable. These mass-produced record changers, while competitive with other manufactures mass-produced record changers, i.e. BSR and Garrard, in both build quality and product specifications, were not competitive with professional record changers. Like other mass-produced record changers, the tone arms had heavier vertical tracking force (VTF), poorer speed accuracy, and poorer rumble specification than the professional record changers. V-M mass-produced record changers, like their competitors mass-produced record changers, were used in low to medium priced audio equipment-compact <b>stereo</b> systems, <b>console</b> <b>stereos,</b> and portable stereo systems. They were sold also as separate components. Most had ceramic cartridges and diamond styluses (needles), with a separate stylus for 78rpm records. Most had two pole synchronous motors. V-M developed their first professional record changer in 1966. This record changer had a twenty-four pole synchronous motor, and a separate motor for operating the tone arm and lowering the record to the turntable. This professional record changer was only a two speed unit-it did not play 78rpm records. This professional record changer was marketed under the Voice of Music trademark, and also sold to other manufactures such as Sherwood, Philco Ford and Westinghouse. V-M's second generation professional record changers design was developed in 1971, and was sold to BIC. V-M's deteriorating financial condition did not permit V-M to market this design under the Voice of Music trade mark.|$|R
50|$|Radio {{broadcasting}} in {{the early}} 20th century brought the first major consumer product, the broadcast receiver. Later products included telephones, personal computers, MP3 players, audio equipment, televisions (first cathode ray tube TVs, then in the 2000s, flatscreen TVs) and calculators. In the 2010s, consumer electronics stores often sell GPS, automotive electronics (car <b>stereos),</b> video game <b>consoles,</b> electronic musical instruments (e.g., synthesizer keyboards), karaoke machines, digital cameras, and video players (VCRs in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by DVD players and Blu-ray disc players). Stores also sell digital cameras, camcorders, cell phones, and smartphones. As of 2016, some of the newer products sold include virtual reality head-mounted display goggles, smart home devices that connect home devices to the Internet (such as smartphone-controllable thermostats and lights) and wearable technology such as Fitbit digital exercise watches.|$|R
50|$|Delmonico International Corporation was one {{of several}} {{subsidiaries}} of Elgin National Industries. Additional divisions included Elgin National Watch Company (and other watch companies), Elgin Radio, Newport Yachts (sailboats), Enterprise Yachts (which includes Breuil powerboats), and others. Delmonico's three primary businesses were: the importing of Ignis freezers and refrigerators (part of the Agnelli empire of Fiat fame); the manufacturing of home entertainment equipment, such as stereos and televisions (including <b>console</b> <b>stereos</b> and television sets in the Early American, Mediterranean, French Provincial, and Scandinavian styles) in a large manufacturing facility in Queens, New York; and being the first importers into the United States of both Sony (in 1959) and JVC (in the 1960s). Many Delmonico products included the Nivico (Nippon Victor Corporation) brand as well. During this time, JVC was a pioneer in quadraphonic sound (a precursor to 5.1) and multi-frequency tone control (JVC called it SEA, for special effects amplifier). In 1969, Delmonico's revenue was $65,000,000 and Raymond Gincavage was the president.|$|R
50|$|In total, the Challenge Stradale {{is up to}} 110 kg (243 lb) {{lighter than}} the {{standard}} Modena if all the lightweight options are specified such as deleted radio, lexan (plexiglass) door window and Alcantara fabric (instead of the leather option). As much as 74 kilograms (207 lb) was taken off on the car by lightening the bumpers, stripping the interior of its sound deadening and carbon mirrors and making the optional Modena carbon seats standard. Resin Transfer Moulding was utilized for the bumpers and skirts, a carry over from the Challenge cars which resulted in lighter bumpers than on the Modena. The engine and transmission weight was slimmed down 11 kg (24 lb) {{through the use of}} a smaller, lighter weight sports (yet still stainless steel) exhaust back box and valved exit pipes. The Challenge Stradale also got Brembo carbon ceramic brakes as standard (which later became standard fitment on the F430) which shaved 16 kg off the curb weight and improved handling by reducing unsprung weight and completely eliminating brake fade. Cars fitted with the center <b>console</b> <b>stereo</b> option, sub speaker box behind the seats and glass side windows re-gained approximately 30 kg over the best selected options (from a weight perspective).|$|R
5000|$|Philco Corporation by 1960 {{had applied}} for {{bankruptcy}} protection and on December 11, 1961, Ford Motor Company purchased Philco and continued to offer consumer products, computer systems and defense related projects. The company continued to provide Ford with car and truck radio receivers and consumer product investments were made to color television production. Along with color and black and white television Philco continued to produce refrigerators, washers, dryers, air conditioners, stoves, radios, portable transistor radios, portable phonographs, audio console systems with high quality [...] "Mastercraft" [...] furniture cabinets, and component stereo systems. The company branded Philco products as [...] "Philco-Ford" [...] in 1966, and <b>console</b> <b>stereo</b> systems reached their zenith during 1966 and 1967, with high quality cabinet construction and powerful stereo chassis systems of 100- and 300-watt consoles. Philco at one time {{was one of the}} largest furniture producers {{in the world and the}} end was near for building [...] "high quality" [...] furniture cabinets along with stereo equipment. High quality cabinets were replaced with cheaper wood composites covered in vinyl paper with plastic wood pieces, and the quality electronic systems were replaced with cheaper versions imported from Philco in Taiwan. Eventually, all consumer electronic goods would be made by Philco-Taiwan, to lower costs of production and be more competitive in the market. This trend was prevailing in the American electronics industry but Philco-Ford was one of the first to implement. In 1973, a complete line of refrigerators was introduced, consisting of eight side-by-side [...] "Cold Guard" [...] models, which used about one-third less electricity than comparable competitive makes. Ford sold Philco to GTE, which also owned Sylvania Electric Products/Sylvania, in 1974. Then in 1977, Philco International was sold to White Consolidated Industries (WCI). (In 1986, WCI was bought by AB Electrolux.) ...|$|R
5000|$|First and foremost, V-M was {{a record}} changer and tape deck {{supplier}} (less the electronics) to dozens of familiar brand names of their day, such as Zenith and Motorola to name only two good customers. V-M Corporation, from the late 1950s through 1968, was the world's largest record changer manufacturer. During the peak years of record changer production, V-M Corporation produced more record changers than all other record changer manufacturers in the world combined. In the early 1960s, V-M Corporation created a record changer advertisement, placed in an audio magazine, stating this fact. Also, in this advertisement, V-M listed their original equipment manufacturers, (customers), by name. BSR Ltd, a British record changer manufacturer, in the 1970s, copied the format of this ad. By 1969, BSR had surpassed V-M Corporation in record changer production {{to become the world}} largest manufacturer of record changers. In several countries, V-M record changers were produced under license. Telefunken, of then West Germany, was an example, of one such manufacturer sign a licensing agreement with V-M Corporation, to utilize their record changer technology. These large record changer production volumes helped V-M keep its own Voice of Music brand profitable for many years. After 1965, the trend became clear that American audio companies were going out of business or shifting production overseas. As V-M's record changer volumes declined, it became difficult for the company to remain profitable. Retailing began to change from small [...] "mom and pop" [...] stores (V-M's strength) to large electronics retailers where V-M was under-represented. At the end of 1972 year, V-M quit offering <b>console</b> <b>stereos</b> and terminated all tape recorder models, for sale to retail customers, with the exception of an eight track player. At the end of the 1974 year, all their other remaining retail products, except record changers, were discontinued-compact and portable stereo systems, and all other retail audio components, such as receivers, amplifiers and speaker systems. After 1974, V-M record changers were the only consumer product sold to the retail market as components. Record changers continued to be sold to original equipment manufacturers up to the bankruptcy, in mid July, of the 1977 year. Cassette decks still produced, after leaving the retail consumer market, were highly specialized professional units. Some of the companies that bought these professional cassette decks were New Century Education Corporation, Beltone, and Terra Technology. V-M also did contract engineering projects for various manufacturers, along with some assembly projects for outside companies. For the December 1976 Christmas Season, V-M assembled an electronic ping pong game for Factory Direct Marketing. V-M filed for bankruptcy in mid July 1977 when a power failure, in New York City, prevented a wire transfer of critically needed funds.|$|R
