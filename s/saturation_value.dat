25|$|If the {{frequency}} {{and the intensity of}} the incident radiation are fixed, the photoelectric current increases gradually with an increase in the positive potential on the collector electrode until all the photoelectrons emitted are collected. The photoelectric current attains a <b>saturation</b> <b>value</b> and does not increase further for any increase in the positive potential. The saturation current increases with the increase of the light intensity. It also increases with greater frequencies due to a greater probability of electron emission when collisions happen with higher energy photons.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{selecting}} colors, including palettes, color choosers and using an eyedropper tool to select a colour on the canvas. The built-in color choosers include RGB/HSV selector or scales, water-color selector, CMYK selector and a color-wheel selector. Colors can also be selected using hexadecimal color codes as used in HTML color selection. GIMP has native support for indexed colour and RGB color spaces; other color spaces are supported using decomposition where each channel of the new color space becomes a black-and-white image. CMYK, LAB and HSV (hue, <b>saturation,</b> <b>value)</b> are supported this way. Color blending can be achieved using the Blend tool, by applying a gradient {{to the surface of}} an image and using GIMP's color modes. Gradients are also integrated into tools such as the brush tool, when the user paints this way the output color slowly changes. There are a number of default gradients included with GIMP; a user can also create custom gradients with tools provided. Gradient plug-ins are also available.|$|E
25|$|HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV (Hue, <b>Saturation,</b> <b>Value)</b> are two {{alternative}} {{representations of}} the RGB color model, designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to more closely align with the way human vision perceives color-making attributes. In these models, colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice, around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top. The HSV representation models the way paints of different colors mix together, with the saturation dimension resembling various shades of brightly colored paint, and the value dimension resembling the mixture of those paints with varying amounts of black or white paint. The HSL model attempts to resemble more perceptual color models such as NCS or Munsell, placing fully saturated colors around a circle at a lightness value of 1/2, where a lightness value of 0 or 1 is fully black or white, respectively.|$|E

40|$|AIM [...] To {{determine}} whether iron metabolism influences {{the incidence of}} systemic fungal infection in patients with haematological malignancies. METHODS [...] The study population comprised 74 patients who had undergone myeloablative chemotherapy. Systemic fungal infections were classified as confirmed (histological confirmation or characteristic septate hyphae) or possible (antibiotic resistant fever which resolved following administration of intravenous amphotericin B, together with either typical radiographic lesions or massive oropharyngeal candidiasis). Parameters of iron metabolism included serum iron concentrations, total iron binding capacity, serum transferrin, and ferritin concentrations and transferrin <b>saturation</b> <b>values.</b> RESULTS [...] Patients who developed a fungal infection had substantially increased transferrin <b>saturation</b> <b>values</b> and ferritin concentrations at diagnosis together with low serum transferrin and high serum iron concentrations. This profile was present in patients with a fungal infection regardless of the underlying haematological disorder.

A strong correlation between the vertical density stratification, the {{distribution of}} oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, and methane has been identified. A widespread release of methane from the seafloor is indicated by increasing methane concentrations with water depth. The deep basins in the central Baltic Sea show the strongest methane enrichments in stagnant anoxic water bodies (max. 1086 nM and 504 nM, respectively), with a pronounced decrease towards the pelagic redoxcline and slightly elevated surface water concentrations (<b>saturation</b> <b>values</b> of 206 % and 120 %, respectively).

Size describes the surface area of a form. Alignment is the arrangement of forms {{with respect to their}} direction, orientation, or pattern. Character is the rectilinearity and curvilinearity of forms. Forms that have differences in these characteristics contrast each other.|$|E

40|$|A low field AC {{magnetic}} susceptibility has been measured for a superconducting bulk YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d sample with an AC excitation field superimposed with a DC field. The {{effects on the}} susceptibility due to either type of field have been interpreted without any assumption regarding the presence of vortices in the material. From the in-phase susceptibility data, <b>saturation</b> <b>values</b> show that increasing the AC field strength causes a decrease in shielding ability and a persistence of intergranular losses to lower temperatures. The intergranular loss peaks in the out of phase susceptibility data show shifting to lower temperature {{in accordance with the}} in-phase data. Increasing the DC field strength does not cause the <b>saturation</b> <b>values</b> to decrease, but rather, <b>saturation</b> <b>values</b> remain at the same level for the in-phase susceptibility data, showing consistency in the sample’s shielding ability. However, increasing DC field strength increases the peak height for the intergranular loss peaks, but the peak does not shift to lower temperatures, thus greater energy is expended to shield the DC excitation, but without causing losses to persist to lower temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The use of Archie {{interpretation}} {{model to}} estimate water saturation in clean formation has successfully been useful over the years. However, in shaly sand formation this model yields inaccurate S_w estimates (overestimate) due to shale or clay effects. Many shaly sand interpretation {{models have been}} developed, unfortunately; there is no unique model that appears to fit all shaly sand reservoirs. A comparison study of water saturation on well 7220 / 8 - 1 was carried out using four different saturation models (Archie, Indonesian, Simandoux, and Modified Simandoux). Formation permeability was then estimated using two NMR models (Timur-Coates and SDR). The results from the study {{have shown that the}} average water <b>saturation</b> <b>values</b> from Archie model were higher (14. 3 %) than that of shaly models. The Indonesian models yields water <b>saturation</b> <b>values</b> close to that given by Archie model of about 13. 6 % average. Again the result from the Simandoux model (12. 8 %) which is slightly lower than that of Archie model but close to Indonesian model. The even lowest average water <b>saturation</b> <b>values</b> were given by the Modified Simandoux model (9. 8 %). The average permeability values were 1837. 308 mD and 566. 1611 mD for Timur-Coates and SDR models respectively. Because of the lowest average water <b>saturation</b> <b>values</b> given by the Modified Simandoux model relative to base model (Archie), this is the best model to be applied for the study. The Timur-Coates model is the best model for the study due to good agreement with the core-derived permeability.

HSV and HSL improve on the color cube representation of RGB by arranging colors of each hue in a radial slice, around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top.

The contrast ratio increases as the voltage goes up until a <b>saturation</b> <b>value</b> is reached.
