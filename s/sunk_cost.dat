Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as Telcordia and Ericsson have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications {{service providers}} to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available network bandwidth. Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry. The approach can {{be more difficult to}} implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers. Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large <b>sunk</b> <b>cost</b> combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell. Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn’t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as real time policy and real-time charging, and using new marketing channels to target consumers [...] with innovative services.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sunk</b> <b>cost</b> is {{distinct}} from economic loss. For example, when a new car is purchased, it can subsequently be resold; however, it will probably not be resold for the original purchase price. The economic loss is the difference (including transaction costs). The sum originally paid should not affect any rational future decision-making about the car, regardless of the resale value: if the owner can derive more value from selling the car than not selling it, then it should be sold, regardless of the price paid. In this sense, the <b>sunk</b> <b>cost</b> is not a precise quantity, but an economic term for a sum paid, in the past, which is no longer relevant to decisions about the future; it may be used inconsistently in quantitative terms as the original cost or the expected economic loss. It may {{also be used as}} shorthand for an error in analysis due to the <b>sunk</b> <b>cost</b> fallacy, irrational decision-making or, most simply, as irrelevant data.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} {{for research on}} corporate strategy and restructuring in economic geography which focuses explicitly upon the role of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> is proposed. The management of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> in contrasting 'domains of competition' is discussed, and fifteen analytical propositions about the economic and spatial logic of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> are outlined. Claims are advanced that the logic of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> can accommodate both spatial fixity and spatial plasticity and can help bridge the separate, apparently distinctive, notions of restructuring and post-Fordism. Illustrative examples are drawn from both the manufacturing and service sectors. The regional effects of alternative corporate strategies with respect to <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> and {{an assessment of the}} increasing significance of new financial instruments designed to liberate firms from the history and geography of production are outlined.

40|$|Although {{the notion}} of costs is a major {{mechanism}} in economic theory explaining the industrial organization, costs associated with various forms of inter-firm relationships have been largely neglected in the literature. This paper deals with {{the notion of}} <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> related to networks of inter-firm relationships with a focus on the dynamics of the network structures. Two perspectives of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> will be developed. First, the impact of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> on inter-firm relationships here referred to as ‘relation specific sunk costs’. Second, the role of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> in the processes of specialization and division of labor referred to as ‘industry specific sunk costs’. The first perspective aims to show that <b>costs</b> <b>sunk</b> in a relationship provide a fundamental mechanism for network relationships and constitute a basic condition for trust, stability, reduction of opportunism, and reduction of cognitive distances. The level of <b>costs</b> <b>sunk</b> in a relationship, although matter of subjective judgement, function as the “glue ” of networks. At the same time, the level of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> impedes the dynamics of network relationships since it becomes a threshold for change. The second perspective aims to show that the dynamics of network relationships are impeded by costs that have to be sunk when entering new activities or <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> leading to exit costs when terminating current activities. While the first perspective discuss changes of relationships without change in the division of labor, the second perspective stress the impact of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> when change of division of labor occurs. Of course, both situations may occur concurrently and cause similar effects on the dynamics of the networks. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> {{affect a}} financially {{constrained}} incumbent's ability to deter entry into its market. <b>Sunk</b> <b>costs</b> {{make it less}} attractive to the incumbent to accommodate entry by liquidating assets in place and exiting the market. This may render entry by a prospective rival unprofitable, and thereby facilitate entry deterrence. However, <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> also {{make it harder for}} the incumbent to pledge valuable collateral to outside investors. To make up for the poor collateral value, the incumbent will have to give stronger liquidation rights to its lenders. Consequently, a larger fraction of the incumbent's assets will be liquidated {{in the event of a}} liquidity default. This potentially creates room for profitable entry. The overall effect of <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> on the incumbent's ability to deter entry into its market is thus ambiguous. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{very large}} panel dataset of Italian {{manufacturing}} firms, we test an empirical model of foreign markets participation with <b>sunk</b> <b>costs.</b> The period of analysis (1982 - 1999) is exceptionally informative: the large fluctuations in the lira exchange rate determined substantial flows of firms {{in and out of}} foreign markets. We find that <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> of exporting are very important: past experience in foreign markets increases the probability of exporting by about 70 percentage points. Although the assets entailing such costs depreciate quite slowly, new exporters have to acquire them very soon after entry. Altogether, these results suggest that the break in the Italian aggregate export supply function caused by the depreciation of the 1990 s can be considerable and long-lasting. We then relate <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> to firm size and find that they are an important barrier to export, especially for the myriad of Italian small and medium firms.
