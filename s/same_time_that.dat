After leaving Temple Sinai, he became chaplain at San Quentin State Prison.|$|E
5|$|Swimwear and {{underwear}} have similar design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and at about the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.|$|E
50|$|Retail {{operations}} in the low-carbon economy will have several new features. One will be high-efficiency lighting such as compact fluorescent, halogen, and eventually LED light sources. Many retail stores will also feature roof-top solar panel arrays. These make sense because solar panels produce the most energy during the daytime and during the summer. These are the <b>same</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> electricity {{is the most expensive}} and also the <b>same</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> stores use the most electricity.|$|R

5|$|At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Hyakutake's {{troops were}} attacking the Lunga perimeter, Japanese {{warships}} under the overall direction of Isoroku Yamamoto {{moved into a}} position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to Hyakutake's ground offensive. Allied naval carrier forces in the area, now {{under the command of}} William Halsey, Jr. who had replaced Ghormley, also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle.|$|E

Some of the CAF aircraft also mistakenly attacked Hanneken's men, causing several deaths and injuries to the Marines.|$|E

5|$|At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> {{the first}} issue of New Worlds appeared, a {{separate}} British magazine called Fantasy was launched by Walter Gillings, a science fiction fan and a reporter by profession. Fantasy lasted for only three issues before dying in 1947, but Gillings had accumulated a substantial inventory of stories—enough to fill nine issues. Gillings followed the demise of Fantasy by publishing a fanzine, titled Fantasy Review, beginning in March 1947.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the {{landings}} on Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo {{were taking}} place, Allied troops were also landing on nearby Guadalcanal, {{with the objective}} of capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces. In contrast to the intense fighting on Tulagi and Gavutu, the landings on Guadalcanal were essentially unopposed. The landings on both Tulagi and Guadalcanal initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area.|$|E

Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the {{division}} was composed of Japan's four oldest battleships, including Fusō, accompanied by two light cruisers, 12 destroyers, and two oilers. Official records do not show the division as part of the larger Midway operation, known as Operation AL; they were to accompany the fleet under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, but were only to provide support to the Aleutian task force if needed.|$|E
5|$|Gifu's {{most famous}} castle is Gifu Castle, located on Mount Kinka. First {{built by the}} Nikaidō clan during the Kamakura period, the castle has gone through many forms, with its current version rebuilt in 1956.

The next resident, Oda Nobunaga, changed the castle's name at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he changed the name of the surrounding town. From the top of the castle, visitors have a 360-degree view, effectively giving them a view to all of the city's borders. Inside the castle are many artifacts from its past.|$|E

5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand has {{encountered}} {{a number of}} problems since its redevelopment; {{at the beginning of the}} 1999–2000 season, a series of support poles and stanchions had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand. During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the seating capacity in the paddock.|$|E

In November, Seitz and another American liaison officer, Captain Walter R. Mansfield, {{conducted}} {{a tour of}} inspection of Chetnik areas, including that of Lukačević. During their tour they witnessed fighting between Chetniks and Partisans. Due to their relative freedom of movement, the Americans assumed that the Chetniks controlled the territory they moved through. However, despite the praise that Seitz expressed for Lukačević, the Chetnik leader was collaborating with the Germans at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he was hosting the visiting Americans.|$|E
