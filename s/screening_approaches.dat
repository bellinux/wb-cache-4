When compared to alternative methods used for gene knockdowns or knockouts, such as RNAi, zinc finger nucleases or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), the application of CRISPR-based perturbations enables more specificity, efficiency and ease of use. Another advantage of this protocol is that while most <b>screening</b> <b>approaches</b> can only assay for simple phenotypes, such as cellular viability, scRNA-seq allows for a much richer phenotypic readout, with quantitative measurements of gene expression in many cells simultaneously.|$|E

[...] Other domains include the N-terminal candidate PEST domain, Enhancer of polycomb-like domain and the C-terminal nuclear localization (NLS) signal (prosite.expasy.org). JADE1 protein is {{a target for}} post translational modifications, including phosphorylation (Fig 1). Six amino acid residues were identified to be phosphorylated in cell cycle-dependent manner via Aurora A kinase pathway. JADE1 is a target of phosphorylation by Casein kinase 2 (CK2). In addition, multiple phosphorylation sites are found by high throughput <b>screening</b> <b>approaches</b> and in silico analysis.

50|$|He also {{pioneered the}} field of ligand {{homology}} modeling with his threading based, FINDSITE approach for protein function inference, binding site prediction and virtual ligand screening. The research showed that remotely related proteins identified by threading often share a common ligand binding site occupied by chemically similar ligands that contain strongly conserved anchor functional {{groups as well as}} a variable region that accounts for their binding specificity. These insights enable low-resolution predicted structures to be used for ligand screening/binding pose prediction, with comparable accuracy as with high-resolution experimental structures. In virtual ligand screening, the latest version, FINDSITEcomb, was shown to work far better than more traditional virtual <b>screening</b> <b>approaches</b> on both predicted and high resolution experimental structures.|$|E

As a consequence, in conjunction with insulin administrations, the prime requirement for diabetic patients is to regularly monitor their blood glucose levels. The monitoring systems currently in general use have the drawback of below optimal number of readings, due to their reliance on a drop of fresh blood. Some continuous glucose monitors are commercially available, but suffer from the severe drawback of a short working life of the probe. The majority of these work amperometrically. As a result, there is an effort to create a sensor that relies on a different mechanism, such as via external infrared spectroscopy or via fluorescent biosensors [...]Various strategies exist to detect glucose levels using fluorescence, the first and most common being a [...] competition assay between glucose and a labelled glucose polymer for the binding site of Concanavalin A.Over the years, using a combination of rational design and <b>screening</b> <b>approaches,</b> many possible combinations of fluorescent sensor for glucose have been studied with varying degrees of success: In most approaches, the glucose concentration is translated into a change in fluorescence either by using a [...] pair or by using environment sensitive (solvatochromic) dyes in a variety of combinations, the fluorescent small molecule, protein or quantum dot have been used in conjunction with a glucose binding moiety either a boronic acid functionalized fluorophore or a protein, such as glucose oxidase, concanavalin A, glucose/galactose-binding protein, glucose dehydrogenase and glucokinase.In general, the change seen with [...] competition assays is small (see below).|$|E
50|$|Studies {{analyzing}} native complexes of INhibitor of Growth (ING) PHD finger {{family of}} proteins revealed that ING4 and ING5 proteins {{are associated with}} JADE1S and HAT HBO1, while ING3 is associated with EPC1 (JADE1 homolog), TIP60 (HBO1 homolog) and several other partners. Both complexes also included a small Eaf6 protein. The biochemical and in silico analysis of complexes formed by HBO1 and TIP60 suggested common architecture and supported the role for JADE1 in bulk histone H4 acetylation. Characterization of JADE1 and HBO1 functional interactions show structural and functional similarities between the complexes(16, 19). Similarly to TIP60, JADE1 and HBO1 mutually stabilize each other. JADE1 binds to and enables HBO1 to enhance global histone H4 acetylation, which requires intact PHD2 finger.Similarly to HBO1, JADE1 is responsible for bulk histone H4 acetylation in cultured cells. H4K5, H4K12, and most likely H4K8 are targets of JADE1-dependent acetylation in cultured cells and in vivo.Several potential transcription targets of JADE1 have been suggested from experiments using <b>screening</b> <b>approaches.</b> According to screening genomic analysis done by ChIP-chip assay JADE1L complex is found mainly along the coding regions of many genes and JADE1L abundance correlates mostly with H3K36me3 histone mark. JADE1L over expression correlates with increased quantities of H4acK8 in the coding region of many genes. The two PHD zinc fingers of JADE1 appear to bind preferentially non-methylated N-terminal peptide of histone.JADE1 isoforms assemble at least two different complexes, JADE1L-HBO1-ING4/5 and JADE1S-HBO1 complex. Due {{to the lack of}} the C-terminal fragment, JADE1S is incapable of binding ING4/5 partners. A small less characterized protein Eaf6 is also another component of JADE1 complexes.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a so-called <b>screening</b> <b>approach</b> for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A <b>screening</b> <b>approach</b> is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, {{we use a}} flat connectionist analysis. This <b>screening</b> <b>approach</b> aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system {{which is based on}} this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.

40|$|Abstract Background High-throughput genetic <b>screening</b> <b>approaches</b> {{have enabled}} {{systematic}} means {{to study how}} interactions among gene mutations contribute to quantitative fitness phenotypes, {{with the aim of}} providing insights into the functional wiring diagrams of genetic interaction networks on a global scale. However, it is poorly known how well these quantitative interaction measurements agree across the <b>screening</b> <b>approaches,</b> which hinders their integrated use toward improving the coverage and quality of the genetic interaction maps in yeast and other organisms. Results Using large-scale data matrices from epistatic miniarray profiling (E-MAP), genetic interaction mapping (GIM), and synthetic genetic array (SGA) approaches, we carried out here a systematic comparative evaluation among these quantitative maps of genetic interactions in yeast. The relatively low association between the original interaction measurements or their customized scores could be improved using a matrix-based modelling framework, which enables the use of single- and double-mutant fitness estimates and measurements, respectively, when scoring genetic interactions. Toward an integrative analysis, we show how the detections from the different <b>screening</b> <b>approaches</b> can be combined to suggest novel positive and negative interactions which are complementary to those obtained using any single screening approach alone. The matrix approximation procedure has been made available to support the design and analysis of the future screening studies. Conclusions We have shown here that even if the correlation between the currently available quantitative genetic interaction maps in yeast is relatively low, their comparability can be improved by means of our computational matrix approximation procedure, which will enable integrative analysis and detection of a wider spectrum of genetic interactions using data from the complementary <b>screening</b> <b>approaches.</b> </p...|$|E
