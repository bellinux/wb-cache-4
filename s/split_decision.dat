40|$|Lot {{splitting}} {{refers to}} breaking a production lot into smaller sublots during production. Coordinating lot <b>splitting</b> <b>decisions</b> across multiple {{stages of a}} production process is a challenging task. Traditional lot splitting and lot streaming models implicitly assume that the entire system is operated and owned by the same firm, or there exists a coordinator who controls the operation of all machines in the system. In this paper, we consider the situation where the machines in a multiple-stage production process are owned and managed by different companies. Every item in a given production lot {{has to go through}} the processing by the supplier's machine, followed by the manufacturer's machine, and so on. We develop and analyze coordination mechanisms that enable different parties in the supply chain to coordinate their lot <b>splitting</b> <b>decisions</b> so as to achieve a systemwide optimum.

5000|$|In {{the past}} Halley stated that she {{identifies}} increasingly with {{and as a}} gay man and published an article on queer theory under the name Ian Halley. In <b>Split</b> <b>Decisions</b> she described herself as:"A sex-positive postmodernist, only rarely and intermittently feminist, a skeptic about identity politics, with a strong attraction to [...] "queer" [...] revelations of the strangeness and unknowability of social and sexual life, and a deep distrust of slave-moralistic pretensions to identity-political [...] "powerlessness"".|$|R
5|$|Wallhead {{made his}} BAMMA debut at BAMMA 7 against Frank Trigg. Trigg {{was set to}} face Tom 'Kong' Watson for Watson's middleweight title, but Watson {{suffered}} a back injury forcing his withdrawal and allowing Wallhead to step up as his replacement. In the opening round, Wallhead caught Trigg with a left hook which appeared to hurt him, before executing a successful takedown. He ended the first round landing ground-and-pound shots which opened up a cut on Trigg's cheek. The second round saw Wallhead land the stronger strikes, but less often than Trigg. The final round was also close, though Wallhead once again managed to rock Trigg early in the round. The fight went to the judges, where Wallhead won via <b>split</b> <b>decision</b> (29-28, 28-29 and 30-27).|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{knocked out}} Bob Young {{in the second}} round in Boston in his only fight in 1959. A year later, he defended his title against Paul Pender. Robinson entered the fight as a 5–1 favorite, but lost a <b>split</b> <b>decision</b> in front of 10,608 at Boston Garden. The day before the fight Pender commented that he planned to start slowly, before coming on late. He did just that and outlasted the aging Robinson, who, despite opening a cut over Pender's eye in the eighth round, was largely {{ineffective}} in the later rounds. An attempt to regain the crown for an unheard of sixth time proved beyond Robinson. Despite Robinson's efforts, Pender won by decision in that rematch. On December 3 of that year, Robinson and Fullmer fought a 15-round draw for the WBA middleweight title, which Fullmer retained. In 1961, Robinson and Fullmer fought for a fourth time, with Fullmer retaining the WBA middleweight title by a unanimous decision. The fight would be Robinson's last title bout.|$|E
5|$|The European Championship was Razer's next—and final—televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a revised version of the lifting hook. Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked it up with the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a <b>split</b> <b>decision</b> the team decided this was unfair and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E

40|$|In {{a handful}} of cases, {{including}} one from last Term, the United States Supreme Court was divided between upholding, remanding, and overturning a lower court decision, with no majority in favor {{of any of these}} three dispositions.
