40|$|According to {{the famous}} Kibble-Zurek {{mechanism}} (KZM), the universality of <b>spontaneous</b> defect <b>generation</b> in continuous phase transitions (CPTs) can be understood by the critical slowing down. In most CPTs of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), the universality of <b>spontaneous</b> defect <b>generations</b> has been explained by the divergent relaxation time associated with the nontrivial gapless Bogoliubov excitations. However, for atomic BECs in synthetic gauge fields, their spontaneous superfluidity breakdown is resulted from the divergent correlation length associated with the zero Landau critical velocity. Here, by considering an atomic BEC ladder subjected to a synthetic magnetic field, we reveal that the spontaneous superfluidity breakdown obeys the KZM. The Kibble-Zurek scalings are derived from the Landau critical velocity which determines the correlation length. In further, the critical exponents are numerically extracted from the critical spatial-temporal dynamics of the bifurcation delay and the <b>spontaneous</b> vortex <b>generation.</b> Our study provides a general way to explore and understand the spontaneous superfluidity breakdown in CPTs from a single-well dispersion to a double-well one, such as, BECs in synthetic gauge fields, spin-orbit coupled BECs, and BECs in shaken optical lattices.

5|$|By the mid-1850s the {{miasma theory}} of disease was largely {{superseded}} by the germ theory of disease, creating extensive interest in microorganisms and {{their interactions with}} other forms of life. By the 1880s, bacteriology was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of Robert Koch, who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on agar gels containing specific nutrients in Petri dishes. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (<b>spontaneous</b> <b>generation)</b> was attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) exposed boiled broths to the air, in {{vessels that}} {{contained}} a filter to prevent particles from passing {{through to the}} growth medium, and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not {{come in contact with}} the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths {{at the beginning of his}} experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generation</b> and supported the germ theory of disease.|$|E
5|$|Over the 18th and 19th centuries, {{biological}} sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began {{to connect the}} animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided {{a new perspective on}} the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generation</b> {{and the rise of the}} germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{reviewed}} empirical studies on student question generation in the classroom.

We found that most previous intervention studies focused upon the use of prompts by teachers to generate questions from children, but no study ever attempted to identify the factors that allow them to spontaneously generate questions. Finally, we proposed the following educational interventions for promoting <b>spontaneous</b> question <b>generation</b> in students: (1) Teachers should provide a classroom atmosphere and opportunities for students to more easily experience and comfortably express their perplexed feelings when any question arises, and (2) teachers need training regarding methods aimed so that at more <b>spontaneous</b> question <b>generation</b> by students...|$|R

5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generation</b> produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck {{did not believe that}} all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by <b>spontaneous</b> <b>generation.</b> He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{study of}} long wave scattering in a canal with a rapidly varying cross-section is presented. It {{is assumed that}} waves propagate on a stationary current with a given flow rate. Due to the fixed flow rate, the current speed is different in the different sections of the canal, upstream and downstream. The scattering coefficients (the transmission and reflection coefficients) are calculated for all possible orientations of incident wave {{with respect to the}} background current (downstream and upstream propagation) and for all possible regimes of current (subcritical, transcritical, and supercritical). It is shown that in some cases negative energy waves can appear in the process of waves scattering. The conditions are found when the overreflection and over-transmission phenomena occur. In particular, it is shown that a <b>spontaneous</b> wave <b>generation</b> can arise in a trans-critical accelerating flow, when the background current enhances due to the canal narrowing. This resembles a <b>spontaneous</b> wave <b>generation</b> on the horizon of an evaporating black hole due to the Hawking effect. Comment: 28 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|We investigate, numerically and experimentally, {{the effect}} of thermo-optical (TO) chaos on direct soliton {{generation}} (DSG) in microresonators. When the pump laser is scanned from blue to red and then stopped at a fixed wavelength, {{we find that the}} solitons generated sometimes remain (survive) and sometimes annihilate subsequent {{to the end of the}} scan. We refer to the possibility of these different outcomes arising under identical laser scan conditions as coexistence of soliton annihilation and survival. Numerical simulations that include the thermal dynamics show that the coexistence of soliton annihilation and survival is explained by TO chaos accompanying comb generation. The random fluctuations of the cavity resonance occurring under TO chaos are also found to trigger <b>spontaneous</b> soliton <b>generation</b> after the laser scan ends. The coexistence of soliton annihilation and survival as well as <b>spontaneous</b> soliton <b>generation</b> are observed experimentally in a silicon-nitride microresonator.

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>spontaneous</b> gap <b>generation</b> for gapless nodal fermions within an {{effective}} gauge field theory of high temperature superconductors. When superconductivity appears, the gauge boson acquires a finite mass via Anderson-Higgs mechanism. <b>Spontaneous</b> nodal gap <b>generation</b> takes place if the gauge boson mass ξ is zero {{or less than}} a critical value ξ_c but is suppressed by a larger gauge boson mass. The generated nodal gap prohibits the appearance of low-energy fermion excitations and leads to antiferromagnetic order. Using the fact that gauge boson mass ξ is proportional to superfluid density and doping concentration, we build one mechanism that provides a unified understanding of the finite single particle gap along the nodal direction in lightly doped cuprates, the competition and coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity, and the thermal metal-to-insulator transition from the superconducting state to the field-induced normal state in underdoped cuprates.
