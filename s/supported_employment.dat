Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E

Depending on the injury, treatment required may be minimal or may include interventions such as medications, emergency surgery or surgery years later. Physical therapy, speech therapy, recreation therapy, occupational therapy and vision therapy may be employed for rehabilitation. Counseling, <b>supported</b> <b>employment,</b> and community support services may also be useful.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, <b>supported</b> <b>employment</b> and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is <b>support</b> <b>employment</b> for people in {{disadvantaged}} groups. The objectives set in the paper were to assess the quality of services in <b>support</b> <b>employment</b> provided by public corporation MESADA in Jindřichův Hradec, Czech Republic and provide a list of suggested socio-technical recommendations {{in order to improve}} the above-mentioned services. The theoretical part includes the history of <b>support</b> <b>employment,</b> definitions of disadvantaged groups of people, symbols, standards, and the whole process of <b>support</b> <b>employment.</b> The final part gives a review of MESADA projects. The practical part deals with a survey. Conclusions of the thesis are based on the quantitative survey { [...] } the data were collected from questionnaires filled in by users of the <b>support</b> <b>employment</b> services provided by public corporation MESADA Jindřichův Hradec between November 2007 and late February 2008. Next, the author used the document analysis method. Statitistical data were gathered from Czech Statistical Office and statistical data collected by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. The hypotheses that were put forward in order to find out whether the service users find this worthful and quality and whether this service meets their needs were proven correct. The outcome of the survey and the list of suggested measures to be taken in order to improve the service might be found useful in optimizing the <b>support</b> <b>employment</b> service provided not only by p. c. MESADA Jindřichův Hradec, but also in its other branches in the region of South Bohemia...|$|R
