500|$|In the poem, Anactoria is absent, {{though it}} is not evident from the {{surviving}} lines exactly why. [...] One suggestion is that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>left</b> Sappho in order to marry.

[...] Eric Dodson-Robinson suggests that the poem could have been performed at a wedding, with Anactoria the bride leaving her family and friends. George Koniaris disagrees, arguing that there is [...] "no special reason" [...] to believe that Anactoria left Sappho for a man. [...] Glen Most goes further, saying that {{there is no reason to}} believe that Anactoria's absence was anything more than temporary.|$|E

The song never repeats a section. In two minutes and forty-eight seconds, it goes through seven movements with distinct melodies and chord progressions. The first two sections are sixteen bars each; the rest are only eight bars. In comparison to the standard form of pop songs in AABA — where A represents a standard verse, and B represents a variation, usually {{referred to as the}} bridge — [...] "In Dreams", with each variation, can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F.|$|E

[...] Shields believes that the word [...] "light" [...] is significant to her as it marks her African history, a past that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>left</b> physically behind.|$|E
