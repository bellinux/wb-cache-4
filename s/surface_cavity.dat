In addition to demonstrating that the observed resonances are non-radiative and decoupled to bulk radiation, which is critical for high Q cavities, it is also shown the possibility to tune the <b>surface</b> <b>cavity</b> resonance spectra simply by varying the defect width. Such an ability to excite <b>surface</b> <b>cavity</b> resonance that is non-radiative with simultaneous localization of the electric field together with {{the advantage of a}} cavity that is physically formed from a completely monolithic and uniform material offers unique opportunities for widespread applications for example in actuation, detection, and phonon lasing that can be fully integrated with other physical systems such as quantum acoustics, photonics, and microfluidics...|$|E

The microstructures of {{three kinds of}} defects: notches on single crystal, <b>surface</b> <b>cavity</b> and crack, after healing by oxidation in air at 1200 °C, were investigated in detail {{with the aid of}} scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with a focused ion beam cross-section milling technique. The notch-healing results demonstrate an effective healing effect due to the predominant Al 2 O 3 phase filling in the notch with a dense microstructure. The microstructure of oxides filled in the <b>surface</b> <b>cavity</b> depends on {{the size and shape of}} the cavity. The largest cavity that can be healed at 1200 °C solely by Al 2 O 3 is about 10 µm in width. A multi-layered microstructure of oxide scales was observed on the cleavage plane of Ti 2 AlC grains, whereas the microstructure of oxides formed on the non-cleavage area was more complicated due to the anisotropic oxidation behavior of layered Ti 2 AlC. The oxidation driven healing mechanism and factors affecting the healing efficiency of Ti 2 AlC were discussed in detail. ...|$|E
40|$|Signals {{generated}} by cryptochrome (CRY) blue-light photoreceptors {{are responsible for}} a variety of developmental and circadian responses in plants. The CRYs are also identified as circadian blue-light photoreceptors in Drosophila and components of the mammalian circadian clock. These flavoproteins all have an N-terminal domain that is similar to photolyase, and most have an additional C-terminal domain of variable length. We present here the crystal structure of the photolyase-like domain of CRY- 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. The structure reveals a fold that is very similar to photolyase, with a single molecule of FAD noncovalently bound to the protein. The surface features of the protein and the dissimilarity of a <b>surface</b> <b>cavity</b> to that of photolyase account for its lack of DNA-repair activity. Previous in vitro experiments established that the photolyase-like domain of CRY- 1 can bind Mg·ATP, and we observe a single molecule of an ATP analog bound in the aforementioned <b>surface</b> <b>cavity,</b> near the bound FAD cofactor.

40|$|Modelling {{of partial}} {{discharge}} (PD) events allows {{a better understanding}} of the phenomena itself. In this work, an improved model representing PD behaviour within a spherical cavity in a homogeneous dielectric material has been developed to study the influence of <b>cavity</b> <b>surface</b> charge distribution on the electric field distribution in the cavity. Comparison of measurement and simulation results has been undertaken to validate the model. The model uses a two-dimensional axial symmetric Finite Element Analysis method, which is solved for local electric potentials. The model geometry consists of a homogenous dielectric material and a spherical cavity. The upper and lower <b>cavity</b> <b>surfaces</b> are divided into 10 boundaries each to model charge distribution along the cavity wall. Discharge is assumed to occur along the symmetry axis in the cavity. Once the discharge has passed through the cavity to the opposite surface, it is assumed that charge then propagates along the upper and lower <b>cavity</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Charge distribution is assumed symmetrical on the upper and lower <b>cavity</b> <b>surfaces.</b> During discharge, charge density increases on the <b>cavity</b> <b>surface</b> boundaries where charge propagates, until the field in the cavity centre is less than the extinction field. To model the charge movement along the cavity wall through conduction at other times, the change in the charge density on each <b>cavity</b> <b>surface</b> boundary is set as dependent on the <b>cavity</b> <b>surface</b> conductivity. Thus, <b>cavity</b> <b>surface</b> charge distribution will influence the electric field distribution in the cavity, affecting the likelihood of the next PD event...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{have been}} used to study a collective atomic transport phenomenon by repeated Ar$^+$ irradiations in the Ti/Pt interfacial system. The ion-induced injection of surface atoms to the bulk, the ejection of bulk atoms to the top layers together with surface erosion is strongly enhanced by interfacial mixing. This process leads to a dense interfacial material, and broadening of the interface region. The process scales with the relative difference of the atomic masses. We find that surface roughening and interfacial mixing is strongly coupled via an enhanced counterflow material transport normal to the surface which might be a novel surface damage mechanism. This cooperative phenomenon is active when the bilayer system is subjected to a high dose ion irradiation (multiple ion irradiations) and leads to <b>surface</b> <b>cavity</b> growth.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{multiscale}} approach {{to simulate the}} impact of a solid object on a liquid surface: upon impact a thin liquid sheet is thrown upwards all around the rim of the impactor while in its wake a large <b>surface</b> <b>cavity</b> forms. Under the influence of hydrostatic pressure the cavity immediately starts to collapse and eventually closes in a single point from which a thin, needle-like jet is ejected. Existing numerical treatments of liquid impact either consider the surrounding air as an incompressible fluid or neglect air effects altogether. In contrast, our approach couples a boundary-integral method for the liquid with a Roe scheme for the gas domain and is thus able to handle the fully compressible gas stream that is pushed out of the collapsing impact cavity. Taking into account air compressibility is crucial, since, as we show in this work, the impact crater collapses so violently that the air flow through the cavity neck attains supersonic velocities already at cavity diameters larger than 1 mm. Our computational results are validated through corresponding experimental data. Comment: Submitted to Comput Mec...|$|E

We present a dispersion-corrected (D 3) DFT study of the adsorption and activation of molecular nitrogen and hydrogen on Co 3 Mo 3 N-(111) surfaces to identify possible activation sites for ammonia synthesis. H 2 was found to adsorb both molecularly on the Mo 3 N framework and dissociatively on Co 8 clusters or Mo 3 clusters that were exposed due to N-vacancies.

40|$|The {{covalent}} attachment of heme cofactors to the apo-polypeptides via thioether {{bonds is}} unique to the maturation of c-type cytochromes. A number of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases prepare the apocytochrome for heme insertion in system I and II cytochrome c maturation. Although most thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases are nonspecific, the less common, specific thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases may be key to directing the usage of electrons. Here we demonstrate that unlike other thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, the protein responsible for reducing oxidized apocytochrome c in Bacillus subtilis, ResA, is specific for cytochrome c 550 and utilizes alternate conformations to recognize redox partners. We report solution NMR evidence that ResA undergoes a redox-dependent conformational change between oxidation states, as well as data showing that ResA utilizes a <b>surface</b> <b>cavity</b> present only in the reduced state to recognize a peptide derived from cytochrome c 550.

Absorption spectra show a modification of the optical properties {{as a function of}} coverage, i. e. appearance of a shoulder around 505 nm followed by a saturation of the intensity of this signal observed at higher coverages. We attribute this shoulder to the change of the molecular orientation between the first and the second monolayer and thus to an interfacial effect. These results are confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) measurements where the bis-pyrene molecules have been deposited on Au(111) at room temperature (RT) and onto a cold substrate. Independently of the temperature in the range from 210 K to RT, the first monolayer is always highly organized. At low temperature bis-pyrene molecules constituting the second monolayer are randomly distributed, suggesting that self-organisation is kinetically hindered. Deposited at room temperature, the molecular diffusion is enhanced and the formation of an organized second layer takes place after storing the sample for 150 minutes at room temperature.
