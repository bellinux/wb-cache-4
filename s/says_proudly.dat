60|$|Is there a man's {{heart that}} hears {{it without a}} thrill? The many-voiced {{responsive}} hum or bellow of these multitudes is not of triumph; {{and yet it is}} a sound deeper than triumph. But when the long Cavalcade and Proclamation ended; and our huge Flag was fixed on the Pont Neuf, another like it on the Hotel-de-Ville, to wave there till better days; and each Municipal sat in the centre of his Section, in a Tent raised in some open square, Tent surmounted with flags of Patrie en danger, and topmost of all a Pike and Bonnet Rouge; and, on two drums in front of him, there lay a plank-table, and on this an open Book, and a Clerk sat, like recording-angel, ready to write the Lists, or as we say to enlist! O, then, it seems, the very gods might have looked down on it. Young Patriotism, Culottic and Sansculottic, rushes forward emulous: That is my name; name, blood, and life, is all my Country's; why have I nothing more! Youths of short stature weep that they are below size. Old men come forward, a son in each hand. Mothers themselves will grant the son of their travail; send him, though with tears. And the multitude bellows Vive la Patrie, far reverberating. And fire flashes in the eyes of men;--and at eventide, your Municipal returns to the Townhall, followed by his long train of volunteer Valour; hands in his List: <b>says</b> <b>proudly,</b> looking round. This is my day's harvest. (Tableau de la Revolution, para Patrie en Danger.) They will march, on the morrow, to Soissons; small bundle holding all their chattels.|$|E

Hunters at a camp are laughing at the story which Baron Munchausen is telling about him hunting a deer and shooting it with a cherry pit but suddenly they see a noble animal with a cherry tree in place of horns appear from the woods. The Baron <b>says</b> <b>proudly</b> that he became famous not for his exploits but for the fact that he never lies. He really can't lie and is sickened by the idea to lie for personal benefit or [...] "out of politeness".|$|E

When Angela points out to Phyllis {{that she made}} a spelling mistake in the sign [...] "Lunch Party" [...] and bought the wrong plastic utensils, Phyllis attempts to calmly reason with her, which only infuriates Angela to insult Phyllis further. Later on, Phyllis confronts her with numerous Post-It notes stuck onto her fingertips containing Angela's demands, claiming she can only fulfill one, not all of them. When Angela insults her again, Phyllis crumples all the notes into one ball and throws it at Angela's face. Afterwards, Phyllis <b>says</b> <b>proudly,</b> [...] "That seemed to shut her up." ...|$|E

One day he sneaks up and observes her in a scene {{dominating}} a man tied to a chair.

50|$|In 1859, a book {{reviewer}} of Meschach Browning’s newly published book {{noted that}} his family, founded in 1800, had increased “fifty {{years later to}} one hundred and twenty-two, of whom sixty-seven, as their progenitor <b>says</b> <b>proudly,</b> were ‘capable of bearing arms for the defence of their country,’— though, to be sure, the Harper's Ferry affair leaves us in some doubt as to {{the direction in which}} they would bear them.”Meshach Browning’s account of his fight with an unexpectedly formidable buck in the Youghiogheny River inspired Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait (1819-1905) — the great Adirondack artist and deer hunter — to paint the scene in 1861 (The Life of a Hunter: Catching a Tartar). The same year Currier and Ives published a hand-colored lithograph of Tait’s black and white painting, thus immortalizing the incident.A Maryland Historical Marker states Browning was Garrett County's most famous hunter, killing 2,000 deer and 500 bear during this 40-year period. This marker lies within eyesight of Browning's grave at St. Dominic's Catholic Cemetery in Hoye, Maryland.|$|E

The song is [...] "a dizzy rush of a solo track that finds fun ways to {{play around with}} the idea that we’re all on the internet way too much". Mai Lan explained that [...] "This song came to life after a running joke we used to make with Max when we were recording the album in New York. Every time we'd do something 'technical' (it was most of the time stupid stuff) we'd snap and <b>say</b> <b>proudly</b> 'technique'."

50|$|Poe is {{depicted}} as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern {{rather than at the}} hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, <b>saying</b> <b>proudly</b> he has already raised $1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the $1,000 he had collected.|$|R
5000|$|Amadeus {{was born}} Antwan Thompson {{and grew up}} in the Clearmont Village section of the Bronx, New York. His parents {{invested}} in his interest in music is his local church to keep him out of trouble in the neighborhood. This led to THom. and by 2000, he created his own production company, Platinum Boy Music, Inc. [...] Thompson's parents forebode him from getting close with the landmark, a protective gesture he didn't agree with at the time. Today, Thompson has built a success-filled, multi-platinum selling career thanks to his productive commitment to creating music. He understands his parents keeping him from that cross-section allowed him to span the globe, achieving a great deal more than territorial street credibility. [...] To the recording industry Thompson is always posted at the intersection of personal and professional respect, coupled with bankable audio mastery, it’s the reason {{he is one of the}} most sought-after producers in the recording industry today. “Creating music for the world is one of the most exciting accomplishments for me, and just seeing people love and appreciate your music,” he says. The best artists and companies today express their love and appreciation for Thompson by making his service their top choice. Emmy-winning sports television network ESPN enlisted him to score their top rated Monday Night Football broadcasts. Thompson also produced the theme for their acclaimed daytime program, First Take, which stars popular analysts Stephen A. Smith and Skip Bayless. Maybach Music Group recording artist Wale performs the lyrics to Thompson’s score. [...] Thompson’s extensive list of production credits reads much like closing credits of a major cinematic release. Popularly known as Amadeus, his globally recognized pseudonym (reminiscent of late Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) is further representation of his creative and artistic musical merit. A number of notable recording artists - including Jennifer Lopez, Chris Brown, Justin Bieber, Talib Kweli, Tyga, and The Game - have found his work attractive. To achieve the sound they desire, top artists find it imperative to intersect with Thompson. [...] “I appreciate the fact that artists appreciate my gift and the music that I create,” Thompson says. “It starts with of them. If they never liked what they heard you wouldn't have any songs produced by Amadeus.” Raised in church, Thompson absorbed the seismic energy of hand clapping and foot stomping. He quickly realized percussion was his calling, so he answered with drum lessons and natural ability. Engaging the instrument caused his earth to quake. “All of my musical gifts and talents are God-given, it’s up to me to nurture it and practice in order to enhance my abilities as a producer and musician,” he says. “In everything you do there will be trial and error. In order for you to succeed you must make a few mistakes before you get it right.” Right for Thompson was becoming a professional drummer and music producer, being of sound business savvy is where he would begin to shake things up. In 2000 he launched Platinum Boy Music, his own production and recording imprint. As its CEO his behind the scenes goals for his brand were simple: “Make great music and make great shows so everyone recognizes the passion I have for creating and playing music.” Since 2007 Thompson has been Music Director and lead drummer for R&B superstar Trey Songz, a position which exponentially expands his reach. Touring nationally and internationally his role requires even more responsibility and accountability than a producer’s general expectation of properly meshing sounds using rhythmic timing. [...] When not constructing music Thompson makes time to build confidence through motivational speaking engagements. “During my career thus far, I’ve had the opportunity of uplifting thousands of students at educational institutions across the country, from Xavier University and Washington Mathematics Science Technology Public Charter High School to Las Vegas Teen Summit and Berklee College of Music in Boston,” he says. “I’ve also provided motivation and opportunities for students throughout the world by offering free drumming classes in NYC.” In 2015, Thompson decided he and his Platinum Boy team would share their industry experience, successfully launching Music 101 College Tour. “The tour is to educate people on the ins and outs of the music business,” he <b>says</b> <b>proudly</b> of the venture. “With this platform it’s our mission at Platinum Boy Music to educate, empower, inspire and transform the people.” Featuring a panel of experts that’s included DJ Ted Smooth (DJ/Remix King), Torae (Artist/Radio Personality), Jason Hobby (MBK Ent.), Keith L Harrison (ASCAP), Kevin Thomson (Attorney for Platinum Boy Music), AntMixedIt (Studio Engineer), Anhk Ra (Celebrity Vocal Coach) and Cornell Miller (Bad Boy Worldwide), Music 101 has thus far emanated from City College, Nassau Community College, Bronx Community College, Howard University, William Paterson University, and New York University. “This is a monumentally proud moment for the entire Platinum Boy Music team and myself,” he says Mr. Joe Walker.|$|E

It {{is an attempt}} to discuss the ambiguous situation of Asians of Kenya who are neither indigenous Africans nor European colonizers.

He is the son of a grocer, who was himself the son of a Punjabi labourer, an indentured ‘coolie’, brought to East Africa to build the railway line from Mombassa to Kampala, through 600 miles of the loveliest terrain in Africa...|$|E

[...] "But, Mr. Graham, I am free to declare, even in your presence, though you may be her best and surest friend,"--and there was not wanting from {{the tone of his}} voice a strong flavour of scorn as he repeated these words--"that I do exist on hope, let your claims be what they will. If you desire to make such hope on my part a cause of quarrel, I have nothing to say against it." [...] And then he twirled all that he could twirl of that incipient moustache.|$|R

There is an excellent bit of ocean poetry here (ll. 210-224), and we get a vivid idea of the hospitality of a brave people by following the poet's description of Beowulf's meeting with King Hrothgar and Queen Wealhtheow, and of the joy and feasting and story-telling in Heorot. The picture of Wealhtheow passing the mead cup to the warriors with her own hand is a noble one, and plainly indicates the reverence paid by these strong men to their wives and mothers. Night comes on; the fear of Grendel is again upon the Danes, and all withdraw after the king has warned Beowulf of the frightful danger of sleeping in the hall. But Beowulf lies down with his warriors, <b>saying</b> <b>proudly</b> that, since weapons will not avail against the monster, he will grapple with him bare handed and trust to a warrior's strength.|$|R

I gave him a handsome sum in advance; and I promise you the effect of my advertisement was such, that next day I had a regular levee in my antechamber: grooms, valets, and maitres-d'hotel offered themselves without number; I had proposals {{for the purchase of}} horses sufficient to mount a regiment, both from dealers and gentlemen of the first fashion. Sir Lawler Gawler came to propose to me the most elegant bay-mare ever stepped; my Lord Dundoodle had a team of four that wouldn't disgrace my friend the Emperor; and the Marquess of Ballyragget sent his gentleman and his compliments, stating that if I would step up to his stables, or do him the honour of breakfasting with him previously, he would show me the two finest greys in Europe. I determined to accept the invitations of Dundoodle and Ballyragget, but to purchase my horses from the dealers. It is always the best way. Besides, in those days, in Ireland, if a gentleman warranted his horse, and it was not sound, or a dispute arose, the remedy you had was the offer of a bullet in your waistcoat.
