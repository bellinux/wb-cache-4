[...] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ratified a set of rules for preserving and excavating underwater sites at the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage during 15 October — 5 November 2001.

2500|$|Dimon {{commented on}} the Volcker Rule in January 2012, [...] "Part of the Volcker Rule I agreed with, which is no prop trading. But market making is an {{essential}} function. And the public <b>should</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> we have the widest, the deepest, the most transparent capital markets in the world. And {{part of that is}} because we have enormous market making. If the rules were written as they originally came out; I suspect they'll be changed, it would really make it hard to be a market maker in the United States.” [...] He served as Chairman of the Executive Committee of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Napster {{contended that}} the {{injunction}} violated the company's First Amendment rights because it was overbroad. While the Ninth Circuit rejected this argument {{due to the lack}} of a fair use defense, they did order a stay of the injunction and agreed that the injunction was overbroad because [...] "it places on Napster the entire burden of ensuring that no 'copying, downloading, uploading, transmitting, or distributing' of plaintiffs' works occur on the system." [...] Recognizing that Napster's system simply indexed files with imperfect file names and did not automatically verify copyright ownership, the court found that it was the plaintiffs' burden to notify Napster of any infringing files on the system, which Napster would then remove. But the court also again noted that Napster must police the system within its means: [...] "In crafting the injunction on remand, the district court <b>should</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> Napster's system does not currently appear to allow Napster access to users' MP3 files." [...] The court also declined to adjust the bond amount and called imposition of a compulsory royalty scheme an [...] "'easy out' for Napster" [...] that would destroy the plaintiffs' ability to control their intellectual property.|$|E

6000|$|There is {{a strange}} sort of {{originality}} about McClintock; he imitates other people's styles, but nobody can imitate his, not even an idiot. Other people can be windy, but McClintock blows a gale; other people can blubber sentiment, but McClintock spews it; other people can mishandle metaphors, but only McClintock {{knows how to make}} a business of it. McClintock is always McClintock, he is always consistent, his style is always his own style. He does not make the mistake of being relevant on one page and irrelevant on another; he is irrelevant on all of them. He does not make the mistake of being lucid in one place and obscure in another; he is obscure all the time. He does not make the mistake of slipping in a name here and there that is out of character with his work; he always uses names that exactly and fantastically fit his lunatics. In the matter of undeviating consistency he stands alone in authorship. It is this that makes his style unique, and entitles it to a name of its own--McClintockian. It is this that protects it from being mistaken for anybody else's. Uncredited quotations from other writers often leave a reader in doubt as to their authorship, but McClintock is safe from that accident; an uncredited quotation from him would always be recognizable. When a boy nineteen years old, who had just been admitted to the bar, says, [...] "I trust, sir, like the Eagle, I shall look down from lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man," [...] we know who is speaking through that boy; we <b>should</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> note anywhere. There be myriads of instruments in this world's literary orchestra, and a multitudinous confusion of sounds that they make, wherein fiddles are drowned, and guitars smothered, and one sort of drum mistaken for another sort; but whensoever the brazen note of the McClintockian trombone breaks through that fog of music, that note is recognizable, and about it there can be no blur of doubt.|$|E

6000|$|To sum up, we have {{to depend}} on the {{solution}} of the problem of unemployment, probably on the principles laid down in the Minority Report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Law, to make the sexual relations between men and women decent and honorable by making women economically independent of men, and (in the younger son section of the upper classes) men economically independent of women. We also have to bring ourselves into line with the rest of Protestant civilization by providing means for dissolving all unhappy, improper, and inconvenient marriages. And, as it is our cautious custom to lag behind {{the rest of the world}} to see how their experiments in reform turn out before venturing ourselves, and then take advantage of their experience to get ahead of them, we <b>should</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> the ancient system of specifying grounds for divorce, such as adultery, cruelty, drunkenness, felony, insanity, vagrancy, neglect to provide for wife and children, desertion, public defamation, violent temper, religious heterodoxy, contagious disease, outrages, indignities, personal abuse, [...] "mental anguish," [...] conduct rendering life burdensome and so forth (all these are examples from some code actually in force at present), is a mistake, because the only effect of compelling people to plead and prove misconduct is that cases are manufactured and clean linen purposely smirched and washed in public, to the great distress and disgrace of innocent children and relatives, whilst the grounds have at the same time to be made so general that any sort of human conduct may be brought within them by a little special pleading and a little mental reservation on the part of witnesses examined on oath. When it conies to [...] "conduct rendering life burdensome," [...] it is clear that no marriage is any longer indissoluble; and the sensible thing to do then is to grant divorce whenever it is desired, without asking why.|$|E
