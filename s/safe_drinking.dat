5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The {{regulation}} {{of lead in}} drinking water applications with the <b>Safe</b> <b>Drinking</b> Water Act of 1974 made a reduction of lead in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. Selenium produces the same machinability improvement in copper alloys.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency {{is charged}} with {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the <b>Safe</b> <b>Drinking</b> Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of <b>safe</b> <b>drinking</b> water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties.

Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a <b>safe</b> <b>drinking</b> water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town.

40|$|Background: Given limited {{research}} {{evidence for}} community-based alcohol interventions, {{this study examines}} the intervention preferences of rural communities and alcohol professionals, and factors that influence their choices. Method: Community preferences were identified by a survey of randomly selected individuals across 20 regional Australian communities. The preferences of alcohol professionals were identified by a survey of randomly selected members of the Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and Other Drugs. To identify preferred interventions {{and the extent of}} support for them, a budget allocation exercise was embedded in both surveys, asking respondents to allocate a given budget to different interventions. Tobit regression models were estimated to identify the characteristics that explain differences in intervention preferences. Results: Community respondents selected school programs most often (88. 0 %) and allocated it the largest proportion of funds, followed by promotion of <b>safer</b> <b>drinking</b> (71. 3 %), community programs (61. 4 %) and police enforcement of alcohol laws (60. 4 %). Professionals selected GP training most often (61. 0 %) and allocated it the largest proportion of funds, followed by school programs (36. 6 %), community programs (33. 8 %) and promotion of <b>safer</b> <b>drinking</b> (31. 7 %). Community views were susceptible to response bias. There were no significant predictors of professionals' preferences. Conclusions: In the absence of sufficient research evidence for effective community-based alcohol interventions, rural communities and professionals both strongly support school programs, promotion of <b>safer</b> <b>drinking</b> and community programs. Rural communities also supported police enforcement of alcohol laws and professionals supported GP training. The impact of a combination of these strategies needs to be rigorously evaluated...|$|R

5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's <b>Safe</b> <b>Drinking</b> Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Aims. The {{majority}} view among alcohol epidemiologists {{is that the}} lower coronary heart disease mortality observed in moderate drinkers is probably evidence for a protective effect of moderate drinking. In this paper I critically discuss the debate about what type of information, if any, should be provided to {{the public about the}} putative coronary heart disease benefits of moderate alcohol use. Results. Most opposition to informing the public about these putative benefits is based on the fear that such advice will increase per capita alcohol consumption and therefore alcohol-related harm. It is unclear how well-based these concerns are. In the interim, the alcohol industry has communicated these putative benefits to the public. Conclusions. There is a case for including some information on these putative benefits in specific <b>safer</b> <b>drinking</b> guidelines for middle-aged and older drinkers that: clearly conveys the remaining uncertainty about the benefits of moderate drinking, emphasises the conditional nature of any such benefits, and stresses the need to balance the potential benefits against the increased sensitivity of older adults to other adverse effects of alcohol, and the increased risk of interactions between alcohol and other medications used by older adults.
