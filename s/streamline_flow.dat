50|$|An {{air knife}} {{is a tool}} used to blow off liquid or debris from {{products}} as they travel on conveyors. Air knives are normally used in manufacturing or {{as the first step}} in a recursive recycling process to separate lighter or smaller particles from other components for use in later or subsequent steps, post manufacturing parts drying and conveyor cleaning, part of component cleaning. The knife consists of a high-intensity, uniform sheet of laminar airflow sometimes known as <b>streamline</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E
50|$|In fluid dynamics, {{laminar flow}} (or <b>streamline</b> <b>flow)</b> {{occurs when a}} fluid flows in {{parallel}} layers, with no disruption between the layers. At low velocities, the fluid tends to flow without lateral mixing, and adjacent layers slide past one another like playing cards. There are no cross-currents perpendicular to the direction of flow, nor eddies or swirls of fluids. In laminar flow, {{the motion of the}} particles of the fluid is very orderly with particles close to a solid surface moving in straight lines parallel to that surface.Laminar flow is a flow regime characterized by high momentum diffusion and low momentum convection.|$|E
5000|$|BAV outflow is helical and {{occurs at}} high {{velocities}} (>1 m/s) throughout the ascending aorta. This is potentially more {{damaging to the}} aorta {{in comparison to the}} <b>streamline</b> <b>flow</b> and short-lived burst of high velocity {{at the beginning of the}} aorta, as seen within a healthy tricuspid valve. This eccentric outflow from the BAV results in blood hitting and reflecting off the aortic wall in a non-streamline fashion. [...] The specific zones where blood hits is dependent on the varying BAV leaflet fusion patterns and consequently correlates with increases in WSS. WSS measurements in RL fusion indicate an increase in pressure applied predominantly to the right-anterior side of the vessel wall, while RN fusion increases WSS on the right-posterior wall. The resulting rise in WSS is supported by the asymmetrical displacement of blood flow produced by an increased angle of outflow from the BAV. Displacement is measured as the distance in millimeters from the center of the aorta to the center of the high velocity outflow. Blood does not flow centrally through the aorta in BAV, but along the right-anterior and right-posterior vessel wall for RL and RN leaflet fusion respectively.|$|E

Liver scintigrams were obtained following injection of tracer doses of 198 Aucolloj @ into a mesenteric vein and corn pared with repeat scintigrams obtained follow ing i. v. injection of ssmTc. rnicroaggregated albumin. Particularly from subdivisions {{of the superior}} rnesenteric vein, portal vein blood is directed predominantly to the right lobe. This may explain the predominance of right lobe in volvement in infectious diseases which ernbolize to the liver via the superior mesenteric vein. Certain intestinal infectious diseases which spread to the liver {{by way of the}} portal vein tend to localize in the right lobe. This tendency has been attributed to selective streamlining of blood coming up from the superior mesenteric vein.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} tool {{has been}} developed for predicting, in a nonempirical manner, effects of streamline curvature and coordinate-system rotation on turbulent boundary layers. The second-order closure scheme developed by Wilcox and Traci has been generalized for curved <b>streamline</b> <b>flow</b> and for flow in a rotating coordinate system. A physically based straightforward argument shows that curvature/rotation primarily affects the turbulent mixing energy; the argument yields suitable curvature/rotation terms which {{are added to the}} mixing-energy equation. Singular-perturbation solutions valid in the wall layer of a curved-wall boundary layer and a fully developed rotating channel flow demonstrate that, with the curvature/rotation terms, the model predicts the curved-wall and the rotating coordinate system laws of the wall.

Calculations are presented for the pressure, endwall, and suction surfaces of a stationary cascade and for the pressure surface of a rotating turbine blade.

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the relationships between the}} splenic index, right and left hepatic lobe volumes, diameters of splenic vein (SV), superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and the portal vein (PV) by Multidetector Computerized Tomography (MDCT). We also investigated indirect signs of portal venous flow pattern using these parameters. Material and Methods: Following their contrast thoracoabdominal and abdominal 64 -MDCT examinations, the images of 100 cases (61 males and 39 females) were evaluated retrospectively. For each case, the splenic index, total hepatic volume, left and right hepatic volumes were calculated on the post-contrast portal venous phase (50 th sec) images. Spearman correlation tests were carried out with the purpose of determining the relationships between the variables. Statistical significance level was set at p< 0. 005. Results: A statistically significant relation was demonstrated between the diameter of the SMV and right hepatic lobe volume (p< 0. 0001), and according to Pearson’s correlation analysis, a positive correlation of medium strength (r= 0. 36) was observed. A positive correlation was demonstrated between the diameter of the splenic vein and left hepatic lobe volume (r= 0. 36). Statistically significant relation between the diameters of the splenic vein and right hepatic lobe was not observed (p= 0. 62). A strong correlation between the left hepatic lobe volume and the splenic index (r= 0. 556) was observed. Conclusion: We observed a positive correlation and a significant relation between the diameter of the SMV and the right hepatic lobe, and a relation between the splenic vein and splenic index and both hepatic lobes. We believe that this situation is related to the <b>streamline</b> <b>flow</b> in the portal vein, and as demonstrated in the literature, the flow in the SMV is directed at the right lobe, whereas the splenic vein empties into the liver homogenously. Our study is the first study in the literature performed by multidetector CT, which is a technique that reveals the relations between the <b>streamline</b> <b>flow</b> in the portal vein, the splenic index and the hepatic lobe volumes...|$|E
