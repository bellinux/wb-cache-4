40|$|Past {{reviews and}} meta-analyses {{typically}} conceptualized and examined <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> as holistic entities. We {{draw on the}} product design literature to propose a modular approach as a complementary perspective to conceptualizing <b>selection</b> <b>procedures.</b> A modular approach means that a product is broken down into its key underlying components. Therefore, we start by presenting a modular framework that identifies the important measurement components of <b>selection</b> <b>procedures.</b> Next, we adopt this modular lens for reviewing the available evidence regarding each of these components in terms of affecting validity, subgroup differences, and applicant perceptions, {{as well as for}} identifying new research directions. As a complement to the historical focus on holistic <b>selection</b> <b>procedures,</b> we posit that the theoretical contributions of a modular approach include improved insight into the isolated workings of the different components underlying <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> and greater theoretical connectivity among different <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> and their literatures. We also outline how organizations can put a modular approach into operation to increase the variety in <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> and to enhance the flexibility in designing them. Overall, we believe that a modular perspective on <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> will provide the impetus for programmatic and theory-driven research on the different measurement components of <b>selection</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{deposition}} of silica by diatoms may also {{prove to be}} of utility to nanotechnology. Diatom cells repeatedly and reliably manufacture valves of various shapes and sizes, potentially allowing diatoms to manufacture micro- or nano-scale structures which may be of use {{in a range of}} devices, including: optical systems; semiconductor nanolithography; and even vehicles for drug delivery. With an appropriate artificial <b>selection</b> <b>procedure,</b> diatoms that produce valves of particular shapes and sizes might be evolved for cultivation in chemostat cultures to mass-produce nanoscale components.

A central aspect of Parnell's reforms was a new <b>selection</b> <b>procedure</b> to ensure the {{professional}} selection of party candidates committed to taking their seats. In 1884, he imposed a firm 'party pledge' which obliged party MPs to vote as a bloc in parliament on all occasions. The creation of a strict party whip and formal party structure was unique in party politics at the time. The Irish Parliamentary Party is generally seen as the first modern British political party, its efficient structure and control contrasting with the loose rules and flexible informality found in the main British parties, which came to model themselves on the Parnellite model. The Representation of the People Act 1884 enlarged the franchise, and the IPP increased its number of MPs from 63 to 85 in the 1885 election.|$|E

In addition, they must have passed a qualifying exam and passed through a rigorous Canadian Forces/League <b>selection</b> <b>procedure</b> at local, provincial and national levels. Also in 1946, the Government approved a maximum establishment for the post-war period of 15,000 cadets across Canada.

25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a <b>selection</b> <b>procedure</b> for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E

40|$|Indifference-zone <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> {{have been}} used to select a design with the minimum or max-imum {{expected}} performance measure among a finite number of simulated designs. While there have been significant advancements in selection methodologies, the majority of the <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> are developed to process the selection when the performance measures are the mean of some out-put.
