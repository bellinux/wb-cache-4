40|$|The {{metalloid}} germanium {{has found}} widespread application in electronics, nuclear sciences and in medicine. General toxicity of germanium is low, {{except for the}} tetrahydride germane, and few observations on toxicity of germanium in man exist. Germanium is not carcinogenic and even appears to inhibit cancer development and, {{in the form of}} the organic germanium compound, <b>spirogermanium,</b> to destroy cancer cells. Germanium compounds have no mutagenic activity and may, under certain conditions, inhibit the mutagenic activity of other substances. High doses of germanium may result in an increased embryonic resorption, but possible malformations have been reported only after administration of dimethyl germanium oxide to pregnant animals. Germanium may thus be considered an element of rather low risk to man...|$|E
40|$|Because of its {{prevalence}} and severity, Babesia microti infection {{is an important}} public health problem. The current treatment of choice is clindamycin plus quinine. However, in some cases other treatments are needed because of drug intolerance or relapse. The activity of azithromycin was investigated for treatment of babesiosis in the hamster model. All animals received vancomy-cin to prevent antibiotic-associated colitis. Quinine (250 mg/kg/day), azithromycin (150 mg/kg/ day), and the combination of azithromycin and quinine were compared. A significant suppres-sion of parasitemia was found in all treatment groups (combination had the greatest effect, followed by azithromycin, then quinine; P <. 05). The mean survival was significantly prolonged in the combination group (P <. 05). Azithromycin as monotherapy in a higher dose (300 mg/kg/ day) also resulted in a significant prolongation of survival (P <. 05). <b>Spirogermanium</b> and cipro-ftoxacin, which {{have been reported to}} have antimalarial activity, had no effect on parasitemia or survival in this experimental babesiosis model. Babesia microti is an intraerythrocytic apicomplexan para-site that may cause a severe febrile and hemolytic illness, especially in asplenic individuals and those who are imrnuno...|$|E
40|$|For {{several years}} organo-germanium {{containing}} medicine {{has been used}} for special treatments of e. g. cancer and AIDS. The active substances contain germanium as beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide ((GeCH 2 CH 2 COO-H) 2 O 3 /"Ge- 132 "), <b>spirogermanium,</b> germanium-lactate-citrate or unspecified forms. For humans, germanium is not essential and in general the toxicity of the mentioned organo-germanium compounds is low. Acute and chronic toxic effects of inorganic germanium dioxide have been demonstrated. It is obvious that especially inorganic germanium has a higher potential of negative effects. Therefore, a widespread analytical product control is indispensable. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is the preferred technique and different applications were developed for controlling various parameters: (i) A speciation method using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with quadrupole (Q-) ICP-MS was developed for the identification of organo-germanium species in medicine. (ii) The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique was applied to confirm the molecular structure and to determine the molecule concentration. (iii) The total concentration of germanium in the medicine was determined in the diluted sample by high resolution (HR-) ICP-MS. (iv) For a general overview, a multi-element screening method of 56 elements with HR-ICP-MS was developed. The semi-quantitative mode was used for quantification and elements of higher abundance are reported. (v) Investigations about matrix-based interferences on masses of isotopes, which are generally determinable without remarkable problems. Isotopes like e. g. 85 Rb, 88 Sr, 89 Y, 90 Zr, 93 Nb and the isotopes of Ba are strongly interfered by different Ge-based molecules and need to be analysed in a higher resolution mode than used for other common matrices...|$|E
