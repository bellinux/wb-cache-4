The guideline permits optimisation with respect to cover depth and concrete composition. The required concrete performance is the chloride diffusion resistance, measured as Rapid Chloride Migration.

However, less is known about the effects of preschool television on subsequent bullying involvement. We examined the association between television viewing time through ages 2 - 5 and bullying involvement in the first grades of elementary school. We hypothesized that high television exposure increases the risk of bullying involvement. Method. TV viewing time was assessed repeatedly in early childhood using parental report. To combine these repeated assessments we used latent <b>class</b> analysis. Four <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> were identified and labeled "low", "mid-low", "mid-high" and "high". Bullying involvement was assessed by teacher questionnaire (n = 3423, mean age 6. 8 years). Additionally, peer/self-report of bullying involvement was obtained using a peer nomination procedure (n = 1176, mean age 7. 6 years). We examined child risk of being a bully, victim or a bully-victim (compared to being uninvolved in bullying). Results: High television <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> was associated with elevated risks of bullying and victimization. Also, in both teacher- and child-reported data, children in the high television <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> were more likely to be a bully-victim (OR = 2. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 42 - 3. 13 and OR = 3. 68, 95 % CI: 1. 75 - 7. 74 respectively). However, all univariate effect estimates attenuated and were no longer statistically significant once adjusted for maternal and child covariates.

An algorithm-derived local connected fractal dimension (LCFD) frequency measure {{was used in}} this comparative analysis. Canonical variates (CVA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to evaluate the discrimination power of the method among <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> (unexposed, Cd exposed, TBA exposed). Misclassification, sensitivity and specificity, both with original and cross-validated cases, were determined. LCFDs frequencies enhanced the differences among classes which were visually selected after their means, respective variances and the differences between Cd and TBA exposed means, with respect to unexposed mean, were analyzed by scatter plots. Selected frequencies were then scanned by means of LDA, stepwise analysis, and Mahalanobis distance to detect the most discriminative frequencies out of ten originally selected. Discrimination resulted in 91. 7 % of cross-validated cases correctly classified (22 out of 24 total cases), with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 95. 5 % (1 false negative with respect to 21 really positive cases) and 75 % (1 false positive with respect to 3 really negative cases). CVA with convex hull polygons ensured prompt, visually intuitive discrimination among <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> and graphically supported the false positive case. The combined use of semithin sections, which enhanced the visual evaluation of the overall lamellar structure; of LCFD analysis, which objectively detected local variation in complexity, without the possible bias connected to human personnel; and of CVA/LDA, could be an objective, sensitive and specific approach to study fish gill lamellar pathology.

However, pretreatment with 10 mu M SA enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the concentrations of non-enzymatic antioxidants, but lowered the concentrations of H 2 O 2 and MDA in the Cd-stressed rice compared with the Cd treatment alone. Pretreatment with SA alleviated the Cd-induced inhibition of root growth. The results showed that pretreatment with SA enhanced the antioxidant defense activities in Cd-stressed rice, thus alleviating Cd-induced oxidative damage and enhancing Cd tolerance. The possible mechanism of SA-induced H 2 O 2 signaling in mediating Cd tolerance was discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{reinforced}} steel corrosion {{which is the}} most important problem of reinforced concrete structures durability is generally stipulated for carbonization of concrete surrounding it. Concrete cover calculation at the design stage is predicated one because of the differences in manufacturing conditions and use of constructions. The applying of the probabilistic approaches to the carbonation process modeling allows to get predicated grade of the depth of carbonization of concrete and, thus, to settle minimum concrete cover thickness for a given projected service life of a construction. The procedures for concrete mix design for different strength classes of concrete are described in the article. Current recommendations on assignment of concrete strength class as well as concrete cover are presented. The European Standard EN 206 : 2013 defines the content requirements for the concrete structures operated in the <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 1, including the minimum values of water-cement ratio, minimum cement content, and minimum strength class of concrete.

Histologically and ultrastructurally, cellular shrinkage/coarctation prevailed in cadmium exposed lamellae, whereas cellular swelling and epithelial lifting were predominant in terbuthylazine exposed lamellae compared to unexposed fish.

However, unpredictable patterns of flare events still remain a mystery. Occupational effectors have also been suggested as having a contributing role; however, they are not widely researched. In this paper we report a pilot study designed to generate focus areas for future research regarding occupational exposures and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: The study explored potential links between exposures and the occurrence of patient-reported flare events in 80 Australian women with SLE (American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria classified).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{durability and}} service life models for reinforced concrete structures {{with regard to}} chloride ingress, carbonation and frost attack. In the past years a number of models for durability design of concrete structures have been suggested by relevant organisations or international committees. It is necessary to validate these models against long-term field data for their applicability with respect to exposure climate in order to satisfactorily use the models in the durability design and redesign of concrete structures. In this study, various potential models for concrete resistance to chloride ingress, carbonation and frost attack were briefly reviewed. Three models including the simple ERFC, the DuraCrete and the ClinConc, for prediction of chloride ingress were evaluated using the infield data collected from both the field exposure site after over 20 years exposure and the real road bridges of about 30 years old. A physicochemical model for prediction of carbonation depth was evaluated using the infield data collected from the field exposure site after 11 years exposure and the limited data from the real structures with the age of 7 - 13 years. For the modelling of frost attack, some problems in measurement of critical saturation degree and actual degree of saturation are discussed. According to the comparison results, the simple ERFC overestimates whilst the DuraCrete model underestimate the chloride ingress in most cases. The ClinConc model {{on the other hand}} gives reasonable good prediction for both the short-term (one year) and the long-term (21 years) exposure. The Papadakis model for carbonation also gives fairly good prediction of carbonation depth when compared with the Norwegian infield data classified as <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 3, but underestimates the carbonation depths when compared with the infield data from Norwegian structures in <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 4.

In ASO cells, we observed chromosomal rearrangements, increased spontaneous mutations, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation (GWDH), similarly to exposed cells. We inferred that a short-term <b>SA</b> <b>exposure</b> has long-term effects and that GWDH enhances the genetic instability. Consequently, we evaluated GWDH in HaCaT keratinocytes at several time points during expanded growth following SA removal. We found a persistent GWDH, and some specific gene promoters (DNMT 3 A, DNMT 3 B, HMLH 1) methylation changes. We suggest that the SA-treated cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming at gene/genome level that is durable over many cell generations in the absence of SA, contributing to long-lasting genomic instability SA-induced. Obtaining several individual clones isolated at different time points from the growing ASO cells, we observed in someone, chromosomal and morphological instability, higher ROS, aberrant DNA methylation. We also noted that all the ASO clones with low SOD 1 and high ROS acquired a transformed phenotype and moreover that the increase of ROS was accompanied by defective telomerase activity.

The study for municipality of Lom is carried out on the base of a framework for vulnerability assessment which includes the following important elements: hazard probability, exposure, sensitivity and coping capacity. In this paper we use the spatial dimensions of the areas prone to a particular climate hazard as an indicator for the level of exposure to this hazard. We introduce a measure for the system sensitivity as a function of hazard and <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> assigned to these areas. On the base of a system of indicators and scores for the hazard, exposure, sensitivity and capacity, is estimated a Vulnerability Index for municipality of Lom. The results from this case study show that implementation of the proposed Vulnerability Assessment Method provide reliable information for the level of vulnerability to ten climate hazards. It may be of use for different risk management purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{mortality}} of selected groups of gasworkers {{has been observed}} {{over a period of}} eight years, and a comparison has been made of the mortality from different causes among different occupational groups. Men were included in the study if they had been employed by the industry {{for more than five years}} and were between 40 and 65 years of age when the observations began. All employees and pensioners of four area Gas Boards who met these conditions were initially included; but the number was subsequently reduced to 11, 499 by excluding many of the occupations which did not involve entry into the carbonizing plants or involved this only irregularly. All but 0 ¬∑ 4 % of the men were followed successfully throughout the study. Mortality rates, standardized for age, were calculated for 10 diseases, or groups of diseases, for each of three broad occupational classes, i. e., those having heavy exposure in carbonizing plants (<b>class</b> A), intermittent <b>exposure</b> or exposure to conditions in other gas-producing plants (class B), and such <b>exposure</b> (<b>class</b> C) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare expert versus fractal analysis as new methods to evaluate branchial lamellar pathology in European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax (Linnaeus, 1758) experimentally exposed to cadmium and to terbuthylazine. In particular, guided expert quantitative and fractal analysis were performed on selected images from semithin sections to test possible differences according to <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> (unexposed, cadmium exposed, or terbuthylazine exposed) and the discrimination power of the two methods. With respect to guided expert quantitative analysis, the following elementary pathological features were assessed according to pre-determined cover classes: ‚Äòepithelial lifting‚Äô, ‚Äòepithelial shrinkage‚Äô, ‚Äòepithelial swelling‚Äô, ‚Äòpillar cells coarctation‚Äô, ‚Äòpillar cells detachment‚Äô, ‚Äòchannels fusion‚Äô, ‚Äòchloride cells swelling‚Äô and ‚Äòchloride cells invasion‚Äô. Considering fractal analysis, DB (box dimension), DM (mass dimension), D¬Øx (mean fractal dimension) as fractal dimensions and lacunarity from DM and D¬Øx scan types were calculated both from the outlined and skeletonized (one pixel wide lines) images. Despite significant differences among experimental classes, only expert analysis provided good discrimination with correct classification of 91. 7...|$|R
