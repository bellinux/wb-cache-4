25|$|Atwater: But Reagan did {{not have}} to do a {{southern}} strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even <b>surprised</b> <b>me,</b> is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

In a 2009 interview she commented on {{the significance of the}} character to EastEnders and viewers, saying [...] "I can't believe that I'm still recognised so much as Chrissie. I still get a lot of letters about her, too. I think that she had as much of an impact as Janine (Charlie Brooks) did, which <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> Chrissie wasn't around for that long but she was an amazing character with an epic storyline." ...|$|E

Abu Rahma was clear in interviews that the Israelis had fired the shots. For example, he told The Guardian: [...] "They were cleaning the area. Of course they saw the father. They were aiming at the boy, and that is what <b>surprised</b> <b>me,</b> yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time, but many times." [...] Abu Rahma said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost, but that they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit. The Israeli fire was being directed at this Palestinian outpost, he said. He told National Public Radio: ...|$|E

500|$|According {{to media}} reports, Kapoor relies on her {{instincts}} and spontaneity as an actor. She {{is known to}} commit heavily to each role, and refrains from rehearsing for a project. Commenting on this, director Rajkumar Hirani said [...] "I usually have a habit of conducting rehearsals for my actors, but she insisted on not having them as it would affect her spontaneity. She really <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> {{with a couple of}} emotional scenes which we canned in just one take." [...] Karan Johar described Kapoor as a [...] "natural", explaining that [...] "she has no craft, grammar or process attached to her acting [...] It is a great sense of cinema that can keep her going." [...] According to Rensil D'Silva (who directed her in Kurbaan), [...] "Kareena [...] is instinctive and has emotional intelligence. She absorbs the situation and performs accordingly. Discussing the scene, in fact, harms her." ...|$|E
500|$|While at {{the amateur}} clubs, Valbuena also honed his quickness, {{technical}} ability, and developed his tenacious {{style of play}} which contributed to his positive work-rate defensively. Léglise once stated that [...] "he had never worked with such a young person so technically brilliant" [...] in his coaching career. Valbuena's former coach also described the player's tenacious style stating [...] "Whatever the build of the opponent, he will always tackle" [...] and [...] "he also <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> {{with the level of}} his defensive work when he is aligned on the right-hand side". Valbuena is also known for his small size and, while at Langon, began using his diminutive stature to his advantage. During his first season at Marseille, he earned the nickname le petit by his former manager Eric Gerets. Gerets described the player as [...] "extremely mobile" [...] and a player who is [...] "very quick at turning, {{from one side to the}} other".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were critical. WhatCulture {{reviewer}} Joseph Kratzer {{awarded the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars and wrote, [...] "Now that's what I'm talking about – few things are better in art than having your expectations overturned and 'The Pool Party' pleasantly <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> with the efficacy of its execution." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave gave the episode a 9/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I think 'Pool Party' is my favorite episode so far this season. The Robert California and Erin/Dwight/Andy story lines were rock solid. Previous excursions out of the office have been blah, but the pool party setting really complimented the ensemble – and the sharp writing." [...] Michael Tedder from New York Magazine called the episode the season's second best, after [...] "Trivia." [...] In addition, many critics wrote positively of the characters and their actions. Jill Mader from InsidePulse wrote that while, [...] " [...] storyline itself was just OK... Ellie Kemper was hilarious." [...] Many reviewers, including McNutt and Forcella, found Kevin's lines and actions to be particularly memorable, most notably, his declaration that Val was racist after she asked if Darryl could swim. A variety of reviewers found the cold-opening, featuring Jim pranking Dwight by placing meatballs in his desk in an attempt to make Stanley laugh, funny.|$|E

500|$|The Digital Fixs Ryan Poxon gave CRUSH3D a {{score of}} seven out of ten and called it a [...] "puzzle game that {{genuinely}} <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> at how brain teasing the game actually is." [...] 411Mania's Adam Larck gave it {{a score of}} 6.6 out of 10 and said, [...] "For a puzzle game, Crush 3D {{is a good choice}} for 3DS fans. While the mechanic may not be as creative as it was a few years ago, it’s still a decent game to check out. If you never saw the PSP version or haven’t played games like Fez or Echochrome, I’d recommend checking this out to see what crushing is all about." [...] However, Digital Spys Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and stated: [...] "Despite the five-year gap between releases, Crush 3D takes a few steps backwards in terms of visual style and presentation. Other than a rather limited and lacklustre selection of new levels and StreetPass features, it also offers very {{little in the way of}} brand new bonus content, making it difficult to recommend to anybody familiar with its PSP counterpart. Despite its shortcomings, however, Crush 3D gets it right where it counts." [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40.|$|E

These people are so locked into the world, by default some sort of transcendence is located elsewhere, and obviously machines become the totem they imbue with sacred properties, wishes, hopes, goals, desires, dreams.

2500|$|Ronaldinho {{finished}} the 2008–09 season at Milan with 10 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions. After {{a good start}} to the season, Ronaldinho struggled with fitness, and was often played from the bench to end a disappointing first season for Milan. A perceived lack of dedication in training and a lifestyle of late night partying not befitting of an athlete saw him receive criticism, with Carlo Ancelotti, his coach at Milan {{in his first season}} in Italy, commenting, [...] "The decline of Ronaldinho hasn't <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> His physical condition has always been very precarious.

2500|$|Years later, {{prior to}} the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League round of 16 match between Chelsea FC and FC Copenhagen former Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti, now manager of Chelsea, was asked about his view on Danish footballers: [...] "Above all the Danish work ethic <b>surprised</b> <b>me,</b> their special ability to give {{everything}} in training. These were very professional and skilled players. The one who performed best and showed the most continuity, was Jon Dahl Tomasson, who always had to fight for playing time against world class strikers.

2500|$|On a {{publicity}} tour for Past Mortem in 2004, Elton mused {{on the high}} school reunion theme and his own drama college reunion: We'd had a very happy time all together, so there were no old scores to be settled really, we'd been a pretty happy bunch. And yet one person, who'd been a bit of a golden boy – he certainly went out with a girl I was besotted and unrequitedly in love with – he came up and he said, 'Why did you come? Was it to show off?' That really <b>surprised</b> <b>me,</b> that anyone would think that ... he came kind of carrying my agenda. It was weird. I hasten to add I didn't think my life to be more successful than anybody else's. If you're happy and honest and fulfilled in what you do, then you're having a successful life.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding The Thing, by John Carpenter, I've asked him, {{as he was}} {{preparing}} some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, [...] "Why did you call me, {{if you want to}} do it on your own?" [...] He <b>surprised</b> <b>me,</b> he said - [...] "I got married to your music. This is why I've called you." [...] I was quite amazed, he called me because he had my music at his wedding. Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [...] took the electronic score.|$|E

2500|$|Bond began A String in the Harp {{while looking}} for a job after {{returning}} to the United States from a year in graduate school studying librarianship in Aberystwyth. She drew closely on her experiences and reactions to write the book, saying [...] "the American family notices and adjusts to the same things I did". She did not intend to write a fantasy. [...] "I consider myself a realistic kind of person, and it really <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> in many ways that the first book I should write would be a fantasy." [...] According to Elizabeth Briggs in On the Inside Looking In: Contemporary Anglo-Welsh Fantasy, non-Welsh authors use Welsh mythology in their books to develop a sense of fantasy and unreality. But Bond found using Taliesin's life was a good way to introduce Welsh history into the story. Because he was already associated with the area she was writing about and his presence helped convey a sense of the country's age to her American reading audience, she chose to use him as her link to Wales' past. She needed a talisman to trigger the fantasy sections of the story, and when she read that harp keys are essential for tuning she knew she had found an object she could use in the book. The visions the key brings to Peter and the others tie the various elements of the story together.|$|E
2500|$|Den of Geek {{affirmed that}} [...] "Doctor Who hits top form with 'Kill the Moon'. [...] And Jenna Coleman {{has never been}} better". They also praised Harness' script as [...] "impressive" [...] and said that Wilmshurst [...] "fully understands that slowing things down and making little moments count {{is the key to}} {{crawling}} under people's skins". [...] They closed their review by saying [...] "The best Doctor Who episodes have something to say, get under your skin, and keep you pretty much gripped until the end credits roll. 'Kill the Moon' certainly did that, with us heading for a rewatch {{as soon as it was}} done. It has a good science fiction story underneath it, a strong dilemma, and real consequences". The A.V. Club also reacted very positively to the episode, awarding it an A score praising almost every aspect of the episode, but particularly the focus on character development. They said [...] "'Kill the Moon' is the second time this season that Doctor Who has genuinely <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> That fact, above all else, is why tonight’s episode rates as an instant classic" [...] and went on to praise the episode's final scene, saying that [...] "Maybe the whole Moffat era is going to be defined by that final scene in the TARDIS, in which Clara delivers the most blistering rebuke we have ever seen any companion give the Doctor". They ended their review by claiming that [...] "This season is already a return to form, but 'Kill the Moon' could help turn it into something truly special".|$|E
2500|$|Famously vituperative attacks {{came from}} {{journalist}} H. L. Mencken, whose syndicated columns from Dayton for The Baltimore Sun drew vivid caricatures of the [...] "backward" [...] local populace, {{referring to the}} people of Rhea County as [...] "Babbits", [...] "morons", [...] "peasants", [...] "hill-billies", [...] "yaps", and [...] "yokels". He chastised the [...] "degraded nonsense which country preachers are ramming and hammering into yokel skulls". However, Mencken did enjoy certain aspects of Dayton, writing, [...] "The town, I confess, greatly <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> I expected to find a squalid Southern village, with darkies snoozing on the horse-blocks, pigs rooting under the houses and the inhabitants full of hookworm and malaria. What I found was a country town full of charm and even beauty—a somewhat smallish but nevertheless very attractive Westminster or Balair." [...] He described Rhea County as priding itself on a kind of tolerance or what he called [...] "lack of Christian heat", opposed to outside ideas but without hating those who held them. He pointed out, [...] "The Klan has never got a foothold here, though it rages everywhere else in Tennessee." [...] Mencken attempted to perpetrate a hoax, distributing flyers for the [...] "Rev. Elmer Chubb", but the claims that Chubb would drink poison and preach in lost languages were ignored as commonplace by the people of Dayton, and only the Commonweal bit. Mencken continued to attack Bryan, including in his famously withering obituary of Bryan, [...] "In Memoriam: W.J.B.", in which he charged Bryan with [...] "insincerity"—not for his religious beliefs but for the inconsistent and contradictory positions he took on a number of political questions during his career. Years later, Mencken did question whether dismissing Bryan [...] "as a quack pure and unadulterated" [...] was [...] "really just". Mencken's columns made the Dayton citizens irate and drew general fire from the Southern press. After Raulston ruled against the admission of scientific testimony, Mencken left Dayton, declaring in his last dispatch, [...] "All that remains of the great cause of the State of Tennessee against the infidel Scopes is the formal business of bumping off the defendant." [...] Consequently, the journalist missed Darrow's cross-examination of Bryan on Monday.|$|E
