5000|$|Like the university, {{the student}} {{newspaper}} {{of what is}} now Georgia State University has evolved with each incarnation of the school. Georgia State's first student newspaper, The Technite, was named in homage to the Georgia Institute of Technology's own student paper, The Technique, when the school was founded as the Georgia School of Technology's Evening School of Commerce. [...] In 1933, as the University changed to become the Atlanta Extension Center of the University System of Georgia, the two divisions of the school (the day division and the night division) each produced their own separate newspapers (named The Junior Collegiate and the Evening Signal, respectively). On two occasions the publications would appear in combination with one another, initially as the Collegiate-Signal on April 21, 1941, and again as the University Signal on September 22, 1941. It wasn't until the Evening Signal merged with the day division newspaper, The Junior-Collegiate, permanently in 1943 that the formal name of the publication would become The Signal. Since that time, a number of mastheads have been used, including The University Signal, The Georgia <b>State</b> <b>Signal,</b> the Georgia State College Signal, and the Georgia State University Signal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{continuous}} flow analysis (CFA) a continuous stream of material is divided by air bubbles into discrete segments in which chemical reactions occur. The continuous stream of liquid samples and reagents are combined and transported in tubing and mixing coils. The tubing passes the samples from one apparatus {{to the other}} with each apparatus performing different functions, such as distillation, dialysis, extraction, ion exchange, heating, incubation, and subsequent recording of a signal. An essential principle {{of the system is}} the introduction of air bubbles. The air bubbles segment each sample into discrete packets and act as a barrier between packets to prevent cross contamination as they travel {{down the length of the}} tubing. The air bubbles also assist mixing by creating turbulent flow (bolus flow), and provide operators with a quick and easy check of the flow characteristics of the liquid. Samples and standards are treated in an exactly identical manner as they travel the length of the tubing, eliminating the necessity of a steady <b>state</b> <b>signal,</b> however, since the presence of bubbles create an almost square wave profile, bringing the system to steady state does not significantly decrease throughput ( [...] third generation CFA analyzers average 90 or more samples per hour) and is desirable in that steady state signals (chemical equilibrium) are more accurate and reproducible.|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{management accounting}} {{issue is how}} to incorporate decision-influencing information (e. g., an ex post <b>state</b> <b>signal)</b> into employment contracts. Our experiment examines the effects of contract framing on such information use in a principal-agent setting. In each of 40 rounds, participants (as employer and worker) negotiate a contract that specifies pay depending on an ex post <b>state</b> <b>signal.</b> State-signal pay is framed as either a bonus or a penalty over two groups. The {{results show that the}} bonus frame facilitates information use, because of worker loss aversion. Although both groups initially underweigh the <b>state</b> <b>signal,</b> the bonus group quickly converges toward the optimal weight, whereas the penalty group persistently underweighs the <b>state</b> <b>signal.</b> Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago. ...|$|E

The framework can consider both concurrency reduction {{as well as new}} <b>state</b> <b>signal</b> in-sertion during the transformation process. Considering concurrency reduction in the exploration space is crucial because more area effi-cient and higher performance circuits may be possible. This is partly because often fewer new state signals are required and the resulting logic is typically more highly unspecified, thus leaving more room for optimizations at the logic level. Considering new <b>state</b> <b>signal</b> insertion is also crucial as new signals are usually required for dis-ambiguating state coding conflicts. A larger solution space can be searched when both classes of transformations are considered. The new framework has been implemented and verified on a large set of realistic design examples. ...|$|E

40|$|Photosynthesis {{produces}} the oxygen necessary for all aerobic life. During this process, the manganese-containing oxygen evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II (PSII), cycles through five oxidation states, S 0 -S 4. One of these, S 2, {{is known to}} be paramagnetic and gives rise to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals used to probe the catalytic structure and function of the OEC. The S 0 state has long been thought to be paramagnetic. We report here a Mn EPR signal from the previously EPR invisible S 0 state. The new signal oscillates with a period of four, indicating that it originates from fully active PSII centers. Although similar to the S 2 state multiline signal, the new signal is wider (2200 gauss compared with 1850 gauss in samples produced by flashing), with different peak intensity and separation (82 gauss compared with 89 gauss). These characteristics are consistent with the S 0 state EPR signal arising from a coupled MnII-MnIII intermediate. The new signal is more stable than the S 2 <b>state</b> <b>signal</b> and its decay in tens of minutes is indicative of it originating from the S 0 state. The S 0 <b>state</b> <b>signal</b> will provide invaluable information toward the understanding of oxygen evolution in plants...|$|E

As the QCD production cross section at the LHC is large and more importantly poorly known, specific methods to suppress and consequently predict the remaining QCD multi-jet background are required.
