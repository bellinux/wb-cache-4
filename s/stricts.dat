Methods: We included 57 patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke without vessel recanalization despite intravenous thrombolysis. Using voxel-­-based analysis of coregistrated MR images before and 24 hours after treatment, salvaged mismatch was defined as the initial PWI/DWI mismatch that did not overlap with final infarct. Mean Tmax values were compared between salvaged and infarcted mismatch areas. We also searched an association between cardiovascular risk factors, pre-­-thrombolysis clinical factors and percentage of salvaged mismatch. Results: Using Tmax> 6 seconds, 60. 4 % [40. 0 -­- 83. 8] of the PWI/DWI mismatch escaped from infarction. Salvaged mismatch was still sizeable for Tmax> 8 s (50. 5 % [30. 1 -­- 80. 0]) and for Tmax> 10 s (41. 1 % [22. 2 -­- 70. 3]).

40|$|Progress toward {{understanding}} {{principles of}} nonlinear growth and saturation of large scale magnetic fields {{has emerged from}} comparison of theoretical models that incorporate the evolution of magnetic helicity with numerical simulations for problems that are more idealized than expected in astrophysical circumstances, but still fully non-linear. We carry out a new comparison of this sort for the magnetic field growth from forced isotropic helical turbulence in a periodic box. Previous comparisons be- tween analytic theory and simulations of this problem have shown that a two-scale model compares well with the simulations in agreeing that the driver of large scale field growth {{is the difference between}} kinetic and current helicities associated with the small scale field, and that the backreaction that slows the growth of the large scale field as the small scale current helicity grows. However, the two-scale model artificially re- <b>stricts</b> the small scale current helicity to reside at the same scale as the driving kinetic helicity. In addition, previous comparisons have focused on the late time saturation regime, and less on the early-time growth regime. Here we address these issues by comparing a three scale model to new simulations for both early and late time growth regimes. We find that the minimalist extension to three scales provides a better model for the field evolution than the two-scale model because the simulations show that the small scale current helicity does not reside at the same scale as that of the driving kinetic helicity. The simulations also show that the peak of the small scale current helicity migrates toward lower wave numbers as the growth evolves from the fast to saturated growth regimes.

Recent studies demonstrated that inhibition or genetic inactivation of the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is beneficial in myocardial reperfusion injury. PARP activation in the reperfused myocardium has been assumed, but not directly demonstrated. Furthermore, the issue whether pharmacological PARP inhibition affords long-term functional benefit in the reperfused myocardium {{has not been}} explored. These questions were addressed in the present study. 2. In a rat model of myocardial ischemia (1 h) and reperfusion (up to 24 h), there was a marked and significant activation of PARP in the ischemic borderzone, as determined by poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) immunohistochemistry. PAR localized to the nuclei of myocytes and infiltrating mononuclear cells. In {{the core of the}} infarction, necrotic tissues and diffuse PAR staining were observed. PARP activation remained markedly detectable 24 h after reperfusion. The PARP inhibitor 3 -aminobenzamide (20 mg kg(- 1) intraperitoneally 10 min before reperfusion, and every 2 h thereafter for 6 h) markedly reduced the activation of the enzyme in myocytes. 3. 3 -aminobenzamide significantly protected against myocardial morphological and functional alterations at 24 h post-reperfusion. Notably, infarct size was reduced, circulating creatine kinase activity was attenuated, and myocardial contractility (dP dt(- 1)) was restored by 3 -aminobenzamide. 4. Our results demonstrate a significant and prolonged activation of PARP in the reperfused myocardium, localizing to the necrotic area and the ischaemic borderzone. Furthermore, the studies demonstrate that PARP inhibition affords long-term beneficial morphological and functional effects in the reperfused myocardium. These data strengthen the notion that pharmacological PARP inhibition is a viable novel experimental approach for protection against myocardial reperfusion injury...|$|E

In the paper there obtained a geometrical characterisation of strict suns in ℓ ∞ (3). In comparison with [1] we establish a more precise property of stict suns. A subset M of a normed linear space X {{is said to be}} a strict sun if, for every x ∈ X M, the set of its nearest points from M is non-empty and if y ∈ M is the nearest point to x, then y is the nearest ponit from M to every point from the ray starting at y and passing through x. In this paper we obtain a geometric characterisation of strict suns in the space ℓ ∞ (3) (Theorem 1). This characterisation provides a more precise property of <b>stricts</b> suns in ℓ ∞ (3) than Theorem A (see below) from [1] does. 1. Definitions and notation. We will consider only real spaces. Following K. Menger [2] and H. Berens and L. Hetzelt [3], a set M ⊂ R n is called ℓ 1 -convex if, for all x, y ∈ M, x ̸ = y, there is a point z ∈ M, z ̸ = x, z ̸ = y, such that ‖x − y‖ℓ 1 = ‖x − z‖ℓ 1 + ‖z − y‖ℓ 1 (here ‖·‖ℓ 1 is the standard ℓ 1 -norm on R n). As it is shown in [3], ℓ 1 -convexity (together with closedness) proved to be a characteristic property of suns ℓ ∞ (n). (Here we recall that a set M ⊂ X is a sun if, for every point x ∈ X M there is a point y, that is nearest from M to x and such that y is a nearest point to all points from the ray starting at y and passing through x; such a point y is called a solar point for x). It is clear that every strict sun is a sun. The inverse statement is not true in general. On suns, strict suns and other approximative sets see [4], [5]. An elegant characterisation of suns in ℓ ∞ (n) was obtained by H. Berens and L. Hetzelt [3] (see also [6]). Theorem (H. Berens, L. Hetzelt). A closed nonvoid set M ⊂ R n is a sun in ℓ ∞ (n) if and only if it is ℓ 1 -convex. The first characterisation of strict suns in ℓ ∞ (n) in geometrical terms was independently obtained by B.

40|$|This {{survey of}} {{literature}} was undertaken by ARTEP- the French Research Association for Oil Exploration and Production Techniques- {{at the beginning}} of STAR (=STabilité des ARgiles), a project on the influence of clays on borehole stability. Knowledge of theories and laboratory experiments was indeed felt very necessary to help understanding, and thus becoming able to prevent, quite damaging phenomena. During the time spent on this project, ideas and interpretations of all participants underwent some evolution due to the comparison between theories and experiment, and new procedures and interpretations are being proposed elsewhere. The survey is divided in four sections :The first section recalls the specific problems caused by the occurrence of shales during drilling operations for oil or gas : about 90 % of the problems, for about 70 % of the drilled formations. The behaviour of the shales leads to a classification in four different classes : dispersive, swelling, heaving and brittle. They are spread all over the world, not only on the Gulf Coast of the USA and in the North Sea, where they have been more extensively studied, but also in former USSR, in Asia and Africa. Due to deposit conditions and diagenetic history, they occur at different depths, with different properties : reactive shales, at shallow depths, under-, over- or normally-compacted formations, and reservoir caps. Besides their mineralogical and textural properties, due to the large proportion of clays, they have damaging properties as the low permeability (10 to the power of (- 6) to 10 to the power of (- 12) D). The variety of reactions with water extends from a complete dispersion in mud to cavings or swelling of the borehole, with cuttings ranging from less than 1 mm to more than several cm. This has led to use of various empirical solutions to protect the borehole, with mainly mechanical or chemical objectives. However, it is felt that the general solutions can arise only from a synergistic effort of both rock mechanics and physico-chemistry, hence the STAR program. The second section is devoted to a survey of physico-chemical reactions between clays and water. It begins with some definitions of the clays as solids, from the rock to the atomic level. All clays are characterised by their small size, in the range of 1 µm, and thus, their high surface area : from one to several hundred M²/g. Existence of a layer charge, and of compensating cations is the key of the behaviour of the swelling clays (i. e. smectites) versus water, pure or with cations, which deserve particular attention. Description of the various kinds of water associated, more or less energetically, with clays, as a function of relative humidity RH, or water activity a index (w), helps to distinguish their effect on porosity and texture. Hydration and dehydration behaviour, with a particular hysteresis, is described, in solid-gas systems as well as in solid-liquid, closer to field conditions. Two main domains are distinguished : crystalline swelling, up to a water content of circa 50 vol. -%, inducing swelling pressures in the range of several thousand atmospheres, and osmotic swelling, for higher water contents, inducing pressures in the range of several atmospheres. Influence of nature and amount of cations is examined, mainly for calcium, which induces limited swelling, and for potassium which is both less hydratable and proner to irreversible fixation on clay. Little work has already been performed on the influence of temperature and pressure. Mechanisms of water and/or ionic species transport are reviewed: diffusion and osmosis, without applied pressure, and effect of pressure. Behaviour on compaction, always showing hysteresis, depends {{on the nature of the}} clays, and of the cations, but also on the composition of the solution. It is described using suction pressures or mechanical stresses, which induce different properties of the final solid. Experiments in soil literature, generally performed in the presence of a gas phase, cannot be readily compared to the in situ behaviour of the shales, but give insights on the possible artefacts of laboratory experiments. Caution is thus necessary before any application of literature results to real samples, all preliminary conditioning (initial state and composition of the clay and the water, way of hydration/dehydration, or compaction) being able to modify the behaviour of the clay-water system. The third section sets the problem of describing the mechanical behaviour of the rock formation on drilling. This behaviour depends on initial in situ stresses, pore pressure and temperature, and on the constitutive law of the rock, i. e. the relation between stress and strain. As an example, the Cam Clay elasto-plastic law is developed. Then the laboratory experimental sets used to identify mechanical properties are described : triaxial tests, drained or undrained, oedometric tests, and hollow cylinder tests, the first ones being used to calibrate borehole stability, while the latter simulate drilled boreholes. Specific aspects of shales are then recalled : dependence of mechanical properties on the water content, anisotropy and influence of time. Coupling between physico-chemistry and mechanics arises from the lack of chemical equilibrium between the solid and the liquid. This desequilibrium induces a transfer of water and chemical species in solution, modifying the pore pressure, thus the stress on the rock, and leading to chemical reactions, which have been described in section III. Follows a description of stability models, which should be able to predict mud characteristics for the drilling as well as evolution of the borehole with time. Stability models intend to calculate the maximum/minimum mud weight, from a relevant instability criterion, drawn from well data, mechanical data and fluid properties. The choice of the constitutive law is thus important, and elasto-plastic ones seem the more relevant. Taking into account physico-chemistry has been done generally using an osmoticpressure, with the assumption that the shales behave as a semi-permeable membrane. Even if this assumption is too simplistic, it is still used, but more refined models are being studied, which take into account variations in pore pressures and salinities. The fourth section deals with what actually occurs on application to real wellbore. Improvement of mud formulation tries to prevent any problem occurring during drilling. Evolution of formulation is described, from lime, oil, KCI to polymers additions, and to nowadays constraints brought by environment concerns : requirements may be opposite, and thus compromises must be found. Mud monitoring seems a good prospect. In a second part, availability of representative samples, artefacts related to the recovery and storage of samples as well as choice of experimental conditions are reviewed. It is recalled that downhole conditions are rarely taken into account, and problems like drying of the samples, which induces a suction pressure, anisotropy and cohesion of the samples are rarely considered. The conclusion emphasises that if swelling pressures can now be more precisely defined in hydration domains, the effects of physicochemistry on mechanical properties are still to be investigated more thoroughly. Further experiments should be set in conditions closer to downhole ones, and teams must work together to get all the data needed. This will allow proper stability modelling, with coupling of physico-chemistry and mechanics, to become a predictive tool. Cette revue bibliographique a été réalisée dans le cadre du programme STAR (STabilité des ARgiles) entrepris par l'ARTEP (Association de Recherche sur les Techniques d'Exploitation du Pétrole). Elle se divise en quatre sections: La première section rappelle les problèmes spécifiques rencontrés lors du forage des argiles, qui représentent environ 70 % des formations traversées, et sont répandues dans le monde entier, à diverses profondeurs, donc dans des états de compaction et d'évolution diagénétique différents. Leur comportement a conduit à une classification opérationnelle. Des solutions empiriques, destinées à protéger les parois de puits, ont été mises en oeuvre. Toutefois, il apparaît évident que des solutions de caractère général ne peuvent résulter que d'un effort conjoint en mécanique des roches et en physico-chimie : tel est l'objectif du programme STAR. La seconde section est consacrée à la description des réactions physico-chimiques entre les argiles et l'eau. Après avoir décrit les argiles en tant que solides, et plus particulièrement les argiles gonflantesqui ont une charge structurale faible compensée par un cation interfoliaire échangeable, on s'attache au comportement de l'eau qui leur est associée en fonction du degré d'humidité et de la nature et de la concentration des sels dans l'eau. Le gonflement cristallin, limité à une teneur en eau de 50 % environ, et correspondant à des pressions de gonflement de milliers d'atmosphères, est distingué du gonflement osmotique, qui intervient à de plus fortes hydratations, et induit des pressions de l'ordre de la dizaine d'atmosphères au maximum. L'influence spécifique des cations comme le potassium et le calcium est décrite. Des exemples de comportement à la compaction, fonction de la nature des argiles et des cations sont décrits. Il apparaît qu'une description très précise des conditions de départ et du déroulement des phénomènes est indispensable pour l'interprétation, et qu'elle est malheureusement absente dans nombre de publications. La troisième section traite de la description mécanique du comportement des roches argileuses lors du forage. La possibilité de modéliser ce comportement dépend de l'acquisition des paramètres pertinents, et du choix du modèle : le modèle Cam Clay, qui utilise une loi élasto-plastique est donné en exemple. Les tests de laboratoire sont décrits. Dans les argilites, les déséquilibres chimiques entre solide et fluide induisent des transferts d'eau et d'espèces chimiques, modifiant la pression de pore, donc la contrainte à laquelle est soumise la roche, et conduisant à des réactions chimiques décrites dans la deuxième section. Les modèles de stabilité prennent en compte ce couplage par l'usage d'une pression osmotique, avec l'hypothèse simpliste que les argilites se comportent comme des membranes semi-perméables. Des modèles plus affinés sont en cours d'élaboration pour prendre en compte les variations de pression de pore et de salinité. La quatrième section traite des pratiques de terrain, en particulier des améliorations apportées par une formulation de plus en plus élaborée des boues, pour répondre à la fois aux problèmes de forage, et aux exigences de préservation de l'environnement. La question de représentativité des échantillons destinés au laboratoire, et des artefacts liés à la récupération et au stockage est traitée : en particulier les variations de pression capillaire lors du séchage et de la réhydratation imposent des protocoles <b>stricts.</b> Des conditions expérimentales proches des conditions de fond sont rarement employées. En conclusion, si la notion de gonflement, et les conditions dans lesquelles il peut intervenir, apparaissent plus précisément, l'effet sur les propriétés mécaniques reste encore largement à étudier. Une approche multidisciplinaire est indispensable à l'élaboration de modèles de stabilité qui se veulent prédictifs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} concept of local <b>strict</b> envy-freeness (LS-envy-freeness), which is a local version of Zhou's (1992) <b>strict</b> envy-freeness, and investigates its {{implications}} in large economies. In spite of the weakness of this concept, it works effectively by combining with efficiency. It is shown that an LS-envy-free and efficient allocation is a <b>strict</b> envy-free allocation. That is, efficiency expands the local version of <b>strict</b> envy-freeness into <b>strict</b> envy-freeness. Therefore, the set of LS-envy-free and efficient allocations coincides with the set of equal-income Walrasian allocations.
