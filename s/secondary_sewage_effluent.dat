40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the suitability of treated <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> for irrigation of horticultural crops in Botswana. Secondary effluent water was sampled every month for one year, from a breather pipe on the pivot irrigation system at the Botswana College of Agriculture, Notwane Farm, Gaborone, using USEPA procedures and guidelines. The results of the study showed that the <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> from the activated sewage treatment plant in Gaborone had the following physico-chemical properties: Electrical Conductivity (EC) of 0. 51 dS m - 1, pH 9. 08, total dissolved solids of 358 mg L - 1, total alkalinity of 234 mg L - 1 as CaCO 3, Cl - 70 mg L - 1, NaCl 115 mg L - 1, Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) of 2. 26, NO 3 - 5. 56 mg L - 1, NH 4 + 0. 3 mg L - 1, NO 2 - 0. 0184 mg L - 1, total Fe 0. 623 mg L - 1 and faecal coliforms of 5 / 100 mL. The current results suggest that the Gaborone <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> is suitable for unrestricted irrigation of horticultural crops based on the EC, SAR, Cl -, NaCl, faecal coliforms, available plant nutrients and the low concentration of heavy metals (Pb, Cr, Cu, Co, Cd, As and Se all present in parts per billion) ...|$|E

This will stimulate aerobic biological processes and benefit the organic pollutants decomposition and nitrification process for ammoniacal-nitrogen (NH 4 +-N) removal. The results showed that the average P concentration in the <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> was reduced from 1. 90 mg-P/L to 0. 04 mg-P/L. CSW presents excellent P removal performance. The average NH 4 +-N concentration was reduced from 9. 94 mg-N/L to 1. 0 mg-N/L through nitrification in the system. The concentration of resultant nitrite and nitrate in the effluent of the CSW based CWs ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 4 mg-N/L and 0. 01 to 0. 8 mg-N/L, respectively. The outcome of this study has shown that CSW can be successfully used to act as main substrate in CWs. The application of CSW based CWs on improving N and P removals from <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> presents a win-win scenario. Such the reuse of CSW will benefit both the CSW disposal and nutrient control from wastewater. More significantly, such the application can transfer the CSW from a ‘waste’ to ‘useful’ material and can ease the pressure of construction waste solid management.

However, viruses were detected in 5 of 43 100 -ml samples of the column drainage water. Most of the viruses were adsorbed in the top 5 cm of soil. Virus removal was not affected by the infiltration rate, which varied between 15 and 55 cm/day. Flooding a column continuosly for 27 days with the sewage water virus mixture did not saturate the top few centimeters of soil with viruses and {{did not seem to}} affect virus movement. Flooding with deionized water caused virus desorption from the soil and increased their movement through the columns. Adding CaCl 2 to the deionized water prevented most of the virus desorption. Adding a pulse of deionized water followed by sewage water started a virus front moving through the columns, but the viruses were readsorbed and none was detected in outflow samples. Drying the soil for 1 day between applying the virus and flooding with deionized water greatly reduced desorption, and drying for 5 days prevented desorption. Large reductions (99. 99 % or more) of virus would be expected after passage of <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> through 250 cm of the calcareous sand similar to that used in our laboratory columns unless heavy rains fell within 1 day after the application of sewage stopped.

40|$|Chlorine is {{the most}} widely used {{disinfectant}} for disinfecting <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> before their discharge into receiving water bodies. Hong Kong, where seawater is used for toilet flushing, has largely decided to use chlorine for disinfecting its 1. 7 million cubic meters per day of saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents.</b> Upon chlorination, however, the extremely high levels of bromide ions in saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> can be oxidized to hypobromous acid/hypobromite which could then react with the organics in the <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> to form large quantities of brominated disinfection byproducts (DBPs). It has been demonstrated that brominated DBPs are significantly more toxic than their chlorinated analogues. The chlorinated saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> with brominated DBPs are discharged into receiving water bodies. In Hong Kong, the receiving water body is the coastal marine water, which covers 41 gazetted swimming beaches and many ecologically sensitive habitats. Due to the shortage of fresh water resources, many coastal cities around the world may adopt the practice using seawater for toilet flushing. Therefore, detection, formation and toxicity of brominated DBPs during chlorination of saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> have become an imminent issue that needs to be investigated and evaluated. In this study, a precursor ion scan method with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (ESI-tqMS) with/without ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) preseparation was improved. The improved method was then applied to fast selective detection of polar brominated DBPs in disinfected wastewater. Numerous polar brominated DBPs were detected in chlorinated saline sewage effluents; many of them are new brominated DBPs that have not been reported previously; three of them including 5 -bromosalicylic acid (5 BSA), 2, 6 -dibromo- 4 -nitrophenol (DBNPh) and bromomaleic acid (BMA) were identified with authentic standard in chlorinated saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents.</b> The formation of polar brominated DBPs, especially those newly detected ones, were studied {{for the first time in}} chlorinated primary and <b>secondary</b> saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents.</b> For a <b>secondary</b> saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent,</b> the number and levels of brominated DBPs formed during chlorination varied with chlorine dose. The numbers of brominated DBPs formed at chlorine doses of 6 and 10 mg/L as Cl 2 were similar, and more brominated DBPs formed at chlorine dose of 15 mg/L as Cl 2. Over 18 nitrogenous brominated DBPs were detected in the chlorinated secondary saline effluent, and most of them reached their maximum intensities at chlorine dose of 10 mg/L as Cl 2. The application of chlorine dose at breakpoint without significant free chlorine residual generally reduced nitrogenous DBP formation in the chlorinated secondary saline effluent with well nitrification. The formation of total organic halogen (TOX) increased with chlorine dose from 6 to 10 mg/L as Cl 2, but did not increase further when chlorine dose was increased to 15 mg/L as Cl 2; also, a higher total organic bromine (TOBr) to TOX ratio was observed at a higher chlorine dose. Compared to the <b>secondary</b> saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent,</b> the primary saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> generated less brominated DBPs in number and levels, and rarely generated nitrogenous brominated DBPs. A primary saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> with a high ammonia concentration was chosen for investigating the chlorination mode. As expected, the inactivation efficiency (for contact time 30 min) increased with increasing chlorine dose. To meet the temporary discharge standard (20, 000 cfu/ 100 mL), a minimum chlorine dose of 6. 0 mg/L as Cl 2 was required. When chlorine dose exceeded 4. 0 mg/L as Cl 2, the formation of TOBr and TOX during chlorination increased dramatically. Accordingly, an appropriate chlorine dose should be 6. 0 mg/L as Cl 2. The variation of the inactivation efficiency (for chlorine dose 6. 0 mg/L as Cl 2) with contact time included three phases, a slightly descending one, a rapidly descending one, and a slow descending one. In consideration of the normalized TOBr and TOX values by the inactivation efficiency, an appropriate contact time should be 40 min. Moreover, a three-step chlorination (i. e., chlorine dose 6. 0 mg/L as Cl 2 was conducted by dosing 2. 0 mg/L at 0, 5 and 10 min, respectively) was found to have a higher inactivation efficiency and lower TOBr and TOX values per unit inactivation efficiency than the one-step chlorination with the same chlorine dose. The mechanism for the inactivation could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of free chlorine and monochloramine. The chlorinated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> stimulated algal growth at low dilution factors (i. e., low effluent to seawater volumetric ratios), but inhibited algal growth at high dilution factors. Among the three kinds of <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents,</b> the chlorinated <b>secondary</b> freshwater effluent displayed the highest algal inhibition rate, and the chlorinated primary saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> exhibited higher algal inhibition rates than the chlorinated <b>secondary</b> saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent.</b> The algal inhibition rate of the chlorinated primary saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> decreased with the increase of chlorine dose, whereas the algal inhibition rate of the chlorinated <b>secondary</b> saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> increased with the increase of chlorine dose. Of the three newly identified brominated DBPs, 5 BSA inhibited algal growth in the pure medium, but stimulated algal growth when spiked in the corresponding chlorinated saline sewage effluent; BMA showed little effect on algal growth; DBNPh stimulated algal growth at low concentrations, but inhibited algal growth at high concentrations...|$|R

In April 1987 common bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L. Pers.) was seeded to a gravelly sandy loans soil and maintained under fairway conditions. Perennial ryegrass (Loliman perenne L.) was overseeded in the fall to maintain an actively growing turf. Plots were irrigated identically with either effluent or potable water. Soil and irrigation water samples were collected periodically and analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium (Na), calcium + magnesium (Ca +Mg), bicarbonates (HCO₃), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). Effluent water was found to contain a higher sodium absorption ratio (SAR), EC and greater concentrations of all the above elements {{with the exception of}} pH. Effluent irrigation lead to significantly lower seed germination and resulted in higher EC, Na, nitrate- nitrogen (NO₃-N), P and K concentrations in soils. Turf quality was assessed by visual evaluation under four N fertilization rates in each irrigation regime. Established effluent irrigated turf did not show signs of osmotic stress with a 15 - 20 % leaching fraction and responded to the nutrient content of this water during periods of higher irrigation rates. However, no single fertilization rate or irrigation regime consistently produced a superior turf quality. <b>Secondary</b> municipal <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> was used successfully for turf irrigation but the greater EC, Na and nutrient content of the water need to be considered by the turf professional making management decisions...|$|R
40|$|Reclaimed {{water is}} an {{important}} resource for areas with inadequate water supplies. However, {{there have been few}} studies on the variety of microorganisms found in this type of water, since typically reclaimed water is examined only for the presence of coliform bacteria. Many microorganisms, including the legionellae, are known to be more resistant to chlorine than are coliform bacteria. Previously, we detected > 10 (3) Legionella cells per ml in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> and observed no significant reduction in population numbers throughout the treatment process. In this study, we detected Legionella spp. in chlorinated effluent by using an EnviroAmp Legionella PCR kit and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining. However, {{we were not able to}} isolate Legionella spp. from either natural or seeded reclaimed water samples. This suggests that the Legionella spp. detected by the PCR and DFA methods may be injured or viable but nonculturable after exposure to the high residual chlorine levels typically found in this type of water source. The numbers of coliform bacteria were low (< 2 cells per 100 ml) in most reclaimed water samples and were not correlated with the presence or absence of Legionella spp. We also collected air samples from above a secondary aeration basin and analyzed them by using the PCR, DFA, and plate culture methods. Legionella spp. were detected in the air obtained from above the secondary basin with all three methods.

Upon chlorination, the high levels of bromide ions in saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> (up to 32 mg/L) can be oxidized to hypobromous acid/hypobromite, which could then react with organic matter in the <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> to form brominated disinfection byproducts (Br-DBPs). In this study, primary and <b>secondary</b> saline <b>sewage</b> <b>effluents</b> were collected and chlorinated at different chlorine doses, and a powerful precursor ion scan method using ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was adopted for detection and identification of polar Br-DBPs in these samples. With the new method, 54 major polar Br-DBPs were detected in the chlorinated saline effluents and six of them were newly identified as wastewater DBPs, including bromomaleic acid, 5 -bromosalicylic acid, 3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, 3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 6 -dibromo- 4 -nitrophenol, and 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol. The formation of polar Br-DBPs, especially those newly detected ones, during chlorination of the saline effluents was studied. For the secondary saline effluent, various polar Br-DBPs formed and reached their maximum levels at different chlorine doses, whereas for the primary saline effluent, the formation of polar Br-DBPs basically kept increasing with increasing chlorine dose.

Ion {{exchange}} for the desalination and tertiary {{treatment of waste water}} has involved the development of both the theory and practice of continuous countercurrent ion exchange (CCIX). The need for process development arose after a comprehensive review of the principles and properties of ion exchange as these applied to the treatment of saline sewage plant discharge streams. Initial cost studies also indicated that regenerant chemicals constituted the major cost item in an IX plant. On the basis, therefore, of the IX literature review and the cost exercise, the decision was made. to use CCIX and to develop a specific process for the treatment of <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent.</b> A study was made of the kinetic, equilibrium and organic absorption properties of cation and anion resins and how these properties related to the operation of a CCIX unit.

The various ion exchange reactions involved in the overall desalination and tertiary treatment process were monitored in a CCIX column and from these tests, a steady state theory of the operation of such a column incorporating the previously determined resin exchange properties was proposed and verified. The next phase of the investigation involved the design, construction and commissioning of an interlinked five column CCIX pilot plant. This was also a new development in that this complexity of CCIX plant had not formerly been operated. Initial test work involved synthetic saline solutions and an hydraulic investigation.

The exposure encompassed the full period of reproductive development for rainbow trout. Trout did not show any evidence of a dose-dependent change in growth. Fish exposed to 15 % effluent were the only group to show mortality (5 %) over {{the duration of the}} experiment. Trout at the highest effluent concentration had significantly higher liver size than reference water fish. Both male and female trout in the 15 % exposure group also exhibited significantly higher gonad weight than the reference group. In female trout, this gonad size increase could be explained by higher egg numbers. Female and male trout both displayed a significant increase in plasma 17 beta-estradiol levels after exposure to 15 % effluent, while neither sex had dose-dependent differences in plasma testosterone. Male trout displayed elevated vitellogenin levels and reduced plasma 11 -ketotestosterone concentration after exposure to 15 % effluent. Chemical examination of steroidal compounds, including both estrogens and androgens, in the wastewater revealed that only estrone was detectable at a mean concentration of 4. 5 ng/L. It is assumed that the effects observed in trout exposed to 15 % effluent were consistent with stimulation of reproductive development due to very low levels of estrogens.

This initial feasibility study used synthetic nutrient mixtures and <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> as feed to a laboratory-scale methanotrophic attached-film expanded bed (MAFEB) reactor operated at 35 °C and 20 °C. The MAFEB system operated successfully at low nutrient concentrations under a variety of nutrient-limited conditions. Using a synthetic nutrient mixture with a nitrogen:phosphorus feed ratio (w/w) of 9 : 1, phosphate concentrations were reduced from 1. 3 mg P/ L to below 0. 1 mg P/ L, and ammonia was reduced from 12 mg N/L to approximately 1 mg N/L on a continuous flow basis, with a bed hydraulic retention time of 4. 8 hours. The average nutrient uptake rates from synthetic nutrient mixtures were 100 mg nitrogen and 10 mg phosphorus/L of expanded bed/d. Nutrient assimilation rates increased with increasing growth rate and with increasing temperature. Nitrogen/phosphorus uptake ratios varied from 8 to 13, and the observed yield varied from 0. 11 to 0. 16 g volatile solids (VS) /g chemical oxygen demand (COD). Nutrient removal from <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> was successfully demonstrated using sewage effluent from two local treatment plants. Nutrient concentrations of 10 - 15 mg N/L and 1. 0 - 1. 8 mg P/L were reduced consistently below 1 mg N/L and 0. 1 mg P/L. No supplemental nutrients were added to the sewage to attain these removal efficiencies since the nutrient mass ratios were similar to that required by the methanotrophs. Removal rates were lower at 20 °C than at 35 °C, but high removal efficiencies were maintained at both temperatures. Effluent suspended solids concentrations ranged from 8 to 30 mg volatile suspended solids (VSS) /L, and the effluent soluble COD concentration averaged 30 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|This field {{experiment}} evaluated {{the use of}} secondary treated municipal wastewater for irrigation of turfgrasses. Common bermudagrass (Cvnodon dactvlon L. Pers.) was seeded to a gravelly sandy loam. In the Fall, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was overseeded to maintain an actively growing turf. Plots were irrigated identically with either effluent or potable water. Soil and water samples were collected periodically and analyzed for pH, salinity, major cations, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Turf quality was assessed using a visual evaluation technique. Effluent irrigation produced significantly lower seed germination and resulted in increased salinity, sodium, nitrate and phosphorus concentrations in soils. Leachate waters contained greater salinity and higher concentrations of major cations than irrigation waters. Established effluent irrigated turf did not show signs of salt stress and produced turf quality as good as potable irrigated plots. High quality turf was grown using <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> for irrigation...|$|E

The maximum daily DO-% saturation in the SSE during flooding ranged from 30 to 450 %, depending {{on the length of}} flooding and seasonal effects of temperature and solar radiation. Diurnal cycles of Eh in the SSE and the top 0 to 2 cm of soil indicated that oxygen production by algae and bacterial nitrifying and denitrifying reactions at the soil-water interface are occurring daily for limited periods during flooding and that these reactions might contribute to the net-N removal and renovation of SSE by soil filtration...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{increased}} water demand, water shortage {{is going to}} get worse in the forthcoming years. Water scarcity is already a fact of life in arid and semi-arid regions where agricultural, domestic and industrial water demands compete for this limited resource. Continuous population growth, rising living standards, rapid industrialization and urbanization have limited the freshwater sources available for agricultural practices (Katz and Dosoretz 2008). Conventionally biologically treated sewage water may not meet the requirements for the discharge and permissible limit of wastewater for its reuse. These processes are, therefore, being ruled out due to requirement of large space, long residence time and skilled technicians. However, even after treatment, <b>secondary</b> treated <b>sewage</b> (STS) <b>effluent</b> contains organic matter and nutrients which cause eutrophication and increase the oxygen demand of the surface water (Sharma 2013).|$|R
40|$|The {{discharge}} of <b>secondary</b> treated <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> from the Mokapu Ocean Outfall into Kailua Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, represents a point {{source of pollution}} to the bay. Public health considerations are therefore of significant importance due to bodily contact and the possible ingestion of recreational water. The impact of the Mokapu outfall on the shoreline water quality at Kailua Bay was assessed in 1990 and 1991. The concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli, enterococci, C. perfringens) were determined in <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> samples and in water samples collected from the zone of mixing (ZOM) sites, offshore sites, nearshore sites, and shoreline sites of Kailua Bay. The indicator bacterial loads discharged from the outfall were on the orders of 106 E. coli/ 100 ml, 105 enterococci/ 100 ml, and 104 C. perfringens/ 100 ml. Within the ZOM, some of the sewage surfaced, however {{most of it was}} transported submerged and in a northerly direction. The sewage was also transported submerged to the two offshore sites located north and south of the ZOM but preferentially north. The nearshore data also suggested the movement of sewage in a direction north-northwest of the outfall. The absence or recoveries of only very low numbers of bacteria from the nearshore sites closest to the Kailua shoreline did not provide evidence that sewage from the outfall was possibly impacting the quality of the shoreline recreational waters. The geometric means of the seven true shoreline sites all met Hawaii's marine recreational water quality standard. The two other shoreline sites which equaled or exceeded the standard are actually the mouths of land-based fresh water sources which are known to contain high concentrations of indicator bacteria. The overall results suggested that the quality of shoreline water is more likely impacted by land-based sources such as rainfall events which increase surface runoff.

40|$|Stormwater {{from three}} Sydney urban {{catchments}} {{show that in}} separately sewered areas has a greater concentration and carries a greater total load of pollutants than effluent from secondary sewage treatment plants. Pollution and nutrient indicators are highly concentrated in the first flush of a storm, but fall rapidly to low levels. An important exception is that phosphate concentration remains approximately constant. When the discharge increases sharply, the suspended solids and phosphates increase slightly. Faecal coliform concentration is usually between one and two orders of magnitude less than raw sewage. Some stormwater samples were subject to simple settling for up to an hour: typically, these showed that on an annual basis, short duration settling of storm water could remove amounts of pollutants comparable to the amount which could be removed by tertiary treatment of <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> from the same catchment.

40|$|Because of the {{increasing}} emphasis placed upon land application {{as a means of}} wastewater disposal, it is important to evaluate the influences of different factors upon virus survival in soil. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the effects of various environmental variables on virus persistence. Test samples of soil were placed in vials, and the soil was wetted with suspensions of virus in either distilled water, unchlorinated <b>secondary</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent,</b> or mixtures of effluent and water. The viruses used were coxsackieviruses A 9 and B 3, echovirus 1, poliovirus 2, rotavirus SA 11, and bacteriophages T 2 and MS 2. The rate of virus inactivation was evaluated statistically with regard to conditions under which the vials were incubated and to the soil characteristics. The factors that were found to influence virus survival were temperature, soil moisture content, presence of aerobic microorganisms, degree of virus adsorption to the soil, soil levels of resin-extractable phosphorus, exchangeable aluminium, and soil pH. Overall, temperature and virus adsorption to soil appeared to be the most important factors affecting virus survival...|$|E

High concentrations (10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 / 100 ml) of FC and FS could be recovered from samples of stream waters obtained from unpolluted and polluted sites. Most of the stream-water samples collected in urbanized areas, but upstream from the <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> discharge site (unpolluted stream), contained higher concentrations of FC than the 200 to 400 FC/ 100 ml considered by state and federal laws as being polluted with fecal matter and as a possible source of enteric pathogens. Only after analyzing stream samples for concentrations and the ratio of FC and FS, as well as concentrations of phosphates, was it possible to determine which stream samples {{did or did not}} contain <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent.</b> The results show that the impact of <b>sewage</b> <b>effluent</b> discharge into streams on Oahu, Hawaii, cannot be properly evaluated by analyzing the stream samples for only FC as mandated by law.
