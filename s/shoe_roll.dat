50|$|According to Chinese {{scientist}} Sun Syan, Sogdian songs, {{dances and}} music always {{could be heard}} in the palaces, in the city and village streets on the Chinese empire. Japanese scientist Kisibe distinguished the names of 31 musicians from the West who worked in the palace of the Tang dynasty. Chinese princesses Yan and Rokshan received dance classes and learned dance techniques from Sogdian dancers. According to Chinese sources, the group of young male and female dancers from Kesh (present day Shahrisabz in Uzbekistan) and Samarkand performed wearing vermilion dress and red leather <b>shoes.</b> <b>Rolling,</b> twirling and twisting the body were unique aspects of their dances which can be seen today both in Far-Eastern and Uzbek female dances.|$|R

The music received strong reviews and {{is reminiscent of the}} catchy power pop of The Beat, particularly in the opening song, Rock and <b>Roll</b> <b>Shoes.</b> Additionally, Flying High showcases Paul Collins' alt-country, roots-rock and Americana styles, with the singles Will You Be A Woman and Afton Place, which were released worldwide as music videos.|$|R

In 1983 Furay became senior pastor of the Calvary Chapel in Broomfield, Colorado, a non-sectarian Christian church in the Denver area. He continues to perform as a solo artist, and very occasionally with Poco. He toured as an opening act for America and Linda Ronstadt during the Summer of 2006. The 2006 release of his CD The Heartbeat of Love returned Furay to his early country rock roots with a contemporary flair.|$|R

50|$|On {{the ensuing}} drive, Bills quarterback Rob Johnson led a 5-play, 37-yard {{drive to the}} Titans' 24-yard line. After Del Greco's field goal, Kevin Williams {{returned}} the ensuing kickoff 33 yards to give the Bills good field position at their own 39 yard line. Johnson began the drive with a completion to rookie wide receiver Peerless Price for 14 yards and a first down. After an incompletion, the Bills ran a draw play on second down, and running back Jonathan Linton picked up a 12 yard gain for another first down at the Titans' 35 yard line {{with less than a}} minutes remaining. On the next play from scrimmage, Johnson lost a shoe in a scramble, and with the clock running, he had no time to put it back on. With only one <b>shoe,</b> Johnson <b>rolled</b> out and hit Price on an out pattern, and he broke a tackle and got out of bounds at the 24 yard line with 20 seconds left. After this play, Wade Phillips sent out the field goal unit for {{what appeared to be a}} game-winning attempt. Special Teams Coordinator Bruce DeHaven wanted the Bills to run another play so the Bills could kick the field goal with less time on the clock, but was overruled. With only 16 seconds remaining in the game, Bills kicker Steve Christie made a 41-yard field goal to put Buffalo in the lead, 16-15.|$|R

5000|$|Finn is a 5-foot tall teenage human. He {{has several}} missing teeth, yellow hair, {{of which the}} length differs due to {{occasional}} haircuts. His eyes and eyebrows appear black from a distance, but according to lead character designer Andy Ristaino, they are blue. He wears a white bear hat, short blue pants, and a light blue T-shirt. He also has a green backpack, black <b>shoes,</b> and socks <b>rolled</b> down to his ankles. Finn has peach color skin.Finn is a teenage boy who is average height and weight. His arms and legs are very thin, {{but he has a}} wide torso. He is missing several teeth because they often face monsters that hit him in the face, also he often bites rocks and other hard objects. These teeth are sometimes round or pointed and constantly changing place, depending on the occasion. In the episode [...] "The Enchiridion!" [...] it can be seen for a moment that his left eye is green while his right eye is blue, as if he has heterochromia. However, Andy Ristaino confirmed that this was a [...] "special occasion" [...] and that in fact both eyes are light blue, which is not visible to the naked eye. He also points out in that episode that Finn had a small round nose but this is considered more of an error or humorous scene.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{contract}} {{was to investigate the}} viability of a new process for dewatering paper called displacement pressing. The term “displacement pressing” was coined in the 1980 s by researchers to describe a paper dewatering process where air is blown through a sheet of paper while it is being pressed. It was shown at that time that the combination of air and low pressing force could dramatically increase both sheet bulk and sheet solids which in theory would translate into huge savings in energy and fiber consumption. But there was a catch. Although the research results were dramatic, no one could figure out a commercially viable process to carry out displacement pressing. All research work had been done with batch processes, and there was no obvious way to convert these processes into a continuous process. By the end of the early 1990 ’s no one was researching in this area because no continuous process existed. Recently we proposed a new method to carry out displacement pressing. Our process uses special pressing fabrics and a special 4 roll press that we call a “Beck Cluster Press” or BCP. The BCP provides a pressurized atmosphere that acts on a moving web of paper and fabrics. The special fabrics designed for this process use this atmosphere to press the sheet and at the same time, these special fabrics force air through the sheet to carry out displacement pressing. 1 Because of the complexity and cost of building the first functioning BCP, a simple simulator was built to confirm and study the process. Although results from this simulator were extremely favorable, financial times were hard in the paper industry. We are grateful for the DOE contract that allowed us to continue research that showed the tremendous benefits of displacement pressing. Specifically, accomplishments from the DOE contract are as follows: 1. A narrow (5 ” wide sheet) lab Beck Cluster Press (BCP) was started up, and made operational. This press accepts hand sheets and displacement presses them at conditions that duplicate commercial conditions for dwell time, and pressure. 2. The lab BCP machine was used to verify simulator results. Results showed the lab BCP gave paper dryness that exceeded simulator results for dryness. 3. Sheet samples were obtained for several paper grades. These samples were pressed conventionally (<b>shoe</b> and <b>roll</b> presses) and with the lab BCP. Results showed significant gains in bulk (5 - 48 %) compared to commercially pressed sheets while producing similar or higher dryness. These results verified the predictions of the earlier research papers. 4. Sheet bulk exceeded the Agenda 2020 goal a 7 % increase. This increase in bulk was reported by Agenda 2020 as being worth about 3 billion dollars per year in fiber savings. Potential energy savings due to dryness savings could be worth $ 1 billion per year. However energy savings and fiber savings are inter-related so while savings are likely in both energy and fiber at the same time, increasing one will cause the other to decrease. 5. Based on the significant results of small-scale BCP trials, a 1 m pilot BCP press stand was built to determine scalability of the process. 6. 1 m pilot press stand was started up. This machine was shown to hold design pressure. Drive issues however prevented operation at operating speed and pressure during the contact period. Improvements to the drive system {{since the end of the}} DOE contract have allowed us to reach operating pressure and speed. 7. The last DOE objective of passing paper through the 1 m BCP was not reached due to drive issues and the desire to study and qualify sealing systems. All other original objectives and the added objective (by contract revision) of this ambitious project have been met. 8. Several paper companies have showed interest in helping us commercialize this process. Interest is so high that these companies appear willing to invest in further development...|$|R
