A joint industry project was therefore carried out by Det Nordce Veritas (DNV) [1] to investigate the structural capacity of these connections from autumn 2009 to January 2011.

This study investigated if conjunctival GCs contribute to ocular <b>surface</b> immune <b>tolerance.</b> Antigens applied to the ocular surface, imaged by confocal microscopy, passed into the conjunctival stroma through goblet cell associated passages (GAPs) in wild type C 57 BL/ 6 (WT), while ovalbumin (OVA) was retained in the epithelium of SAM pointed domain containing ETS transcription factor (Spdef) knockout mice (Spdef−/−) that lack GCs and are a novel model of dry eye.

40|$|For a given target {{at a given}} range, the {{sensitivity}} of a radar {{is proportional to the}} transmit power and the gains of the trans-mitting and receiving antennas, which are the same for a monostatic radar such as the Haystack Ultrawideband Satellite Imaging Radar (HUSIR). As the operating frequency increases, it becomes more difficult to generate high transmit power, so it becomes vitally important that the gain of the antenna is maximized. The gain of a reflector antenna is inversely proportional to its surface errors in an exponential manner.

One of the technologies being considered is the inflatable microstrip reflectarray. A conventional inflatable parabolic reflector antenna will offer similar advantages with the added capability of wide electrical bandwidth. However, it suffers from the difficulty of maintaining its required large, thin, and curved-parabolic surface in the space environment.

The company in this case claims that their invested robot cell, with CNC machine isn't used enough. The questions here are: How can we improve {{the use of the}} robot cell? Which products are appropriate for the production in the robot cell?   As a method to come to a conclusion, an analysis has been made over the manufactured products. And also interviews with machine operators and the production management. Our work has also been based on literature studies,   because the production moment has been compared with models from Lean Production theories.       The analysis shows that there are some limitations in the robot cell, which means that there are several demands that have to be fulfilled. From the investigated material our conclusion is that many products don't keep up with following demands: length, <b>surface,</b> <b>tolerance</b> dimensions, and shape. As a result of this, there are some products that can´t be manufactured in the robot cell, and therefore has to be produced in the ordinary CNC machine group.   Interviews have declared that there doesn't exist any documentation from the production in the robot cell, which causes stop in the production. The data collection shows that an inner setting in the robot cell varies a lot, because the article supply is vast. Therefore it's hard to estimate average time for inner settings. The total time for inner settings could be reduced by shorten time for cleaning the CNC machine, pre-programming the robot and using fixtures which can be attached easily. This should increase the ability to run more articles in the robot cell.   The conclusion is that the company could improve the production, by upgrading and investing in equipment for the robot cell. Improvements can also be achieved by reduce the time for inner settings, and also by collect statistics from the production in the robot cell. This should make it easier to find reasons that keep the utilization rate low. ...|$|E
40|$|Phase change {{technology}} is a science that is continually finding new applications, from passive refrigeration cycles to semiconductor cooling. The primary heat transfer techniques associated with phase change heat transfer are pool boiling, flow boiling, and spray cooling. Of these techniques, spray cooling is the least studied {{and the most recent}} to receive attention in the scientific community. Spray cooling is capable of removing large amounts of heat between the cooled surface and the liquid, with reported heat flux capabilities of up to 1000 W/cm 2 for water. Many previous studies have emphasized heat flux as a function of spray parameters and test conditions. Enhanced spray cooling investigations to date have been limited to surface roughness studies. These studies concluded that <b>surface</b> <b>tolerance</b> (i. e. variations in machined surface finish) had an impact upon heat flux when using pressure atomized sprays. Analogous pool boiling studies with enhanced surfaces have shown heat flux enhancement. A spray cooling study using enhanced surfaces beyond the surface roughness range may display heat flux enhancement as well. In the present study, a group of extended and embedded surfaces (straight fins, cubic pin fins, pyramids, dimples and porous tunnels) have been investigated {{to determine the effects of}} enhanced surface structure on heat flux. The surface enhancements were machined on the top surface of copper heater blocks with a cross-sectional area of 2. 0 cm 2. Measurements were also obtained on a flat surface for baseline comparison purposes. Thermal performance data was obtained under saturated (pure fluid at 101 kPa), nominally degassed (chamber pressure of 41. 4 kPa) and gassy conditions (chamber with N 2 gas at 101 kPa). The study shows that both extended and embedded structures (beyond the surface roughness range) promote heat flux enhancement for both degassed and gassy spray cooling conditions. The study also shows that straight fins provide the best utilization of surface area added for heat transfer. An Energy conservation based CHF correlation for flat surface spray cooling was also developed. CHF predictions were compared against published and non-published studies by several researchers. Results for the correlations performance show an average mean error of ± 17. 6 % with an accuracy of ± 30 % for 88 % of the data set compared against...|$|E
40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide {{has been}} shown to {{modulate}} inflammatory and immune responses in various systems. Recent studies in our laboratory and colleagues have shown that intracutaneously injected calcitonin gene-related peptide impairs the induction of contact hypersensitivity in mice, and participates in the pathogenesis of failed contact hypersensitivity induction after acute, low-dose ultraviolet B radiation. In this study we investigated the ability of calcitonin gene-related peptide to induce tolerance in normal and mast cell deficient mice and we examined the extent to which calcitonin gene-related peptide contributes to the tolerance induced by acute, low-dose ultraviolet B radiation. Calcitonin gene-related peptide was injected intradermally followed by application of 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene to the injected skin <b>surface.</b> <b>Tolerance</b> was assessed by re-exposing the mice 2 wk later to a second, sensitizing dose of 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene on uninjected skin. We found that calcitonin gene-related peptide induced tolerance to 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene in both normal and mast cell deficient mice. Calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced tolerance was blocked by intradermal injection of a calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist [CGRP-(8 - 37) ] that selectively blocks the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. Tolerance was also abolished by intraperitoneally injected anti-interleukin- 10, but not anti-tumor necrosis factor α, antibodies. When 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene was painted on skin into which splenic dendritic cells pretreated with calcitonin gene-related peptide had been injected, tolerance was observed. Calcitonin gene-related peptide- treated dendritic cells mixed with anti-interleukin- 10 antibody prior to intradermal injection failed to promote tolerance. Finally, injection of CGRP-(8 - 37) into skin that was subsequently exposed to acute, low-dose ultraviolet B radiation partially prevented tolerance induced by local application of 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene. These results indicate that calcitonin gene-related peptide has the capacity to promote cutaneous tolerance through an interleukin- 10 -dependent mechanism. This mechanism, which does not require the participation of mast cells, contributes to the tolerance promoted by acute, low-dose ultraviolet B radiation. Thus, calcitonin gene-related peptide from cutaneous nerve endings {{plays a key role in}} the local immune aberrations caused by ultraviolet B radiation...|$|E
