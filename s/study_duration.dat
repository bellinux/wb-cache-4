50|$|The foam {{formulation}} {{has been}} studied in two pivotal, randomized, double-blind trials in patients with mild to severe plaque psoriasis. In the first study (randomized, phase 2) of 302 patients with body and scalp psoriasis, more patients treated with Cal/BD foam achieved 'clear' or ' almost clear' disease (45%) according to the IGA by 4 weeks compared with Cal 50 mcg/g or BD 0.5 mg/g (15% and 31%, respectively). In a second study (randomized, phase 3) of patients with psoriasis on the body (N=426), a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with once-daily Cal/BD foam achieved 'clear' or 'almost clear' disease (53.3%) vs. those receiving the vehicle control (4.8%). Mean modified PASI score was also significantly lower for patients treated with Cal/BD foam compared with vehicle (2.0 vs 5.5, respectively, at week 4), and itch relief was significantly greater in patients using the Cal/BD foam beginning at day 3. A recent study compared the Cal/BD foam formulation with the ointment formulation in patients with mild to severe psoriasis. At 4 weeks, significantly more patients achieved treatment success, defined as 'clear' or 'almost clear' disease according to the IGA with Cal/BD foam (54.6%) versus the ointment (43.0%).

Durations of both main and recovery phases depend on types of interplanetary drivers. On the average, duration of main phase of storms induced by compressed regions (CIR and Sheath) is shorter than by MC and Ejecta while duration of recovery phase of CIR- and Sheath-induced storms is longer. Analysis of durations of individual storms shows that durations of main and recovery phases anti-correlate for CIR- and Sheath-induced storms and there is not dependence between them for (MC+Ejecta) -induced storms.

40|$|In this article, an {{alternative}} for Tinto's integration theory of student persistence is proposed and tested. In the proposed theory, time available for individual study {{is considered a}} major determinant of both <b>study</b> <b>duration</b> and graduation rate of students in a particular curriculum. In this view, other activities in the curriculum, in particular lectures, constrain self-study time and therefore must {{have a negative impact on}} persistence. To test this theory, we collected <b>study</b> <b>duration</b> and graduation rate information of all-almost 14, 000 students-enrolling in eight Dutch medical schools between 1989 and 1998. In addition, information was gathered regarding the timetables of each of these curricula in the particular period: lectures hours, hours spent in small-group tutorials, practicals, and time available for self-study. Structural equation modeling was used to study relations among these variables. In line with our predictions, time available for self-study was the only determinant of graduation rate and <b>study</b> <b>duration.</b> Lectures were negatively related to self-study time, negatively related to graduation rate, and positively related to <b>study</b> <b>duration.</b> The results suggest that extensive lecturing may be detrimental in higher education. However, in the curricula employing limited lecturing considerable energy was spent in supporting self-study activities of students and preventing postponement of learning. Given our findings, both activities will likely have large pay offs, in particular in curricula with low graduation rates...|$|E
40|$|Background: When {{discontinuation}} in COPD {{randomized controlled}} trials (RCTs) is unevenly distributed between treatments (differential dropout), {{the capacity to}} demonstrate treatment effects may be reduced. We investigated {{the impact of the}} time of differential dropout on exacerbation outcomes in RCTs, in relation to <b>study</b> <b>duration</b> and COPD severity. Methods: A post hoc analysis of 2, 345 patients from three RCTs of 6 - and 12 -month duration was performed to compare budesonide/formoterol and formoterol in moderate, severe, and very severe COPD. Outcomes were exacerbation rate, time-to-first exacerbation, or discontinuation; patients were stratified by disease severity. Outcomes were studied by censoring data monthly from 1 to 12 months. Results: In patients treated with budesonide/formoterol, annualized exacerbation rates (AERs) were comparable for each <b>study</b> <b>duration</b> (rate ratio [RR] = 0. 6). With formoterol, the AER decreased with <b>study</b> <b>duration</b> (RR = 1. 20 at 1 month to RR = 0. 86 at 12 months). There was a treatment-related difference in exacerbation rates of 45 %– 48 % for shorter study durations (≤ 4 months) and 27 % for 12 -month duration. This treatment-related difference in exacerbation rates was comparable for the three disease severities in studies ≤ 4 months (range: 39 %– 51 %), but this difference decreased with longer study durations, especially in more severe groups (22 % and 29 % at 12 months). There were fewer discontinuations with budesonide/formoterol; the treatmentrelated difference in time-to-first discontinuation decreased by <b>study</b> <b>duration</b> (35 %, 30 %, 26 %, and 22 % at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively). Numbers of differential dropouts increased with increasing disease severity, being greatest during second, third, and fourth months. Conclusions: COPD severity and <b>study</b> <b>duration</b> impact exacerbation as an outcome in double-blind RCTs. This effect is most obvious in patients with severe/very severe COPD and in studies that are longer than 4 months. Early differential dropout particularly impacts study outcome, producing a “healthy survivor effect,” which reduces estimations of treatment impact on exacerbations...|$|E
