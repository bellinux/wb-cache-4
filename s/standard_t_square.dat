40|$|Atmospheric {{turbulence}} parameters epsilon (turbulent {{energy dissipation}} rate), and C sub <b>T</b> <b>squared</b> (temperature structure function) were {{measured in the}} marine boundary layer during the Cooperative Experiment for West Coast Oceanography and Meteorology (CEWCOM- 76). The atmospheric stability was characterized by measurements of profiles of mean wind velocity, temperature and relative humidity. This paper will focus on turbulence properties and turbulent heat flux measured during four marine fog events. The fogs were characterized by a slightly unstable boundary layer with moderate increases of heat flux during the fog. An ensemble average of the fog events showed that C sub <b>T</b> <b>squared</b> and epsilon reached peak values immediately {{before and after the}} fog was encountered. An analysis of the dimensionless temperature structure function C sub <b>T</b> <b>squared</b> normalized by the square of the temperature gradient) gave lower values of temperature fluctuations in fog than in clear airPrepared for: Naval Air Systems Command, AIR 370, Washington D.
