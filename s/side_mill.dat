40|$|The {{design of}} cutters is an {{important}} consideration for the manufacture of helicoidal surfaces such as extruder screw surfaces. These surfaces are produced mostly by milling processes using form cutters of end mill type, <b>side</b> <b>mill</b> type or disc type, such as side-and-face mill or grinding wheel. The methodology proposed in the paper addresses {{the problem of the}} design of cutters for the machining of helicoidal surfaces. Using the proposed methodology, the characteristic profile(s) of the cutter can be determined from the given cross-sectional profile and lead of a helicoidal surface. By sweeping this characteristic profile along an appropriate path or around an axis, the geometry of the specific form cutter can be obtained. Such a geometry could be a turning tool, an end mill, a <b>side</b> <b>mill,</b> a side-and-face mill or a grinding wheel, depending on the process adopted for manufacture. The proposed methodology {{can also be used to}} determine the geometry of the helicoidal surface that will be obtained by using a given cutter. In the paper, the procedure to obtain the geometry of the cutters for machining extruder screws is explained with illustrations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{compressor}} rotors {{usually are}} helical surfaces with constant pitch and are composed crossing profiles. Frequently, for repair operations occurs the reconstruction necessity {{for one or}} both of the worms, drive and driven, from the helical compressors gear. The helical composed surface of rotor flank is generated usually with <b>side</b> <b>mill.</b> The knowledge of worm shape can not be made from geometrical conditions. In these conditions it is necessary to determine the flank form by actual measuring the crossing profiles of these parts. So, the theoretical helical surface of the worm is being substituted by an assembly of helical lines which together with crossing profiles forms points cloud resulted from measuring leads to a polyhedral expression of the flank rotor. Numerically, this surface type is expressed by a coordinate array which shows its discrete image. The profiling of cutting tool bounded by a revolution surface reciprocally enveloping with the substitutive surface of the helical one represents a special problem. In this paper is proposed an algorithm for polyhedral expression of the helical surface previously determined by reverse engineering methods and an algorithm for the determination of the specific enveloping condition at contact with a discrete surface. It is presented an example for a compressor rotor measured on a 3 D measuring machine, the algorithm for the transformation of the gathered points cloud in a surface with polyhedral expression. Given these conditions there were determined the enveloping condition and the axial section of the <b>side</b> <b>mill...</b>|$|E

40|$|Implementing {{real-time}} {{machining process}} control at shop floor has great significance on raising {{the efficiency and}} quality of product manufacturing. A framework and implementation methods of real-time machining process control based on STEP-NC are presented in this paper. Data model compatible with ISO 14649 standard is built to transfer high-level real-time machining process control information between CAPP systems and CNC systems, in which EXPRESS language is used to define new STEP-NC entities. Methods for implementing real-time machining process control at shop floor are studied and realized on an open STEP-NC controller, which is developed using object-oriented, multithread, and shared memory technologies conjunctively. Cutting force at specific direction of machining feature in <b>side</b> <b>mill</b> is chosen to be controlled object, and a fuzzy control algorithm with self-adjusting factor is designed and embedded in the software CNC kernel of STEP-NC controller. Experiments are carried out to verify the proposed framework, STEP-NC data model, and implementation methods for real-time machining process control. The results of experiments prove that real-time machining process control tasks can be interpreted and executed correctly by the STEP-NC controller at shop floor, in which actual cutting force is kept around ideal value, whether axial cutting depth changes suddenly or continuously...|$|E

40|$|Computerized numerically {{controlled}} (CNC) routers {{have been used}} under hard processing conditions {{with the aim of}} raising productivity. Therefore, tool wear progresses rapidly, and burr formation occurs on the surface of wood and wood-based materials frequently. Because this burr formation greatly influences product quality and productivity, the development of a system that can monitor it automatically is needed. In this study, to monitor the burr formed because of tool wear, a charge-coupled device (CCD) vision sensor with high reliability in monitoring was installed in a CNC router, and a system for monitoring the burr formation in <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> and for removing it automatically was developed. In addition, verification experiments of this system were carried out. The main results obtained are as follow: The <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> system for monitoring burr formation was composed of a CCD vision sensor, a personal computer (PC) for CNC router control, and a monitoring PC to control other devices and collect sampling data for the burr formation.

40|$|For {{time and}} cost saving reasons, the lowest surface {{roughness}} possible is sought in milling operations. High speed milling is recommended {{in order to}} minimise the amount of material to be removed in subsequent finishing operations, e. g. grinding, electrical discharge machining or manual polishing. Several roughness parameters are usually employed for the characterization of polished surfaces. In this paper relevant roughness parameters are determined for polishing operations after <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> with cylindrical milling tool or after ball-end milling. It was observed that, in polishing operations after <b>side</b> <b>milling,</b> most relevant parameters are average roughness parameters such as Rk and Ra.

40|$|This project {{deals with}} {{modelling}} and simulation of <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> using Finite Element Analysis. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to validate the cutting force result between simulation and experiment. It describes how the finite element analysis predicts the cutting force before the machining process is proceeded. The data obtained in this project were cutting force and stress during the <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> process. Machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, spindle speed were also studied. The cutting force and stress prediction was done by using finite element analysis software called ABAQUS. The finite element analysis was analyzed based on the interaction between aluminium 6061 work piece and high speed steel tool cutter. The cutting forces were measured by using dynamometer during the <b>side</b> <b>milling</b> process. The machining parameters were calculated before the experiment started. Finally, the cutting force in the three directions which is X, Y and Z direction versus time was measured and recorded in the data acquisition software which is Dyno-ware. From the results of dynamometer, noise has been eliminated to get the certain time period of cutting force. The results between simulation and experiment indicates that the predicted and the measured cutting force of milling process are in a good agreement...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{polishing}} time, the lowest surface roughness possible is sought in milling operations.

In ball-end milling, feed per tooth f of 0. 05 and 0. 40 mm tooth- 1 revolution- 1, and radial depth of cut Rd of 0. 25 and 0. 40 mm were taken into account. Results show that, in <b>side</b> <b>milling,</b> cutting time was the same regardless of feed employed. On the contrary, in ball-end milling, highest polishing time was obtained if both feed and radial depth is high. At low feed and/or radial depth values, polishing time decreases markedly...|$|R
