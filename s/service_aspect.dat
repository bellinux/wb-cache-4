40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{discourse}} of health managers on aspects related to delay in tuberculosis diagnosis. This was a qualitative research study, conducted with 16 Family Health Unit managers. The empirical data were obtained through semi-structured interviews. The analysis was based on the theoretical framework of the French school of discourse analysis. According to the managers&# 8217; statements, the delay in tuberculosis diagnosis is related to patient and health <b>service</b> <b>aspects.</b> As for patient aspects, managers report fear, prejudice and lack of information as factors that may promote a delayed diagnosis. Regarding health <b>service</b> <b>aspects,</b> structural problems and lack of professional skills were reported. The discourse of managers should be considered to qualify tuberculosis control actions and to prevent delays in diagnosis...|$|R

In 1974, Sealy published The Community and the Police: Conflict or Cooperation with co-author Joseph Fink. In this book, Sealy and Fink wrote that [...] "if people are to view the police as an integral and beneficial component of the community structure, the police must improve the social <b>service</b> <b>aspect</b> of their mission," [...] but that too often police attitudes are self-serving rather than community-serving. To address this problem, they proposed increased minority recruitment, human services training, and citizen participation in law enforcement.|$|E

[...] Keller and Ludwig go on to state that while service providers will most often be the lead entity in taking on SLOs there is no firm definition as such and any entity can be responsible for an SLO.

5000|$|An {{interesting}} fan <b>service</b> <b>aspect</b> of this relationship-building is that Kururugi {{will become}} [...] "strong friends" [...] with whichever of the InuYasha group {{he or she}} has spent the most time with. When paired with the opposite sex, love triangles begin to form between the canon pairings and the player character. For example, if the male Kururugi spends a majority of his interval events bonding with Kagome, InuYasha will grow increasingly jealous (or vice versa), or if the female Kururugi spends a majority of her interval events bonding with Miroku, Sango will get jealous. Also, there is a chance for the female Kururugi to be paired with Sesshomaru. This is achieved when the player gets the female character in some of the areas where Sesshomaru is. No negative impacts occur to the canon pairings if Shippo is the one the player becomes closest to, given that both Michiru and Kaname consider him a little brother.|$|E
50|$|Although {{rates of}} formal {{education}} have increased, many adults entering the workforce are lacking the basic math, reading and interpersonal skills that the “unskilled” labor force requires. The lines between {{formal and informal}} learning have been blurred due to the higher rates of college attendance. The largest increase in population for manual or low-skilled labor is in individuals who attended college but did not receive a degree. A recent collection of cross-sectional surveys were conducted and polled employers across the United States to gauge which skills are required for jobs which do not require college degrees. These surveys concluded that 70% require some kind of customer <b>service</b> <b>aspect,</b> 61% require reading or writing paragraphs, 65% require math, 51% {{require the use of}} computers. In regards to training and academic credentials, 71% require a high school diploma, 61% require specific vocational experience. The rates of men entering the low-skilled labor force have remained static over the last fifty years, indicating a shift of less than 1%. Women’s participation in the unskilled labor force has steadily increased and projections indicate that this trend will continue.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{passenger}} willingness-to-pay (WTP) {{for improving}} the quality levels of a bus service is examined. Specifically, {{the objective of this}} research is to provide a tool for evaluating passenger willingness-to-pay by considering some qualitative <b>service</b> <b>aspects,</b> in addition to the traditional quantitative <b>service</b> <b>aspects</b> like travel time and cost. The adopted methodology is built on the calibration of behavioural models based on user choices. The WTP values are obtained as marginal rates of substitution between some service quality attributes and travel cost at constant utility. For this purpose, Multinomial and Mixed Logit models are introduced. The models were calibrated by using the data collected from an SP experiment in which each user makes a choice between an alternative representing the current service and two alternatives representing hypothetical bus services. In order {{to take into account the}} randomness of the estimated WTP, the limits of the confidence intervals are calculated...|$|R

30|$|According to the S-D logic, {{value is}} {{experienced}} and created when {{products and services}} are used, and so the customer becomes the value creator. Consequently, all products or services should be valuable ‘in use’ (Ng et al. 2010). From this perspective, tangible products act as distribution mechanisms for services, implying that suppliers are really service providers (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004; Sandström et al. 2008). Grönroos (2008) therefore argued against using the word dominant and instead {{to use the term}} Service Logic, since: “Adopting a service-centred perspective {{is not a matter of}} adding weight to the <b>service</b> <b>aspect</b> of a logic in order to become service-dominant. Rather, it is a new logic in itself” (ibid, p. 300). The danger of merely adding weight to the <b>service</b> <b>aspect</b> of the S-D logic is that the firm-centric reasoning continues with claims that customers need to be sensitized to make better use of offered services (Payne et al. 2007) and that one should address value co-creation from the supplier perspective (Karpen et al. 2015).|$|E
