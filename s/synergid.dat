50|$|In {{flowering}} plants, the megagametophyte (also {{referred to}} as the embryo sac) is much smaller and typically consists of only seven cells and eight nuclei. This type of megagametophyte develops from the megaspore through three rounds of mitotic divisions. The cell closest to the micropyle opening of the integuments differentiates into the egg cell, with two <b>synergid</b> cells by its side that are involved in the production of signals that guide the pollen tube. Three antipodal cells form on the opposite (chalazal) end of the ovule and later degenerate. The large central cell of the embryo sac contains two polar nuclei.|$|E
40|$|Lentibulariaceae is {{the largest}} family among {{carnivorous}} plants which displays not only an unusual morphology and anatomy but also the special evolution of its embryological characteristics. It has previously been reported by authors that Utricularia species lack a filiform apparatus in the <b>synergids.</b> The main {{purposes of this study}} were to determine whether a filiform apparatus occurs in the <b>synergids</b> of Utricularia and its sister genus Genlisea, and to compare the female germ unit in these genera. The present studies clearly show that <b>synergids</b> in both genera possess a filiform apparatus; however, it seems that Utricularia quelchii <b>synergids</b> have a simpler structure compared to Genlisea aurea and other typical angiosperms. The <b>synergids</b> are located at the terminal position in the embryo sacs of Pinguicula, Genlisea and were probably also located in that position in common Utricularia ancestor. This ancestral characteristic still occurs in some species from the Bivalvaria subgenus. An embryo sac, which grows out beyond the limit of the integument and has contact with nutritive tissue, appeared independently in different Utricularia lineages and as a consequence of this, the egg apparatus changes position from apical to lateral...|$|R
30|$|The egg {{apparatus}} {{is located}} at the micropylar end of the embryo sac and is composed of three cells, two <b>synergids</b> and the egg cell (Fig.  4 c). The <b>synergids</b> have a very similar shape between them, their nuclei are highly polarized towards the micropyle and a large vacuole is observed towards the chalazal end (Fig.  4 d). Their average size is 16.76  ±  0.30  μm long and 12.92  ±  0.47  μm wide. One of their walls is in contact with the edge of the embryo sac, however, they are separated from each other by a small space (Fig.  4 e) and it was possible to observe the filiform apparatus at the base of both <b>synergids</b> (Fig.  4 e).|$|R

5000|$|Flowering plants {{generate}} gametes using {{a specialized}} cell division called meiosis. Meiosis {{takes place in}} the ovule (a structure within the ovary that is located within the pistil {{at the center of the}} flower) (see diagram labeled [...] "Angiosperm lifecycle"). A diploid cell (megaspore mother cell) in the ovule undergoes meiosis (involving two successive cell divisions) to produce four cells (megaspores or female gametes) with haploid nuclei. [...] One of these four cells (megaspore) then undergoes three successive mitotic divisions to produce an immature embryo sac (megagametocyte) with eight haploid nuclei. Next, these nuclei are segregated into separate cells by cytokinesis to producing 3 antipodal cells, 2 <b>synergid</b> cells and an egg cell. Two polar nuclei are left in the central cell of the embryo sac.|$|E
50|$|Double {{fertilization}} {{refers to}} {{a process in which}} two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovary. This process begins when a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the pistil (female reproductive structure), germinates, and grows a long pollen tube. While this pollen tube is growing, a haploid generative cell travels down the tube behind the tube nucleus. The generative cell divides by mitosis to produce two haploid (n) sperm cells. As the pollen tube grows, it makes its way from the stigma, down the style and into the ovary. Here the pollen tube reaches the micropyle of the ovule and digests its way into one of the synergids, releasing its contents (which include the sperm cells). The <b>synergid</b> that the cells were released into degenerates and one sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell, producing a diploid (2n) zygote. The second sperm cell fuses with both central cell nuclei, producing a triploid (3n) cell. As the zygote develops into an embryo, the triploid cell develops into the endosperm, which serves as the embryo's food supply. The ovary will now develop into a fruit and the ovule will develop into a seed.|$|E
50|$|After megasporogenesis, the {{megaspore}} develops {{into the}} female gametophyte (the embryo sac) {{in a process}} called megagametogenesis. The process of megagametogenesis varies depending on which pattern of megasporogenesis occurred. Some species, such as Tridax trilobata, Ehretia laevis, and Alectra thomsoni, can undergo different patterns of megasporogenesis and therefore different patterns of megagametogenesis. If the monosporic pattern occurred, the single nucleus undergoes mitosis three times, producing an eight-nucleate cell. These eight nuclei are arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus {{to the center of}} the cell; these become the polar nuclei. Depending on the species, these nuclei fuse together before or upon fertilization of the central cell. The three nuclei at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus, with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. At the other end of the cell, a cell wall forms around the nuclei and forms the antipodals. Therefore, the resulting embryo sac is a seven-celled structure consisting of one central cell, one egg cell, two <b>synergid</b> cells, and three antipodal cells. The bisporic and tetrasporic patterns undergo varying processes and result in varying embryo sacs as well. In Lilium which has a tetrasporic pattern, the central cell of the embryo sac is 4N. Therefore, upon fertilization the endosperm will be 5N rather than the typical 3N.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Angiosperms sexual {{reproduction}} involves {{interactions between the}} two female gametes in the embryo sac and the two male gametes released by the pollen tube. The two <b>synergids</b> of the embryo sac express the FERONIA/SIRÈNE receptor-like kinase, which controls the discharge of the two sperm cells from the pollen tube. FER/SRN may respond to a ligand from the pollen tube. Alternatively, the interaction between FER/SRN and a ligand from the embryo sac {{may lead to a}} state of competence of the <b>synergids</b> allowing pollen tube discharge. Here, we report the new mutant scylla (syl) impaired in the control of pollen tube discharge. This mutant also produces autonomous endosperm development in ab-sence of fertilization—a trait associated with the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) mutant class. This led us to iden-tify autonomous endosperm in srn mutants and to demonstrate synergistic interactions between srn and the fis mutants. In addition, the fis mutants display defects in pollen tube discharge as in srn and syl mutants, confirming the interaction between the two pathways. Our findings suggest that pollen tube discharge is controlled by an interaction between the <b>synergids</b> expressing SRN/FER and the central cell expressing FIS genes...|$|R
40|$|The precise {{guidance}} of the pollen tube to the embryo sac {{is critical to the}} successful sexual reproduction of flowering plants. We demonstrate here the {{guidance of}} the pollen tube to the embryo sac in vitro by using the naked embryo sac of Torenia fournieri, which protrudes from the micropyle of the ovule. We developed a medium for culture of both the ovule and the pollen tube of T. fournieri and cocultivated them in a thin layer of solid medium. Although pollen tubes that had germinated in vitro passed naked embryo sacs, some pollen tubes that grew semi-in vitro through a cut style arrived precisely at the site of entry into the embryo sac, namely, the filiform apparatus of the <b>synergids.</b> When pollen tubes were unable to enter the embryo sac, they continuously grew toward the same filiform apparatus, forming narrow coils.

The amyloplast-rich endothelium is partially degraded during {{the expansion of}} the micropylar portion of the megagametophyte. Organization of the mature embryo sac is determined by the patterns of vacuolation, nuclear migration, spindle orientation and cellularization. The egg cell is slightly chalazal in relation to the <b>synergids,</b> and its micropylar end does not touch the micropylar channel. At the chalazal pole of the egg apparatus, the common walls between the <b>synergids,</b> the egg and central cells, despite their tenuity, are present in the mature megagametophyte.

40|$|All {{four members}} of a gene family, which are highly {{expressed}} in {{the cells of the}} female gametophyte (ZmES 1 [...] 4 : Zea mays embryo sac), were isolated from a cDNA library of maize egg cells. High expression of ZmES genes in the <b>synergids</b> around the micropylar region was detected in thin sections of maize ovaries. Single-cell RT [...] PCR analyses with the various cells of the female gametophyte confirmed the expression in <b>synergids</b> and also showed expression in the egg cell and central cell, and low expression in the antipodals. The expression of the whole gene family is suppressed after fertilization of the embryo sac, and expression in two-cell or later embryo stages or other tissues of maize could not be detected. In order to investigate ZmES mRNA gradients in the highly polarized and vacuolized cells of the maize embryo sac, a whole-mount in situ protocol with isolated single cells was developed: as for total RNA, ZmES transcripts are uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of egg cell, <b>synergids</b> and central cell. ZmES genes encode small, cysteine-rich proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide, probably for translocation into the embryo sac cell wall.

40|$|During {{angiosperm}} reproduction, {{one of the}} two <b>synergid</b> cells {{within the}} female gametophyte undergoes cell death prior to fertilization. The pollen tube enters the female gametophyte by growing into the <b>synergid</b> cell that undergoes cell death and releases its two sperm cells within the degenerating <b>synergid</b> cytoplasm to effect double fertilization. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and many other species, <b>synergid</b> cell death is dependent upon pollination. However, the mechanism by which the pollen tube causes <b>synergid</b> cell death is not understood. As a first step toward understanding this mechanism, we defined the temporal relationship between pollen tube arrival at the female gametophyte and <b>synergid</b> cell death in Arabidopsis. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy, light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and real-time observation of these two events in vitro, we demonstrate that <b>synergid</b> cell death initiates after the pollen tube arrives at the female gametophyte but before pollen tube discharge.

40|$|In over 80 % of the angiosperms, {{the female}} {{gametophyte}} {{is comprised of}} seven cells, {{two of which are}} the <b>synergid</b> cells.

The <b>synergid</b> cells direct pollen tube growth toward the female gametophyte, and facilitate the entrance of the tube into the embryo sac. Once the pollen tube enters the <b>synergid</b> cell, its growth is arrested, the tip of the tube breaks, and two sperm cells are released. This sequence of events is also <b>synergid</b> dependent. In addition, separation of the cells of the male germ unit, orientation of the two sperm cells in the degenerating <b>synergid,</b> and fusion of the egg and central cell with sperm cells may also be related to <b>synergid</b> cells. <b>Synergid</b> structure has been widely studied, but development and function of these cells during angiosperm fertilization remains elusive.

This cell serves as the site of entry for the pollen tube. Following fertilization, the vacuolar organisation in the zygote changes; in addition to the large micropylar vacuole, there are several small vacuoles of varying size. Ribosomal concentration increases significantly after fertilisation. In T. pratense, ultrastructural changes between the egg cell and zygote stages are noticeable. Several marked changes occur in the egg cell because of fertilisation. The zygote cell contains ribosomes has many mitochondria, plastids, lipids, vacuoles.

40|$|The {{directional}} {{growth of the}} pollen tube from the stigma to the embryo sac in the ovules is regulated by pollen-pistil interactions based on intercellular communication. Although pollen tube growth is regulated by the cytoplasmic Ca(2 +) concentration ([Ca(2 +) ](cyt)), {{it is not known}} whether [Ca(2 +) ](cyt) is involved in pollen tube guidance and reception. Using Arabidopsis expressing the GFP-based Ca(2 +) -sensor yellow cameleon 3. 60 (YC 3. 60) in pollen tubes and <b>synergid</b> cells, we monitored Ca(2 +) dynamics in these cells during pollen tube guidance and reception under semi-in vivo fertilization conditions. In the pollen tube growing towards the micropyle, pollen tubes initiated turning within 150 μm of the micropylar opening; the [Ca(2 +) ](cyt) in these pollen tube tips was higher than in those not growing towards an ovule in assays with myb 98 mutant ovules, in which pollen tube guidance is disrupted. These results suggest that attractants secreted from the ovules affect Ca(2 +) dynamics in the pollen tube. [Ca(2 +) ](cyt) in <b>synergid</b> cells did not change when the pollen tube grew towards the micropyle or entered the ovule. Upon pollen tube arrival at the <b>synergid</b> cell, however, [Ca(2 +) ](cyt) oscillation began at the micropylar pole of the <b>synergid,</b> spreading towards the chalazal pole. Finally, [Ca(2 +) ](cyt) in the <b>synergid</b> cell reached a maximum at pollen tube rupture.

40|$|Fertilization, both {{in plants}} and animals, {{is at its}} core, a study of cell to cell communication. With respect to plants, the male gametophyte, the pollen tube, elongates within the female organ called the pistil, {{transporting}} in its cytoplasm two sperm cells. The pollen tube is attracted by signals secreted from the <b>synergid</b> cells that are located {{at the entrance to}} the female gametophyte that resides in the ovule. Secondary pollen tube visitors to the ovules are unwanted and repelled presumably by signals emitted by the fertilized female. The final communication between the pollen tube and female gametophyte is the induction of pollen tube rupture upon penetration of the <b>synergid</b> cell, an event that leads to the release of the two sperm cells, which go on to fertilize the central cell and egg cell within the female gametophyte, completing a double fertilization process that is unique to plants. My thesis research is centered on elucidating the mechanism behind the <b>synergid</b> cell-induced pollen tube rupture process. Studies in our laboratory have established that the <b>synergid</b> cell-expressed receptor like kinase, called FERONIA, mediates a highly oxidative environment in the female gematophyte that is necessary for the pollen tube rupture process. Using an in vitro pollen tube culture system, my research showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces pollen tube rupture in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner.

At this moment Attraction ceases and the second sperm is led by a current of cytoplasma to the central nucleus. In the egg cell the sperm nucleus is led to the nucleus by cytoplasmic current too. After fertilization the character of cytoplasmic motion changes, because of a cell membrane damage. The presence of the sperm in the female nuclei may {{also serve as a}} regulating factor...|$|R
