50|$|The social {{inclusion}} OMC, by contrast, was not {{directly linked to}} the EMU debate. Social inclusion was for many years a controversial topic to address at the European level due to the subsidiarity concept. In 1999 the Commission finally adopted a communication for a concerted strategy on social protection, proposing a Social Protection Committee which was made official in the Nice Treaty. Said committee {{was responsible for the}} initial standard <b>setting</b> <b>exercise.</b> Next, each member state was asked to benchmark its situation by producing a two year national action plan (NAP or NAPincl), presenting national-level strategies for improving the situation. These were made available in June 2001. 18 months later the EU released a joint report on {{social inclusion}} where the member state’s approaches were compared and contrasted and recommendations were given. While the NAPs form a first level of action, the Community Action Programme to combat poverty and social exclusion, which aims to improve cooperation between the member states, can be considered the second level of action.|$|E

Ideally, they should also be able to perform the procedure themselves as this would aid in determining the characteristics of the borderline candidate.

40|$|The European Alps harbour {{a unique}} and species-rich biodiversity, which is {{increasingly}} impacted by habitat fragmentation through land-use changes, urbanization and expanding transport infrastructure. In this study, we identified the 50 most important questions relating to the maintenance and restoration of an ecological continuum - the connectedness of ecological processes across many scales including trophic relationship and disturbance processes and hydro-ecological flows in the European Alps. We initiated and implemented a trans-national priority <b>setting</b> <b>exercise,</b> inviting 48 institutions including researchers, conservation practitioners, NGOs, policymakers and administrators from the Alpine region. The exercise was composed of an initial call for pertinent questions, a first online evaluation of the received questions and a final discussion and selection process during a joint workshop. The participating institutions generated 484 initial questions, which were condensed to the 50 most important questions by 16 workshop participants. We suggest new approaches in tackling the issue of an ecological continuum in the Alps by analysing and classifying {{the characteristics of the}} resulting questions in a non-prioritized form as well as in a visual conceptualisation of the inter-dependencies among these questions. This priority <b>setting</b> <b>exercise</b> will support research and funding institutions in channelling their capacities and resources towards questions that need to be urgently addressed in order to facilitate significant progress in biodiversity conservation in the European Alps...|$|E

40|$|Background: Research {{suggests}} {{that there may be}} bereavement experiences and support needs which are specific to family caregivers providing end of life care (EoLC), although this remains an under-researched area. This paper focuses on themes relating to bereavement which were derived from an analysis of free text survey responses collected in a research priority <b>setting</b> <b>exercise</b> for palliative and EoLC. Methods: The priority <b>setting</b> <b>exercise</b> involved a public survey, designed to generate research priorities. Rather than identify research topics, many people instead described their experiences and raised more general questions relating to palliative and end of life care. To explore these experiences and perspectives a supplementary thematic analysis was conducted on the survey responses. 1403 respondents took part, including patients, current and bereaved carers, health and social care professionals, volunteers and members of the public. Results: Several grief issues were identified, which seem specific to the experiences of family caregivers. Responses demonstrated a relationship between death experiences, feelings of guilt and bereavement outcomes for some family caregivers, as well as caregiver experiences of a “void” created by the withdrawal of professional support after death. Communication and support needs were also identified by participants. Conclusion: This analysis provides further evidence of some of the specific effects that caring for a loved one {{at the end of life}} can have on bereavement experiences. Finding ways of improving communication around the time of death and effective follow up approaches post death could help to address some of these issues...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a rating tool for policy makers to prioritize breast cancer interventions in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), based on a simple multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach. The definition and identification of criteria play a key role in MCDA, and our rating tool could be used as part of a broader priority <b>setting</b> <b>exercise</b> in a local setting. This tool may contribute to a more transparent priority-setting process and fairer decision-making in future breast cancer policy development. METHODS: First, an expert panel (n = 5) discussed key considerations for tool development. A literature review followed to inventory all relevant criteria and construct an initial set of criteria. A Delphi study was then performed and questionnaires used to discuss a final list of criteria with clear definitions and potential scoring scales. For this Delphi study, multiple breast cancer policy and priority-setting experts from different LMICs were selected and invited by the World Health Organization. Fifteen international experts participated in all three Delphi rounds to assess and evaluate each criterion. RESULTS: This study resulted in a preliminary rating tool for assessing breast cancer interventions in LMICs. The tool consists of 10 carefully crafted criteria (effectiveness, quality of the evidence, magnitude of individual health impact, acceptability, cost-effectiveness, technical complexity, affordability, safety, geographical coverage, and accessibility), with clear definitions and potential scoring scales. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the development of a rating tool to assess breast cancer interventions in LMICs. Our tool can offer supporting knowledge for the use or development of rating tools as part of a broader (MCDA based) priority <b>setting</b> <b>exercise</b> in local settings. Further steps for improving the tool are proposed and should lead to its useful adoption in LMICs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Knowledge {{construction}} is expensive for Computer Assisted As-sessment. When <b>setting</b> <b>exercise</b> questions, teachers use Test Makers to con-struct Question Banks. The addition of Automatic Generation to assessment applications decreases {{the time spent}} on constructing examination papers. In this article, we present ArikIturri, an Automatic Question Generator for Basque language test questions, which is independent from the test assessment applica-tion that uses it. The information source for this question generator consists of linguistically analysed real corpora, represented in XML mark-up language. ArikIturri makes use of NLP tools. The influence of the robustness of those tools and the used corpora is highlighted in the article. We have proved the vi-ability of ArikIturri when constructing fill-in-the-blank, word formation, multi-ple choice, and error correction question types. In the evaluation of this auto-matic generator, we have obtained positive results as regards the generation process and its usefulness. ...|$|E

40|$|Research {{priority}} setting aims to gain {{consensus about}} areas where research effort will have wide benefits to society. While general principles for setting health research priorities have been suggested, {{there has been}} no critical review of the different approaches used. This review aims to: (i) examine methods, models and frameworks used to set health research priorities.; (ii) identify barriers and facilitators to priority setting processes.; and (iii) determine the outcomes of priority setting processes in relation to their objectives and impact on policy and practice. Medline, Cochrane, and PsycINFO databases were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies published from 1990 to March 2012. A review of grey literature was also conducted. Priority <b>setting</b> <b>exercises</b> that aimed to develop population health and health services research priorities conducted in Australia, New Zealand, North America, Europe and the UK were included. Two authors extracted data from identified studies. Eleven diverse priority <b>setting</b> <b>exercises</b> across a range of health areas were identified. Strategies including calls for submission, stakeholder surveys, questionnaires, interviews, workshops, focus groups, roundtables, the Nominal Group and Delphi technique were used to generate research priorities. Nine priority <b>setting</b> <b>exercises</b> used a core steering or advisory group to oversee and supervise the priority setting process. None of the models conducted a systematic assessment of the outcomes of the priority setting processes, or assessed the impact of the generated priorities on policy or practice.

PROMIS computer adaptive tests (CATs) {{use a computer}} algorithm developed with item response theory to administer the items. The psychosocial assessment was adapted from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer and Problem Checklist [53]. Over the course of three years, 636 patients completed a total of 1493 assessments with 636 patients completing the assessment at least once (301 twice, 184 three times, and 129 four times).
