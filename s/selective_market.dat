40|$|Transparent armor {{is already}} {{starting}} experiencing {{a change in}} its technology due to the incorporation of new materials, which we call “transparent ceramics” or “optoceramics”. This {{is based on the}} increase of safety needs that year by year are requiring better transparent armor. That is to say, stronger and lighter systems than the traditional glass layered systems, {{in order to be able}} to protect from new threats and be installed to new vehicles. This technology transfer is still premature because of several factors such as economical or technological, but is improving extraordinary in the last years. Therefore, this paper focus on the near future highend transparent armor models by using those new transparent ceramics materials. First of all, the paper is considering the study of the art of transparent ceramics, giving a global view how and why these materials have so high properties, their manufacturing process and how could they be transparent. At the end of the chapter it is to be found a large variety of potential applications in which this material open new horizons. Secondly, a study of the main application “transparent armor” is considered. In this chapter is to see the previous transparent armor (TA) design and its way to improve compared to the future TA design enabled by the transparent ceramics and its new way of thinking. Economical issues as well as environmental aspects are born in mind, so that a global sense of how realistic this project is given.

40|$|The {{bluefin tuna}} Thunnus thynnus (L., 1758) is a teleost fish {{belonging}} to the Scombridae family and is an emblematic species that has fed the Mediterranean populations for millennia. From the 90 ´s starts the process called «bluefin tuna fattening» which involves capturing live specimens by purse seiners in spawning areas, transferring them to nearby farms to the coast, feeding them for several months with small pelagic fish rich in fat and sent to market later, especially Japan. This activity led to severe exploitation of natural populations, risking {{the future of the}} fishery. To mitigate this, the International Council for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) established from 2007 a recovery plan, with a drastic limitation of catches and several conservation measures, which have made the fishery of Atlantic bluefin tuna one of the most regulated. Clearly, despite the undoubted positive effects on the recovery of the stock, limited catches will continue in the near future. Therefore, to ensure the supply of this iconic species in the quantity and quality required by an increasingly important and <b>selective</b> <b>market,</b> the bluefin tuna production has to come inevitably by techniques of integrated aquaculture completely independent of natural populations, such as it happens today with species such as gilthead sea bream, sea bass or turbot. This activity also promotes the recovery of natural stocks by reducing the fisheries pressure.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This study {{originated}} with industry recognition of inadequate flexibility in currently used procedures for grading, sizing, and packaging fresh apples in North Central Washington. Field-run apples are {{introduced into the}} process, and {{nearly all of the}} product must be placed in a marketing package in the process. Portions of the output products are stored for a 12 -month marketing period. Frequently during this marketing period there are changes in the types of packaging demanded. In recognition of this problem, research has developed prototype equipment for performing a presorting and presizing function. Presorted and presized apples could be returned to bulk bin storage for later <b>selective</b> <b>market</b> preparation. This study provides cost information on the application of this new procedure that should be useful to managers of packing plants. The principal objective of the study is to determine how the application of the new procedure would affect the production-point marketing margins. An intermediate objective is to establish industry structure and trends that might relate to the application of the new procedure. Cost analysis is limited to those operating input costs that would likely be affected by the application of the new procedure. An economic-engineering method of analysis is used to measure the relative efficiency of the old and new techniques. A sample of four representative apple packing lines was analyzed for rate of output in standard operating periods (eight-hour shifts) and for average costs per unit of output in these periods. Cost per unit of output associated with integrating the presorting and presizing function into the process was estimated. Operating and cost models were developed for both the standard packing line and the new method. From analysis of standard packing line operation, it was concluded that presorting and presizing the 50 per cent of the total seasonal volume with the lowest quality would improve the rate of product output on standard packing lines. This is the basis for estimating operating and cost models of the new technique. Models are based on annual seasonal output volumes of 210, 000, 28 O, 000 and 350, 000 boxes (42 pounds of apples per box). These volumes represent a majority of the larger packing plants in North Central Washington. Average operating input costs per unit of output increase due to the application of presorting and presizing. The increase was approximately. 025 per unit of output. This is one per cent of the average production-point marketing margin. Application of the new method would not increase the economic efficiency of this specific phase of grading, sizing, and packing fresh apples. The application of presorting and presizing and integration with the current packing line procedures in apple packing plants in North Central Washington could result in total cost savings in individual plants through the more efficient use of storage facilities. Approximately 20 per cent more product can be stored in refrigerated storage or modified atmosphere refrigerated storage in bulk form in bins as compared to finished product storage. Presorting and presizing 50 per cent of the field-nm product would also result in greatly improved flexibility in adapting to the market. The relatively small additional cost of application of this presorting and presizing function would improve the efficiency of many larger apple packing plants. The economic value would vary with each plant. Individual plant variables that should be analyzed are total seasonal volume and trends, storage capacity, current packing line efficiency, and marketing program...|$|E

The {{main purpose of}} this study is to examine the evolution of Chinese brand equity and the impact of <b>selective</b> <b>marketing</b> mix elements and the Country of Origin as attributes preceding the creation of Chinese brand equity. A qualitative approach has been adopted in order to acquire an understanding of Chinese path to building brands. A case-study methodology was applied, with the unit of the analysis being two Chinese automotive brands: GEELY and BYD. The researcher proposes a conceptual framework in which brand differentiators composed of <b>selective</b> <b>marketing</b> mix elements and the COO (Antecedents) are related to the dimensions of brand equity; brand awareness, perceived quality, and brand associations. Throughout the course of study, five questions were explored. The results of the research confirmed that some of the Chinese companies are moving towards building strong brand equity with their steady steps in product quality, joint ventures and co-branding. The researcher also confirmed that Chinese Country of Origin is no longer an obstacle to building strong brand equity. Two research questions - geographical presence and perceived value - were not supported by the cases of GEELY and BYD and were not accepted as positively affecting the brand equity of Chinese brands during the course of the study. While some literature supports this direction, the two cases understudy failed to support them. The research affirmed that certain Chinese brands are on the rise and that the strategic focus of Chinese companies recognizes the fact that brand building is the path to sustainable competitive advantage.

40|$|Summary. The {{discovery}} of association rules {{has been known}} to be useful in <b>selective</b> <b>marketing,</b> decision analysis, and business management. An important application area of mining association rules is the market basket analysis, which studies the buying behaviors of customers by searching for sets of items that are frequently purchased together. With the increasing use of the record-based databases whose data is being continuously added, recent important applications have called for the need of incremental mining. In dynamic transaction databases, new transactions are appended and obsolete transactions are discarded as time advances. Several research works have developed feasible algorithms for deriving precise association rules efficiently and effectively in such dynamic databases. On the other hand, approaches to generate approximations from data streams have received a significant amount of research attention recently. In each scheme, previously proposed algorithms are explored with examples to illustrate their concepts and techniques in this chapter. ...|$|R
