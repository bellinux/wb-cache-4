500|$|Expo 67 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} World Exhibitions, and is still regarded fondly by Canadians. In Montreal, 1967 is often referred to as [...] "the last good year" [...] before economic decline, Quebec <b>sovereignism</b> (seen as negative from a federalist viewpoint), deteriorating infrastructure and political apathy became common. In this way, it has much in common with the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. In 2007, a new group, Expo 17, was looking to bring a smaller-scale — BIE sanctioned — exposition to Montreal for Expo 67's 50th anniversary and Canada's sesquicentennial in 2017. Expo 17 hoped a new world's fair would regenerate the spirit of Canada's landmark centennial project.|$|E
50|$|The Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society (French: Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste) is an {{institution}} in Quebec {{dedicated to the}} protection of Quebec francophone interests and to the promotion of Quebec <b>sovereignism.</b> Its President from 2009 to 2014 was Mario Beaulieu who subsequently became leader of the Bloc Québécois. The society's current president is Maxime Laporte, known for being coordinator (president) of Cap sur l'indépendance, an umbrella group of various independentist organisations.|$|E
5000|$|This was {{and still}} is widely seen as a {{symbolic}} show of mutual respect and recognition of the national status and right to self-determination of each people. It was put into concrete action when Ted Moses surprised many by supporting the re-election of Landry's Parti Québécois in the 2003 Quebec election after years of refractory attitudes of the Cree people towards Quebec <b>sovereignism.</b> He declared: ...|$|E

5000|$|Les Cowboys {{represent}} {{an important part}} of modern Québécois music. They are part of the néo-trad movement that appeared in Quebec {{around the turn of the}} 21st century, and they embody a resurgence of political songwriting (after the drought of the 1980s and parts of the 1990s, political songwriting had been a victim of Post-Referendum Syndrome). As the néo-trad movement adapts Quebec folklore into contemporary crafts, the political message of the band is a re-occurrence of 1970s chansonnier activist messages of left-wing solidarity and, recently, <b>sovereignism,</b> although in a more distinctly modern way. They also sometimes adopt a minimalist and dadaesque style, a trend of the Quebec music scene of the 2000s - a decade of voluntary simple yet nonetheless quite intelligent and joual lyrics, therefore subversive and akin to a sort of lyrical naïve art. (The 1970s did see the first wave of voluntary joual art, like the songs of Robert Charlebois and Aut'chose, and the plays of Michel Tremblay, although not as willingly exaggerated. This is present even more in the music of Les Trois Accords, Les Denis Drolet, and Daniel Boucher, or in [...] "Carole", the song by [...] "Pépé et sa Guitare").|$|E
40|$|Does Europe {{have the}} means to defend its own social model in a globalized world {{at a time when the}} United States, China, India and Russia are {{concerned}} by enhancing their national sovereignties and playing power politics?

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyze an ideal of civic life, the Republic, based on the form of the sovereign state. Historically, the convergence between Republic and sovereign state has been truncated by the former's commitment to the thesis of royal absolutism. However, as the democratic issue (translated in the values of equality and pluralism) was absorbed by <b>sovereignism,</b> such convergence became more plausible. As viewed in this article, the theoretical bridge of that passage is the concept of political representation. The issue is thus to show in what way a certain vision of the political form (that of the state) can fit into a theory of political representation that contemplates the above-mentioned values...|$|E

40|$|Although many {{authors have}} debated {{the propriety of}} the use of {{religious}} arguments in public policy discussions and lawmaking, few have critically reviewed the jurisprudence of particular judges through the lens of their own faith-traditions. Preliminarily, this article attempts a modest contribution to the discussion about the use of religious argument in public discussions by suggesting that judicial opinions should be viewed rhetorically and that religious assumptions and claims may legitimately be 2 ̆ 2 borrowed 2 ̆ 2 analogically into such opinions, at least their forensic and epideictic elements. More concretely, it analyzes themes in some of Justice William Rehnquist 2 ̆ 7 s opinions to determine how consistent they are with traditional Lutheran theological understandings of law and the state. The article argues that Rehnquist 2 ̆ 7 s strict constructionism, state <b>sovereignism,</b> and positivism are inconsistent with the paradoxical quality of mainstream Lutheran theological claims about human life and institutions on such matters as who is trustworthy (the individual or the state), limitations on human institutions and the relationship of conscientious citizens to the state, and the responsibility for the neighbor...|$|E
