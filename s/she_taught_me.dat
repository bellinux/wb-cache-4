Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: [...] "I got to know her well. <b>She</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang – just the way she was."

He said of her in 1968 that she was [...] "a walking encyclopedia. All through her life she stored up knowledge on all sorts of subjects, {{and she had the}} great gift of being able to make it all interesting when she taught it to me. She was completely methodical; we had time-tables for each subject, and I had to do preparation, and so forth. <b>She</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough. She was outspoken and open-minded to a degree quite unusual in members of the Royal Family. And she was also entirely free from prejudice about politics or colour and things of that kind." ...|$|E

Mauboy cites Mariah Carey as her main influence and inspiration, stating that she has [...] "drawn a lot of inspiration from watching and listening to her live performances". She grew {{up listening to}} many of Carey's songs and was inspired by her vocal style and songwriting, [...] "I loved 'Dreamlover' and 'Fantasy' – and picked up loads of tips from her style of singing. <b>She</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> that the lyrics you write have to come from personal experiences – I really felt her music.

[...] Mauboy also names Whitney Houston as another influence, stating that she looks up to her and Carey [...] "for their outstanding vocal performances". Her other musical influences are John Farnham and Beyoncé. Mauboy is also inspired by fellow Indigenous Australian women such as Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman and actress Deborah Mailman.|$|E

Shortly before his birth, {{she had come to}} live with the Renoir family. She introduced the young boy to the Guignol puppet shows in Montmartre, which influenced his later film career. He wrote in his 1974 memoirs My Life and My Films, [...] "She taught me to see the face behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes. <b>She</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> to detest the cliché."

2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then <b>she</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along.

Dancer and choreographer Teresa Espinosa began her career on the tour and credits Jackson for her success, leading her to subsequently work with Britney Spears, Pink, Rihanna, Mariah Carey, and Selena Gomez. Espinosa stated [...] "it was a great learning experience, she's the top of the top," [...] commenting [...] "Dance-wise, (<b>she</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me)</b> how to become a better dancer and performer, and that you also have your good and bad days. Most of all you can’t take things personally." [...] Backing dancer Tiana Brown was inspired to pursue a professional dancing career after watching the tour. So You Think You Can Dance finalist Jessica King included the tour among her [...] "favorite dance moments."

2500|$|One of Wilson's {{earliest}} memories {{was hearing}} Glenn Miller's 1943 recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (1924), later citing it as a pivotal influence in his {{development as a}} composer. He recalled: [...] "Around our house, when I was a child, I heard things from my parents' record collection like Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rosemary Clooney, and the Four Freshmen. Those were my first inspirations. To try to describe exactly what each influence was is hard to explain because it's very subtle, {{but it can be}} felt when you listen to my music. I don't think people realize just how much Rosemary Clooney affected my singing. <b>She</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> to sing with love in my heart ... I would sing along with it , studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling." [...] John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful noted, [...] "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that." [...] Carl speculated that it was Mike Love who got Brian into doo-wop music.|$|E
