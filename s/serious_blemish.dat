5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a <b>serious</b> <b>blemish</b> on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote: The author {{came out}} in 1856 to make {{experiments}} in astronomical observations. Scientific men have usually a contempt for language: we find the same in Our Inheritanse, &c. (Dalby & Co., London, 1877), where the poor modern hierogrammats are not highly appreciated. But it is a <b>serious</b> <b>blemish</b> to find 'Montana Blanco,' 'Malpays,' 'Chahzorra' (for Chajorra), and 'Tiro del Guanches.' The author also is wholly in error about Guanche mummification. He derides (p. 329) the shivering and shaking of his Canarian guide under a cloudy sky of 40Â°F., when the sailor enjoyed it in their 'glorious strength of Saxon (?) constitution.' But when the latter were oppressed and discouraged by dry heat and vivid radiation, Manoel was active as a chamois. Why should enduring cold and not heat be held {{as a test of}} manliness?] ...|$|E
50|$|Coach Bible {{proved that}} the disappointing 1930 season was perhaps just a fluke of bad luck, by once again {{bringing}} home a conference championship, his 2nd in three years at Nebraska. The only <b>serious</b> <b>blemish</b> on the season being the defeat by Northwestern early on, as few could fault the Cornhuskers for the honorable defeat dealt by Pittsburgh, who finished 9th {{in the nation in}} the Dickinson ranking. Coach Bible's career record improved to 16-6-5 (.685), and his third squad improved the program's overall record to 236-80-25 (.729) while the perfect 1931 Big 6 slate improved Nebraska's overall conference record to 64-10-8 (.829).|$|E
50|$|The {{credit report}} also {{contains}} the borrowers past derogatory credit. This include collections, charge offs, repossession, foreclosures, bankruptcies, liens and judgments. Typically, {{if any of}} these items are present on the report, it increases the risk of the loan. For more <b>serious</b> <b>blemishes</b> such as foreclosures and bankruptcies, a lender may require up to two to seven years from the date of satisfaction indicated by the report before approving a loan. Furthermore, the lender may require the borrower to reestablish the credit by obtaining a certain amount of new credit to rebuild their credit. It is also the prerogative of the lender to require that all collections, charge offs, liens and judgments be paid prior to closing the loan.|$|R
5000|$|A Jewish woman {{seeking a}} divorce {{from her husband}} must present her {{complaint}} to a Beth din with the implication of a <b>serious</b> physical <b>blemish</b> or character defect. The husband {{must be willing to}} divorce his wife, for if he gives the get unwillingly, the divorce is invalid, and any future offspring of the wife would be considered mamzers. If the circumstances truly warrant a divorce and the husband is unwilling, the dayan has the prerogative of instituting community shunning measures to [...] "coerce him until he agrees," [...] with physical force being reserved only for the rarest of cases.|$|R
5000|$|The 20th century {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a critical dispute over the final lines of the poem and their relationship to the beauty of the whole work. Poet laureate Robert Bridges sparked the debate when he argued:The thought as enounced in the first stanza is the supremacy of ideal art over Nature, because of its unchanging expression of perfect; and this is true and beautiful; but its amplification in the poem is unprogressive, monotonous, and scattered ... which gives an effect of poverty in spite of the beauty. The last stanza enters stumbling upon a pun, but its concluding lines are very fine, and make a sort of recovery with their forcible directness.Bridges believed that the final lines redeemed an otherwise bad poem. Arthur Quiller-Couch responded with a contrary view and claimed that the lines were [...] "a vague observation - to anyone whom life has taught to face facts and define his terms, actually an uneducated conclusion, albeit most pardonable in one so young and ardent." [...] The debate expanded when I. A. Richards, an English literary critic who analysed Keats's poems in 1929, relied on the final lines of the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] to discuss [...] "pseudo-statements" [...] in poetry:On the one hand there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its statements seriously - and find them silly ... This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand there are those who succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty ...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.Poet and critic T. S. Eliot, in his 1929 [...] "Dante" [...] essay, responded to Richards:I am at first inclined to agree ... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line strikes me as a <b>serious</b> <b>blemish</b> on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement ... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps the fact that it is grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.In 1930, John Middleton Murry gave a history of these responses [...] "to show the astonishing variety of opinion which exists at this day concerning the culmination of a poem whose beauty has been acknowledged for many years. Whether such another cause, and such another example, of critical diversity exists, I cannot say; if it does, it is unknown to me. My own opinion concerning the value of those two lines in the context of the poem itself is not very different from Mr. Eliot's." ...|$|E
40|$|Micro {{satellites}} are DNA markers, {{based on}} the repeated nucleotide sequences number polymorphism. They belong {{to a group of}} PCR markers and are mainly used as an addition to other types of markers. Their characteristics and technical aspects of their application are discussed in the present study. Furthermore, some results obtained by the use of the micro satellite DNA in genetic mapping of plant genomes are also presented. Although micro satellites provide the identification of genotypes within a species, inadequacy of comparative mapping of different species is their <b>serious</b> <b>blemish.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A <b>serious</b> <b>blemish</b> of {{the present}} {{economic}} era is the high rates of unemployment which currently afflict developed countries. Unemployment has reached high levels in several European countries as the following figures suggest. It is nearly 10 % of the labour force in France, 24. 5 % in Greece, 15. 3 % in Ireland, 10. 8 % in Italy, 25. 2 % in Spain, 16. 4 % in Portugal, 8. 1 % in Sweden, 8. 2 % in the UK, and 8. 2 % in USA. The average OECD unemployment increased from 6. 8 % in 2005, and 6. 2 % in 2006 to 8. 2 % in 2011 and 8. 2 % in 2012. In addition there is further unemployment due to {{factors such as the}} discouraged worker effect and the high incidence of involuntary part-time work. ...|$|E
40|$|A study {{investigated}} tne {{reason for the}} decline in participation in NDT (National Debate Tournament) debate. An anonymous poll of forensic programs was conducted to encourage a frank and open description of the issues surrounding the problem. One hundred thirty {{colleges and universities in}} America (out of 354) responded to a questionnaire. The list of schools was compiled from those active in NDT, CEDA (Cross Examination Debate Association) or Individual Events for the 1988 - 1989 school year. Results indicated that almost 25 % of the programs offer only one forensic activity and that 75 % of the programs offer only one or two events. Few programs use graduate assistants, and the forensics field is dominated by communications departments. Results also indicated that changes are needed and desired to increase partiripation, and that the only <b>serious</b> <b>blemish</b> to forensics is the loss of some schools which ma...|$|E
