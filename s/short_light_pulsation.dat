Type II Cepheids stars belong to older Population II stars, than do the type I Cepheids. The Type II have somewhat lower metallicity, much lower mass, somewhat lower luminosity, and a slightly offset period verses luminosity relationship, so it is always important to know which type of star is being observed.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a recent}} trend and growing {{popularity}} of using the technique of <b>light</b> <b>pulsation</b> for achieving the dimming control of light-emitting diodes. However, {{it is found that}} such a dimming control technique can result in a significant power loss in terms of luminous efficacy. This contradicts the original motive of energy saving through illumination dimming. Total energy consumed for lighting is an overwhelming 8 % of depleting energy resources. A potential loss of 2 % or more of these resources could go unnoticed owing to poor handling of dimming technology. It is demonstrated that, driving the LEDs with discretised multilevel pulsation, can achieve a quasi-optimally-efficient state of dimming control with a saving of up to 26. 7 % of the luminous efficacy. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Anopheles gambiae {{mosquitoes}} exhibit an endophilic, nocturnal blood feeding behavior. Despite {{the importance}} of light as a regulator of malaria transmission, our knowledge on the molecular interactions between environmental cues, the circadian oscillators and the host seeking and feeding systems of the Anopheles mosquitoes is limited. Results In the present study, we show that the blood feeding behavior of mosquitoes is under circadian control and can be modulated by light pulses, both in a clock dependent and in an independent manner. <b>Short</b> <b>light</b> pulses (~ 2 – 5 min) in the dark phase can inhibit the blood-feeding propensity of mosquitoes momentarily in a clock independent manner, while longer durations of light stimulation (~ 1 – 2 h) can induce a phase advance in blood-feeding propensity in a clock dependent manner. The temporary feeding inhibition after <b>short</b> <b>light</b> pulses may reflect a masking effect of light, an unknown mechanism which is known to superimpose on the true circadian regulation. Nonetheless, the <b>shorter</b> <b>light</b> pulses resulted in the differential regulation {{of a variety of}} genes including those implicated in the circadian control, suggesting that light induced masking effects also involve clock components. <b>Light</b> pulses (both <b>short</b> and long) also regulated genes implicated in feeding as well as different physiological processes like metabolism, transport, immunity and protease digestions. RNAi-mediated gene silencing assays of the light pulse regulated circadian factors timeless, cryptochrome and three takeout homologues significantly up-regulated the mosquito's blood-feeding propensity. In contrast, gene silencing of light pulse regulated olfactory factors down-regulated the mosquito's propensity to feed on blood. Conclusion Our study show that the mosquito's feeding behavior is under circadian control. Long and <b>short</b> <b>light</b> pulses can induce inhibition of blood-feeding through circadian and unknown mechanisms, respectively, that involve the chemosensory system. </p...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{abscisic acid}} (ABA) in seed {{germination}} of two cultivars of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.; light-sensitive Ritsa and light-insensitive Strada) was investigated. The inhibition of Ritsa seed germination by exogenous ABA {{was higher than}} that of Strada seeds, the extent of inhibition of both cultivars being reduced by a <b>short</b> <b>light</b> break. At 25 °C the sensitivity of both cultivars to exogenous ABA was higher than at 15 °C. The endogenous level of ABA was similar in dry seeds of both cultivars, increasing temporarily in Ritsa seeds during the first 4 h of imbibition in darkness but not in Strada seeds, nor in Ritsa seeds exposed to a <b>short</b> <b>light</b> break. The transitory increase of ABA content in Ritsa seeds imbibed in darkness was accompanied by increased expression of the gene responsive to ABA (Rab) under these conditions. Zorial (Norflurazone), an ABA-biosynthesis inhibitor, decreased ABA content and allowed dark germination of the light-requiring Ritsa seeds. A <b>short</b> <b>light</b> break induced germination of Ritsa seeds when applied at 24 and 48 h after imbibition onset, i. e. after the transitory increase of ABA. GA 3, on the other hand was effective when applied at the beginning of imbibition. It seems that light induces germination of the photoblastic Ritsa seeds by both inhibiting ABA synthesis and decreasing seed sensitivity to ABA and inhibitory processes induced by it...|$|R
