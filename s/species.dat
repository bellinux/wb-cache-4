5|$|A {{keystone}} <b>species</b> is a <b>species</b> that {{is connected}} to a disproportionately large number of other <b>species</b> in the food-web. Keystone <b>species</b> have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a keystone <b>species</b> holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone <b>species</b> results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|A second <b>species</b> of Voalavo, eastern voalavo, {{was named}} in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between the two are subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences of the two <b>species</b> differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely related <b>species</b> regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single <b>species</b> suggests the presence of cryptic <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2006 identified 216 <b>species</b> of birds {{known to have}} occurred in Petrified Forest National Park since the park became a protected area in 1906. Of those, 33 <b>species</b> breed within the park, 6 other <b>species</b> probably do, and 18 <b>species</b> live in the park year-round. Thirty-five <b>species</b> live in the park only {{during the summer and}} 11 <b>species</b> only during the winter. The greatest diversity of birds occurs during fall and winter migrations.|$|E
25|$|At equilibrium, therefore, some {{fraction}} of the <b>species's</b> habitat will always be unoccupied.|$|R
50|$|The <b>species's</b> flight {{period is}} from May to October, and is most {{plentiful}} from June to July.|$|R
50|$|An insectivore, the <b>species's</b> diet {{consists}} of grasshoppers, caterpillars, cicadas, beetles and aphids and is complemented with spiders, anoles, and berries.|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 282 bird <b>species</b> have been {{recorded}} in Matsalu, among which 175 are nesting and 33 are transmigrant waterfowl. 49 <b>species</b> of fish and 47 <b>species</b> of mammals are registered {{in the area of}} the nature reserve, along with 772 <b>species</b> of vascular plants.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of animals and insects live in Texas. It is the home to 65 <b>species</b> of mammals, 213 <b>species</b> of {{reptiles}} and amphibians, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native <b>species</b> in all. At least 12 <b>species</b> have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study in}} 2006, there were 37 fish <b>species,</b> 127 bird <b>species,</b> and 140 insect and {{invertebrate}} <b>species</b> found in the Merced River watershed. Due to differences in climate, {{there is a large}} disparity between <b>species</b> found in the upper watershed (above Lake McClure) and along the lower river.|$|E
50|$|The <b>species's</b> stems are reddish and its bark is grey. Its {{flowers are}} narrow and long, with golden petals. Its growth rate and height is unknown.|$|R
50|$|Its flowers have 5 petals and {{its leaves}} are 8-15 mm long. The <b>species's</b> stem is 10-25 centimeters long, and its root {{system is that}} of a taproot.|$|R
50|$|The <b>species's</b> {{leaves are}} elliptic-rounded. Its flowers are five-petaled and yellow, bloom from July to September and bear fruit from August to September. It grows 10 to 40 cm tall.|$|R
5|$|All named <b>species</b> of Plateosaurus {{except the}} type <b>species</b> and P.gracilis {{have turned out}} to be junior {{synonyms}} of the type <b>species</b> or invalid names. Von Huene practically erected a new <b>species</b> and sometimes a new genus for each relatively complete find from Trossingen (three <b>species</b> of Pachysaurus and seven of Plateosaurus) and Halberstadt (one <b>species</b> of Gresslyosaurus and eight of Plateosaurus). Later, he merged several of these <b>species,</b> but remained convinced that more than one genus and more than one <b>species</b> of Plateosaurus was present in both localities. Jaekel also believed that the Halberstadt material included several plateosaurid dinosaurs, as well as non-plateosaurid prosauropods. Systematic research by Galton drastically reduced the number of genera and <b>species.</b> Galton synonymised all cranial material, and described differences between the syntypes of P.engelhardti and the Trossingen material, which he referred to P.longiceps. Galton recognized P.trossingensis, P.fraasianus and P.integer to be identical to P.longiceps. Markus Moser, however, showed that P.longiceps is itself a junior synonym of P.engelhardti. Furthermore, a variety of <b>species</b> in other genera were created for material belonging to P.engelhardti, including Dimodosaurus poligniensis, Gresslyosaurus robustus, Gresslyosaurus torgeri, Pachysaurus ajax, Pachysaurus giganteus, Pachysaurus magnus and Pachysaurus wetzelianus.|$|E
5|$|All nemerteans move slowly, {{using their}} {{external}} cilia {{to glide on}} surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger <b>species</b> use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen <b>species</b> inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen <b>species</b> live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans. A few <b>species</b> are scavengers, and a few <b>species</b> live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. Some <b>species</b> have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have few predators. Two <b>species</b> are sold as fish bait.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, the Russulaceae {{comprise}} around 1,900 accepted <b>species.</b> Russula {{is by far}} {{the largest}} genus with ca. 1100 <b>species,</b> Lactarius has ca. 550, Lactifluus ca. 120, Boidinia 13, Multifurca 6, Gloeopeniophorella 6, and Pseudoxenasma 1 <b>species.</b> Closed-fruitbody <b>species</b> not yet synonymised with Lactarius or Russula (see above) account for some 150 <b>species.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{specific}} epithet [...] is Latin for [...] "enigma" [...] or [...] "riddle" [...] and {{refers to}} the <b>species's</b> [...] "very unusual ecological preferences" [...] of growing in deep shade.|$|R
5000|$|In her {{autobiography}} Recollections of a Happy Life, {{the first}} edition of which bears a gilt outline of N. northiana on its cover, North wrote the following account of the <b>species's</b> discovery: ...|$|R
5000|$|Similar to the {{situation}} in the dark-eyed junco, this <b>species's</b> systematics is still in need of much research before they can be considered resolved. Four subspecies groups are usually distinguished. These are, north to south: ...|$|R
5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single <b>species</b> has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two <b>species</b> involved) automimicry; the model is the same <b>species</b> as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} <b>species,</b> it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed <b>species</b> of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 950,000–1,000,000 of all {{described}} <b>species</b> are insects, so over 50% of all described eukaryotes (1.8 million) are insects (see illustration). With only 950,000 known non-insects, if {{the actual}} number of insects is 5.5 million, they may represent over 80% of the total, and with only about 20,000 new <b>species</b> of all organisms being described each year, most insect <b>species</b> likely will remain undescribed, unless <b>species</b> descriptions greatly increase in rate. Of the 24 orders of insects, four dominate in terms of numbers of described <b>species,</b> with at least 670,000 <b>species</b> included in Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{appear in}} the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of living <b>species</b> is about 9,200. These <b>species</b> are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine {{bivalves}} (including brackish water and estuarine <b>species)</b> represent about 8,000 <b>species,</b> combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 <b>species</b> and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 <b>species.</b> The freshwater bivalves include seven families, the largest of which are the Unionidae, with about 700 <b>species.</b>|$|E
5000|$|However G. brachyphylla can be {{distinguished}} by its very shiny, smooth leaves (its two relatives' leaves are rough with tiny tubercles). [...] "Brachyphylla" [...] means [...] "wide/short leaves", and this <b>species's</b> leaves are shorter than its relatives'.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{chestnut}}-headed oropendola shares {{much of this}} <b>species's</b> range, it is smaller, mainly {{black with}} a chestnut head (instead of mainly chestnut with a blackish head), and lacks coloured facial patches, so the two oropendolas {{are unlikely to be}} confused.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the extent}} of its range is uncertain, N. benstonei {{appears to have a}} secure future in the wild as the type {{locality}} lies within a protected area and the <b>species's</b> unremarkable appearance means over-collection does not pose a serious threat.|$|R
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and grows}} on the decaying wood of deciduous and coniferous trees. Host <b>species</b> include white fir (Abies concolor), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and other maple (Acer) <b>species,</b> grey alder (Alnus oblongifolia), beech (Fagus) <b>species,</b> spruce (Picea) <b>species,</b> ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and other pine (Pinus) <b>species,</b> poplar (Populus) and oak (Quercus) <b>species.</b> In temperate North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.|$|E
5|$|Dense moist {{deciduous}} forest mainly consists of sal, haldu, peepal, rohini and mango trees. Forest covers almost 73% of the park, 10% {{of the area}} consists of grasslands. It houses around 110 tree <b>species,</b> 50 <b>species</b> of mammals, 580 bird <b>species</b> and 25 reptile <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} taxonomic {{revisions}} by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, {{the number of}} recognized lemur <b>species</b> has grown from 33 <b>species</b> and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing cytogenetic and molecular genetic research, as well as ongoing field studies, particularly with cryptic <b>species</b> such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur <b>species</b> is likely to keep growing. However, the rapid {{increase in the number}} of recognized <b>species</b> has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the <b>species</b> concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate <b>species</b> to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a more thorough analysis.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 150 {{individual}} Somali wild asses living in zoos around the globe, of which 36 were born at Zoo Basel, where this <b>species's</b> breeding program started with Basel's first Somali wild asses in 1970 {{and the first}} birth in 1972.|$|R
50|$|Danser also {{identified}} Ridley 16097 from the Malay Peninsula as N. alata, extending the <b>species's</b> range even further and making its apparent absence from Borneo difficult to explain. Ridley 16097 is now thought {{to represent a}} mixed collection of N. alba and N. benstonei.|$|R
5000|$|Vocals on Urban <b>Species's</b> [...] "Religion and Politics" [...] and [...] "Changing of the Guard", {{from the}} album Blanket (1998), after {{sampling}} his song [...] "You Goin' Miss Your Candyman" [...] in their song [...] "Listen" [...] from the album {{by the same}} name (1994) ...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} winters, {{the park has}} few reptile and {{amphibian}} <b>species</b> with only one <b>species</b> of toad, three <b>species</b> of frog, one salamander <b>species</b> and two <b>species</b> of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 <b>species</b> of birds {{can be found in}} Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory <b>species.</b> Additionally, commonly seen <b>species</b> such as the gray jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different <b>species</b> including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.|$|E
5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between <b>species,</b> as well as competition within or between <b>species.</b> In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the <b>species</b> involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two <b>species,</b> {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several <b>species</b> may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another <b>species,</b> as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
5|$|Exotic <b>species</b> of fauna such as {{the zebra}} and quagga mussels and the New Zealand mud snail are {{invasive}} <b>species</b> that can greatly impact fish <b>species.</b> Though the mussel <b>species</b> are not known to be in Wyoming, several surrounding regions have reported them. The New Zealand mud snail {{has been found in}} the Shoshone River east of the forest. Forest managers have established a preventative program to try to keep these <b>species</b> from entering forest waterways.|$|E
50|$|The {{summer tanager}} (Piranga rubra), is a {{medium-sized}} American songbird. Formerly {{placed in the}} tanager family (Thraupidae), it {{and other members of}} its genus are now classified in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). The <b>species's</b> plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family.|$|R
50|$|The <b>species's</b> {{population}} {{had recently been}} in decline in the country while it slowly increases in reintroduction sites. The Turkmenian kulan has been reintroduced to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine, where the onagers formerly existed, also in Israel, where the subspecies are making hybrids with Persian onagers in the wild.|$|R
50|$|Liatris spicata var. resinosa {{is found}} in the {{southern}} part of the <b>species's</b> natural range, the variable plants have only 5 or 6 flowers per head and the heads are more widely spaced on the stems, these differences are more pronounced when the plants are found in drier and coastal habitats.|$|R
