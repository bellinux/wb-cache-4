40|$|Piezoelectric motors use {{the inverse}} {{piezoelectric}} effect, where microscopically small periodical displacements are transferred to continuous or stepping rotary or linear movements through frictional coupling between a displacement generator (stator) and a moving (<b>slider)</b> <b>element.</b> Although many piezoelectric motor designs have various drive and operating principles, microscopic displacements at the interface of a stator and a slider can have two components: tangential and normal. The displacement in the tangential direction has a corresponding force working against the friction force. The {{function of the}} displacement in the normal direction is to increase or decrease friction force between a stator and a slider. Simply, the generated force alters the friction force due to a displacement in the normal direction, and the force creates movement due to a displacement in the tangential direction. In this paper, we first describe how {{the two types of}} microscopic tangential and normal displacements at the interface are combined in the structures of different piezoelectric motors. We then present a new resonance-drive type piezoelectric motor, where an octagonal plate, with two eyelets {{in the middle of the}} two main surfaces, is used as the stator. Metallization electrodes divide top and bottom surfaces into two equal regions orthogonally, and the two driving signals are applied between the surfaces of the top and the bottom electrodes. By controlling the magnitude, frequency and phase shift of the driving signals, microscopic tangential and normal displacements in almost any form can be generated. Independently controlled microscopic tangential and normal displacements at the interface of the stator and the slider make the motor have lower speed–control input (driving voltage) nonlinearity. A test linear motor was built by using an octagonal piezoelectric plate. It has a length of 25. 0 mm (the distance between any of two parallel side surfaces) and a thickness of 3. 0 mm, which can produce an output force of 20 N...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} elastomers strongly differs {{from one to}} another. Among these differences, hysteresis upon cyclic load can take place, and can be either rate-dependent or rate-independent. In the present paper, a microsphere model taking into account rate-independent hysteresis is proposed and applied to model filled silicone rubbers behavior. The hysteresis model {{is based on a}} combination of monodimensional constitutive equations distributed in space. The behavior of each direction is described by a collection of parallel spring <b>slider</b> <b>elements.</b> The <b>sliders</b> are Coulomb dampers with non-zero break-free force in tension. This model is tested on a filled silicone rubber by the way of uniaxial tensile and pure shear tests. The mechanical response of the material is well predicted for such tests. Finally, the constitutive equations are implemented in the finite element software ABAQUS. Calculation results highlight good performances of the proposed model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract A {{time-dependent}} {{numerical simulation}} procedure is implemented {{to simulate the}} flying height response of a typical thermal flying height control (TFC) slider {{as a function of}} the power input to the heater element. The Reynolds equation is used in conjunction with a TFC <b>slider</b> finite <b>element</b> model to determine the change in the thermal protrusion and flying height of the slider. The power input signal to the heater element is optimized using convex optimization to minimize flying height variations of the slider. The optimization procedure is applied to a typical experimentally measured flying height profile. The numerical simulation results are in excellent qualitative agreement with experimental measurements. ...|$|R

40|$|Co-hosted by the University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia, {{under the}} auspices of the Australian Fracture Group (AFG). This study {{presents}} a constitutive model developed for lightly cemented geomaterials. The cemented geomaterials, when subjected to loading, exhibit hybrid mechanical responses: elastic-brittle due to bond breaking and elastic-plastic due to grains friction. This constitutive model is developed to capture the two mechanical responses by using three physical elements, i. e., the spring, the bond and the <b>slider.</b> These <b>elements</b> are combined to mimic the mechanical responses of lightly cemented soils under triaxial loading conditions. The model formulation is presented and validation with experimental data performed to demonstrate its capability in capturing the material behavior under both low and high confining pressures.

This {{includes}} the [...] command, which tried {{to emulate the}} slightly awkward syntax of the [...] command a bit too much. Also, it seems that over time, a number of XCMDs were simply rolled into the engine as built-in commands, maintaining the not very memorable handler call syntax. The most obvious case here is the [...] function, where movies are kind of [...] "invisibly tacked on" [...] to a window instead of being implemented as real controls like <b>sliders</b> or other <b>elements.</b> There are also some properties that control general application behaviour that are one-to-one translations of the underlying system APIs, e.g. for using [...] "appearance manager" [...] (the theming engine in Mac OS 9).|$|R
40|$|Thermal flying-height control (TFC) sliders {{have been}} used for active flying height control of hard disk drives. It is of {{particular}} interest to investigate if TFC sliders can be used to minimize both repeatable and nonrepeatable flying height variations. To that end, the power input to the heater must be dynamically optimized at each time step in order to minimize changes in flying height. In the current study, a numerical procedure is implemented to simulate the time dependent response of a TFC slider to changes of the heater element power input. The dynamic Reynolds equation and slider equilibrium equations are solved simultaneously to determine the dynamic change in flying height as a function of time. The change of thermal protrusion {{as a result of the}} optimized power input to the heater is computed using a TFC <b>slider</b> finite <b>element</b> model. The reduction of flying height variation is studied using past and present flying height histories and optimization of the power input to the heater. It is shown that the dynamic approach can be successfully used to minimize both repeatable and nonrepeatable flying height changes at the hard disk interface.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel concept for a low cost variable delivery external gear pump (VD-EGP). The proposed VD-EGP {{is based on}} the realization of a variable timing for the connections of the internal displacement chambers with the inlet and outlet ports. With respect to a standard EGP, an additional <b>element</b> (<b>slider)</b> is used along with asymmetric gears to realize the variable timing principle. Previously performed tests confirmed the validity of the concept, for a design capable of varing the flow in the 65 %- 100 % range. Although the VD-EGP concept is suitable for various flow control system typologies (manual, electro-actuated, hydraulically flow- or pressure- compensated), this paper particularly details the design and the test results for a prototype that includes both a manual flow control system and a pressure compensator. Flow vs pressure and volumetric efficiency curves are discussed along with transient (outlet flow fluctuation) features of the VD-EGP...|$|R
