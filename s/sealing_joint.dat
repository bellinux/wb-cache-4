40|$|The sealing {{capability}} of the Ares-I Upper Stage liquid oxygen tank-to-sump joint is assessed by analyzing the deflections of the joint components. Analyses are performed using three-dimensional symmetric wedge finite element models and the ABAQUS commercial finite element software. For the pressure loads and feedline interface loads, the analyses employ a mixed factor of safety approach {{to comply with the}} Constellation Program factor of safety requirements. Naflex pressure-assisted seals are considered first because they have been used successfully in similar <b>seal</b> <b>joints</b> in the Space Shuttle External Tank. For the baseline sump <b>seal</b> <b>joint</b> configuration with a Naflex <b>seal,</b> the predicted <b>joint</b> opening greatly exceeds the seal design specification. Three redesign options of the joint that maintain the use of a Naflex seal are studied. The joint openings for the redesigned <b>seal</b> <b>joints</b> show improvement over the baseline configuration; however, these joint openings still exceed the seal design specification. RACO pressure-assisted seals are considered next because they are known to also be used on the Space Shuttle External Tank, and the joint opening allowable is much larger than the specification for the Naflex seals. The finite element models for the RACO seal analyses are created by modifying the models that were used for the Naflex seal analyses. The analyses show that the RACO seal may provide sufficient sealing capability for the sump <b>seal</b> <b>joint.</b> The results provide reasonable data to recommend the design change and plan a testing program to determine the {{capability of}} RACO seals in the Ares-I Upper Stage liquid oxygen tank sump <b>seal</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{experimental}} and theoretical studying of mechanical effects in running fuel cell is provided. It is shown that under optimized operating {{conditions it is}} possible to obtain the electrical performances of fuel cells at about 1 [*]W[*]cm− 2. The further improvements can be achieved by means of mechanical effects. In particular, the influence of mechanical properties of <b>seal</b> <b>joints</b> and clamping bolt torques on the electrical performance is studied experimentally. It is demonstrated that rigid <b>seal</b> <b>joints</b> improve the electrical performance in comparison with the soft <b>seal</b> <b>joints.</b> Concerning the influence of the bolt torques, a certain optimal value is found for different types of MEA. The numerical modelling of mechanical stresses in running fuel cell is made. The developed model includes the main components of a real fuel cell (the membrane, the gas diffusion layers, the graphite plates, and the <b>seal</b> <b>joints)</b> and the clamping elements (the steel plates, the bolts, and the nuts). The operating conditions have been taken into account by imposing heat sources and humidity field. The results of modelling illustrate the main mechanical effects arising in the entire fuel cell.

40|$|Leaking, {{friction}} and wear of seals are concerns for machine designers and users everywhere. Although perfect sealing {{may be the}} general aim, in practice, considering apparently identical seals in the same application, some may seal while some may not. This is due, at least in part, to surface-related random phenomena. Therefore, the importance of considering the reliability of <b>sealed</b> <b>joints</b> cannot be overemphasized. Up to now, there is no paper in the published literature about the reliability analysis of static <b>sealed</b> <b>joints.</b> All of these facts provide the motivation for the current research work. A computer simulation model for the leakage analysis of static <b>sealed</b> <b>joints</b> has been developed based on the percolation theory. The features of the leakage simulation model can be concluded as follows: (1) It reveals the effect of random properties of rough surfaces on the sealing performance and {{makes it possible to}} apply the statistical concepts in discussing the sealing reliability of static sealed joints; (2) It provides much simpler and more economic tool for the statistical analysis of leakage by computer simulation than by experiments; (3) It makes it possible to describe the leakage phenomenon more accurately using the leakage path model instead of the clearance between surface centre-lines; (4) It eliminates the need for individual asperity model of rough surfaces, because the actual digitized surface is used directly. The relationship between the leakage probability and the applied load, which is of great general interest to the designers of static <b>sealed</b> <b>joints,</b> has been predicted by the leakage simulation model. The simulated results show that for a given leakage probability, the required load will increase as the value of RMS o height a increases or the value of correlation length decreases. It is confirmed that a certain value of contact ratio can be used as the criterion for identifying the reliability of static <b>sealed</b> <b>joints</b> with a certain confidence level. The contact ratio criterion provides a simple, inexpensive and useful tool to evaluate the effects of rough surfaces, material properties and applied load on the sealing reliability of static <b>sealed</b> <b>joints.</b> However, in order to be of practical use, experimental work is required to evaluate its validity...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of lining damage in stilling basins and at the toe of chute spillways is the global {{instantaneous}} uplift forces due to the difference in pressure acting on the upper and the lower surface of protection slabs or rock elements. Spillway stilling basin linings can be built according to two different techniques: using <b>sealed</b> <b>joints</b> or unsealed joints. In the case of <b>sealed</b> <b>joints,</b> the pressure underneath the slab is constant and the uplift force results from the pressure fluctuations acting on the slab. In the case of unsealed joints, the pressure propagation at the lower surface of the slab, being transferred through the joints, should also be considered. The aim of the paper is to study, define, and compare the design criteria in these two cases. In the present study, the pressure field on the slab is evaluated {{according to a recent}} method based on the Taylor hypothesis, whereas the pressure propagation under the slab is computed by a new 3 D model based on unsteady flow analysis of seepage through porous media. By this approach, it is possible to consider the effect of finite thickness foundation layers, typical in the case of weirs for run-of-river power plants, earth dams, and rock-fill dams. Furthermore, to complete the presented design criteria, the dynamic behavior of anchored slabs is experimentally investigated with reference to the <b>sealed</b> <b>joint</b> case {{due to a lack of}} studies in the literature.

In this case, the thin Ti layer {{was used as}} a buffer layer to prevent the diffusion between solder interlayer and Cu after deposition and to save more solders for diffusion bonding process. Bonding was performed in a wafer bonder at 180 and 150 C for 20 min with a pressure of 5. 5 MPa. It was found that bonding at 180 C voids free <b>seal</b> <b>joints</b> composed of high-temperature intermetallic compounds were obtained with good hermeticity. However, with bonding at 150 C, voids were generated along the <b>seal</b> <b>joint,</b> which caused poor hermeticity compared with that bonded at 180 C. After four types of reliability tests—pressure cooker test, high humidity storage, high-temperature storage, and temperature cycling test—dies bonded at 180 C showed good reliability properties evidenced by hermeticity test and shear tests. Results presented here prove that high-yield and low-temperature hermetic bonding using Sn/In/Cu metallization with thin Ti buffer layer can be achieved.

40|$|In Japan acrylic {{sealants}} {{are traditionally}} the sealant products of choice when specified for use between autoclaved lightweight concrete (ALC) panels. Although, in general terms, {{the mechanisms of}} the deterioration of acrylic sealants are well known its long-term durability to outdoor exposure has not, however, been fully investigated. The research described in this paper focuses on {{the change in the}} properties and deterioration of acrylic sealant products when exposed to outdoor testing. The two stage project consisted of (i) on-site investigations of deteriorated acrylic sealants that had been placed in external joints of ALC-clad buildings; and (ii) outdoor exposure testing of different types of acrylic sealant in three climate regions located in Japan. The results of the work from the first stage of the study revealed the following. Two-sided adhesion joint configurations installed in deep panel ALC cladding were more reliable than threesided adhesion joints used for thin panel ALC cladding from the viewpoint of the durability of the <b>sealed</b> <b>joint</b> installed in actual buildings. Most fractures of the <b>sealed</b> <b>joint</b> could be characterized as failure in peel (or thin layer cohesive failures), in which the sealant ruptured at the interface with the ALC substrate to which it was applied. Additionally, in 47 of 62 locations surveyed, surface cracks were apparent on the coating that had been applied to protect the sealant. The second stage of the project focused on the degree of deterioration of coated and non-coated acrylic sealants subjected to outdoor exposure testing in a cold, a warm, and a subtropical climate. Results from this stage showed that aging of the sealant, as determined by the degree of surface cracking, expectedly depended on the local temperature and the respective degree of exposure to solar radiation. It was determined that the longer the exposure period, the lower the tensile performance of the acrylic sealants. The elongation of three-sided adhesive joint configurations after 5 years exposure testing decreased remarkably and their maximum elongation was less than 50 %.
