5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be the marks of bird attacks have been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the <b>scorpionfly</b> Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
25|$|Evolution is not {{a random}} process. Although {{mutations}} in DNA are random, natural selection {{is not a}} process of chance: the environment determines the probability of reproductive success. Evolution is an inevitable result of imperfectly copying, self-replicating organisms reproducing over billions of years under the selective pressure of the environment. The outcome of evolution is not a perfectly designed organism. The end products of natural selection are organisms that are adapted to their present environments. Natural selection does not involve progress towards an ultimate goal. Evolution does not strive for more advanced, more intelligent, or more sophisticated life forms. For example, fleas (wingless parasites) are descended from a winged, ancestral <b>scorpionfly,</b> and snakes are lizards that no longer require limbsâ€”although pythons still grow tiny structures that are the remains of their ancestor's hind legs. Organisms are merely the outcome of variations that succeed or fail, dependent upon the environmental conditions at the time.|$|E

50|$|Boreidae, {{commonly}} called snow <b>scorpionflies,</b> {{or in the}} British Isles, snow fleas (no relation to the snow flea Hypogastrura nivicola) are a very small family of <b>scorpionflies,</b> containing only around 30 species, {{all of which are}} boreal or high-altitude species in the Northern Hemisphere. Recent research indicates the boreids are more closely related to fleas than to other <b>scorpionflies,</b> which renders the order Mecoptera paraphyletic if the order Siphonaptera is excluded from it.|$|R
