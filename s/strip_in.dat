5|$|As with Fleming's {{previous}} novels, Diamonds Are Forever received broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic <b>strip.</b> <b>In</b> 1971 it was adapted into the seventh Bond film in the series and was the last Eon Productions film to star Sean Connery as Bond.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 20th century, daily {{newspaper}} strips were usually presented {{in black and}} white and Sunday <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> color, but a few newspapers have published daily <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> color, and some newspapers, such as Grit, have published Sunday <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> black and white. On the web, {{daily newspaper}} <b>strips</b> are usually <b>in</b> color, and conversely, some webcomics, such as Joyce and Walky, have been created {{in black and white}}.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} {{and development of}} endodermal Caspar-ian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> Pinus bungeana needles and roots were stud-ied by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Primary pit fields (PFs) frequently occurred in radial walls of Casparian strips isolated from needles, whereas PFs were never detected <b>in</b> Casparian <b>strips</b> from roots. Formation of Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> needles as well as roots started at the outer parts of the radial walls and they finally occupied the entire radial walls of the endodermis. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of Caspar-ian strips isolated from roots revealed significant absorp-tion bands characteristic for suberin. However, <b>in</b> Casparian <b>strips</b> of needles, evidence for suberin was rarely detected by FTIR spectroscopy. The apoplastic permeability of Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> needles and roots was probed by the apoplastic tracers calcofluor and berberine. Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> roots efficiently blocked the apoplastic transport (AT) of calcofluor and berberine. Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> nee-dles blocked the AT of calcofluor, but diffusion of berber-ine was not inhibited and berberine thiocyanate crystals were detectable in the vascular tissue of the needles. From the data presented, it must be concluded that Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> needles, which are characterized {{by the absence of}} suberin, are more solute permeable compared with Caspar-ian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> roots...|$|R
