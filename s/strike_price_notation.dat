50|$|Before 2010 the ticker (trading) symbols for US options {{typically}} {{looked like}} this: IBMAF.This {{consisted of a}} root symbol ('IBM') + month code ('A') + <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> code ('F'). The root symbol is {{the symbol of the}} stock on the stock exchange. After this comes the month code, A-L mean January-December calls, M-X mean January-December puts. The <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> code is a letter corresponding with a certain <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> (which letter corresponds with which <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> depends on the stock).|$|R
50|$|Suppose {{that you}} {{purchase}} a CoC and sell a PoC {{on the same}} underlying call option and with the same <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> and time to maturity. The payoff of this portfolio is always the same: you will purchase the underlying call {{at the time of}} maturity of the compound options. If the underlying call's price at the time of maturity is greater than the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> you will exercise your CoC and purchase the underlying call at its <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> If the underlying call's price at the time of maturity is less than the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> the counterparty will exercise its PoC and you will need to purchase the underlying call at its <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> Thus, {{there will always be a}} cash outflow equal to the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> and you will come into possession of a call option.|$|R

50|$|If the {{underlying}} stock's market price {{is below the}} option's <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> when expiration arrives, the option owner (buyer) can exercise the put option, forcing the writer to buy {{the underlying}} stock at the <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> That allows the exerciser (buyer) {{to profit from the}} difference between the stock's market price and the option's <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> But if the stock's market price is above the option's <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> at the end of expiration day, the option expires worthless, and the owner's loss is limited to the premium (fee) paid for it (the writer's profit).|$|R

50|$|The {{intrinsic}} value {{is the difference}} between the underlying spot <b>price</b> and the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> to the extent that this is in favor of the option holder. For a call option, the option is in-the-money if the underlying spot price is higher than the strike price; then the {{intrinsic value}} is the underlying <b>price</b> minus the <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> For a put option, the option is in-the-money if the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> is higher than the underlying spot price; then the intrinsic value is the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> minus the underlying spot price. Otherwise the intrinsic value is zero.|$|R

40|$|Trades in DAX index options with {{identical}} maturities cluster around particular {{classes of}} <b>strike</b> <b>prices.</b> For example, options with strikes ending on 50 are less traded than options with strikes ending on 00. Clustering is higher when options with close <b>strike</b> <b>prices</b> are good substitutes.

50|$|In {{financial}} mathematics, put-call parity {{defines a}} relationship between the price of a European call option and European put option, both with the identical <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> and expiry, namely that a portfolio of a long call option and a short put option is equivalent to (and hence has the same value as) a single forward contract at this <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> and expiry. This is because if the price at expiry is above the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> the call will be exercised, while if it is below, the put will be exercised, and thus in either case one unit of the asset will be purchased for the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> exactly as in a forward contract.|$|R
50|$|An {{investor}} typically 'buys a call' when {{he expects}} {{the price of the}} underlying instrument will go above the call's 'strike price,' hopefully significantly so, before the call expires. The investor pays a non-refundable premium for the legal right to exercise the call at the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> meaning he can purchase the underlying instrument at the <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> Typically, if the price of the underlying instrument has surpassed the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> the buyer pays the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> to actually purchase the underlying instrument, and then sells the instrument and pockets the profit. Of course, the investor can also hold onto the underlying instrument, if he feels it will continue to climb even higher.|$|R
5000|$|For example, for UVW stock with a {{stock price}} of $100, {{and for the}} bear put portion of the iron {{butterfly}} a put option with a <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> of $100 is sold at $3.00 and a put option for UVW with a <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> of $90 is purchased for $1.00.

50|$|The options trader {{hopes that}} the price of the {{underlying}} drops, maximizing his profit when the underlying drops below the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> of the written option, netting him the difference between the <b>strike</b> <b>prices</b> minus the cost of entering into the position.|$|R
50|$|The <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> {{is a key}} {{variable}} in a derivatives contract between two parties.

50|$|The {{basic idea}} of an {{accumulator}} contract is that the buyer speculates a company will trade between a certain price range (the range between the strike and the knock out price) within the contract period, and the issuer bets that stock will fall below the <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> Note that the buyer holds an obligation to buy the shares at the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> and not the option to buy. Likewise, the issuer holds an obligation to sell shares at the <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{the same}} reasons, a put option is in-the-money if {{it allows the}} {{purchase}} of the underlying at a market <b>price</b> below the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> of the put option.

5000|$|The Bull Put Credit Spread (see bull spread) is a bullish {{strategy}} {{and consists of}} selling a put option and purchasing a put option for the same stock or index at differing <b>strike</b> <b>prices</b> for the same expiration.

50|$|If {{the stock}} is {{sufficiently}} volatile and option duration is long, the trader could profit from both options.
