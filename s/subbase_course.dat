40|$|France is {{currently}} producing about 17 Mt/year of demolished concrete, {{most of this}} material being used in road <b>subbase</b> <b>courses</b> or embankments.

40|$|UK {{government}} policy strongly encourages {{the industry to}} increase recycling waste materials, and accommodate them among other common construction materials. Creating a market for common wastes will reduce volumes and provide economic advantage over disposal, as well as reducing the associated environmental and social impacts. Limestone dust, which is produced {{during the process of}} limestone rock crushing process, is a common waste, creating many problems. Using limestone dust in road base and <b>subbase</b> <b>courses</b> is one of the suggestions to move it to the category of by-products. Although previous researches have concluded some disadvantages in application of limestone dust in road foundation, there is a potential hypothesis suggesting the probable gain in stiffness during the time, due to high amount of free CaO in the chemical structure of limestone dust. This research focused on studying the possibilities of application of extra limestone dust in Type 1 material, and examined its effect in terms of resilient modulus, one of very important, influential factors in design of flexible pavement structures. The results of short- and long-term resilient behaviour measurement of the samples signify the positive effect of adding considerable amount of limestone dust to the Type 1 road base aggregate system...|$|R

The results of the proposed testing method, carried out by this apparatus, are shown to conform well to the results of previous researches.

40|$|Throughout a year, climatic changes highly {{influence}} {{the degree of}} saturation of <b>subbase</b> <b>course</b> layer inside pavement structures in cold snowy regions, such as Hokkaido, Japan. Besides, pavements have to transfer traffic loads from the asphalt-mixture layer to the <b>subbase</b> <b>course</b> layer. Accordingly, {{it is necessary to}} understand the mechanical behaviors of the <b>subbase</b> <b>course</b> layer effected by seasonal variations of degree of saturation and traffic loads. In this study, a series of monotonic and cyclic triaxial compression tests was performed to measure the deformation-strength characteristics of the unsaturated granular <b>subbase</b> <b>course</b> material (called C- 40) using the newly developed medium-size triaxial apparatus. The suction-controlled laboratory element test method for unsaturated soils in this study is based on the axis translation technique using the triaxial apparatus with special deign on cap and pedestal, which can control pore water pressure and pore air pressure separately, thereby reducing the total testing time. To begin with, the soil-water characteristic test was carried out on C- 40 specimen to obtain the relationship between the matric suction and the degree of saturation. The water-air-particle system in unsaturated soils are introduced to describe the transition of pore water and pore air inside soils. Second, the influences of degree of saturation and strain rate on strength characteristics of unsaturated specimens were evaluated through monotonic triaxial compression tests. The experimental results implied that the degradation in shear strength of C- 40 specimen, with the increment in degree of saturation and decrement in strain rate, was found under monotonic loads. The effects of degree of saturation and strain rate on the total internal friction angle appear to be negligible, while the total cohesion can be affected by the degree of saturation and the strain rate. More specifically, the failure surface drawn through the failure envelope with respect to the matric suction is curved surface. Finally, to examine the effect of degree of saturation on resilient modulus (Mr) for C- 40, the cyclic triaxial compression tests, i. e., the modulus resilient tests (MR tests), were performed on C- 40 specimens with different degrees of saturation pursuant to AASHTO T 307 - 99 (2003). The test results indicated that the degree of saturation of the specimen and the applied stress level have a considerable influence on the resilientIIdeformation characteristics of C- 40 in MR test. The testing results obtained from monotonic and cyclic triaxial compression tests indicate that the degree of saturation and the strain rate {{influence the}} deformation-strength characteristics of the unsaturated granular <b>subbase</b> <b>course</b> material C- 40 strongly. Therefore, to rationalize a design method for pavement structures better suited to the climatic conditions in cold snowy regions, the laboratory element tests under monotonic and cyclic loading, which take the influences of above-mentioned two factors into account, should be employed...|$|E

The use of reclaimed asphalt (RA) as a constituent material for bound mixtures offers two main advantages: it eliminates problems concerning disposal and it allows natural resources to be preserved. Among the most widespread recycled mixtures, the use of cement–bitumen-treated materials (CBTM) for <b>subbase</b> <b>courses</b> has rapidly increased over the last 10 years. This paper deals with the influence of RA content on the mechanical characteristics of CBTM. Several mixtures were produced by combining different dosages of binders (cement and bituminous emulsion) and RA contents. The behaviour of recycled mixtures was evaluated and compared in terms of indirect tensile strength, water sensitivity and stiffness modulus. In addition, the effects of temperature on the stiffness properties were investigated. Experimental results showed that the RA content did not significantly affect the compactability and the strength properties of CBTM. The presence of RA determined an increase in mix deformability and thermodependence, but the effect can be inhibited by increasing cement dosage. The findings offer good prospects for increasing the use of RA and encourage administrations to employ this material as an effective construction solution...|$|R
40|$|For the {{rehabilitation}} of asphalt pavements the upper distressed layers are usually milled before overlaying to eliminate reflection cracking-related problems and to preserve the pavement geometry. This maintenance technique generates {{a large amount of}} reclaimed asphalt (RA) as a product of the milling operation.

However, the influence of RA on the mechanical properties of cement-treated materials (CTMs) is still not completely understood. As a consequence, CTMs using a high content of RA have not yet been widely applied. The present paper shows the findings of an experimental analysis on CTMs including 50 % and 80 % RA in comparison with the reference CTM consisting of 100 % mineral aggregates. In particular, indirect tensile tests and unconfined compressive tests were conducted to evaluate the resistance characteristics of the CTMs. In addition, complex modulus tests at and ultrasonic pulse velocity tests were performed to investigate the stiffness properties of CTMs. The investigation shows promising results as regards the use of high percentages of RA in CTMs and offers a substantial contribution for the understanding of the mechanical behaviour of CTM...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} physical and mechanical properties of marginal lateritic soil and Melamine Debris (MD) blends as a sustainable engineering fill material. Physical property tests included specific gravity, water absorption, Atterberg limits, Los Angeles (LA) abrasion and particle-size distribution, while mechanical property tests included California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and swelling. The results indicate that MD as non-plastic coarse-grained and durable material (LA = 11. 3 %) {{can be used as}} an alternative replacement material for engineering fill materials. The MD replacement of lateritic soil reduces the fine content and increases the abrasion resistance of the soil particles, hence the reduction in liquid limit, plasticity index, LA abrasion and particle breakage. This physical property improvement leads to superior mechanical properties (soaked CBR and swelling) with increasing MD replacement ratio as compared to the soil alone. The proposed empirical equations for predicting soaked CBR and swelling of blends at different MD replacement ratios and compaction energy levels are useful in the selection of the suitable MD replacement to attain targeted mechanical property requirements. The physical and mechanical properties of the 20 % MD replacement blend were found to meet the requirement of local road authority for engineering fill materials while the 50 % MD replacement blend was at the borderline for a <b>subbase</b> <b>course</b> material...|$|E

It has been used in the construction of retaining walls, embankments, earth dams, foundation beds for heavy structures on soft grounds, viaduct bridges and other applications (Henry Vidal, 1969; Haussmann, 1990; Rao, 1996). With the advent of geosynthetics in civil engineering, reinforced earth {{technique has}} taken a new turn in its era. The practice of reinforced earth technique became easy and simple with geosynthetics. In spite of its wide use in various engineering practices, its application in the construction of pavements is very much limited (Prasada Raju, 2001).

40|$|It is {{well known}} that inter-particle {{friction}} and cohesion of soil particles and aggregates deeply affect the strength and deformation properties of soils, exerting critical effects on the bearing capacity of unbound pavement materials. In that respect, considering that strength characteristics of soil are highly dependent on particle interactions, and assuming a relationship between electric properties (e. g. electric permittivity) and bulk density of materials, a good correlation between mechanical and electric characteristics of soil is expected. In this work, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) techniques are used to investigate this topic. Two GPR equipment with same electronic characteristics and different survey configurations are used. Each radar operates with two ground-coupled antennae at 600 MHz and 1600 MHz central frequencies. Measurements are developed using 4 channels, 2 mono-static and 2 bi-static. The received signal is sampled in the time domain at dt = 7. 8125 × 10 − 2 ns, and in the space domain every 2. 4 × 10 − 2 m. A semi-empirical model is proposed for predicting the resilient modulus of sub-asphalt layers from GPR-derived data. Basically, the method requires to follow two steps. Firstly, laboratory tests are carried out for calibration, with the main focus to provide consistent empirical relationships between physical (e. g. bulk density) and electric properties. The second step is focused on the in-situ validation of results through soil strength measurements retrieved by CBR tests and Light Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD). On the basis of traditional empirical equations used for flexible pavement design, the following expression is proposed, where Ei [MPa] is the ith expected resilient modulus of the surveyed soil under the line of scan, hj,i [m] is the i th thickness referred to the j th layer, and αj is a dielectric parameter calibrated {{as a function of the}} relative electric permittivity. The experimental setting requires the use of road material, typically employed for subgrade and <b>subbase</b> <b>courses.</b> Different types of soil ranging from group A 1 to A 4 by AASHTO soil classification system, are analyzed. As regards the laboratory experiments, material is gradually compacted in electrically and hydraulically isolated test boxes. A large metal sheet supports the experimental boxes, so that the transmitted GPR signal is totally reflected. GPR inspections are carried out for any compaction step up to the maximum density value available. Moreover, in-situ tests are carried out on targeted types of soil, with grain size distribution and texture comparable to those analyzed in laboratory environment. The results of this study confirm a promising correlation between the electric permittivities and the strength and deformation properties of the surveyed soils. Laboratory analyses show that the relationship between the relative permittivity and the bulk density is positive: the higher the density of the compacted soil sample, the higher the electric permittivity of the medium. Analogously, in-situ validation presents a good comparison between measured and predicted data. Percentage errors less than 20...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a recent investigation on the performance of four recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs). The materials, obtained by crushing concrete with compressive strength ranging from 15 MPa to 75 MPa, were reconstituted to satisfy the grading requirements for a subbase material. Triaxial specimens were tested under repeated loading one day after compaction. It appears that the original concrete compressive strength, the amount of softer material in the RCA, and the flakiness index of the RCA can significantly affect the resilient modulus. Degradation is mostly related to the crushing of softer and flaky materials within the aggregate matrix. In this regard, the Ten Percent Fines test is suitable as an evaluation test as it does not impose an excessive force on the RCA. The overall results indicated that RCA may be utilized as a <b>subbase</b> or base <b>course</b> material if it can be produced to consistently meet product quality standards...|$|R

As long as we arent stop this chaos, our resersours will be finish. So we will engaged to local wars, uncoordinated industrialization, famisment and disturp natural balance. As long as we can recycling to plastics, paper, some fossil oil products, rocks etc. As far as we know collection, transportation, transaction and disposal of waste materials are part of waste management.   In 2014, 1636 million ton steel are produce in the world, besides 34 million tonnes steel are produce in Turkey. Nearly 130 – 150 kg slag have been released druring producing 1 ton steel. As long as calculate slag producing, approximately 5, 1 million tonnes slag have been released every year in Turkey.   In our country, the place of construction sector in economy is incrasing gradually. Following that the demand of materials used in the construction sector is also incrasing. Also pavement construction is more consume natural resources than other branches of civil engineering. Huge quantities of natural materiales, rocks, fossil oil and sand are constructed into kilometers of constructed roads or in reconstruction of fault roads. Given the limited resources of our country,as in many areas the recycling of waste materials to useful resources is beneficial to both environment and minimization of the production costs.   As far as we know, we are using huge of amount of aggregate in the construction sector. Every year we are using million tonnes aggregate for built something.

This example show us how much aggregate we are using in order construction. Acording to not reduce aggregate amount, we can change aggregate materials. Every year we are {{spent a lot of money}} for road building. As far as we know aggregate is huge amount in budget of road building.

40|$|Pavement layer {{materials}} are typically {{assumed to be}} isotropic in determining pavement responses, such as stress and strain. The main benefit of the isotropic assumption is that stiffness defined by modulus of elasticity (E-value) is equal in all directions. In reality, stiffness along vertical and horizontal (i. e., and) may vary due to density gradients in compacted layer materials caused by vertical compaction during construction. Therefore, pavement layer materials with different vertical and horizontal modulus (i. e., ≠) are cross-anisotropic. Past studies have reported that degree of cross-anisotropy, () ranges from 0. 2 to 0. 85 in Asphalt Concrete (AC) layers. Yet, the presence of cross-anisotropy is not considered in pavement layers for determining stress and strains, which are used for prediction of pavement distresses such as rutting and fatigue cracking. Ignoring the presence of AC cross-anisotropy may lead to an error in stress-strain calculations, and in pavement distress value predictions. To this end, this study examines the effects of cross-anisotropy on pavement stress-strain and thereby, evaluates the importance of cross-anisotropy in pavement design. In addition to cross-anisotropy, AC modulus is temperature and frequency dependent. Pavement temperature varies not only at different times over a day but also at different seasons over a year. Also, temperature is not constant over the depth of an AC layer {{which leads to a}} non-homogenous distribution of AC stiffness. AC modulus varies due to different loading frequencies caused by variable speed of moving vehicles. Unbound layers such as base and subbase are stress-dependent. The stiffness of an unbound layer differs at different months over a year due to varying moisture contents. This study considers all of these factors such as temperature, frequency, and moisture with material cross-anisotropy through laboratory testing and finite element modeling. In this study, a dynamic Finite Element Model (FEM) is developed based on the geometry of an instrumented pavement section at Milepost (MP) 141 on I- 40, Rio Puerco, New Mexico and deflections, stress, and strains are predicted under truck tire pressure. Two different material models are employed: (i) generalized cross-anisotropic and temperature dependent viscoelastic model, and (ii) nonlinear elastic and stress-dependent model. The first one is for the AC layer whereas the second one is for unbound layers such as base and <b>subbase</b> <b>courses.</b> In this study, dynamic modulus tests were conducted in the laboratory on field-compacted vertical and horizontal AC cores to determine the parameters required for developing the generalized cross-anisotropic viscoelastic model. Resilient modulus tests were conducted on granular aggregates collected from the base and subbase layers to develop nonlinear elastic and stress-dependent material model. After integrating these material models, the dynamic FEM is simulated under a Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) test type load (79. 6 psi over a circular area with 6 inch radius) for model validation. The simulated responses are compared to in-situ deflections, stress, and strains under a FWD test. It is observed that the simulated pavement responses are close to in-situ responses. Using the validated model under non-uniform vertical tire-pavement contact stress, FEM simulations are run at varying n-values and temperatures to determine tensile strain at the bottom of AC layer and vertical compressive strains in all layers. It is observed that strains are sensitive to material cross-anisotropy and strains with cross-anisotropy assumption are greater than those with isotropy assumption. In particular, both horizontal tensile and vertical compressive strains increased in case of AC cross-anisotropy, whereas only vertical strains increase in case of unbound layer cross-anisotropy. These strain variations due to cross-anisotropy increase at high temperature and in presence of stress-dependent unbound layer. In order to determine pavement distresses, simulated strains are used to determine damage due to fatigue and permanent deformation using Miner’s rule. In case of AC cross-anisotropy, damage decreases as n-value increases towards isotropy (). However, unbound layer cross-anisotropy leads to an increase in fatigue damage as n-value increases towards isotropy. It is also observed that damage due to AC cross-anisotropy is very high compared to unbound layer cross-anisotropy. It indicates that earlier pavement damage is mostly caused by the AC cross-anisotropy. That is, AC cross-anisotropy {{is more important than the}} unbound layer cross-anisotropy when considering rutting and fatigue damage only. This study recommends to incorporate the AC cross-anisotropy, at a minimum, in pavement analysis and design. PhD, Civil EngineeringDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

30|$|Time curing, {{according}} to Bell and Coulthard [9], {{is an important}} factor influencing the strength of stabilized material as a steady gain in strength for over months is a characteristic. Decrease in the CBR values were recorded after 21  days of curing of cement treated, indicating improved strength, strength gain with time and long term durability of the cement treated material at 3  weeks of curing, after which, the rate of increment in the CBR values reduced gradually. This gradual decrease in the CBR after 21  days of curing could be attributed to breakdown of weak chemical bonds between stabilized constituents which may be as a result that the lime produced was quickly used up within 3  weeks of curing leaving little or no cement for further reaction. In assessment of strength of construction material for pavement design such as base, subbase and subgrade materials, CBR value {{according to}} Okagbue and Ochulor [23] is often used as a benchmark. According to Federal Ministry of Works and Housing [14], the CBR recommended values for use as: subgrade, <b>subbase</b> and base <b>course</b> materials are: ≤  10, ≤  30 and ≤  80 %, respectively for unsoaked soil. On the basis of the CBR values, the cement treated shale materials improved significantly their bearing capacity thereby satisfying the minimum requirement of United States National Lime Association for lime stabilization.|$|R
40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{study for the}} use of propane as a subbase drying technique. Michael Blahut (1) Dr. Vernon Schaefer (2) Dr. Chris Williams (3) The use of propane as a soil drying technique will be studied to determine the economicand technical feasibility for use in transportation related projects. The need originates from the earthwork portion of a construction schedule, which can be severely delayed if the soil is too wet for compaction. The ultimate goal is develop an implement {{that can be used in}} the field and can be adapted to work with existing equipment; i. e. pulled by earth moving equipment. The laboratory drying device has provisions to receive the propane fuel, transfer the propane to heat through interchangeable instruments, output the heat onto the soil, and till the soil as it passes over the sample. A laboratory based technical feasibility analysis is currently under way to determine the amount of propane in BTU 2 ̆ 7 s that is required to dry a soil to a desirable level that has an over optimum moisture content. Several types of drying instruments will be implemented with all using propane as their fuel source. Some of these heating instruments include forced air, direct flame and infrared heating. Soils typically used in Iowa for <b>subbase</b> and base <b>courses</b> will be used. The properties of the soils will be measured before and after drying. The properties that will be measured are dry unit weight, moisture content and the Atterberg limits. All soil types could benefit from a drier device but those with percent fines content above 20 will benefit the most. We will also investigate to determine if any chemical changes occur after the application of propane heat.

40|$|Roads in many {{northern}} climates like Saskatchewan can undergo {{structural failure}} caused by frost action and substructure moisture problems. Frost action can be efficiently controlled by eliminating {{at least one}} of the following conditions: moisture; freezing temperatures; and frost susceptible soils. However, effective use of shredded tire material could provide an environmentally sustainable solution for waste tires and could relieve pressure on limited quality aggregate resources. The City of Saskatoon has successfully incorporated crushed rock and crushed recycled concrete as a subsurface road drainage layer to mitigate substructure drainage and frost issues. However, the price of crushed high value aggregates can be cost prohibitive and at times these materials are not available in quantities required. Previous research has documented that shredded tires are efficient in controlling frost action by providing thermal insulation and free drainage, but shredded tires performed poorly as a structural support layer with low mechanical stiffness and high compressibility properties. The goal of this research was to provide improved pavement performance with respect to road substructure moisture drainage and frost mitigation. The specific objectives of this research were to: •	Quantify the mechanical properties of shredded tires and investigate the mechanical behavior of mixes of shredded tires with and without sand blended into the tire matrix as compared to conventional subbase and base coarse materials; •	Determine the permeability of shredded tires and investigate the effect of sand on the permeability of shredded tire/sand mixes as compared to conventional granular base and subbase materials, and; •	Compare the structural primary response behavior and capital cost of alternate road structures constructed with shredded tires and mixes of shredded tire and sand as a free draining subbase material compared to conventional drainage layers and road structures. The hypothesis of this research was that the mechanical behavior of shredded tire material, used as a road substructure layer, can be improved by blending it with free draining sand. It was also hypothesized that blending shredded tire with free draining sand will have improved drainage compared to conventional granular <b>subbase</b> and base <b>course</b> materials. Volumetric and mechanistic material properties and structural performance behavior of shredded tires and shredded tire/sand mixes in the mix ratios (by volume) of 1 Tire: 1 Sand, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand were evaluated and compared to City of Saskatoon subbase materials: crushed rock and granular base; as well as Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure (SMHI) Type 6 subbase. Laboratory characterization showed that 100 % shredded tire materials were uniformly graded indicating high amounts of voids. The addition of sand resulted in a reduction of interparticle air voids. Results from strength and stiffness characterization tests indicated that 100 % shredded tires exhibited low structural stiffness, but this behavior was improved as the quantity of sand in the shredded tire was increased. The 100 % shredded tire material was determined to have a dynamic modulus value of 5 MPa, whereas shredded tires/sand blends at the ratios of 1 Tire: 1 Sand, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand gave dynamic moduli values of 30 MPa, 110 MPa and 158 MPa, respectively. For comparison, SMHI Type 6 subbase, City of Saskatoon crushed rock and granular base exhibited dynamic moduli values of 94 MPa, 174 MPa and 471 MPa, respectively. Permeability characterization indicated that the 100 % shredded tire materials were free draining at 1. 42 cm/s. Permeability decreased from 1. 42 cm/s with 100 % shredded tire to 0. 0026 cm/s with 1 Tire: 3 Sand. However, the shredded tire/sand mixes maintained permeability values higher than sand (0. 0013 cm/s). SMHI Type 6 subbase and granular materials were found to have a permeability of 0. 0018 cm/s and 0. 000025 cm/s, respectively, while crushed rock was free draining with a permeability of 1. 12 cm/s. Structural behavior of 100 % shredded tire, shredded tire/sand mixes and City of Saskatoon subbase materials were studied in road models using a 3 -D numerical road modeling software that encoded triaxial material constitutive relationships determined in this research. A typical City of Saskatoon road structure was assumed for all road structures considered in this study with varying subbase material so as to directly compare the structural effect of the shredded tire with conventional road materials under primary load limits. Modeled results of the 100 % shredded tire and crushed rock roads showed peak surface deflections of 2. 19 mm and 0. 73 mm, respectively. Peak surface deflection under primary load limits was found to decrease with an increase in sand quantity within the shredded tire layer. Based on the modeling results, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand yielded peak surface deflections of 1. 01 mm and 0. 96 mm, respectively. For comparative purposes, road structures with SMHI Type 6 subbase deflected at 1. 14 mm. Field test sections were constructed at Adolph Way in Saskatoon to compare the structural performance of shredded tire to crushed rock (currently specified by City of Saskatoon for drainage layers) in a typical residential road in Saskatoon. Unfortunately, both crushed rock (control) and shredded tire sections were found to deflect above acceptable limits due to high moisture conditions within the deep subgrade. Therefore, deeper excavation was required and the test sections were not constructed. The Adolph Way field experimentation of shredded tire showed that shredded tire road systems can be effectively constructed in the field, but showed the same sensitivity to poor subgrade conditions as crushed rock. Capital cost analysis showed the 100 % shredded tire and shredded tire/sand subbase layers to be less expensive than City of Saskatoon specified crushed rock drainage layers. The 100 % shredded tire layer was estimated at a total cost of $ 2. 93 /m 2 while 1 Tire: 1 Sand, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand were estimated at $ 4. 39 /m 2, $ 4. 88 /m 2 and $ 5. 12 /m 2, respectively. SMHI Type 6 subbase, crushed rock and granular base layers were estimated at a total cost of $ 5. 85 /m 2, $ 13. 95 /m 2 and $ 9. 00 /m 2, respectively for equivalent thickness. From the structural, permeability and economic perspective of this research, the 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand materials proved to be cost efficient as well as technically viable options for mitigating frost action as compared with City of Saskatoon crushed rock materials evaluated. The use of shredded tire/sand mixes of 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand in urban local road structures with low traffic volumes are therefore recommended as a cost effective subbase drainage layer material...|$|R
