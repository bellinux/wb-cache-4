25|$|Mobile speed cameras may be hand-held, tripod mounted, or vehicle-mounted. In vehicle-mounted systems, {{detection}} equipment and cameras can be mounted {{to the vehicle}} itself, or simply tripod mounted inside the vehicle and deployed out a window or door. If the camera is fixed to the vehicle, the enforcement vehicle does not necessarily have to be stationary, and can be moved either with or against the flow of traffic. In the latter case, depending on the direction of travel, the target vehicle's relative speed is either added or subtracted from the enforcement vehicle's own speed to obtain its actual <b>speed.</b> The <b>speedometer</b> of the camera vehicle needs to be accurately calibrated.|$|R

40|$|Digital is {{certainly}} a unique system. It gives the same function as the analog system which has been widely used throughout our life and the innovation of digital appliances has given great impact in our work system. Therefore in this project, a model of an Adjustable <b>Speed</b> Limit Digital <b>Speedometer</b> with <b>Speed</b> Alarm is developed in the laboratory using a PIC microcontroller which will be equipped with a 12 -buttons keypad, a two dual digits 7 -segment display and also a buzzer.

In the end of the project, the built model of an Adjustable <b>Speed</b> Limit Digital <b>Speedometer</b> with <b>Speed</b> Alarm will able to display the actual running speed of the vehicle in km/h reading and also the desired speed limit entered by the user in digital mode while the secondary purpose is to have an adjustable speed limit controller as an input for the setting of the speed limit together with a speed alarm that buzzes continuously when the speed limit being set is exceeded by the current running vehicle speed...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{literature}} {{does not}} draw conclusions {{as to which}} speedometer type is better for truck driving. A digital speedometer would be more beneficial when obtaining absolute and relative readings, while an analogue speedometer would be more efficient and less distracting when detecting dynamic <b>speed</b> changes. Redundant <b>speedometers,</b> which simultaneously present digital and analogue speedometers, appear increasingly in vehicles, but no information is available on their ergonomic qualities. This study compared three speedometers: digital speedometers, analogue speedometers, and redundant speedometers. This study compared the efficiency, usability and visual distraction measures for all three types of speedometers in a simulated truck driving setting. The task-dependant results were confirmed for the digital and analogue speedometer. The redundant speedometer combined the benefits of each type presented separately, which highlights interesting theoretical and applied implications...|$|R
30|$|In this investigation, it {{is shown}} {{that when a}} highway vehicle is driven at a {{constant}} speed on a level road, what actually determines its fuel economy is the airspeed of the vehicle rather than its ground <b>speed</b> or its <b>speedometer</b> reading. A theoretical model is then developed {{for the first time}} that describes the fuel economy of a highway vehicle as a function of its airspeed. The functional form of this model turns out to be in good correlation with the experimental data that have been collected by the authors over the last 2 years. Finally, the concept of parallel corridors is introduced and a design for highway construction is suggested that can significantly improve fuel economy of vehicles where traffic is heavy, by establishing a controlled driving environment. The results of this investigation apply to any vehicle using any source of energy.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAcoustic {{feedback}} {{inside a}} car is composed of different sources, which give information on the drivers actions and the dynamic state of the car. This acoustic feedback influences the drivers perception of movement in a multisensory integration. The development of electric motorizations brings new balance between noise sources inside the car, due {{to the loss of}} engine sound that is present in traditional internal combustion engine cars. To study the influence of this modified noise source balance on driving, we focused on speed perception. A car simulator was used for this purpose. 24 participants were asked to accelerate up to a given target <b>speed,</b> while the <b>speedometer</b> was hidden. We studied the speed they actually reached with three acoustic feedbacks (engine, electric motor, no sound), in two visual conditions (night and day). We found out that acoustic feedback can alter the drivers speed perception...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{investigated}} the effects of drivers' age and low light on speed, lane keeping, and visual recognition of typical roadway stimuli. BACKGROUND: Poor visibility, which is exacerbated by age-related changes in vision, is a leading contributor to fatal nighttime crashes. There is little evidence, however, concerning {{the extent to which}} drivers recognize and compensate for their visual limitations at night. METHOD: Young, middle-aged, and elder participants drove on a closed road course in day and night conditions at a "comfortable" <b>speed</b> without <b>speedometer</b> information. During night tests, headlight intensity was varied over a range of 1. 5 log units using neutral density filters. RESULTS: Average speed and recognition of road signs decreased significantly as functions of increased age and reduced illumination. Recognition of pedestrians at night was significantly enhanced by retroreflective markings of limb joints as compared with markings of the torso, and this benefit was greater for middle-aged and elder drivers. Lane keeping showed nonlinear effects of lighting, which interacted with task conditions and drivers' lateral bias, indicating that older drivers drove more cautiously in low light. CONCLUSION: Consistent with the hypothesis that drivers misjudge their visual abilities at night, participants of all age groups failed to compensate fully for diminished visual recognition abilities in low light, although older drivers behaved more cautiously than the younger groups. APPLICATION: These findings highlight the importance of educating all road users about the limitations of night vision and provide new evidence that retroreflective markings of the limbs can be of great benefit to pedestrians' safety at night...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} demonstrated, using {{abstract}} psychophysical stimuli, that speeds appear slower when contrast is reduced under certain conditions. Does this effect {{have any real}} life consequences? One previous study has found, using a low fidelity driving simulator, that participants perceived vehicle speeds to be slower in foggy conditions. We replicated this finding with a more realistic video-based simulator using the Method of Constant Stimuli. We also found that lowering contrast reduced participants’ ability to discriminate speeds. We argue that these reduced contrast effects could partly explain the higher crash rate of drivers with cataracts (this is a substantial societal problem and the crash relationship variance can {{be accounted for by}} reduced contrast). Note that even if people with cataracts can calibrate for the shift in their perception of <b>speed</b> using their <b>speedometers</b> (given that cataracts are experienced over long periods), they may still have an increased chance of making errors in speed estimation due to poor speed discrimination. This could result in individuals misjudging vehicle trajectories and thereby inflating their crash risk. We propose interventions that may help address this problem...|$|R
5000|$|The Authorities variant {{is based}} on the {{standard}} R1200RT, but can be recognized by the addition of stainless steel protection bars (colloquially known as [...] "crash bars") situated about the front fairing and panniers, also often used for mounting of additional equipment such as sirens. Paint and trim schemes also reflect the service use, most often black and white [...] "panda paint," [...] such as found on many patrol cars. The large, flat side panels on the R1200RT-P are a convenient and easily seen location for insignia.Other changes include unique top-loading panniers (also known as [...] "saddleboxes"), a single seat (with radio box in place of the RT's pillion seat), additional switch gear for equipment, emergency lighting, and an additional auxiliary battery which feeds all public safety electrical equipment. An additional feature of the RT-P is the reprogramming of the onboard computer to allow a motor officer to lock in their current <b>speed</b> on the <b>speedometer</b> display. The officer only needs to match speed with a target vehicle, press the [...] "BC" [...] button on the handlebars, and the speed is visible for later reference.|$|R
40|$|There is much {{interest}} today {{in identifying the}} right metrics to help focus investments and strategy implementation. Metrus {{has been involved in}} the design, implementation and benchmarking of these metrics for nearly 20 years. During that time, we have discovered many myths as well as some key ingredients in the design and use of HR metrics that are the subject of this paper. What are HR Metrics? First metrics are often confused with measures. We find that it is best to refer to “measures ” as {{the way in which we}} hope to quantify a particular concept, such as employee engagement or talent loss. It requires a clear operational definition, a method of calculating a quantitative number, and some related information (baseline, targets) that help frame the number. In contrast, we prefer to use metric to refer to the actual reading on the measure at a given time. For example, your automobile has a <b>speed</b> measure (a <b>speedometer</b> with a precise way in which speed is calculated; it might even have hash marks at certain limits, such as national speed limits). However, the metric might be your current velocity in miles per hour. Second, a measure is only a representation of reality. That is, a measure is a way of capturing...|$|R
40|$|Optic flow {{affects the}} walking speed during human pedal locomotion: when the ground texture is {{moved in a}} {{direction}} opposite to the walking direction, people slow down despite noticeable changes in their physical effort. We hypothesized that in driving conditions, where no direct matching between physical effort and produced speed exists, {{the role of the}} optic flow should be even more pronounced. Similarly, fog is supposed to reduce the perceived driving speed, by a reduction of the contrast of the visual scene. This, subsequently, should lead to a speeding during fog [1]. We aimed to replicate these results using a large field-of-view, a real road trajectory and a realistic exponential fog model. We used a driving simulation which was back-projected on a large fronto-parallel projection screen (75 x 70 degrees). Participants were trained to learn the relation between current driving <b>speed</b> (digital <b>speedometer)</b> and amount of optic flow in the image plane. In the experimental phase, we varied environmental condition (clear vs. foggy scene), speed signal (40, 60, and 90 km/h), and road texture motion. By adding motion to the road texture, the apparent driving speed was increased to 150 or reduced to 67 of the actual driving speed with regard {{to the rest of the}} environment. After the beginning of the trial, a speed signal indicated the required speed. The participants were instructed to accelerate up to this speed, keep it for five seconds, and terminate the trial by button press. The average speed of the last five seconds of each trial was included into the analysis. We found a significant effect of the motion of the road texture on the produced driving speed. As expected, participants increased the driving speed when the texture motion indicated a slower speed and vice versa. We observed also a significant fog effect which is in opposition to the previous results: when contrast was attenuated by fog the driving speed was reduced. Our study raises serious doubts about the previous interpretation of the relation among contrast reduction, perceived speed and driving behavior. In a realistic driving scenario, fog does not directly lead to speeding. However, the large effect of texture motion, suggests that the optic flow, especially originating from the road ahead, clearly determines the perception of the driving speed, even in foggy conditions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of an initial survey of the research literature in driving simulation and, specifically {{about the influence of}} visual fidelity on driving performance and behaviour. The main section comprises the preparation, execution, and analysis of an experiment with the Green Dino fixed-base driving simulator within the 3 mE faculty at TU Delft. This experiment evaluated three levels of visual fidelity: (1) a realistic high level, (2) a medium level with colours and horizon, but without textures and objects, and (3) a low level like the medium one but without colours and without horizon. Participants drove along a rural road without <b>speedometer.</b> <b>Speed</b> and driving performance data was collected along with eye tracking information. A within-subject statistical analysis was performed to determine the differences and resemblances between the visual levels and further conclusions are drawn with assessment provided by the eye tracking data. Results showed small but significant differences in all the driving behaviour and performance measures between the highest level and the two lower ones. However, no differences were found for those measures between the medium and low levels, suggesting that decreasing the optical flow or removing the textures has a stronger influence on driving behaviour and performance than removing the colours and the horizon. Focusing on specific measures, the steering activity was higher, as well as the lane keeping precision, in the high level than in the medium and low ones. Driving speed was slower in the medium and low levels than in the high one. Drivers tended to look lower as fidelity level decreased and, since the high visual fidelity level had roadside objects and textures, the gaze variance was larger in that level...|$|R
