40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the corticosteroid response to a <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor</b> varied {{in proportion to the}} concentration of effluent in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) captured downstream of 10 wastewater treatment works (WWTW). However, at 9 sites with no upstream WWTW input inter-population variation in the reactivity of the stress axis occurred across a similar range to that seen for fish at impacted sites, suggesting that the factor(s) responsible for modulating stress responsiveness in sticklebacks are not unique to sites receiving WWTW effluent. Physicochemical data from a long-term monitoring programme were employed to investigate whether variation in water quality contributed to between-site variation in stress axis reactivity. Between-site variation in fourteen water quality determinands explained between 30 % and 60 % of the variation in stress reactivity, and fish size, for sticklebacks at both WWTW-contaminated and uncontaminated sites. At uncontaminated sites the mean mass and length of sticklebacks increased with total oxidised N concentration (as an indicator of anthropogenic input) whereas at WWTW-contaminated sites fish size decreased with increasing effluent concentration, suggesting that factors adversely affecting growth were present predominantly at WWTW-contaminated sites. In contrast, at contaminated and uncontaminated sites the {{magnitude of}} the corticosteroid response to a <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor</b> increased with anthropogenic input (effluent concentration or total oxidised N respectively), indicating that factor(s) modulating the reactivity of the stress axis may be present at both WWTW-contaminated and uncontaminated sites...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} behaviour {{responses in}} yolk sac fry originating from strains selected for high (HR) or low (LR) plasma cortisol {{response to a}} <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor.</b> The results shows that yolk sac larvae originating from the HR strain is more sensitive to environmental stressors, in that they showed a shorter reaction time to low oxygen levels. Previous studies on adult and juvenile individuals from these strains have demonstrated a number of correlated physiological and behavioural differences. In yolk sac larvae growth and development depend mainly on internal factors, which suggest {{that at least some}} aspects of stress coping styles are inherent to the individual, before factors such as exposure to social experience or variable access to food resources could modify behavioural strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of six species of freshwater fish, from the families Cyprinidae (common carp Cyprinus carpio; roach Rutilus rutilus; chub Leuciscus cephalus) and Salmonidae (rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss; brown trout Salmo trutta; Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus), to a <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor</b> was evaluated. A six hour period of confinement resulted in changes to plasma cortisol, glucose, amino acid and lactate levels compared to unconfined controls. There {{were significant differences}} in the response profiles both within and between families. The cyprinid species exhibited higher and more sustained stress-induced increases in plasma cortisol and glucose than the salmonid species. In cyprinids plasma lactate and plasma amino acid concentration showed less disturbance following stress than in salmonids. The results of the study, together with an evaluation of previously published data for eight salmonid species and six cyprinid species support the hypothesis that differences in core elements of the stress response exist between species of fish, and that this variation may have a systematic basis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Better {{indicators}} {{are needed for}} identifying children with early signs of developmental psychopathology. Aims: To identify measures of autonomic nervous system reactivity that discriminate children with internalising and externalising behavioural symptoms. Method: Across-sectional study of 122 children aged 6 - 7 years examined sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity to <b>standardised</b> field-laboratory <b>stressors</b> as predictors of parent- and teacher-reported mental health symptoms. Results: Measures of autonomic reactivity discriminated between children with internalising behaviour problems, externalising behaviour problems and neither. Internalisers showed high reactivity relative to low-symptom children, principally in the parasympathetic branch, while externalisers showed low reactivity, in both autonomic branches. Conclusions: School-age children with mental health symptoms showed a pattern of autonomic dimorphism in their reactivity to standardised challenges. This observation may be of use in early identification of children with presyndromal psychopathology...|$|R
40|$|Two {{lines of}} rainbow trout {{selected}} for high (HR) and low (LR) responsiveness to a <b>standardised</b> confinement <b>stressor</b> displayed a sustained divergence in plasma cortisol levels during a 3 h period of confinement (max. : HR: 167 ± 13 ng ml- 1; LR: 103 ± 8 ng ml- 1; P < 0. 001). However, {{no significant difference}} in plasma ACTH levels was evident (max: HR: 153 ± 9 pg ml- 1; LR: 142 ± 7 pg ml- 1). Dexamethasone (DEX) was administered to HR and LR fish to block endogenous adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) release. Administration of a weight-adjusted dose of ACTH to the DEX-blocked fish elevated plasma cortisol levels to a significantly greater extent in HR (233 ± 24 ng ml- 1) than LR (122 ± 14 ng ml- 1) fish (P < 0. 001). Plasma cortisol levels in DEX-blocked HR and LR fish after sham injection were low but also significantly different (HR: 6. 7 ± 1 ng ml- 1; LR: 2. 2 ± 0. 2 ng ml- 1; P < 0. 001). These results indicate that modulation of cortisol responsiveness to stressors in HR and LR fish resides, at least in part, downstream of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis...|$|R

However, little is known about how parenting quality impacts the association between maternal prenatal anxiety and stress reactivity in human infants. This prospective study examined the impact of prenatal anxiety disorder and maternal caregiving sensitivity on infants’ responses to a <b>standardised</b> interactive <b>stressor</b> (still-face procedure). Eighty-four women completed a clinical interview during pregnancy to assess anxiety symptoms meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. At infant age 7 months, maternal sensitivity to infant distress and infant negative affect were observed and coded during the still-face procedure. Maternal postnatal (concurrent) anxiety and depression were also assessed at this time. Results indicated a negative association between maternal sensitivity to infant distress and infant negative affect responses to the still-face procedure. An unexpected finding was a positive association between parity and infant reactivity. The main effect for sensitivity was qualified by a significant interaction, p <. 05, suggesting that the impact of sensitivity was particularly marked among infants of women who experienced an anxiety disorder during pregnancy. This finding is consistent with a cumulative risk model suggesting that maternal prenatal anxiety and quality of maternal care act in concert to shape infant outcomes. 10 page(s...|$|R

We examine the evidence that, in humans, these effects are apparent from infancy. We systematically reviewed published findings on cortisol response to a stressor, in 0 - 5 -year-olds already exposed to adversity. Adversity {{was defined as a}} negative environmental influence present post-conception. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950 -May 2010), EMBASE (1980 -May 2010) and PsychINFO (1806 -May 2010).

Six of these demonstrated an effect of prenatal substance exposure. Thirteen studies found that psychosocial adversity increased cortisol reactivity. Three studies reported that cortisol reactivity could be normalised by intervention programmes. The studies were heterogeneous, both in nature of adversity studied and in stressor used, precluding meta-analysis and assessment of publication bias. Our review presents evidence that adversity disrupts the stress response from an early age.

Controls (stressed and undisturbed) received the same feed but without any supplementary TRP. Stress resulted in a significant elevation of plasma [cortisol] in fish fed control feed and in fish fed TRP-supplemented feed for 3 and 28 days. However, fish fed TRPsupplemented feed for 7 days did not show any significant elevation of plasma [cortisol] in response to stress. Plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin followed the same general pattern as cortisol. Plasma and brain [TRP] were elevated in fish fed TRP-supplemented feed. The amino acid TRP is the precursor of the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) and the brain 5 - HT system {{is known to be}} involved in the control of the hypothalamic–pituitary–interrenal (HPI) axis. Fish fed TRP-supplemented feed showed elevated levels of 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA, a major 5 -HT metabolite) in the hypothalamus and optic tectum. However, TRP treatment did not appear to result in any effects on brain dopaminergic activity and the effects on brain norepinephric activity do not support a role of norepinephrine in mediating the effects of TRP on HPI axis reactivity in rainbow trout...|$|E
40|$|The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA/I) axis plays a {{key role}} in {{responding}} to biotic and abiotic challenges in all vertebrates. Recent studies have shown that the apical response of the HPI axis to stressors in three-spined sticklebacks varies in proportion to the concentration of wastewater treatment works (WWTW) effluent to which the fish are exposed. This study was conducted to determine whether between-site variation in stress responsiveness among WWTW effluent-exposed sticklebacks is persistent or reversible. Sticklebacks from eight sites in north-west England affected by WWTW effluent and exhibiting between-population variation in HPI axis reactivity, were moved to a clean-water aquarium environment. After five months in the contaminant-free environment the responsiveness of these fish to a <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor</b> was determined, by measuring the rate of stress-induced cortisol release across the gills, and compared with the responses of fish newly sampled from the eight original capture sites. Inter-site differences in the reactivity of the HPI axis, proportional to the effluent concentration at each site, persisted among the translocated female sticklebacks for at least 5 months. In male fish however, the direct relationship between stress responsiveness and site-specific effluent was not evident 5 months post-translocation. These results support previous observations that the HPA/I axis, a non-reproductive endocrine system, is vulnerable to modulation by anthropogenic factors in fish and show for the first time that, in female fish at least, this modulation is not transient. The mechanisms underlying these observations, and the implications for the fitness and resilience of affected populations, requires investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the early intrauterine {{environment}} to program fetal neurodevelopment has been documented in several species, and {{there is evidence to}} suggest that a similar process may occur in humans. Glucocorticoids are the primary candidates for fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) programming, but testosterone and DHEAS may also be involved. This thesis examines the relationship between these amniotic fluid honnones, particularly in the context of prenatal stress. Human studies lack the precision of animal experimental paradigms, and most stress protocols in humans have involved laboratory <b>stressors</b> poorly <b>standardised</b> for duration and nature of exposure. I aimed to use a <b>standardised</b> clinical <b>stressor</b> to examine the endocrine response in maternal plasma and amniotic fluid. I hypothesised that amniocentesis in a clinical setting elicits a maternal stress response associated with alterations in amniotic fluid steroidal hormones. I found amniocentesis to be associated with raised Spielberger state anxiety scores, validating the use of this procedure as a clinical model of psychological stress. Despite high state scores, only a modest rise of maternal cortisol (variance of 4 %) was noted suggesting the response of an attenuated maternal HPA axis. I observed a positive correlation between maternal plasma cortisol and amniotic fluid cortisol that increased with gestational age. The magnitude of the correlation between maternal and amniotic fluid cortisol increased markedly with maternal state anxiety. A significant, positive correlation was observed between amniotic fluid cortisol and amniotic fluid testosterone. Amniotic fluid DHEAS correlated negatively with state anxiety scores but positively with maternal cortisol. This thesis characterises the relationships between the steroidal hormones cortisol, testosterone and DHEAS in amniotic fluid and in maternal plasma, especially in the context of prenatal stress generated by imminence of amniocentesis. The observations of a positive correlation between maternal and amniotic fluid cortisols, the magnitude increasing with gestation and maternal state anxiety scores, together with positive correlations between amniotic fluid cortisol and testosterone suggest more then one mechanism by which prenatal stress may influence fetal development.

40|$|Identifying {{correlates}} of children’s emotional reactions {{and ways of}} coping can provide important information about developmental processes and help to identify useful strategies for improving children's adaptive responses to stress. We investigated associations of children’s social competence with their responses {{to a set of}} <b>standardised,</b> controllable interpersonal <b>stressors.</b> The stressors included bullying, arguing with a parent and not being picked for a team sport. We expected greater social competence to be associated with certain coping responses, and expected that coping would be better explained by also considering emotional reactions. Children (N = 230, grades 3 to 7) reacted to three videotaped stressors and children and parents completed questionnaires. Children rated as more competent used active and challenge coping strategies, such as problem-solving and support seeking, more than other children, and they also responded with more sadness. Children’s competence was associated with fear, but only in bivariate correlations, and was not associated with angry responses. In a structural equation model, emotions were associated with more coping responses, and the emotional reaction of sadness accounted for the link between children’s social competence and adaptive (i. e., challenge) coping. Findings suggest that competent children use more adaptive coping and this is accounted for by their greater feelings of sadness when dealing with controllable interpersonal stressors...|$|R
40|$|A purpose-designed {{microarray}} platform (Stressgenes, Phase 1) was utilised {{to investigate}} the changes in gene expression within the liver of rainbow trout during exposure to a prolonged period of confinement. Tissue and blood samples were collected from trout at intervals up to 648 h after transfer to a <b>standardised</b> confinement <b>stressor,</b> together with matched samples from undisturbed control fish. Plasma ACTH, cortisol, glucose and lactate were analysed {{to confirm that the}} neuroendocrine response to confinement was consistent with previous findings and to provide a phenotypic context to assist interpretation of gene expression data. Liver samples for suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) library construction were selected from within the experimental groups comprising “early” stress (2 – 48 h) and “late” stress (96 – 504 h). In order to reduce redundancy within the four SSH libraries and yield a higher number of unique clones an additional subtraction was carried out. After printing of the arrays a series of 55 hybridisations were executed to cover 6 time points. At 2 h, 6 h, 24 h, 168 h and 504 h 5 individual confined fish and 5 individual control fish were used with control fish only at 0 h. A preliminary list of 314 clones considered differentially regulated over the complete time course was generated by a combination of data analysis approaches and the most significant gene expression changes were found to occur during the 24 h to 168 h time period with a general approach to control levels by 504 h. Few changes in expression were apparent over the first 6 h. The list of genes whose expression was significantly altered comprised predominantly genes belonging to the biological process category (response to stimulus) and one cellular component category (extracellular region) and were dominated by so-called acute phase proteins. Analysis of the gene expression profile in liver tissue during confinement revealed a number of significant clusters. The major patterns comprised genes that were up-regulated at 24 h and beyond, the primary examples being haptoglobin, β-fibrinogen and EST 10729. Two representative genes from each of the six k-means clusters were validated by qPCR. Correlations between microarray and qPCR expression patterns were significant for most of the genes tested. qPCR analysis revealed that haptoglobin expression was up-regulated approximately 8 -fold at 24 h and over 13 -fold by 168 h...|$|R
40|$|Disruption of non-reproductive {{endocrine}} {{systems in}} wildlife by chemicals has received little attention but represents a potentially significant problem. Nitrate {{is a major}} anthropogenic contaminant in the freshwater aquatic environment and {{has been identified as}} a potential disrupter of endocrine function in aquatic animals. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between the function of the neuroendocrine stress axis in fish and inorganic N loading along reaches of rivers receiving cumulative point source and diffuse chemical inputs. To accomplish this, the responsiveness of the stress axis, quantified as the rate of release of cortisol to water across the gills during exposure to a <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor,</b> was measured in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) resident at three sites on each of four rivers in north-west England. The magnitude of the stress response in fish captured at the sites furthest downstream on all rivers was more than twice that of fish captured at upstream sites. Site-specific variation in stress axis reactivity was better explained by between-site variation in concentrations of dissolved nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia than by the concentration of wastewater treatment works effluent. An increase in the magnitude of the stress response was seen among sticklebacks at sites where long-term averaged concentrations of NH 3 -N, NO 3 -N and NO 2 -N exceeded 0. 6, 4. 0 and 0. 1 mg/L respectively. These data suggest that either (i) inorganic N is a better surrogate than wastewater effluent concentration for an unknown factor or factors affecting stress axis function in fish, or (ii) dissolved inorganic N directly exerts a disruptive influence on the function of the neuroendocrine stress axis in fish, supporting concerns that nitrate is an endocrine-modulating chemical...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the cortisol response to a <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor</b> is a heritable trait in salmonid fishes, and selection for stress responsiveness induces differences in both behaviour and neuroendocrine function. For instance, in laboratory studies, fish with a high cortisol response show a greater propensity for stress induced anorexia. Some authors have, however, commented that controlled studies encompassing relatively small groups of fish hold little or no relevance to practical aquaculture. This notion may be flawed, since understanding the mechanisms behind the behaviour of individuals is a proviso to predict behaviour in groups even with the caveat that some behaviors may be modified by group size. As an example, optimal feeding regimes should be easier to predict in a population consisting of individuals whose appetite is relatively less affected by external stressors. In a fluctuating and potentially stressful environment, such a population should also generate less feed waste, if kept on fixed rations. In the present experiment, we tested this hypothesis by monitoring feed waste and feed conversion efficiency in lines of rainbow trout selected for a low (LR) or high (HR) cortisol response to stress. The study was carried out after fish had been transported between rearing sites in the United Kingdom and Norway. There was significantly more feed waste from rearing units containing HR fish, and these fish also showed lower feed efficiency (growth per unit feed consumed). The difference in feed waste became more apparent with increasing time after transport, as rations increased. Simultaneously, size was more variable and growth was slower in HR rearing units. These results {{suggest that there are}} several potential benefits of selection for low stress responsiveness in aquaculture. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{indicators}} of reproductive performance were assessed in rainbow trout divergently selected {{on the basis}} of their plasma cortisol response to a <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor.</b> For both male and female rainbow trout, body weight was significantly related to stress responsiveness. High-responding (HR) females were significantly heavier than low-responding (LR) females overall and HR males were significantly heavier than LR males overall. There was no significant difference in the SGR of HR and LR female fish during the experimental period while in contrast the mean SGR of HR males was significantly greater than that of LR males. The divergent confinement-induced levels of blood cortisol in HR and LR groups were stable for more than one year after selection. There was no significant difference in the extent to which confinement stress reduced blood estradiol- 17  levels in HR and LR females despite the large difference in relative blood cortisol levels. The onset and rate of ovulation was similar within the HR and LR groups. Differences in fecundity, relative fecundity and egg volume and weight were wholly attributable to the different mean body weights of the HR and LR fish. There was no difference between the sperm counts of HR and LR males. There was significantly higher mortality among eggs derived from HR parents overall between fertilization and hatch but maximum mean mortality did not exceed 12 %. Mean time to eyeing in the HR groups was 224 degree days and in the LR groups was 244 degree days. Hatching commenced at 344 and 347 degree days in the HR and LR groups respectively and was complete within 412 and 416 degree days respectively. Overall, selection for stress responsiveness was associated with no significant benefits or costs in reproductive performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{a variety}} of {{vertebrate}} species, early life environmental cues are important drivers of an individual’s phenotypic trajectories, priming physiological pathways, with consequences for growth, reproductive-related traits and lifespan. These phenotypic responses {{are believed to be}} adaptive in the short-term, but may impinge on health and survival over the long-term. Much of the work in this field has focused on the potential constraints imposed on animals after exposure to early life adversities, including nutritional deficit, sibling competition, and high predator pressure. Such stressful experiences can result in direct, but also indirect (via the maternal route) increases in the exposure to glucocorticoid stress hormones in the developing individuals. Glucocorticoids, whose production and secretion is regulated by the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis (HPA axis), have been hypothesised to be the main candidates mediating the programming effects of developmental stress. Earlier predictions based on this assumption came from studies conducted in mammals. In mammals it is particularly difficult to manipulate exposure to circulating hormones in developing individuals because of the physiological intimacy between mother and offspring via the placenta and lactation. Here, I circumvent this complicating factor by using the precocial Japanese quail as a study species. In chapter 2 I measure corticosterone (B, the main avian glucocorticoid) stress responses to a <b>standardised</b> environmental <b>stressor</b> in growing quail aged 8 - and 16 -days-old. The results are consistent with those previously reported in other precocial birds, showing that the magnitude of the stress response (i. e. peak B within 30 min period) is higher in the 8 - than the 16 -day-old hatchlings. I find no differences in baseline B concentrations between the two groups. I then describe the main experiment in which I elevate B concentrations in ovo and/or in the endogenous circulation of the hatchlings (oral B administration from day 5 to day 19 post-hatching) in order to obtain four distinct phenotypes: pre-hatching B-treated birds, post-hatching B-treated birds, both pre- and post-hatching B-treated birds, and controls. I examine the specific and combined effects of pre- and post-hatching B on (1) growth trajectories and physiological stress responses before sexual maturity (post-hatch day 22) and upon adulthood (post-hatch day 64); (2) adult gene expression patterns within the hippocampus and hypothalamus, and (3) oxidative stress in the blood and the brain in the adults. The main results of Chapter 3 show that post-hatching B, regardless of pre-hatching experiences, decrease HPA axis responsiveness in the juveniles, but only in the female quail; whilst pre-hatching stress, when not combined with post-hatching B, increase HPA responsiveness in both sexes upon adulthood. I also show that both pre- and post-hatching B induce short-term alterations in triglyceride basal concentrations, which are linked with the sex and basal glucose concentrations of the birds; the effects of pre-hatching B exposure were visible also upon adulthood with sex-specific alterations on basal glucose concentrations. Overall these results suggest that early life stress can trigger both transient and permanent physiological changes, depending on the sex and the quality of both the pre- and post-hatching environment. In Chapter 4 I show that the gene expression responses to pre- and post-hatching B are overall subtle, results similar to those reported in previous genomic studies that have manipulated early life rearing environments. The effects are, however, distinguishable, strongly tissue-specific and involve well characterised key candidate genes in the regulation of the HPA axis. These data also suggest important novel regulatory mechanisms, likely linked with cellular redox state, which may be driving the long-term effects of developmental stress. Finally, in chapter 5, I show that developmental B induces alterations in the basal antioxidant defences upon adulthood. The magnitude of these effects, once more, depends upon the timing of exposure, interactions between the pre- and post-hatching B and the tissue examined. As there are no differences in terminal oxidative damage, these results suggest that the B-treated birds could avoid oxidative stress via altering body oxidative defences. In summary, my findings throughout this thesis, illustrate the complexity of glucocorticoid programming and the importance of integrating analyses at multiple levels, from physiology to genome-wide investigations. The results of this thesis also strengthen the importance of examining the effects of early life stress over differing life stages in order to consider the overall balance of costs and benefits that may ultimately affect Darwinian fitness and survival...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate whether exposure to wastewater treatment works (WWTW) effluent affects the adaptive stress axis of fish resident within the receiving water. Three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were sampled from sites downstream of ten WWTWs in north-west England, selected to provide a range of population equivalents between 1, 000 and 120, 000. Following capture, indices of stress (whole-body cortisol and glucose concentrations) were measured both prior to, and following, a <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor</b> to establish both baseline and stress-induced cortisol and glucose concentrations. There was considerable between-site variation in size, {{and to a lesser extent}} condition, of the fish. Pre- and post-stress cortisol and glucose concentrations also exhibited significant between-site variation. A large proportion of the variation in both somatic characters and stress response was explained by variation in the proportion of effluent contributing to total river flow at the study sites. Mass (r 2 = 0. 35, P < 0. 001) and length (r 2 = 0. 37, P < 0. 001) of the fish, and cortisol (r 2 = 0. 26, P < 0. 001) and glucose (r 2 = 0. 12, P < 0. 01) concentrations in unstressed sticklebacks, were positively related to the concentration of effluent across the sample sites. However, in stressed fish cortisol (r 2 = 0. 32, P < 0. 001) and glucose (r 2 = 0. 14, P < 0. 001) concentrations exhibited a negative trend in relation to the effluent concentrations across sites. Individual variation in fish size did not account for the variation in either cortisol or glucose levels. These data are the first in which the activity and responsiveness of the stress axis has been compared across multiple populations of fish and provide the first indication that modulation of the stress axis in fish by anthropogenic factors might be a widespread phenomenon and therefore of greater significance than hitherto assumed...|$|E

Ultradian rhythms in the concentration of plasma cortisol were observed resulting from the episodic secretion of cortisol from the adrenal cortex at a mean rate of 0. 8 pulses/h. Circadian rhythms in plasma cortisol concentrations were also found in 11 out of the 20 complete 24 h profiles (mean amplitude, 3. 8 +/- 1. 4 ng/ml). Seasonal rhythms in mean 24 h plasma cortisol concentrations and cortisol pulse parameters were also observed. Mean 24 h plasma cortisol concentrations were higher in November (12. 5 +/- 1. 0 ng/ml) than in February (6. 3 +/- 1. 0 ng/ml), April (4. 0 +/- 1. 0 ng/ml) or July (4. 2 +/- 1. 0 ng/ml). Cortisol pulse height, nadir and amplitude were all significantly higher in November than at other {{times of the year}} (P< 0. 01). Peak cortisol concentrations following infusion of ACTH(1 - 24) (0. 04 IU kg(- 1)) were higher (P< 0. 05) in November (55. 8 +/- 2. 7 ng/ml) and lower (P< 0. 001) in April (33. 7 +/- 1. 8 ng/ml) than those in February and July (48. 7 +/- 2. 0 ng/ml and 45. 4 +/- 2. 0 ng/ml respectively). The area under the cortisol response curve was significantly smaller (P< 0. 05) in April (266. 6 +/- 15. 3 ng/ml/ 190 min) than at other times of the year (February, 366. 1 +/- 15. 3 ng/ml/ 190 min; July, 340. 7 +/- 15. 3 ng/ml/ 190 min and November, 387. 8 +/- 21. 2 ng/ml/ 190 min). These data demonstrate that the adrenal gland of the red deer stag exhibits ultradian, circadian and seasonal rhythms in activity, and that its responsiveness to ACTH varies with season. November, a period of reproductive quiescence in the southern hemisphere, with new antler growth and rapid weight gain, is associated with higher mean plasma cortisol concentrations and a greater responsiveness to exogenous ACTH. In contrast, the breeding season is associated with lower adrenal activity and responsiveness...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{responses}} involve {{activation of}} the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the secretion of glucocorticoid hormones, and can help animals cope with changes in their environments. Corticosterone is the primary glucocorticoid in birds and has metabolic actions, and can affect behaviour and reproduction. Stimuli that activate the HPA axis are called stressors, and stressors can be classified as either physical or emotional. When animals respond to emotional stressors they also experience fear, and the magnitude of a corticosterone response to an emotional stressor {{is thought to be}} related to the degree of fearfulness that is experienced by a bird. The great majority of studies have measured plasma corticosterone responses of birds to emotional rather than physical stressors, and corticosterone responses to emotional stressors are assumed to reflect the responsiveness of the HPA axis of birds to stressors in general. The aims of the research described in this thesis were to determine the effects of corticosterone on fear behaviour, reproductive function, and plasma corticosterone responses to stressors in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), both during and after treatment, and to examine if plasma corticosterone responses to similar emotional stressors, and to different types of emotional and physical stressors are related in individual quail. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher in quail treated with corticosterone in their drinking water compared with controls during a 21 day treatment period, and concentrations remained elevated eight days after treatment ended. Corticosterone had little or no effect on the fearfulness of quail in tonic immobility, novel object or open field tests of fear behaviour. Body weight, food intake, egg production and egg weight were significantly lower in some corticosterone treatment groups than in controls during treatment and for up to 22 days after treatment ended. Corticosterone concentrations in quail were generally unaffected after 24 h of fasting, so the effects of elevated plasma corticosterone on corticosterone responses to a natural stressor in quail could not be determined. Corticosterone had marked effects on the physiology of quail for several weeks after treatment ended, suggesting that chronic elevations in plasma corticosterone resulting from climate change or human disturbance could have negative affects in birds even after exposure to a stressor ends. There were significant positive relationships between the magnitudes of plasma corticosterone responses to the emotional stressors of 15, 30 or 60 min handling followed by 45, 30 or 0 min confinement respectively in individual Japanese quail. Plasma corticosterone responses to 15 min handling followed by 45 min confinement are commonly measured in domesticated species of birds, and the findings of the present study suggest that magnitudes of responses to this <b>standardised</b> <b>stressor</b> may reflect the responsiveness of the HPA axis of birds to emotional stressors in general. Treatment with insulin and treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were shown to be physical stressors in quail, and doses and blood sampling times determined in insulin and LPS dose-response tests were used in a study of plasma corticosterone responses to emotional and physical stressors in quail. There were no relationships between corticosterone responses of individual birds subjected to emotional (handling) and physical (insulin and LPS) stressors, whereas there were significant correlations in responses of the birds to the two physical stressors. These results suggest that corticosterone responses of birds to standardised emotional stressors such as handling and confinement in domesticated species or capture and restraint in free-living species may not reflect the responsiveness of the HPA axis of birds to stressors in general. Given that quail displayed consistent individual differences in their plasma corticosterone responses to emotional stressors and to physical stressors, but magnitudes of corticosterone responses to both classes of stressor were unrelated in individual quail, these findings suggest that birds may possess at least two quite distinct stress responses to help them cope with changes in their environments...|$|E
