40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} library network {{function}} is so–called <b>shared</b> <b>cataloguing,</b> i. e. the exchange of bibliographic records on national and international level. In this paper we present a system for creating valid bibliographic records based on XML technology, {{as a basis for}} exchange of these records within default library network. To perform the exchange of XML bibliographic records it is necessary to ensure these records be valid against the adopted document type definition. The validation will be done against a schema written in XML Schema Language, based on the international standard for recording the bibliographic data in machinereadable cataloguing format – UNIMARC. The system for creating valid XML bibliographic records will be implemented in Java environment...|$|E

Co-operation can take place either at local, national or international level. In the past, we were able to observe close co-operation at the national level between libraries in similar disciplines (for instance, co-operation of groups of medical, technical and economics libraries). This form of co-operation has existed until today. Then, {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 ’s a new ‘configuration’ of library co-operation was initiated, that is, co-operation between libraries in various disciplines within one consortium aimed at choosing, purchasing and implementing the same integrated library system. The next step was co-operation undertaken within an inter-system consortium in order to fund a national union catalogue. This was an enormous enterprise, whose aim was to facilitate access to catalogue information on the collections of Polish research libraries and accelerate the process of cataloguing books.
