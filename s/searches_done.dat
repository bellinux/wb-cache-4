The main objective was to examine which treatment would give the best result {{in the case of}} an acute myocardial infarction, trombolysis or PCI, considering both mortality and morbidity. I also wanted to compare PCI to facilitated PCI and prehospital trombolysis. Methods: This project is based on <b>searches</b> <b>done</b> with the international medical search monitors Medline/Ovid and PubMed. Results: PCI seems to be superior to trombolytic treatment comparing mortality and morbidity in both short term and long term clinical outcome. Early start with prehospital trombolysis gives the same results as if the patient was taken directly to PCI. Primary PCI is better treatment than facilitated PCI...|$|E

Even with these problems, some scientists said that the data release was a service to the research community [47]. AOL was widely criticized in the blogosphere and in mainstream media, some individuals at AOL lost their jobs, and the company was the target of a class-action lawsuit.|$|E

Computer literacy is increasing, but many clinicians remain ill at ease with search strategies for online bibliographic databases. As part of an ongoing project to simplify the translation of clinical questions into effective searches, a Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus tool was designed. The authors compared bibliographic searches by relatively inexperienced users employing only GRATEFUL MED to <b>searches</b> <b>done</b> using GRATEFUL MED augmented with this tool. The users were clinicians examining questions related to a test set of clinical cases. Their problems and successes were monitored; the results suggest that the addition of a thesaurus helps resolve some problems in citation retrieval that trouble the novice user. By helping the user understand indexing terms in context and by reducing typing errors, a thesaurus can help provide an intelligent solution to lexical mismatches in bibliographic retrieval...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} the {{underlying}} IR problems encountered when dealing with the complex morphology and compound constructions found in the Hungarian language. It describes evaluations carried out on two general stemming strategies for this language, and also demonstrates that a light stemming approach could be quite effective. Based on <b>searches</b> <b>done</b> on the CLEF test collection, we find that a more aggressive suffix-stripping approach may produce better MAP. When compared to an IR scheme without stemming or one based on only a light stemmer, we find the differences to be statistically significant. When compared with probabilistic, vector-space and language models, {{we find that the}} Okapi model results in the best retrieval effectiveness. The resulting MAP is found to be about 35 % better than the classical tf idf approach, particularly for very short requests. Finally, we demonstrate that applying an automatic decompounding procedure for both queries and documents significantly improves IR performance (+ 10 %), compared to word-based indexing strategies. ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{original}} PageRank algorithm {{for improving the}} ranking of search-query results, a single PageRank vector is computed, using the link structure of the Web, to capture the relative "importance" of Web pages, independent of any particular search query. To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance {{with respect to a}} particular topic. By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For <b>searches</b> <b>done</b> in context (e. g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of {{the context in which the}} query appeared...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} method of management of Learning Objects Repositories (LORs). It looks at both the storage and search of learning objects (LOs) in the LORs. The focus is on how LORs can be structured {{in order to promote}} easier and more efficient search and thus furnishing users with relevant results. The model proposed defines a â€œneighbourhoodâ€, a concept achieved by grouping LOs by purpose (genre-classification) using metadata elements from IEEEâ€™s LOM. The elements chosen, which fall under the Educational and General groups, are Learning Resource Type and Keyword. This can then be put into a Knowledge base to enable users to get additional results based on <b>searches</b> <b>done</b> by previous users who requested similar objects. This involves the exploitation of similarities between users (including the user conducting the search) to suggest additional LOs that could be relevant. Two algorithms have been developed that use this model, one for searching and the other for insertion...|$|E
40|$|Two {{groups have}} {{recently}} discovered {{a statistically significant}} deviation in the fluxes of high-redshift type Ia supernovae from the predictions of a Friedmann model with zero cosmological constant. In this Letter, I argue that bright, dusty, starburst galaxies would preferentially eject a dust component with a shallower opacity curve (hence less reddening) and a higher opacity/mass than the observed galactic dust which is left behind. Such dust could cause the falloff in flux at high-z without violating constraints on reddening or metallicity. The specific model presented is of needle-like dust, which is expected from the theory {{of crystal growth and}} has been detected in samples of interstellar dust. Carbon needles with conservative properties can supply the necessary opacity, and would very likely be ejected from galaxies as required. The model is not subject to the arguments given in the literature against grey dust, but may be constrained by future data from supernova <b>searches</b> <b>done</b> at higher redshift, in clusters, or over a larger frequency range.
