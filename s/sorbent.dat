5|$|Zirconium binds urea, a {{property}} {{that has been}} utilized extensively {{to the benefit of}} patients with chronic kidney disease. For example, zirconium is a primary component of the <b>sorbent</b> column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the <b>sorbent</b> column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system. Also, developmental versions of a Wearable Artificial Kidney have incorporated sorbent-based technologies.|$|E

30|$|The intra-particle {{diffusion}} rate constants for modified <b>sorbents</b> were observed {{to be lower}} than those of unmodified <b>sorbents.</b> This implies that the diffusion of crude oil into the pores of modified <b>sorbents</b> was slower than its diffusion into the pores of unmodified <b>sorbents.</b> This may be due to reduction in the porosity of the <b>sorbents</b> after acetylation.|$|R
40|$|The {{desulfurization}} {{behavior of}} novel Fe and Fe–Mo <b>sorbents</b> supported using Chinese lignite chars for desulfurization of hot coal gases was investigated and compared. The desulfurization experiments {{were carried out}} using a fixed-bed quartz reactor over a temperature range of 673 K to 873 K in simulated coal gas containing 0. 47 % H₂S and 0. 047 % COS. The product gases composition and chemical phases of <b>sorbents</b> were analyzed using a gas chromatograph and X-ray diffractometer, respectively. The results show that iron and Fe–Mo <b>sorbents</b> supported on lignite char demonstrated high desulfurization efficiency under the present experimental conditions. The sulfur capacity of iron-based <b>sorbents</b> {{is determined by the}} amount of iron contained in the <b>sorbents</b> and the addition of Mo into the iron-based <b>sorbents</b> effectively improves the desulfurization efficiency of char-supported iron <b>sorbents...</b>|$|R
30|$|The <b>sorbents</b> were {{successfully}} modified {{and can also}} be used to remove crude oil from water. Acetylation enhances the crude oil sorption capacities of the <b>sorbents,</b> and the difference in the crude oil sorption capacities of the modified and unmodified <b>sorbents</b> is statistically significant.|$|R

25|$|Patiromer is a {{selective}} <b>sorbent</b> that is taken by mouth and works by binding free potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract and releasing calcium ions for exchange, thus lowering {{the amount of}} potassium available for absorption into the bloodstream and increasing the amount that is excreted via the feces. The net effect is a reduction of potassium levels in the blood serum.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to store}} {{natural gas is}} adsorbing it to the porous solids called sorbents. The best {{condition}} for methane storage is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The used pressure can be up to 4 MPa (about 40 times atmospheric pressure) for having more storage capacity. The most common <b>sorbent</b> used for ANG is activated carbon (AC). Three main types of activated carbons for ANG are: Activated Carbon Fiber (ACF), Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), activated carbon monolith.|$|E
40|$|A sol-gel {{granulation}} {{method was}} developed to prepare spherical {gamma}-alumina granular supports and supported CuO granular <b>sorbents</b> for flue gas desulfurization. The prepared {gamma}-alumina supported CuO <b>sorbents</b> exhibit desirable pore structure and excellent mechanical properties. The <b>sorbents</b> contain higher loading (30 - 40 wt. %) of CuO dispersed in the monolayer or sub-monolayer form, giving rise to a larger SO{sub 2 } sorption capacity ({gt} 20 wt. %) and a faster sorption rate as compared to similar <b>sorbents</b> reported in the literature. With these excellent sulfation and mechanical properties, the sol-gel derived {gamma}-alumina supported CuO granular <b>sorbents</b> offer great potential {{for use in the}} dry, regenerative flue gas desulfurization process. Research efforts were also made to prepare DAY zeolite supported <b>sorbents</b> with various CuO contents by the microwave and conventional thermal dispersion methods at different conditions. Monolayer or sub-monolayer coating of Cu(NO{sub 3 }) sub 2 or CuO was achieved on several DAY supported <b>sorbents</b> by the microwave heating method but not by the conventional thermal dispersion method. The DAY zeolite supported CuO <b>sorbents</b> prepared by the microwave heating method can adsorb up to 15 wt. % of SO{sub 2 }. The results obtained have demonstrated the feasibility of effective preparation of zeolite supported CuO <b>sorbents</b> by the microwave heating method...|$|R
40|$|Hot-gas {{desulfurization}} for {{the integrated}} gasification combined cycle (IGCC) {{process has been}} investigated by many researchers to remove effectively hydrogen sulfide with various metal oxide <b>sorbents</b> at high pressures and high temperatures. Metal oxides such as zinc titanate oxides, zinc ferrite oxide, copper oxide, manganese oxide and calcium oxide, {{were found to be}} promising <b>sorbents</b> in comparison with other removal methods such as membrane separations and reactive membrane separations. Removal reaction of H{sub 2 }S from coal gas mixtures with ZT- 4 or other promising <b>sorbents</b> of fine solid particles, and regeneration reaction of sulfur-loaded <b>sorbents</b> will be carried on in a batch reactor or a continuous differential reactor. The objectives of this research project are to find intrinsic initial reaction kinetics for the metal oxide-hydrogen sulfide heterogeneous reaction system, to obtain effects of concentrations of coal gas components such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen and moisture on equilibrium reaction rate constants of the reaction system at various reaction temperatures and pressures, to identify regeneration kinetics of sulfur-loaded metal oxide <b>sorbents,</b> and to formulate promising metal oxide <b>sorbents</b> for the removal of sulfur from coal gas mixtures. Promising durable metal oxide <b>sorbents</b> of high-sulfur-absorbing capacity will be formulated by mixing active metal oxide powders with inert metal oxide powders and calcining these powder mixtures, or impregnating active metal oxide <b>sorbents</b> on supporting metal oxide matrixes. The Research Triangle Institute, a sub-contractor of this research project, will also prepare promising metal oxide <b>sorbents</b> for this research project, plan experiments on removal of sulfur compounds from coal gases with metal oxide <b>sorbents</b> as well as regeneration of sulfur-loaded metal oxide <b>sorbents,</b> and review experimental results...|$|R

25|$|Normal–phase {{chromatography}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of HPLC that chemists developed. Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) this method separates analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica, hence it is based on analyte ability to engage in polar interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole type of interactions) with the <b>sorbent</b> surface. NP-HPLC uses a non-polar, non-aqueous mobile phase (e.g. Chloroform), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in non-polar solvents. The analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased analyte polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (separate) structural isomers.|$|E
2500|$|Many [...] {{different}} types of columns are available, filled with adsorbents varying in particle size, and {{in the nature of}} their surface ("surface chemistry"). The use of smaller particle size packing materials requires the use of higher operational pressure ("backpressure") and typically improves chromatographic resolution (i.e. the degree of separation between consecutive analytes emerging from the column). <b>Sorbent</b> particles may be hydrophobic or polar in nature.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{studies have}} shown that the {{mobility}} of TNT degradation products is likely to be lower “than TNT in subsurface environments where specific adsorption to clay minerals dominates the sorption process.” [...] Thus, the mobility of TNT and its transformation products are dependent on the characteristics of the <b>sorbent.</b> The mobility of TNT in groundwater and soil has been extrapolated from “sorption and desorption isotherm models determined with humic acids, in aquifer sediments, and soils”. [...] From these models, it is predicted that TNT has a low retention and transports readily in the environment.|$|E
40|$|Research {{activities}} and efforts {{of this research}} project were concentrated on formulating various metal oxide <b>sorbents</b> with various additives under various formulation conditions, conducting experiments on initial reactivity of formulated <b>sorbents</b> with hydrogen sulfide, and testing hardness of formulated <b>sorbents.</b> Experiments on reactivity of formulated metal oxide <b>sorbents</b> with wet hydrogen sulfide contained in a simulated coal gas mixture were carried out for 120 seconds at 550 o C (see Table 1) to evaluate reactivity of formulated <b>sorbents</b> with hydrogen sulfide. Hardness of formulated <b>sorbents</b> was evaluated {{in addition to testing}} their reactivity with hydrogen sulfide. A typical simulated coal gas mixture consists of 9107 -ppm hydrogen sulfide (0. 005 g; 1 wt %), 0. 085 -g water (15. 84 wt %), 0. 0029 -g hydrogen (0. 58 wt %), and 0. 4046 -g nitrogen (81. 34 wt%) ...|$|R
30|$|The newly {{designed}} chemically and/or biologically hybrid activated carbon (AC) <b>sorbents</b> were synthesized as effective <b>sorbents</b> for heavy metals contaminated water in El Mex bay. These <b>sorbents</b> and biosorbents were successfully applied in removing cadmium, lead, chromium and mercury by dynamic micro-column technique. The chemical treatments of commercial active carbon via simple acid, base, oxidation and reduction reactions {{were found to}} improve the recovery efficiency of the chemically hybrid AC <b>sorbents</b> for the studied metals than AC blank in all case, this recovery efficiency give excellent values with addition of baker’s yeast to all hybrid AC <b>sorbents</b> especially after 2 nd run of micro-column.

2500|$|HPLC is {{distinguished}} from traditional ("low pressure") liquid chromatography because operational pressures are significantly higher (50–350 bar), while ordinary liquid chromatography typically {{relies on the}} force of gravity to pass the mobile phase through the column. Due to the small sample amount separated in analytical HPLC, typical column dimensions are 2.1–4.6mm diameter, and 30–250mm length. [...] Also HPLC columns are made with smaller <b>sorbent</b> particles (2–50 μm in average particle size). [...] This gives HPLC superior resolving power (the ability to distinguish between compounds) when separating mixtures, which makes it a popular chromatographic technique.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF through {{physisorption}} or chemisorption {{based on}} the porosity and selectivity of the MOF leaving behind a Greenhouse gas poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly. The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) so the MOF can be reused. Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the [...] {{is removed from the}} <b>sorbent</b> or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the <b>sorbent</b> or solution to be reused. Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing , have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water. Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step. Thus, to optimize a MOF for carbon capture, low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired. Additionally, high working capacity and high selectivity are desirable in order to capture as much [...] as possible from the flue gas. However, there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure. As the amount of [...] captured increases, the energy, and therefore cost, required to regenerate increases. A large drawback of using MOFs for CCS is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability. Current research is looking to optimize MOF properties for CCS, but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable MOF. Metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of MOFs.|$|E
2500|$|The use of more polar {{solvents}} in {{the mobile}} phase will decrease the retention time of analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to induce slower elution (increased retention times). Very polar solvents such as traces {{of water in}} the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the solid surface of the stationary phase forming a stationary bound (water) layer which is considered to play an active role in retention. [...] This behavior is somewhat peculiar to normal phase chromatography because it is governed almost exclusively by an adsorptive mechanism (i.e. analytes interact with a solid surface rather than with the solvated layer of a ligand attached to the <b>sorbent</b> surface; see also reversed-phase HPLC below). Adsorption chromatography is still widely used for structural isomer separations in both column and thin-layer chromatography formats on activated (dried) silica or alumina supports.|$|E
40|$|The efforts {{dedicated}} to improving water decontamination procedures have prompted {{the interest in}} the development of efficient, inexpensive, and reusable <b>sorbents</b> for the uptake of dye pollutants. In this work, novel <b>sorbents</b> consisting of carrageenan polysaccharides grafted to magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared kappa- and iota-carrageenan were first chemically modified by carboxymethylation and then covalently attached via amide bond to the surface of aminated silica-coated magnetite nanoparticles, both steps monitored using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The kinetics and the equilibrium behavior of the cationic dye methylene blue (MB) adsorption onto the carrageenan <b>sorbents</b> were investigated. iota-carrageenan <b>sorbents</b> displayed higher MB adsorption capacity that was ascribed to high content of sulfonate groups. Overall, the pseudo-second order equation provided a good description of the adsorption kinetics. The iota-carrageenan <b>sorbents</b> followed an unusual Z-type equilibrium adsorption isotherm whereas the isotherm of iota-carrageenan <b>sorbents,</b> although displaying a conventional shape, could not be successfully predicted by isotherm models commonly used. Noteworthy, both <b>sorbents</b> were long-term stable and could easily be recycled by simply rinsing with KCl aqueous solution. The removal efficiency of kappa-carrageenan <b>sorbents</b> was 92 % in the first adsorption cycle and kept high (> 80 %) even after six consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles...|$|R

30|$|It {{was also}} {{observed}} {{that in all}} the sorption process by modified <b>sorbents,</b> there was greater contribution of surface sorption in the intra-particle diffusion because the intercepts of intra-particle diffusion model for modified samples are greater than those found for unmodified samples (Bulut et al. 2008). This {{is supported by the}} fact that pseudo-first-order rate constants for sorption by modified <b>sorbents</b> are higher than those of unmodified ones which suggests that, for sorption process by modified <b>sorbents,</b> surface reactions are faster. Thus, acetylated materials are suitable <b>sorbents</b> for oil sorption.|$|R

[...] These complex and large GC-MS systems have been modified and configured with resistively heated low thermal mass (LTM) gas chromatographs that reduce analysis time to less than ten percent of the time required in traditional laboratory systems.

The size of the purge stream compared with the amount of <b>sorbent</b> going round the cycle affects the process considerably.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, all <b>sorbents</b> removal {{percentage}} increase as {{the concentration of}} Cd decreases in the collected samples due to exist of more available active sites on the <b>sorbents</b> surface, that trend excluded the samples from stations (3) and (4), which give removal values lower than the expected. That behavior {{could be explained by}} the existence of more sorbets in the samples to compete with Cd on the active sites of the <b>sorbents</b> or may be cause of the traces concentration of Cd in both stations decreases the chance of collation between cadmium ions and <b>sorbents</b> particles.|$|R

The porous silica support was prepared {{according to a}} sol-gel technique, and CuO was deposited on this support through an ion-exchange technique to achieve a uniform, highly dispersed CuO deposition. During up to 75 cycles of oxidation, sulphation, and reduction, the ion-exchanged <b>sorbents</b> did not show a significant loss in chemical activity except for some deactivation in the first 1 ¿ 3 cycles.
