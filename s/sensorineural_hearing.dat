5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. <b>Sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{constellation}} of anomalies seen with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{result in a}} distinct diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria for the disorder are broad distal phalanges of the thumbs and big toes, accompanied by a broad and shortened nose, <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss and developmental delay, with predominant occurrence in males.|$|E

50|$|Pain is {{the most}} common symptom, {{followed}} by either <b>sensorineural</b> or conductive <b>hearing</b> loss, tinnitus or drainage (discharge). A mass lesion may be present, but it is often slow growing.|$|R
5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, distal brachydactyly and <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the thumbs and big toes, also with brachydactyly. Broad thumbs and big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Negus {{family moved}} to Haslemere, Surrey. During the Second World War, Negus again served in a medical capacity, {{this time with the}} Emergency Medical Service (EMS) at Horton Hospital, Epsom, from 1939 to 1946. In 1940, on the {{retirement}} of his colleague Charles Hope, he had been appointed senior surgeon at King's College Hospital, and in 1946 he reached the peak of his profession as a consulting surgeon. During this post-war period one of Negus's patients was the former (and future) prime minister Winston Churchill, who in 1950 was diagnosed by Negus with high-frequency <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss. Negus retired from clinical and teaching work in 1952 at the age of 65.|$|E
40|$|Wolfram {{syndrome}} {{patients are}} mainly characterised by juvenile onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. A synonym is the acronym DIDMOAD: diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness. Diabetes insipidus and <b>sensorineural</b> high-frequency <b>hearing</b> impairment are important additional features. This rare autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative syndrome {{is caused by}} mainly inactivating mutations in the WFS 1 gene. It is located at chromosome 4 p 16 and encodes wolframin, a transmembrane protein. No function has yet been ascribed to this protein...|$|R
50|$|Tympanometry is a {{valuable}} component of the audiometric evaluation. In evaluating hearing loss, tympanometry permits a distinction between <b>sensorineural</b> and conductive <b>hearing</b> loss, when evaluation is not apparent via Weber and Rinne testing. Furthermore, in a primary care setting, tympanometry {{can be helpful in}} making the diagnosis of otitis media by demonstrating the presence of a middle ear effusion.|$|R
50|$|Imaging {{is usually}} not pursued in those with {{uncomplicated}} conductive hearing loss and characteristic clinical findings. Those with only conductive hearing loss are often treated medically or with surgery without imaging. The diagnosis may be unclear clinically in cases of <b>sensorineural</b> or mixed <b>hearing</b> loss and may become apparent only on imaging. Therefore, imaging is often performed when the <b>hearing</b> loss is <b>sensorineural</b> or mixed.|$|R

40|$|Background: Hereditary hearing {{impairment}} (HHI) is a heterogeneous class of disorders that shows various pat-terns of inheritance and involves {{a multitude of}} different genes. Mutations in the EYA 4 gene are responsible for postlingual, progressive, autosomal dominant hearing loss at the DFNA 10 locus. EYA 4 is orthologous to the Drosophila gene eya (“eyes absent”), a key regulator of eye formation. EYA 4 {{plays an important role}} in several devel-opmental processes. Material and Methods: Here we report a Hungarian family displaying <b>sensorineural,</b> progressive <b>hearing</b> impairment. The family comprising four generations with 11 affected and 8 unaffected members was subjected to genome-wide link-age analysis and candidate gene sequencing.

5000|$|A {{hearing test}} {{administered}} by a medical doctor, otolaryngologist (ENT) or audiologist including pure tone audiometry and speech recognition {{may be used}} to determine the extent and nature of hearing loss, and distinguish presbycusis from other kinds of hearing loss. Otoacoustic emissions and evoked response testing {{may be used to}} test for audio neuropathy. The diagnosis of a <b>sensorineural</b> pattern <b>hearing</b> loss is made through audiometry, which shows a significant hearing loss without the [...] "air-bone gap" [...] that is characteristic of conductive hearing disturbances. In other words, air conduction is equal to bone conduction. Persons with cochlear deficits fail otoacoustic emissions testing, while persons with 8th cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve) deficits fail auditory brainstem response testing.|$|R
40|$|Complete {{otological}} examinations, including audiograms, {{were carried}} out on 504 British Columbia Indians of the Mount Currie Reservation. Of these, 79 {{were found to have}} evidence of current middle ear pathology, while 226 were known to have had previous disease. Among 364 subjects who could be formally tested, 112 had a 15 -decibel or greater hearing loss in the speech frequencies. Among these Indians, middle-ear disease began early in life and recurrences were frequent. The prevalence of aural disease was related to poor social conditions, family history and presence of nasal discharge. No other relationships could be demonstrated, and there was no evident benefit from adenotonsillectomy. No secretory otitis or otosclerosis and almost no <b>sensorineural</b> high-tone <b>hearing</b> loss were discovered...|$|R
25|$|Craniofacial and {{skeletal}} deformities {{may require}} surgical correction, using techniques including bone grafts and osteotomy procedures. <b>Sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss {{can be managed}} {{with the use of}} hearing aids and educational services designated for the hearing impaired.|$|E
25|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} that {{hyperbaric oxygen therapy}} improves hearing in patients with sudden <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss who present within two weeks of hearing loss. There is some indication that HBOT might improve tinnitus presenting {{in the same time}} frame.|$|E
25|$|Damage to {{the hair}} {{cells of the}} inner ear results in <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss, which affects the ability to {{discriminate}} between sounds. This often manifests as a decreased ability to understand speech, and simply amplifying speech (as a hearing aid does) is often insufficient to improve speech perception.|$|E
40|$|Hearing, speech, and {{language}} were studied in 26 children who survived severe perinatal asphyxia. The results of hearing {{tests showed that}} most children had a favourable outcome. Only 1 child had <b>sensorineural</b> deafness. <b>Hearing</b> loss in 6 others was due to middle-ear disease which resolved after treatment, and on retesting {{was found to be}} normal. The study also showed that neither gentamicin treatment nor incubator noise seemed to affect hearing. The results of speech {{and language}} assessment were less encouraging and about one-third of the children without serious mental or physical handicap had deficits in speech and language. It is suggested that {{the quality of life in}} such children could be improved if these deficits were detected early and adequately treated...|$|R
50|$|Most {{forms of}} nonsyndromic {{deafness}} {{are associated with}} permanent hearing loss caused by damage to structures in the inner ear. The inner ear consists of three parts: a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea that helps process sound, nerves that send information from the cochlea to the brain, and structures involved with balance. Loss of hearing caused by changes in the inner ear is called <b>sensorineural</b> deafness. <b>Hearing</b> loss that results from changes in the middle ear is called conductive hearing loss. The middle ear contains three tiny bones that help transfer sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. Some forms of nonsyndromic deafness involve changes in both the inner ear and the middle ear; this combination is called mixed hearing loss.|$|R
40|$|Cisplatin {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used and {{effective}} cytotoxic agents currently available for the treatment of soft-tissue cancers, with a reported cure rate of 85 %. [1] This antineoplastic drug inhibits tumour growth through the formation of DNA interstrand and intrastrand crosslinks, which disrupts the double-stranded DNA helical structure. This in turn prevents cell division and growth due to inhibition of DNA replication and transcription, leading directly to apoptosis. [2] Use of cisplatin is limited by the relatively high incidence of associated adverse drug reactions, including neurotoxicity, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, due to the drug’s narrow therapeutic index. Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is characterised by high-frequency <b>sensorineural</b> bilateral <b>hearing</b> loss, which can be irreversible and progressive[3] and is often associated with tinnitus and ear pain. The hearing loss usually begins at high frequencies (> 8 000 Hz) and may later progress to lowe...|$|R
25|$|Another {{condition}} {{has come}} to be known as autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). It is characterized by idiopathic, rapidly progressive, bilateral <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss. It is a fairly rare disorder while at the same time, a lack of proper diagnostic testing has meant that its precise incidence cannot be determined.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{recurrent}} {{episodes of}} {{acute otitis media}} and those with otitis media with effusion or chronic suppurative otitis media have higher risks of developing conductive and <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss. Globally approximately 141nbsp&million people have mild hearing loss due to otitis media (2.1% of the population). This {{is more common in}} males (2.3%) than females (1.8%).|$|E
25|$|Individuals with CS appear prematurely {{aged and}} exhibit severe growth {{retardation}} leading to short stature. They {{have a small}} head (less than the -3 standard deviation), fail to gain weight and failure to thrive. They also have extreme cutaneous photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight), neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and deafness, and often exhibit lipoatrophy, atrophic skin, severe tooth decay, sparse hair, calcium deposits in neurons, cataracts, <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss, pigmentary retinopathy, and bone abnormalities. However, {{they do not have}} a higher risk of cancer.|$|E

50|$|This gene is a homolog of the Drosophila diaphanous {{gene and}} {{belongs to the}} protein family of the formins, {{characterized}} by the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain. It {{has been linked to}} autosomal dominant, fully penetrant, nonsyndromic <b>sensorineural</b> progressive low-frequency <b>hearing</b> loss. Actin polymerization involves proteins known to interact with diaphanous protein in Drosophila and mouse. It has therefore been speculated that this gene may have a role in the regulation of actin polymerization in hair cells of the inner ear. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.|$|R
30|$|Of the 72 {{children}} and adolescents invited to participate, 61 (84.7  %) consented. Twenty of the children/adolescents with profound hearing loss had an cochlear implant (unilateral), and twenty-four of the children/adolescents with profound/severe hearing loss had conventional hearing aids and/or no implants. Both groups had <b>sensorineural</b> bilateral <b>hearing</b> loss. Seventeen individuals with normal hearing also participated in the study. Among those with implants, the age of implantation ranged from 2 to 5  years. All {{of the children who}} received implants before beginning school had used them for 3 or more years. All of the deaf children had hearing parents. All of the participants had normal intellectual development, were between the ages of 8 and 18  years, and attended school in Portugal. The participants were matched by gender and school year. Any children with other disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, auditory neuropathy, syndromes, hypoplasia of the auditory nerve, or bilateral implant, were excluded.|$|R
25|$|JNK kinases are {{implicated in}} the {{development}} of insulin resistance in obese individuals as well as neurotransmitter excitotoxicity after ischaemic conditions. Inhibition of JNK1 ameliorates insulin resistance in certain animal models. Mice that were genetically engineered to lack a functional JNK3 gene - the major isoform in brain – display enhanced ischemic tolerance and stroke recovery. Although small-molecule JNK inhibitors are under development, none of them proved to be effective in human tests yet. Interestingly, a peptide-based JNK inhibitor (AM-111, a retro-inverse D-motif peptide from JIP1, formerly known as XG-102) is also under clinical development for <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss.|$|E
25|$|Variations {{within the}} Genome are being studied to {{determine}} susceptibility to chronic diseases {{as well as}} infectious diseases. According to Aileen Kenneson and Coleen Boyle, about one sixth of the U.S. population has some degree of hearing loss. Recent research has linked variants in the Gap Junction Beta 2 (GJB2) gene to nonsyndromic prelingual <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss. GJB2 is a gene encoding for connexin a protein found in the cochlea. So far, scientists have found over 90 variants in this gene and sequence variations may account for up to 50% of nonsyndromic hearing loss. Variants in GJB2 are being looked at to determine age of onset as well as severity of hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Six autosomal-dominant point {{mutations}} {{in the sequence}} {{have been found to}} cause various types of hearing loss, particularly <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss linked to the DFNA 20/26 locus. It seems that they affect the stereocilia of the ciliated cells present in the inner ear’s Organ of Corti. β-actin is the most abundant protein found in human tissue, but it is not very abundant in ciliated cells, which explains the location of the pathology. On the other hand, it appears that the majority of these mutations affect the areas involved in linking with other proteins, particularly actomyosin. Some experiments have suggested that the pathological mechanism for this type of hearing loss relates to the F-actin in the mutations being more sensitive to cofilin than normal.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSome {{individuals}} with hearing loss {{choose to be}} fitted with hearing aids. Compliance is significantly affected by how satisfied patients are with their hearing aids. Patient satisfaction can be assessed through questionnaires and scales. ObjectiveTo assess the degree of satisfaction of patients fitted with hearing aids. MethodScale “Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life” (SADL) was applied to 180 patients fitted with hearing aids; results were categorized based on the mean values observed for global satisfaction scores and scores attained on each subscale. Patients were interviewed for additional information. ResultsMean global score was 5. 6; 48. 9 % of the subjects were very satisfied, 47. 2 % were satisfied, and 3. 9 % were dissatisfied. The mean score on subscale Positive Effects was 5. 6; {{the mean score for}} Service and Cost was 6. 2; for Negative Factors the mean score was 4. 9; and the mean score on subscale Personal Image was 5. 8. Of the patients fitted with in-the-ear hearing aids, 83. 3 % were very satisfied. Fifteen percent of the individuals were dissatisfied with their Personal Image. <b>Sensorineural</b> and profound <b>hearing</b> loss patients were less satisfied, with 5. 4 % and 50. 0 % of the subjects revealing dissatisfaction with their hearing aids. ConclusionPatients were generally very satisfied with their hearing aids. Satisfaction rates were higher among patients fitted with in-the-ear hearing aids. Dissatisfaction was higher in subscale Personal Image. Lesser degrees of satisfaction were seen in patients with <b>sensorineural</b> and profound <b>hearing</b> loss...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} a 67 -year-old woman with severe disabling right-sided tinnitus, mild hyperacusis, and headache. The tinnitus was associated with sudden right hearing loss and vertigo, which occurred about 18 months before. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) resulted in normal anatomical structures of the cochlea and of the cranial nerves showing a partial empty sella syndrome with suprasellar cistern hernia. Angio-MR revealed a bilateral contact between the anterior-inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) and the acoustic-facial nerve with a potential neurovascular conflict. Surgery was considered unnecessary after further evaluations. The right ear was successfully treated with a combination device (hearing aid plus sound generator). Shortly after a standard fitting procedure, the patient reported a reduction of tinnitus, hyperacusis, and headache which completely disappeared at the follow-up evaluation after 3, 6, and 12 months. This paper demonstrates that the combination device resulted in a complete tinnitus and hyperacusis suppression in a patient with unilateral <b>sensorineural</b> sudden <b>hearing</b> loss. Our paper further supports the restoration of peripheral sensory input for the treatment of tinnitus associated with hearing loss in selected patients...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Hearing {{impairment}} is {{the most}} prevalent sensory disability and {{is caused by a}} variety of genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have proposed otitis media, head injury, convulsions, respiratory problems and infections to the infants as the important antecedents of neonatal deafness or hearing impairment. A prospective etiological study of adverse postnatal conditions leading to bilateral <b>sensorineural</b> neonatal <b>hearing</b> impairment was conducted. In this study 1076 children below 14 years of age with congenital hearing loss were investigated. The results showed adverse postnatal history in 20. 26 % (218) of the cases out of 1076. High risk factors included otitis media, head injury and convulsions and respiratory distress. Majority (126 / 11. 71 %) of the cases showed otitis media followed by head injury in 4. 83 % (52) of the cases, convulsions in 2. 78 % (30) of the cases and respiratory problems in 0. 92 % (10) of the cases. It can be concluded that careful monitoring of the child during the first few years and vaccination against all the infections is necessary...|$|R
