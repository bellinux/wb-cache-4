40|$|Aim. This National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) funded UK study {{sought to}} examine {{organisational}} and professional responses to children's missed healthcare appointments. Design/methods. The study comprised two parts: phase I was a web-based scoping and systematic analysis of UK National Health Service healthcare organisations' internal policies on missed appointments. Phase II involved {{a case study of}} how missed appointments were managed within one hospital trust, including interviews with hospital-based staff, review of organisational data and examination of policies and ‘systems’ in place. Results Policies. accessed were of variable quality when benchmarked against a predetermined set of evidence-based standards. Additional material (eg, board minutes) gleaned through the searches found an apparent disconnect between nationally determined <b>safeguarding</b> <b>requirements</b> and strategies to reduce the cost pressures arising from missed appointments. Findings from the case study included the continuing use of the adult-centric term ‘did not attend’ (DNA), the challenges that may be inherent in attending appointments (with concomitant sympathy for parents) and a need to further explore general practitioner responses to DNA notifications, particularly given the acknowledged association between missed appointments and child maltreatment. Conclusions. The web-based scoping exercise yielded a small number of organisational policies. These were of variable quality when rated against predetermined standards. Other material gathered through the search strategy found evidence that ‘missed appointment’ strategies aimed at reducing costs did not always acknowledge the discrete needs of children. The case study findings contribute {{to an understanding of the}} complexities and challenges of responding to a missed appointment and the importance of taking a child-centred approach...|$|E
40|$|Two {{off-the-shelf}} John Deere utility mowers were modified for X-by-wire {{control for}} the purposes of constructing autonomous vehicles usable in sports-turf mowing applications. The purpose of these mules was to enable the gathering of requirements and customer feedback on such a system. The environment selected initially was that of a baseball stadium. These areas can be characterized as flat, highly controlled and well-groomed, for which precise mowing patterns are necessities. Typically the operators of these mowers are highly skilled; an autonomous system has the benefits of saving time and labor, permitting the efficient usage of less-skilled employees, and allowing skilled personnel to focus on more complex tasks (such as infield mowing and warning track grooming). For this application, there are stringent requirements on navigation, path planning and path tracking, while the <b>safeguarding</b> <b>requirements</b> are challenging, but more relaxed than, say, the requirements for golf courses. The calculation of precise position and orientation in this environment requires sensor fusion and is {{complicated by the fact that}} frequently the operating area is surrounded by very high walls, limiting sky visibility and preventing the usage of GPS-centric navigation systems. Furthermore, it was desirable to mature the design far enough so that it could be operated regularly by non-technical operators. These results were achieved by developing an accurate local positioning system, making the hardware and software subsystems robust against unexpected failures and constructing a very simple graphical user interface. This paper will review other relevant existing systems, describe the hardware and software systems utilized, and conclude with descriptions on the performance, customer learning, and description of properties of autonomous systems that enable their integration into a worksite...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} the second {{in a series of}} {{guidelines}} on international <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements</b> and practices, prepared expressly for the designers of nuclear facilities. The first document in this series is the description of generic international nuclear <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements</b> pertaining to all types of facilities. These requirements should be understood and considered at the earliest stages of facility design as part of a new process called “Safeguards-by-Design. ” This will help eliminate the costly retrofit of facilities that has occurred in the past to accommodate nuclear safeguards verification activities. The following summarizes the requirements for international nuclear safeguards implementation at enrichment plants, prepared under the Safeguards by Design project, and funded by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of NA- 243. The purpose of this is to provide designers of nuclear facilities around the world with a simplified set of design requirements and the most common practices for meeting them. The foundation for these requirements is the international safeguards agreement between the country and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), pursuant to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Relevant <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements</b> are also cited from the Safeguards Criteria for inspecting enrichment plants, found in the IAEA Safeguards Manual, Part SMC- 8. IAEA definitions and terms are based on the IAEA Safeguards Glossary, published in 2002. The most current specification for safeguards measurement accuracy is found in the IAEA document STR- 327, “International Target Values 2000 for Measurement Uncertainties in Safeguarding Nuclear Materials,” published in 2001. For this guide to be easier for the designer to use, the requirements have been restated in plainer language per expert interpretation using the source documents noted. The safeguards agreement is fundamentally a legal document. As such, it is written in a legalese that is understood by specialists in international law and treaties, but not by most outside of this field, including designers of nuclear facilities. For this reason, many of the requirements have been simplified and restated. However, in all cases, the relevant source document and passage is noted so that readers may trace the requirement to the source. This is a helpful living guide, since some of these requirements are subject to revision over time. More importantly, the practices by which the requirements are met are continuously modernized by the IAEA and nuclear facility operators to improve not only the effectiveness of international nuclear safeguards, but also the efficiency. As these improvements are made, the following guidelines should be updated and revised accordingly...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} requirements and best practices for implementing international nuclear safeguards at independent {{spent fuel storage}} installations (ISFSIs), also known as Away-from- Reactor (AFR) storage facilities. These installations may provide wet or dry storage of spent fuel, although the safeguards guidance herein focuses on dry storage facilities. In principle, the safeguards guidance applies to both wet and dry storage. The reason for focusing on dry independent spent fuel storage installations {{is that this is}} one of the fastest growing nuclear installations worldwide. Independent spent fuel storage installations are typically outside of the safeguards nuclear material balance area (MBA) of the reactor. They may be located on the reactor site, but are generally considered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the State Regulator/SSAC to be a separate facility. The need for this guidance is becoming increasingly urgent as more and more nuclear power plants move their spent fuel from resident spent fuel ponds to independent spent fuel storage installations. The <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements</b> and best practices described herein are also relevant to the design and construction of regional independent spent fuel storage installations that nuclear power plant operators are starting to consider in the absence of a national long-term geological spent fuel repository. The following document has been prepared in support of two of the three foundational pillars for implementing Safeguards-by-Design (SBD). These are: i) defining the relevant <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements,</b> and ii) defining the best practices for meeting the requirements. This document was prepared with the design of the latest independent dry spent fuel storage installations in mind and was prepared specifically as an aid for designers of commercial nuclear facilities to help them understand the relevant international requirements that follow from a country’s safeguards agreement with the IAEA. If these requirements are understood at the earliest stages of facility design, it will help eliminate the costly retrofit of facilities that has occurred in the past to accommodate nuclear safeguards, and will help the IAEA implement nuclear safeguards worldwide, especially in countries building their first nuclear facilities. It is also hoped that this guidance document will promote discussion between the IAEA, State Regulator/SSAC, Project Design Team, and Facility Owner/Operator at an early stage to ensure that new ISFSIs will be effectively and efficiently safeguarded. This is intended to be a living document, since the international nuclear <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements</b> may be subject to revision over time. More importantly, the practices by which the requirements are met are continuously modernized by the IAEA and facility operators for greater efficiency and cost effectiveness. As these improvements are made, it is recommended that the subject guidance document be updated and revised accordingly...|$|R

40|$|The United States is {{considering}} {{the offer of}} irradiated research reactor spent fuel (RRSF) for international safeguards applied by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

40|$|Nuclear {{proliferation}} {{risks from}} magnetic fusion energy associated {{with access to}} fissile materials {{can be divided into}} three main categories: 1) clandestine production of fissile material in an undeclared facility, 2) covert production and diversion of such material in a declared and safeguarded facility, and 3) use of a declared facility in a breakout scenario, in which a state openly produces fissile material in violation of international agreements. The degree of risk in each of these categories is assessed, taking into account both state and non-state actors, and it is found that safeguards are required for fusion energy to be highly attractive from a non-proliferation standpoint. Specific <b>safeguard</b> <b>requirements</b> and R&D needs are outlined for each category of risk, and the technical capability of the ITER experiment, under construction, to contribute to this R&D is noted.

40|$|Modern nuclear {{materials}} accounting and safeguards measurement systems {{are becoming increasingly}} advanced as they embrace emerging technologies. However, many facilities still rely on human intervention to update materials accounting records. The demand for {{nuclear materials}} safeguards information continues to increase while general industry and government down-sizing has resulted in less availability of qualified staff. Future <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements</b> will necessitate access to information through unattended and/or remote monitoring systems requiring minimal human intervention.

One option examined in general by the IAEA experts group could be used to guarantee Iran’s future nuclear fuel supply and prevent its abuse for military purposes. We examine this option in detail for the case of Iran. It could be used to solve the Iranian crisis by constructing an enrichment facility on Iranian soil jointly owned and operated by Iran and Western governments.

40|$|Conversion, {{the process}} by which natural uranium ore (yellowcake) is puriﬁed and {{converted}} through a series of chemical processes into uranium hexaﬂuoride gas (UF 6), has historically been excluded from the nuclear <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements</b> of the 235 U-based nuclear fuel cycle. With each step in the conversion process from yellowcake to feedstock for UF 6, intermediary uranium oxide and uranium ﬂuoride compounds become progressively attractive products for diversion toward activities noncompliant with international treaties. The diversion of this product material could potentially provide feedstock for a clandestine or undeclared enrichment for weapons development for state or non-state entities. With the realization of this potential, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has only recently reinterpreted its policies to emphasize safeguarding this feedstock in response to such diversion pathways. This project employs a combination of simulation models and experimental measurements to develop and validate concepts of nondestructive assay monitoring systems in a natural uranium conversion plant (NUCP). In particular, uranyl nitrate (UN) solution exiting solvent extraction was identiﬁed as a key measurement point (KMP), where gamma-ray spectroscopy was selected as the process-monitoring tool.

40|$|The {{nuclear fission}} of {{actinides}} in reactor fuel produces {{large quantities of}} Kr and Xe as fission products. Because of {{the high levels of}} fission Kr and Xe, sample collection and analysis of noble gases for spent fuel diagnostic measurements is a simple, straight-forward technique. In modern reprocessing plants with continuous dissolvers, it will not be possible to use traditional methods for isolating input batches of fuel. This study investigates the feasibility of using noble gas isotope abundance measurements (isotope correlation techniques - ICT) to solve <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements.</b> Noble gas measurements might be able to provide an independent analysis of Pu contained within dissolves fuel, on an individual fuel assembly basis. The isotopic composition of Kr and Xe in spent fuel reflects both the composition (isotope abundance ratios) of the fission products and the effects of neutron capture on those fission products. We have reviewed the available literature for noble gas analyses of spent reactor fuel. While references are made to noble gas isotope correlations over the last 20 years, we have found little if any detailed analysis of large data sets. The literature search did find several useful reports. Of these papers, one is particularly useful for evaluating noble gas isotopic compositions. The ``Benchmark-paper`` (1) contains 54 Kr and 56 Xe isotopic composition analyses for 4 different reactors with a variety of fuel enrichment factors. Burnup ranges from 8000 to 37000 MWd/tU.

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2002, the U. S.

The underlying objectives of the USSP include becoming more proactive than reactive in addressing safeguards equipment needs, helping the IAEA to maintain an inventory of cost-effective, reliable, and effective safeguards equipment, establishing a long-term planning horizon, and securing IAEA ownership in the process of effective requirements definition and timely transitioning of new or improved systems for IAEA use. At an initial workshop, seals, their functions, performance issues, and future embodiments were discussed in the following order: adhesive seals, metal seals, passive and active loop seals, ultrasonic seals, tamper indicating enclosures (including sample containers, equipment enclosures, and conduits). Suggested improvements to these technologies focused largely on a few themes: (1) The seals must be applied quickly, easily, and correctly; (2) Seals and their associated equipment should not unduly add bulk or weight to the inspectors load; (3) Rapid, in-situ verifiability of seals is desirable; and (4) Seal systems for high risk or high value applications should have two-way, remote communications. Based upon these observations and other insights, the participants constructed a skeletal approach for seals technology planning. The process begins with a top-level review of the fundamental <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements</b> and extraction of required system features, which is followed by analysis of suitable technologies and identification of technology gaps, and finally by development of a planning schedule for system improvements and new technology integration. Development of a comprehensive procedure will require the partnership and participation of the IAEA.

This paper analyses the use of unattended monitoring systems and remote data transmission in application of Integrated Safeguards starting from the experiences gained when the new safeguards regime was introduced for the non-nuclear weapon states in the European Union in 2010. The cooperation between the stakeholders benefits from smartly designed safeguards equipment which leads to reduced effort for on-site inspections by the IAEA without compromising the effectiveness of safeguards implementation. The use of digital sensors with the possibility of remote data transmission facilitates delegation of routine tasks like cask sealing under surveillance to the operator. The information over the state-of-health of unattended safeguards sensors gains new quality in schemes based on short-notice randomized inspections. With regard to unattended sensors for radiation detection, fast digitization in proximity to the sensor provides further opportunities with respect to authentication of sensor data and determining the state-of-health of the system. This contribution discusses the current and potential future role of safeguards equipment and technical developments in support of safeguards implementation that is based on the State-Level Concept...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{materials}} safeguards {{and security}} systems {{are described in}} the context of the nuclear nonproliferation regime. Materials of interest to safeguards, threats, proposals to strengthen International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, evolving <b>safeguards</b> issues and <b>requirements,</b> system effectiveness, and elements of a global nuclear materials management regime are discussed. Safeguards are seen as an essential element of nuclear materials management, but not a driver for decisions regarding nuclear power or the disposal of excess weapon nuclear materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} global warming raise demands for reduced CO 2 emissions, whereas {{at the same time}} the world’s need for energy increases. With the aim to resolve some of the {{difficulties}} facing today’s nuclear power, striving for safety, sustainability and waste minimization, a new generation of nuclear energy systems is being pursued: Generation IV. New reactor concepts and new nuclear facilities should be at least as resistant to diversion of nuclear material for weapons production, as were the previous ones. However, the emerging generation of nuclear power will give rise to new challenges to the international safeguards community, due to new and increased flows of nuclear material in the nuclear fuel cycle. Before a wide implementation of Generation IV nuclear power facilities takes place, there lies still an opportunity to formulate <b>safeguards</b> <b>requirements</b> for the next generation of nuclear energy systems. In this context, this thesis constitutes one contribution to the global efforts to make future nuclear energy systems increasingly resistant to nuclear material diversion attempts. This thesis comprises three papers, all of which concern safeguards and proliferation resistance in Generation IV nuclear energy systems and especially recycling facilities: In Paper I, proliferation resistances of three fuel cycles, comprising different reprocessing techniques, are investigated. The results highlight the importance of making group actinide extraction techniques commercial, due to the inherently less vulnerable isotopic and radiological properties of the materials in such processes. Paper II covers the schematic design and safeguards instrumentation of a Generation IV recycling facility. The identification of the safeguards needs of planned facilities can act as a guide towards the development of new instrumentation suitable for Generation IV nuclear energy systems. Finally, Paper III describes a mode of procedure for assessing proliferation resistance of a recycling facility for fast reactor fuel. The assessments may be used, as in this case, as an aid to maintain or increase the inherent proliferation resistance when performing facility design changes and upgrades...|$|R
40|$|New data {{indicates}} substantial under-reporting of {{the existence}} of federal funding in academic biomedical patents issued since the enactment of the Bayh-Dole Act. The 1980 Bayh-Dole Act established a uniform, government-wide policy in favor of allowing academic recipients of federal research funding the right to seek patents on inventions arising from that funding. Although federal funding obviates the usual “incentive to invent ” justification for patents, Bayh-Dole’s sponsors believed that giving patent ownership to grantees would be the most effective mechanism for further developing university discoveries into the new products and industries necessary for maintaining national competitiveness 1. Bayh-Dole does not, however, confer entirely unfettered discretion upon grantees. To the contrary, the Act contains accountability <b>safeguards,</b> including <b>requirements</b> for reporting not simply the existence of federally funded patents but also information regarding the licensing, assignment and practical utilization of these patents. The Act also provides the government with an array of retained rights in the work that it funds 2...|$|R
40|$|We address {{inhibiting}} {{factors of}} mobile real-time services. Since research provides evidence that perceived risk is one major inhibiting {{factor for the}} adoption of mobile services, we explore current approaches that should <b>safeguard</b> existing security <b>requirements.</b> First, we develop a classification scheme of mobile real-time applications. We then empirically explore practical and security requirements for the different service classes. Our analysis indicates that current implementation concepts do not meet existent service requirements. Therefore, we present an alternative approach {{on the basis of}} SIM-based security tokens. The additional functionalities provided by these tokens can overcome functional or security constraints of existing implementations...|$|R
