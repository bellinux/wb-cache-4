5|$|Rival {{producers}} of Somali shillings emerged after 1991. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for <b>seigniorage</b> drove {{the value of}} the money down to about $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers have refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries are treated as the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases.|$|E
5|$|Production resumed in 1934, due {{to another}} congressional act; this one {{requiring}} the Mint to purchase {{large quantities of}} domestic silver, a commodity whose price was at a historic low. This Act assured producers of a ready market for their product, with the Mint gaining a large profit in <b>seigniorage,</b> through monetizing cheaply purchased silver—the Mint in fact paid for some shipments of silver bullion in silver dollars. Pursuant to this authorization, over seven million silver Peace dollars were struck in 1934 and 1935. Mint officials gave consideration to striking 1936 silver dollars, and in fact prepared working dies, but as there was no commercial demand for them, none were actually struck. With Mint Chief Engraver Sinnock thinking it unlikely {{that there would be}} future demand for the denomination, the master dies were ordered destroyed in January 1937.|$|E
5|$|While {{conducting}} {{an investigation of}} the Mint at San Francisco, deputy comptroller of the currency John Jay Knox began discussing the monetary situation with Louis A. Garnett, a man who had worked as both the treasurer and assayer of the San Francisco Mint. Garnett recommended that the United States mint a commercial dollar that would be exported to the Orient to compete with other countries' silver trade coins that were already popular in that region. Garnett's rationale was {{that the majority of the}} coins would be hoarded or melted in Asia and would never be presented for redemption, allowing the government to make a profit from the <b>seigniorage.</b> During his time in San Francisco, Knox also discussed the proposed commercial dollar with Henry Linderman, who was working as a special agent for the Treasury Department at that time. In 1870, Knox wrote a report to the Treasury and wrote the draft for a bill on coinage. Knox's bill was approved by George Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury. After modification and review from current and former government officials, the bill was put before Congress.|$|E
5|$|Methods have {{included}} reducing {{the percentage of}} gold in coins, or substituting less precious metals for gold. However, until the 19th century, {{the proportion of the}} world's trade that occurred between nations was very low, so exchanges rates were not generally a matter of great concern. Rather than being seen as a means to help exporters, the debasement of currency was motivated by a desire to increase the domestic money supply and the ruling authorities' wealth through <b>seigniorage,</b> especially when they needed to finance wars or pay debts. A notable example is the substantial devaluations which occurred during the Napoleonic wars. When nations wished to compete economically they typically practiced mercantilism – this still involved attempts to boost exports while limiting imports, but rarely by means of devaluation. A favoured method was to protect home industries using current account controls such as tariffs. From the late 18th century, and especially in Britain, which, for much of the 19th century, was the world's largest economy, mercantilism became increasingly discredited by the rival theory of free trade, which held {{that the best way to}} encourage prosperity would be to allow trade to occur free of government imposed controls. The intrinsic value of money became formalised with a gold standard being widely adopted from about 1870–1914, so while the global economy was now becoming sufficiently integrated for competitive devaluation to occur there was little opportunity. Following the end of World War I, many countries other than the US experienced recession and few immediately returned to the gold standard, so several of the conditions for a currency war were in place. However, currency war did not occur as the U.K. was trying to raise the value of its currency back to its pre-war levels, effectively cooperating with the countries that wished to devalue against the market.|$|E
25|$|Banks or governments relying {{heavily on}} <b>seigniorage</b> and {{fractional}} reserve sources of revenue {{can find it}} counterproductive. Rational expectations of inflation take into account a bank's <b>seigniorage</b> strategy, and inflationary expectations can maintain high inflation. Instead of accruing <b>seigniorage</b> from fiat money and credit, most governments opt to raise revenue primarily through formal taxation and other means.|$|E
25|$|In {{monetary}} economies {{prior to}} fiat banking, a critical form of taxation was <b>seigniorage,</b> {{the tax on}} the creation of money.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seigniorage</b> {{derived from}} notes is more indirect, being the {{difference}} between interest earned on securities acquired in exchange for bank notes {{and the costs of}} producing and distributing those notes.|$|E
25|$|Since the 50 State Quarters Program was {{expected}} to increase public demand for quarters which would be collected and taken out of circulation, the Mint used economic models to estimate the additional <b>seigniorage</b> the program would produce. These estimates established a range of $2.6 billion to $5.1 billion. (At {{the end of the}} program, the Mint estimated the actual increase in <b>seigniorage</b> to be $3 billion.) The Mint also estimated the program would earn $110 million in additional numismatic profits. (The final, post-program estimate was $136.2 million.) The Mint used these estimates to support the proposed program, and the legislation enacting the 50 States Quarters program cited these estimates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seigniorage</b> is a {{convenient}} {{source of revenue}} for some governments. By providing the government with increased purchasing power {{at the expense of}} the public's purchasing power, it imposes what is metaphorically known as an inflation tax on the public.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seigniorage</b> {{derived from}} specie—metal coins—is a tax, {{added to the}} total price of a coin (metal content and {{production}} costs), that a customer of the mint had to pay to the mint, and that {{was sent to the}} sovereign of the political area.|$|E
25|$|As a consequence, the Bakufu {{lost the}} major profit source of recoinage (<b>seigniorage),</b> {{and was forced}} to issue unbacked paper money, leading to major inflation. This was one of the major causes of discontent during the Bakumatsu period, and one of the causes of the demise of the Shogunate.|$|E
25|$|George {{supported}} {{the use of}} 'debt free' (sovereign money) currency, such as the greenback, which governments would spend into circulation to help finance public spending through the capture of <b>seigniorage</b> rents. He opposed the use of metallic currency (such as gold or silver) and fiat money created by private commercial banks.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily <b>seigniorage</b> {{is only an}} {{interest-free}} loan (for instance of gold) to the issuer of the coin or paper money. When the currency is worn out, the issuer buys it back at face value, thereby balancing exactly the revenue received when it was put into circulation, without any additional amount for the interest value of what the issuer received.|$|E
25|$|The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{has stated}} that discontinuing the dollar bill {{in favor of the}} dollar coin would save the U.S. {{government}} approximately $5.5 billion over thirty years primarily through <b>seigniorage.</b> The Federal Reserve has refused to order the coin from the mint for distribution citing a lack of demand, according to ex-Mint director Philip Diehl in November 2012.|$|E
25|$|The gold {{content of}} {{naturally}} occurring electrum in modern Western Anatolia ranges from 70% to 90%, {{in contrast to}} the 45–55% of gold in electrum used in ancient Lydian coinage of the same geographical area. This suggests that one reason for the invention of coinage in that area was to increase the profits from <b>seigniorage</b> by issuing currency with a lower gold content than the commonly circulating metal.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{part of the}} State Department, the Mint {{was made}} an {{independent}} agency in 1799. It converted precious metals into standard coin for anyone's account with no <b>seigniorage</b> charge beyond the refining costs. Under the Coinage Act of 1873, the Mint {{became part of the}} Department of the Treasury. It was placed {{under the auspices of the}} Treasurer of the United States in 1981. Legal tender coins of today are minted solely for the Treasury's account.|$|E
25|$|The Treasury Department {{engaged the}} {{consulting}} firm Coopers and Lybrand {{to conduct the study}} in 1997, which confirmed the Mint's demand, <b>seigniorage</b> and numismatic profit projections for the program. Among other conclusions, the study found that 98 million Americans were likely to save one or more full sets of the quarters (at the program's conclusion, the Mint estimated that 147 million Americans collected the 50 state quarters). Nevertheless, the Treasury Department continued to oppose the program and declined to proceed with it without a congressional mandate to do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{solvency}} constraint of {{the standard}} central bank only requires that the present discounted value of its net non-monetary liabilities (separate from its monetary liabilities accrued through <b>seigniorage</b> attempts) be zero or negative in the long run. Its monetary liabilities are liabilities only in name, as they are irredeemable: the holder of base money cannot insist at any time on the redemption of a given amount of base money into anything else other than {{the same amount of}} itself (base money)—unless, of course, the holder of said base money is another central bank reclaiming the value of its original interest-free loan.|$|E
25|$|The United States Mint {{was created}} by Congress {{following}} {{the passing of the}} Coinage Act of 1792. It was primarily tasked with producing and circulating coinage. The first Mint building was in Philadelphia, then the capital of the United States. The Mint was originally placed within the Department of State, until the Coinage Act of 1873 when it became part of the Department of the Treasury (in 1981 it was placed {{under the auspices of the}} Treasurer of the United States). The Mint had the authority to convert any precious metals into standard coinage for anyone's account with no <b>seigniorage</b> charge beyond refining costs.|$|E
25|$|From 1772, {{the silver}} coins had a {{denomination}} in function of their value in gold, and had significantly less silver than their face value (rather than being just silver-by-weight) {{so as to}} cover coinage expenses, a practice known as token or fiduciary coinage, and a characteristic of modern coinage. This technique was introduced later in England, in 1816, with its adoption of the full gold standard. At the market rates of 1858 10 silver units could be exchanged for 1 gold unit by weight, whereas the face value of silver units was only convertible at 5 to 1. This permitted an increase of monetary circulation without actual production of more bullion, and provided great profit (<b>seigniorage)</b> for the Bakufu.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{breakdown}} in central authority {{that accompanied the}} civil war, {{which began in the}} early 1990s, the value of the Somali shilling was disrupted. The Central Bank of Somalia, the nation's monetary authority, also shut down operations. Rival producers of the local currency, including autonomous regional entities such as the Somaliland territory, subsequently emerged. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. Competition for <b>seigniorage</b> drove the value of the money down to about $0.04 per ShSo (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers also refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which helped to stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries were treated as the same currency. It took large bundles to make cash purchases, and the United States dollar was often used for larger transactions.|$|E
500|$|The first silver {{certificates}} (Series 1878) {{were issued}} in denominations of $10 through $1,000. [...] Reception by financial institutions was cautious. While more convenient and less bulky than dollar coins, the silver certificate was not accepted for all transactions. The Bland–Allison Act established {{that they were}} “receivable for customs, taxes, and all public dues,” and could be included in bank reserves, but silver certificates were not explicitly considered legal tender for private interactions (i.e., between individuals). Congress used the National Banking Act of 12 July 1882 to clarify the legal tender status of silver certificates by clearly authorizing them {{to be included in}} the lawful reserves of national banks. A general appropriations act of 4 August 1886 authorized the issue of $1, $2, and $5 silver certificates. The introduction of low-denomination currency (as denominations of U.S. Notes under $5 were put on hold) greatly increased circulation. Over the 12-year lifespan of the Bland–Allison Act, the United States government would receive a <b>seigniorage</b> amounting to roughly $68 million (between $3 and $9 million per year), while absorbing over 60% of U.S. silver production.|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, {{national}} mints {{report the}} amount of <b>seigniorage</b> provided to their respective governments; for example, the Royal Canadian Mint reported that in 2006 it generated $C93 million in <b>seigniorage</b> for the Government of Canada. The U.S. government, the largest beneficiary of seignorage, earned approximately $25 billion annually as of 2000. [...] For coinage only, <b>seigniorage</b> accruing to the U.S. Treasury per dollar issued {{for the fiscal year}} 2011 was 45 cents.|$|E
2500|$|The opposite, [...] "cost of carry (demurrage)", is not {{regarded}} {{as a form of}} <b>seigniorage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Seigniorage,</b> therefore, is the {{positive}} return on issuing notes and coins, or [...] "carry" [...] on money in circulation.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, <b>seigniorage</b> was {{the profit}} {{resulting}} from producing coins. [...] Silver and gold were mixed with base metals to make durable coins. [...] Thus the British [...] "sterling" [...] was 92.5% pure silver; the base metal added (and thus the pure silver retained {{by the government}} mint) was (less costs) the profit, the <b>seigniorage.</b> [...] United States gold coins before 1933 were made from 90% gold and 10% copper. To {{make up for the}} lack of gold the coins are over-weighted. A one-ounce Gold American Eagle will have as much of the alloy as is needed to contain a total of one ounce of gold which will be over one ounce. <b>Seigniorage</b> is earned by selling the coins above the melt value in exchange for guaranteeing the weight of the coin.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the value}} of the {{currency}} relative to gold has decreased, then the person receives less than one ounce of gold. [...] <b>Seigniorage</b> occurred.|$|E
2500|$|... on {{the cost}} of H.R. 902 (the {{companion}} to S. 1047), which includes information on <b>seigniorage</b> for the State Quarter program. [...] April 12, 2005 ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{the value}} of the {{currency}} relative to gold has increased, then the person receives more than one ounce of gold. [...] <b>Seigniorage</b> did not occur.|$|E
2500|$|The {{price spread}} between face value and {{commodity}} value is called <b>seigniorage.</b> [...] Because some coins do not circulate, {{remaining in the}} possession of coin collectors, this can increase demand for coinage.|$|E
2500|$|According to some reports, [...] {{over half}} of Zimbabwe {{governmental}} revenue in 2008 was <b>seigniorage.</b> Zimbabwe has experienced hyperinflation (see Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe), with the annualized rate at about 24,000% in July 2008 (prices doubling every 46 days).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Seigniorage</b> , also spelled {{seignorage}} or seigneurage (from Old French seigneuriage [...] "right of {{the lord}} (seigneur) to mint money"), {{is the difference between}} the value of money and the cost to produce and distribute it. The term can be applied in the following ways: ...|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{under the}} rules {{governing}} monetary operations of major central banks (including the central bank of the United States), <b>seigniorage</b> on bank notes is simply defined as the interest payments received by central banks on {{the total amount of}} currency issued. [...] This usually takes the form of interest payments on treasury bonds purchased by central banks, putting more dollars into circulation. [...] However, if the currency is collected, or is otherwise taken permanently out of circulation, the back end of the deal never occurs (that is, the currency is never returned to the central bank). Thus the issuer of the currency keeps the whole <b>seigniorage</b> profit, by not having to buy worn out issued currency back at face value.|$|E
2500|$|A {{person has}} one ounce of gold, trades {{it for a}} government-issued gold {{certificate}} (providing for redemption in one ounce of gold), keeps that certificate for a year, and then redeems it in gold. [...] That person ends up with exactly one ounce of gold again. No <b>seigniorage</b> occurs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} between a United States Note and a Federal Reserve Note is that a United States Note represented a [...] "bill of credit" [...] and was inserted by the Treasury directly into circulation free of interest. Federal Reserve Notes are backed by debt purchased by the Federal Reserve, and thus generate <b>seigniorage</b> for the Federal Reserve System, {{which serves as a}} lending intermediary between the Treasury and the public.|$|E
2500|$|For {{historical}} {{reasons the}} size of the coins does not increase with their face value. [...] Both the one-cent and the five-cent are larger than the ten-cent and the less common 50-cent coin is larger than the recent Sacagawea and Susan B. Anthony dollar coins, and the newer same-sized Presidential $1 coins. [...] The sizes of the dime, quarter, and half dollar are holdovers from before 1965 when they were made from 90% silver and 10% copper; their relative sizes thus depended upon the amount of silver needed to approximate the face value and allow reasonable <b>seigniorage.</b> [...] The diameter of the Anthony, Sacagawea, and Presidential dollar coins was introduced in 1979 with the Anthony dollar not only as a concession to the vending machine industry which wanted a smaller dollar coin usable in their machines but also as an increase in the amount of <b>seigniorage</b> for the US Government (the difference between what a piece of money costs to produce and its face value or the profit margin).|$|E
