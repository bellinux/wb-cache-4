40|$|Preparation of {{electroconductive}} fine fibres containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by {{melt spinning}} {{was the main}} goal of the present study. In this regard, {{the influence of the}} main operating parameters such as type of polymer used (polyester, polypropylene and polyamide), type and concentration of the CNTs on conductivity, and mechanical and thermal properties of the melt <b>spun</b> <b>fibres</b> was studied. The conductivity of melt <b>spun</b> <b>fibres</b> was measured based on the method developed by Morton and Hearl. The morphologies of the CNTs–polymer composite fibres were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Thermal behaviours and mechanical properties of the CNTs–polymer composite fibres were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry and tearing tester, respectively. The results reveal that using CNTs had tangible effect on electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of the melt <b>spun</b> <b>fibres.</b> Also, polyamide had a better dispersion of CNTs and correspondingly lower surface resistivity...|$|R
5000|$|Staple {{length is}} an {{important}} criterion for <b>spinning</b> <b>fibre,</b> as shorter fibres {{are more difficult to}} spin than longer ones, so staple length varies from short to longer length fibres, short fibers also resulting in more hairy yarns.|$|R

Many manufacturers compete to provide the spinning machines that are essential to meeting the demand by delivering increases in spinning productivity and additional improvements in yarn quality.

40|$|Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) gas {{separation}} {{hollow fibre}} membranes were produced from multicomponent dopes using dry/wet forced convection spinning. Membranes spun {{from a low}} polymer content solution exhibited disappointing gas separation properties. Their low selectivities were indicative of thick skins and high surface porosities. In contrast, high polymer content <b>spun</b> <b>fibres</b> showed good gas separation properties. Selectivities were high, active layers relatively thin and surface porosities moderate. Coating with poly(dimethylsiloxane) nullified the surface pores. The favourable performance of the high polymer content <b>spun</b> <b>fibres</b> was also related to shear rate and forced convection residence time during spinning. To {{the knowledge of the}} authors, this work represents the first reported success in producing PVC hollow fibre membranes with morphologies suitable for gas separation. The development of PVC hollow fibres relates to the ultimate quest to produce membranes capable of reliably separating oxygen and ozone gas mixtures...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of a solvent or a solvent system is a fundamental and a crucial step in <b>spinning</b> <b>fibres</b> using a selected process. Solvent selection determines the critical minimum polymer concentration and the critical minimum chain entanglement which allows the spinning of nanofibres rather than other hybrid morphologies such as beaded structures. Pressurised gyration, which simultaneously combines the use of gas pressure and rotation, is used as the processing and forming route for <b>spinning</b> <b>fibres</b> in this work. This study investigates 23 different solvents and solvent systems spread on a wide area of a Teas graph and able to dissolve the functional polymer polyethylene (terephthalate) (PET) and spin products by the application of pressurised gyration. The results are mapped on a Teas graph to identify the solubility–spinnability region. Based on this solubility–spinnability region, various solvents and binary solvent systems that allow the making of PET fibres are suggested. Scaling laws {{for the relationship between}} polymer concentration and specific viscosity are identified. The structural evolution in the fibres prepared is elucidated. For the first time, a mathematical model to scale fibre diameter with respect to flow properties and processing parameters encountered in pressurised gyration has been successfully developed...|$|R
30|$|Electrospinning is an {{attractive}} and simple process capable of <b>spinning</b> <b>fibres</b> from melt or polymer solution using an electric field (Salem 2007; Chase et al. 2011). Electrospinning process provides a straightforward electrohydro-dynamical mechanism to produce fibres with diameters even less than 100  nm (Frenot and Chronakis 2003). Under the influence of an electric field, a pendant droplet of the polymer solution at the spinneret is deformed into a conical shape. Such deformation is dependent on solvent physical properties like good miscibility, low boiling point, low surface tension, high conductivity and low dielectric constant (Salem 2007).|$|R

Pulses with durations {{in the range}} of 1 to 10 ns with intensities of a few Watts centred around the 1. 535 µm wavelength were achieved. The circulating pulse within the laser cavity generates both Rayleigh and Raman scattered light.

Five layers of different make-ups could be distinguished. Of these only the two core layers contained the known silk proteins, but all can vitally contribute to the mechanical performance or properties of the silk fibre.

Over a 10 -month period, median odour emission rates were five to eight times lower from supported straw cover surfaces and a non-woven, <b>spun</b> <b>fibre</b> polypropylene weed control material than from the adjacent uncovered pond surface. While the straw covers visually appeared to degrade very rapidly, they continued to reduce odour emissions effectively.

50|$|Ring {{spinning}} is {{a method}} of <b>spinning</b> <b>fibres,</b> such as cotton, flax or wool, to make a yarn. The ring frame developed from the throstle frame, which in its turn was a descendant of Arkwright's water frame. Ring spinning is a continuous process, unlike mule spinning which uses an intermittent action. In ring spinning, the roving is first attenuated by using drawing rollers, then spun and wound around a rotating spindle which in its turn is contained within an independently rotating ring flyer. Traditionally ring frames could only {{be used for the}} coarser counts, but they could be attended by semi-skilled labour.|$|R

40|$|Production of {{flexible}} cellulose fibres involves spinning cellulose solutions through spinnerets through an air gap into an aqueous and/or alcoholic coagulation bath containing amine oxide and then drying. The novelty is that, before drying, the moist <b>spun</b> <b>fibre</b> is passed through after-treatment bath(s) containing water and water-miscible alcohol(s), diol(s) and/or triol(s) and washing bath(s) containing water, an alkanol, a diol or a triol.

40|$|All-optical {{polarisation}} control {{based on}} nonlinear effects (Raman and Brillouin-based polarisation pulling (RBPP and BPPP), photo-refractivity, and four-wave mixing) have been recently {{paid much attention}} {{in the context of}} applications in fibre optic communications. Raman-based polarisation pulling is enhanced in low PMD fibres and so control of the signal state of polarisation (SOP) is accompanied by an increased Raman gain. However, RBPP suffers from an increased polarisation dependent gain (PDG), viz. an uncontrollable output gain variation caused by its dependence on the input signal SOP, which makes difficult an application of the advanced modulation formats using polarisation multiplexing (POLMUX) of the input signals. To make POLMUX along with a high Raman gain and suppressed PDG possible, we suggest herein a technique for de-correlation of pump and signal SOPs based on a two-scale periodically <b>spun</b> <b>fibre</b> Raman amplifier (SFRA) [1 – 3]. The practical implementation of the obtained results can be in an extension of the transmission distance and reducing complexity of the fibre Raman amplifier-based un-repeatered high-capacity transmission systems...|$|E
40|$|Images of a {{clean and}} green New Zealand {{environment}} are no longer enough to satisfy increasingly sophisticated customers that are demanding validation of environmental sustainability claims. This paper reports the findings of research that developed a detailed inventory of resource inputs for New Zealand merino wool and assessed its total energy use profile relative to other textiles. Total energy use was studied using LCA methodology. The system boundary included the production and use of all farm inputs, wool processing and shipping wool top to China. Total on-farm energy use average 890 MJ/ha and 230 MJ/stock unit (s. u.). Fuel and electricity accounted for 50 % of total farm energy use, fertiliser 36 %, purchased feed and agrichemicals 5 %, and capital 9 %. Total energy productivity per tonne of wool is very dependant upon the allocation methodology. Resource allocation was base on mass, being the only underlying physical property common to all economic farm outputs. Wool top landed in China consumes 48, 100 MJ/tonne dry top. An economic allocation model increases the energy footprint to 76, 575 MJ/tonne dry top. In the merino wool life cycle from farm to spinning mill in China on-farm inputs account for 52 % of total energy use, wool processing 45 % and transport is just 3 %. Results of this study show that New Zealand merino wool production consumes 42 % of the energy need to manufacture polyester, 30 % of acrylic and just 21 % of the energy need to manufacture nylon to the <b>spun</b> <b>fibre</b> stage. New Zealand merino fibre production and early stage processing uses significantly less energy than synthetic fibres...|$|E

50|$|Hydroentanglement is {{sometimes}} known as spunlacing, this term arising because the early nonwovens were entangled on conveyors with a patterned weave {{which gave the}} nonwovens a lacy appearance. It can also {{be regarded as a}} two-dimensional equivalent of <b>spinning</b> <b>fibres</b> into yarns prior to weaving. The water pressure has a direct bearing on the strength of the web, and very high pressures not only entangle but can also split fibres into micro- and nano-fibres which give the resulting hydroentangled nonwoven a leatherlike or even silky texture. This type of nonwoven can be as strong and tough as woven fabrics made from the same fibres.|$|R

Since PZT fibres form active elements within a functional device, fibre characterisation and optimisation is essential. Several commercially available fibres have been studied, which are representative of two dominant processing routes currently utilised: extrusion and suspension <b>spinning.</b> <b>Fibres</b> have been characterised in terms of morphology (shape factor and diameter variability), microstructure (grain size and porosity), and phase composition (XRD).

40|$|The {{birefringence}} {{properties of}} single-mode optical-fibre waveguides are discussed. A fibre birefringence measurement {{system has been}} developed specifically to measure the birefringence of fibres {{as a function of}} temperature, wavelength, twist and bending. By incorporating a birefringence modulator into the system, the measurement speed and sensitivity is substantially increased, particularly for low birefringences. The <b>fibre</b> <b>spinning</b> technique has been invented to provide a means of manufacturing ultra-low birefringence fibres with extremely high yield. It is shown that spinning averages the intrinsic local birefringence to produce very low overall retardation. A coupled-mode analysis to describe the birefringence properties of <b>spun</b> and twisted <b>fibres</b> is developed and confirmed experimentally. It is now possible to manufacture ultra-low birefringence fibres routinely. The coupled-mode analysis is subsequently extended to treat the effects of bending, twist and magnetic fields on both linearly- and circularly-birefringent fibres. The predictions are subsequently confirmed experimentally and a thorough understanding of extrinsic effects on fibre birefringence has been established. The design criteria of polarisation maintaining fibres are discussed. A novel technique is also described for the measurement of polarisation mode-dispersion, based on the variation of birefringence with wavelength. The dramatic reduction of polarisation-dispersion achieved by spinning is demonstrated, thereby indicating the high suitability of <b>spun</b> <b>fibres</b> to high-bandwidth communications. The separate identification of the stress and waveguide effects contributing to the intrinsic fibre birefringence has been achieved by observing the changes in birefringence as a function of wavelength and temperature...|$|R
