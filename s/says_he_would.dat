5|$|Though Kikai {{started to}} {{photograph}} in Asakusa {{simply because it}} was near where he then lived, he has continued {{because of the nature}} of the place and its visitors.

25|$|Lee was {{an early}} {{influence}} on physician and human rights activist H. Jack Geiger. They met in 1940 when Geiger, a 14-year-old middle-class Jewish runaway, was backstage at a Broadway production of Native Son. Lee agreed to take Geiger in {{when he showed up}} at his door in Harlem asking for a place to stay. With the consent of his parents, Geiger stayed with Lee for over a year. Lee took on the role of surrogate father and introduced Geiger to Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, and Adam Clayton Powell. Geiger eventually became a journalist, then a doctor who co-founded the first community health center in the United States, Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He became a founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Human Rights, and established community health centers in Mississippi and South Africa. Geiger <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never have moved so deeply in these worlds so quickly if not for his experiences with Canada Lee.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, it is {{revealed}} that Dennis and Gavin {{are still in}} contact. After another six weeks, Margaret visits Sharon, saying that Gavin is acting strangely, but Sharon dismisses this and sends Margaret away. Later, Gavin tells Kathy he has Dennis so she reluctantly gets {{in his car and}} is seen leaving by Buster Briggs (Karl Howman). Sharon sees that Dennis has been in contact with Gavin and Buster tells Sharon what he saw so, fearing for Kathy's safety, they get Gavin's address from Dennis. Kathy and Gavin arrive at a large country house that he bought with Sharon's money, and he locks them in, saying they can live there together. Kathy realises that Dennis is not there, and then Margaret arrives. Gavin locks Kathy in a room as Margaret and Gavin argue, and Margaret knocks Gavin unconscious and lets Kathy out of the room. Gavin regains consciousness and the women try to escape. As Sharon and Buster arrive, a woman falls onto the windscreen of the car and lies dead on the floor. Sharon realises it is Margaret, and she and Buster break into the house where Buster finds Kathy while Sharon confronts Gavin, who is packing a bag with cash. Sharon locks the door and Gavin insists that Margaret's death was an accident. Sharon asks him why he stayed in contact with Dennis when she paid him to stay away, so he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never harm his grandson. She tells him to give himself up to the police and if he does so, she will visit him in prison with Dennis and they can be a family when he gets released. Police and paramedics then arrive, as Sharon called them and Gavin accuses her of stalling until they arrived, but she insists she called them for Margaret's sake. Gavin says he will give himself up to the police so Sharon unlocks the bedroom door, but he then tries to escape. He sees his only way out is via the balcony but he is too scared of harming himself to jump. Sharon joins him on the balcony and he asks Sharon to tell the police that Margaret fell. A police officer then arrives on the balcony and Gavin grabs Sharon, threatening to jump, killing them both. Sharon says he could never kill himself so he lets her go and she tells him it is over between them. Gavin is then arrested.|$|E

500|$|Chet and {{his brother}} rarely visit their mother after she checks into hospital, {{and when they do}} Chet cannot bring himself to tell her he loves her. [...] She suffers a fall {{down a flight of stairs}} there when confusedly {{wandering}} around and dies after being bedridden and incoherent for a short time. [...] Chet makes excuse after excuse to turn Sky away when she tries to spend time with him. [...] The story ends with Chet refusing to accompany Sky to the fair because he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather listen to his new Kiss album.|$|E
500|$|In the hatch, Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Ana-Luc√≠a (Michelle Rodriguez) {{interrogate}} [...] "Henry Gale" [...] (Michael Emerson). After Henry's new cover-up {{story is}} proved false, Henry finally {{admits that he}} is indeed an Other, but <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be killed if he talks. Later, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) confronts the prisoner, demanding {{to know if he}} let himself be caught, thinking it might have been to find the Swan. [...] "Henry", however, calls the hatch a [...] "joke", saying that during the lockdown, he never entered the numbers into the computer or pushed the button; he simply stood there, and watched the timer's numbers turn to red hieroglyphs before they reset back on their own. Locke, however, replies angrily that Henry is lying, but he replies that he's [...] "done lying".|$|E
500|$|Adamson also {{desired to}} make the film larger in scale; [...] "I've gained {{confidence}} having gone through the first. This time, I {{was able to go}} larger [...] scale, with more extras and bigger battle scenes." [...] Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to attack the castle, a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz's castle was created. Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original. Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian's conflict and Edmund's maturity, in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama. Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes, asking his young male actors not to perform angrily. Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by [...] "tell people {{at the end of the}} scene, 'Now just give me something where you're not thinking about anything.' By using it in context, the audience will read an emotion into it." ...|$|E

500|$|Hours later, Shona re-enters {{the room}} with English [...] Hugo (Whitehall). The pair sit on 9C and share a can of Carling while {{swapping}} travel stories. Hugo <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather stay in this carriage than in first class, and the pair begin foreplay. A face appears from 9B, and a man (Glaves) falls to the floor. The carriage's inhabitants wake; Maxwell confirms that the man is dead, then leaves {{to look for a}} guard. Jorg finds a family photo in the man's pocket. Maxwell returns alone, and Jorg suggests they use the emergency stop button; Les prepares to smash the glass. Hugo stops him, confessing he is ticketless, Maxwell says he has an interview with the WHO in the morning, and Les, to Kath's annoyance, confesses that {{he does not want to}} risk missing the wedding. Maxwell explains the situation to Jorg, Les and Kath argue, and Shona refuses to let Hugo back into her bunk. Maxwell gives Jorg some tablets for his constipation, after which Shona offers a eulogy. The body is placed into 9B, and Hugo climbs into the same bunk. The passengers settle, but Kath lies sleepless.|$|E
500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position‚Äîon balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark <b>Says</b> <b>He</b> <b>Would</b> Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

He's also the oldest and best looking Lost Boy.|$|E
2500|$|Carlson {{is known}} for his unusually casual style of {{conversation}} which entails ending most sentences with [...] "man." [...] GQ magazine described him as [...] "the last hipster dude."

2500|$|In 2009, Carlson {{was again}} asked by Trotter to host {{an evening of}} world-famous chefs. This time Trotter insisted on paying and Carlson survived the evening without incident.
