40|$|Effective {{delivery}} of indivisible bulky and heavy loads whose weight can reach hundreds tons {{is of particular}} importance for development of various sectors of economy and support of defense capability. <b>Special</b> <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> provide open <b>road</b> transportation and off-road haulage {{of this kind of}} goods, but in difficult traffic environment their using capabilities are significantly restricted by a lack of the road-ability. For a <b>road</b> <b>train</b> to reach the better road-ability is possible by increasing the number of drive wheels. This can be achieved through the use of an activetrailer as its part. The effectiveness of using this drive may be estimated through comparison of the <b>road</b> <b>train</b> road-ability with the turned on and turned off passive and active semitrailer in different road environment. A mathematical model of the dynamics of the two-link semitrailer truck was created {{to solve the problem of}} comparing dynamic characteristics of the <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> with the passive and active semitrailer. The developed mathematical model of the four-axle tractor and three-axle semitrailer was implemented in the MATLAB® Simulink. It was revealed that in some traffic environments it is advisable to disable the semitrailer drive. A drive control algorithm of semitrailer wheels based on the analysis of the forces in the coupling device was proposed. Data from the sensors installed in the pin of the coupling device serve as a primary source of information for the control system. Test runs enabled us to define control limits for the drive control system. The article considers three cases to use the power of traction motors of the semitrailer in a predetermined range. A number of numerical experiments have been conducted to define dynamic qualities of the <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> in different cases of using semitrailer power. The analysis of results allowed us to draw conclusion that using a system of the semitrailer drive to be connected enables increasing efficiency of the <b>road</b> <b>train</b> when moving in difficult road environment...|$|R
50|$|A <b>special</b> <b>road</b> is the {{official}} classification of motorways in the United Kingdom. For a road to become a <b>special</b> <b>road,</b> it must have a Statutory Instrument sanctioned under the Highways Act 1980. A road {{which is not a}} <b>special</b> <b>road</b> is termed an all-purpose road. The vast majority of the roads in the UK are all-purpose <b>roads.</b> Most <b>special</b> <b>roads</b> are motorways.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{majority}} of <b>special</b> <b>roads</b> in the UK are also motorways, {{there are a number}} of <b>special</b> <b>roads</b> that are not motorways. Quite a number of these are toll bridges, and several others are former motorways which have since been downgraded. In order to charge a toll on a newly built <b>road,</b> <b>special</b> <b>road</b> regulations are usually necessary.|$|R

50|$|The road is dual {{carriageway}} standard throughout, including emergency laybys and hard shoulders in areas. The road is classed as a <b>special</b> <b>road</b> in legal terms.

50|$|In addition, a {{small number}} of non-motorway <b>special</b> <b>roads</b> are {{relatively}} newly built dual-carriageway roads, such as the A1 Dual Carriageway east of Edinburgh and parts of the A720 Edinburgh bypass, or parts of the A55 in North Wales. These particular roads have many of the same regulations as motorways, apart from the speed limit regulations, since that only applies to <b>special</b> <b>roads</b> which are also motorways. The usual speed limit regulations that apply to all-purpose roads do not apply to <b>special</b> <b>roads,</b> so a non-motorway <b>special</b> <b>road</b> must define a speed limit as part of its Statutory Instrument.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{different}} type of double <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> are selected as simulation model, which is commonly used in developed countries and regions {{in order to improve}} the efficiency of road transport and the development of China's logistics industry. The passing ability simulation model of double <b>road</b> <b>train</b> is established based on Auto Turn, and China's current longest tractor-semitrailer is used as a comparison. Simulation models of highway ramp, first class highway and second class highway are established according to the requirement of JTG D 20 - 2006 ‘Design Specification for Highway Alignment’. Adaptability of double <b>road</b> <b>train</b> and highway structure parameter is researched by analyzing {{different type}}s of double <b>road</b> <b>train</b> turn left, turn right and turn around on the road.
