40|$|Abstract: In Bangladesh, jute mills are {{producing}} conventional yarns heavier than 275 tex. These {{are used as}} hessian, sacking, carpet backing cloth etc. For diversified uses of jute it is most essential to produce medium count yarn of 241 to 275 tex. In this regard, <b>slip</b> <b>draft</b> spinning machine has been studied. This machine is capable to produce yarn of 241 to 280 tex at flyer speed of 2900 rpm to 4850 rpm. But there is a relation between flyer speed and yarn breakages of the machine. In addition spinning efficiency of the machine also depends on the yarn breakages. Through a series of experiment, a relation has been established between flyer speed and yarn breakages of the experimental machine for production of jute yarn...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the slip}} {{indicator}} {{was designed and}} constructed {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the slippage of the tractor powered wheel during the operation of plowing and of applying the output signal to control the draft force acting on the plow. In the previous work conducted by one of the authors, two AC generators were attached to front and rear wheels of the tractor to detect their rotational speed, and the slippage was calculated from the output voltage signal proportional to the rotational speed of the wheels. In the use of this type of slip sensor, some difficulty was found in adjusting and resetting the voltage corresponding to the zero slippage, depending on the running gear prior to the operation. A different type of slip sensor was therefore designed and constructed to remedy this disadvantage. The photo-electric type pulse generator was used to detect the rotational speed of both front and rear wheels through the mechanical amplification by use of gears to obtain the required numbers of pulses per unit rotation of the wheel. The number of pulses generated from the wheels was converted to the frequency and then to the voltage. This output voltage was compared to the set voltage which corresponds to the set slippage. In turn this is properly determined from the relationship between the slippage and the pulling froce expressing the different shape due to the soil condition and running device. The difference between the output voltage and set voltage was amlified. Then the relay connected to the hydraulic directional valve to control lifting and lowering the implement mounted on the three point linkage moved on off, depending on the voltage difference. The slippage calculated from the difference indicated through the monitoring device mounted on the platform located in front of operator's seat. This monitoring device worked quite satisfactorily to help the operator in knowing how much draft force was acting on the implement through the indicated value of the slippage. The field test was done to validate the accurate response and action of the implement under <b>slip</b> <b>draft</b> control in two kinds of fields, sandy and paddy, after harvesting of rice. Through the satisfactory result of the field experiments, it was observed that this type of <b>slip</b> <b>draft</b> control system described here would be possible to apply to a commercial tractor without much modification and improvements. No problems of cost, accuracy or durability for practical use were found...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of a large number}} of marginal and small land holdings in India has rendered the power tiller to be the most suitable farm equipment for field operations, in view of its compact size, profitability and versatility, but the transport work which is also required to carry the farm produce is yet to be proved. Keeping these in mind, user friendly software was developed for predicting the haulage performance of power tiller to meet requirements in educational and research organizations. The developed software requires input parameters such as power tiller, trolley and operating conditions. The developed software was validated by conducting experiments with a 6. 7 kW power tiller using a suitable trolley on tarmacadam road at various payloads and road slopes. The <b>draft,</b> <b>slip,</b> fuel consumption and speed were measured and other haulage performance parameters were calculated based on measured values to validate the developed software. The results simulated by software indicate lower <b>draft</b> and <b>slip</b> in the range of 1 - 23 and 2 - 9 % with respect to the experimental data, however, higher transport productivity was in the range of 3 - 12 %...|$|R
5000|$|Murray played minor hockey {{with the}} Philadelphia Jr. Flyers {{until the age}} of 16. At 16 years of age, Murray left home for Youngstown, Ohio, to play for the North American Hockey League's Youngstown Phantoms. He played in 21 games that season. For the next two seasons, Murray played for the United States Hockey League's Sioux Falls Stampede, where his {{teammates}} included T.J. Oshie, Andreas Nodl, Jay Barriball and Alex Kangas. In his first season with Sioux Falls, Murray had a dismal record of 7-13-2 and a goals-against average of 3.24 but he still managed to have a save percentage of [...]902%, thanks mostly to one shutout. The next season, Murray had a GAA of 2.14 while allowing only 68 goals, the same as he did the year before, as well as a much-improved record of 23-7-1 and three shutouts. He also had a save percentage of [...]930%, both of which were second-best in the USHL that season. Murray and teammate Alex Kangas found themselves both ranked in the Final Central Scouting for the 2006 NHL Entry Draft for North American goaltenders with Kangas ranked tenth and Murray ranked 22nd. (Both had <b>slipped</b> through the <b>draft</b> the year before.) Kangas was chosen 135th overall by the Atlanta Thrashers but Murray was not drafted.|$|R
5000|$|Construction {{of the new}} {{bank was}} by {{contractor}} Mr Kelleher {{under the supervision of}} Eyre and Munro. It opened for business on Monday 13 May 1889, and was described as [...] "handsome and very pleasing, an imposing structure, superior to anything north of Brisbane" [...] and overshadowing the adjacent Bank of Australasia (no longer extant). While the Northern Miner newspaper reported the cost at £9,000, the bank's archives indicated £6,040. The new building was seen as the way forward in both structure and location. The inclusion of a commodious manager's private apartment was usual for regional banks.On the ground floor the building comprised banking chamber, fitted handsomely in polished cedar, {{the upper part of the}} various partitions being in ornamental ground glass...ample room for the public in front of the counter for the transaction of business, and a table... placed there for the accommodation of those who may desire to fill in deposit <b>slips,</b> requisitions for <b>drafts,</b> &c; a counter...14 ft long by 4ft 6 in x 1.4m wide, with the bill department on the right, and the exchange clerks' office on the left; ledger desks...placed at the back of the counter. To the left of the main entrance to the public hall is the manager's room, ...and opening out of that is the accountant's office... which has a raised floor, so that the official, by simply standing up, can get a good view of all that is going on. There is a passage leading from the manager's room to the dining-room, which, with the exception of the kitchen and servants' offices is the only one of the private apartments on the ground floor. At the rear of the ledger-desks are the strong room (fireproof), a lavatory and a stationery-room. Leaving the dining-room, we come to the private hall, which is approached from the passage to the left of the building. The upper floor is reached by a staircase from this hall...and contains a handsome drawing room...communicating by folding doors with another large room...which will be used by Mr Beattie for his own bedroom. There are three other bedrooms and a dressing room, all of large dimensions, with linen closet and a bathroom. The upper part of the building has a balcony running around three sides...and the internal passages are all proportionately spacious. The servants' quarters on the ground floor comprise kitchen, pantry, wash-house and sleeping apartment, and are furnished with the usual appurtenances for cooking and washing. Stabling has yet to be erected. Gas is laid on in every room and provision is made: for the Burdekin water supply when that scheme is complete. In the meantime there are three 1000 gallon litres tanks all full. The chimney-pieces and other fittings are in cedar, and are in excellent taste. All the rooms are ceiled, with mouldings, &c., of elegant design, and ventilation and drainage have been specially attended to.'An economic downturn occurred in 1888, during the construction of the bank, due to a decrease in overseas investment and a continuing drought which led to the closure of crushing machines due to lack of water. The slump was short-lived after the development of the Brilliant Reef, which when mined to a depth of 3000 feet (914 m), became the biggest producer in the field.|$|R
