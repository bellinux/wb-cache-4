40|$|Abstract: More than 70 % of {{the world}} oil and gas are {{domiciled}} in unconsolidated reservoir rocks with {{a high risk of}} sand production. To manage the sanding problem it is important to answer such questions as “will the reservoir fail?”, “when will it fail?”, “what volume of sand will it produce? ” and “where will the sand come from – from the <b>sand</b> <b>face</b> or from the reservoir rock matrix? ” In order to predict whether sand production will be problematic, the Sand Management Research Team at The Robert Gordon University has developed a three-fold approach the details of which are presented in this paper. Firstly, two alternative methodologies have been adopted for evaluating the failure potential of reservoir sand. Secondly, an estimate of sand production volumes and rates as a function of reservoir management policy, operational procedures and time is required with the caveat that sand failure is not equal to sand production. Thirdly, it is operationally optimal to have this done in real time, and over the life cycle of the field. A critical issue for accurate sanding quantification is the precise prediction of stress magnitudes and orientation with varying reservoir pressure depletion. The Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope is deployed in this tool to model rock failure based on the critical porosity concept. In the alternate approach, Neural networks have consequently been used to develop models for predicting both UCS and grain size distribution i...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} the dynamic interactions between multiphase flow in the reservoir {{and that in the}} wellbore remains surprisingly weak. The classical way of dealing with these interactions is via inflow performance relationships (IPR's), where the inflow from the reservoir is related to the pressure {{at the bottom of the}} well, which is a function of the multiphase flow behaviour in the well. Steady-state IPR's are normally adopted, but their use may be erroneous when transient multiphase flow conditions occur. Transient multiphase flow in the wellbore causes problems in well test interpretation when the well is shut-in at surface and the bottomhole pressure is measured. Pressure build-up (PBU) data recorded during a test can be dominated by transient wellbore effects (e. g. phase change, flow reversal and re-entry of the denser phase into the producing zone), making it difficult to distinguish between true reservoir features and transient wellbore artefacts. This paper introduces a method to derive the transient IPR's at bottomhole conditions in order to link the wellbore to the reservoir during PBU. A commercial numerical simulator was used to build a simplified reservoir model (single well, radial co-ordinates, homogeneous rock properties) using published data from a gas condensate field in the North Sea. In order to exclude wellbore effects from the investigation of the transient inflow from the reservoir, the simulation of the wellbore was omitted from the model. Rather than the traditional flow rate at surface conditions, bottomhole pressure was imposed to constrain the simulation. This procedure allowed the flow rate at the <b>sand</b> <b>face</b> to be different from zero during the early times of the PBU, even if the surface flow rate is equal to zero. As a result, a transient IPR at bottomhole conditions was obtained for the given field case and for a specific set of time intervals, time steps and bottomhole pressure. In order to validate the above simulation approach, a preliminary evaluation of the required experimental set-up was carried out. The set-up would allow the investigation of the dynamic interaction between the reservoir, the near-wellbore region and the well, represented by a pressured vessel, a cylindrical porous medium and a vertical pipe, respectively.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A reservoir management strategy has been developed for a field located in eastern Venezuela. The field contains deep, high pressure, multilayer reservoirs. A thorough formation evaluation was accomplished using the log data, core data, PVT data, geologic data, well completion data and the production data. A reservoir simulation model was built to forecast reservoir performance for a variety of exploitation and well completion strategies. Reserve forecasts have been made using the reservoir model. The methodology applied in this research consists of eight tasks: 1) build a data base with existing data, 2) analyze the log and core data, 3) analyze the pressure and production data, 4) analyze the PVT data, 5) analyze the hydraulic fracture treatments, 6) build the reservoir model, 7) determine the possible reservoir management strategies, and 8) perform economic evaluations for the management strategies. While much of the data for the field studied was supplied by PDVSA, we did not receive all of the data we requested. For example, no pressure buildup data were available. When necessary, we used correlations to determine values for reservoir data that we were not supplied. In this research four formations were studied and characterized, determining porosity and permeability values. Also, fracture treatments were analyzed and a reservoir model was developed. Runs for black oil and volatile oil were performed. The results show that the upper zones are the most prospective areas, but fracture treatments must be performed to reduce the damage on the <b>sand</b> <b>face.</b> Lower formations (Cretaceous) have a lower permeability value, but high OOIP that justify performing fracture treatments and completing this zone. Economics were developed to support this conclusion. Optimum well spacing was calculated showing that 960 acres is the optimum well spacing, but also that 640 acres can be maintained for all the reservoirs and dual completions can be performed, first hydraulic fracturing and completing the Cretaceous formation, and then, completing any upper zone. Reservoir simulation results show that up to 31 % of OOIP may be incrementally recovered by hydraulic fracturing the Cretaceous formation and 10 or less from the upper zones...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLarge deep saline {{aquifers}} {{are present}} in different sedimentary basins throughout the world. The storage potential in these reservoirs is estimated at several thousands Gt CO 2. The selection among {{the large number of}} prospective saline aquifers for CO 2 sequestration can be expedited with analytical correlations which can be used in place of a full field reservoir modeling and simulation study for each and every saline reservoir. The effectiveness of any CO 2 sequestration operation depends on pore volume and the sequestration efficiency of the saline reservoir. Sequestration efficiency is defined here as the maximum storage with minimum risk of leakage to the overlying reservoirs and to the surface. This can be categorized using three variables: time the plume takes to reach the top seal of the storage formation, maximum lateral distance the plume travels and the percentage of mobile CO 2 present at any time. A database has been created by performing a large number of compositional reservoir simulation studies for different elementary reservoir parameters. A single set of relative permeability curves is used in all simulation cases to maintain the consistency of the simulation parameters. A constant pressure far-field boundary is enforced by putting a number of producers at the boundary of the reservoir producing at constant bottom hole flowing pressure. This database is used to formulate different correlations that relate the sequestration efficiency to reservoir properties and operating conditions. The various elementary reservoir parameters are grouped into a dimensionless ratio of gravity forces and viscous forces. This ”gravity number” can be calculated for any saline reservoir without performing any simulation study, which makes it handy to use in different analytical models with various risk parameters. We improve the correlation for time to hit top seal proposed by Kumar and develop correlations for other two risk parameters by assuming radial grid system in place of Cartesian grid system. We find that normalizing all risk parameters with their respective characteristic values yields reasonable correlations with different variants of dimensionless gravity number. The characteristic values are determined with a characteristic flow speed equal to its value at the <b>sand</b> <b>face.</b> All correlations confirm the physics behind plume movement in a reservoir. For low gravity number displacement the plume travels preferentially in lateral direction due to high viscous forces and contacts more rock and brine volume, resulting in more trapping and less risk. On the other hand a high gravity number allows the plume to move faster in vertical direction due to strong gravity forces. This causes less interaction time and volume of resident brine and rock and results in less trapping of CO 2. These analytical correlations are useful in characterizing a saline reservoir in terms of its sequestration efficiency without any reservoir simulation study, which in turn reduces the cost and time for commissioning a geological site for CO 2 sequestration...|$|E
