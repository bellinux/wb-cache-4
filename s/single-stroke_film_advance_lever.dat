5000|$|The camera {{offers the}} {{convenience}} of image composition with wide open aperture. The aperture is stopped down to the selected value after the shutter is released. After exposure the mirror stays up until the bottom-mounted <b>single-stroke</b> <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> is again wound. Focusing is via a ground glass screen with a central split-image rangefinder.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in late 1985, the Super was {{identical}} in basic {{shape and size}} to the previous model and accepted the same lenses. Many improvements and changes were included to make this model arguably a better camera than the previous Auto 110. Film winding was improved with a <b>single-stroke</b> <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> that advanced the film and cocked the shutter in one winding (the Auto 110 took two strokes to advance the film). A switch around the shutter release button enabled a new ten-second self-timer mode and a shutter lock; the self-timer activated a red light on the pentaprism housing, which flashed during the 10-second shutter release count-down. A button on the front on the user's left hand side gave a +1.5 EV (exposure value) backlit scene exposure compensation.|$|E
50|$|The Asahi Optical Company took a {{different}} manufacturing path, inspired by the German SLRs. Its first model, the Asahiflex I, existed in prototype form in 1951 and production in 1952, making it the first Japanese-built 35mm SLR. The Asahiflex IIB of 1954 was the first Japanese SLR with an instant-return mirror. Previously, the mirror would remain up and the viewfinder black until the shutter was cocked for the next shot. In 1957, the Asahi Pentax became the first Japanese fixed-pentaprism SLR; its success led Asahi to eventually rename itself Pentax. This was the first SLR to use the right-hand <b>single-stroke</b> <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> of the Leica M3 of 1954 and Nikon S2 of 1955. Asahi (starting with the Asahi Pentax) and many other camera makers used the M42 lens mount from the Contax S, which {{came to be called}} the Pentax screw mount. Pentax is now part of the Ricoh Corporation.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Pen F had a double-stroke <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> and {{a distinctive}} logo rendered in a gothic font. The later Pen FT added a <b>single-stroke</b> <b>film</b> <b>advance,</b> and an uncoupled, integrated light meter, which used {{a system of}} exposure numbers rather than f-stops. The exposure numbers {{were added to the}} aperture rings of later Pen F lenses; the rings could be pulled out and rotated to show conventional f-stops instead. A side-effect of the FT's light meter was a dimmer viewfinder. The Pen FV was essentially a Pen FT with the light meter deleted and the F's brighter viewfinder reinstated.|$|R
5000|$|FED 2e is a FED 3b {{with the}} FED 2d shutter {{that does not}} have the slow speeds. Similar to the 3b, it does not have strap lugs but has a <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Production ended around 1970.|$|R
50|$|The Exakta 66 {{is based}} on the Pentacon Six but was made in West Germany by Exakta GmbH, Nuremberg. The body is rubber coated, the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> moves through a shorter angle, and it has a TTL-metered prism coupled to new Schneider lenses.|$|R
50|$|The OM-1n {{is similar}} to the OM-1MD, with a {{redesigned}} <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> a flash ready/sufficient flash LED in the viewfinder, and automatic flash synchronization (X-sync), regardless of the position of the FP/X switch when used with a T-series flash unit mounted on Flash Shoe 4.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon F-301 {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first Nikon SLR sold that lacked a <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> As a result the {{selector}} knob, also used to lock the shutter button, has a continuous option {{in addition to the}} single shot. It was also the first Nikon SLR to feature DX film decoding.|$|R
5000|$|This {{redesign}} {{made a new}} {{camera case}} design necessary, leaving additional space for the frame counter, and the frame reset slider. The Retina Reflex cases were already something special before since the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> (Reflex) and aperture/shutter setting wheel (Reflex S) are located on the bottom. The photo shows just how complex the Retina case had become.|$|R
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the {{film rewind knob}} with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the <b>film</b> (<b>advance)</b> release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> the back release latch, and the film rewind release button.|$|R
50|$|It has {{the typical}} big finder of the Optima series, {{but on this}} special model it is {{combined}} with a superimposed coupled rangefinder. Shutter speed is controlled electronically by a CdS meter, with speeds from 15 sec. to 1/1000 sec. A special feature of the series is the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> which can be switched to also rewind the film at its end.|$|R

Leather carrying case was {{included with the}} camera. A 29.5 mm skylight filter {{is attached to the}} lens. The lever on the left of the lens at 9 o' clock is the self-timer actuator. Construction of the body is all-metal, including the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> at the bottom. The lens mounting plate is rectangular ...|$|R
50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{model was}} the Diax Ia for interchangeable lenses, with 3 different viewfinders in the top, each {{in a different}} color: blue for 35mm lenses, yellow for 85 or 90mm lenses and neutral for 45 or 50 mm lenses. The Diax II, Diax IIa and Diaxette models were rangefinder cameras. The b models were like the a models, but with a rapid <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The Diax system also included 10 lens types covering 6 focal lengths with a common filter thread size of 40.5mm.|$|R
5000|$|The M2 was {{considered}} to be a more affordable, simplified version of the 1954 Leica M3. Notably, the frame counter of the M2 was composed of a disk plate beneath the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> that had to be manually reset to zero after reloading. This system was close to that of the Leica III series, and unlike that of the M3, which is an independent frame counter, visible through a window in the top plate, that automatically resets to zero when the film take-up spool is removed.|$|R
50|$|The Leica MP is Leica's {{latest film}} {{rangefinder}} camera. Unlike the preceding Leica M7, the camera has adopted many retro design features {{from the earlier}} M3. These include a M3 type metal <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> knob <b>film</b> rewind design and M3 type frameline adjust lever. The basic classic design remains unchanged and the design for loading film from the bottom has been retained. The camera comes in various camera finishes including black chrome, black paint and silver chrome and can be further customised with Leica AG's à la carte program.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, the FTb {{design was}} revised slightly. The camera {{was given a}} plastic tipped <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The stop down lever was changed to the same style as that found on the F-1. The PC sync socket was given a {{spring-loaded}} plastic cover. The ring around {{the outer edge of}} the shutter speed dial was changed from a scalloped design to a diamond textured design. Finally, a shutter speed display was added in the lower left hand corner of the viewfinder. This model was unofficially known as FTb-N or FTbn.|$|R
50|$|Much work {{went into}} human factors {{engineering}} {{to create an}} ergonomic user interface for the camera. The form of previous cameras was largely dictated by the required locations of mechanical controls on the body, such as the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> rewind crank, shutter speed dial, shutter release, etc. On the T90, the film transport control is no longer required, while the others are no longer mechanically linked. This gave the designers more freedom to shape the camera {{to make it easier}} to control and hold, and to place controls in a way that suited the user rather than a mechanical design.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} 30 years {{the vast majority}} of SLRs standardized the layout of the controls. The film was transported from left to right, so the rewind crank was on the left, followed in order by the pentaprism, shutter speed dial, shutter release and the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> which in some cameras was ratcheted so that multiple strokes could be used to <b>advance</b> the <b>film.</b> Some cameras, such as Nikon's Nikkormat FT cameras (marketed under the brand-name 'Nikormat' in European countries and elsewhere) and some models of Olympus OM series, deviated from this layout by placing the shutter speed control as a ring around the lens mount.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{combination}} of design elements that made the Nikon F successful. It featured interchangeable prisms and focusing screens; the camera had a depth-of-field preview button; the mirror had lock-up capability; it featured a large bayonet mount and a large lens release button; a <b>single-stroke</b> ratcheted <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> lever; a titanium-foil focal plane shutter; various types of flash synchronization; a rapid rewind lever; a fully removable back. it was a well-made, extremely durable camera, and adhered closely to the then current, successful design scheme of the Nikon rangefinder cameras.|$|R
5000|$|The {{photograph}} above {{shows the}} external flash connection socket {{in the upper}} right corner. The red lever selects among M, F, and X flash synchronizations. The shutter button is barely visible over the letter [...] "h" [...] of [...] "Ricoh." [...] The two large knobs are designed to let the user's two index fingers rapidly focus the camera while following basketball players or other rapidly moving subjects. The wired mount for an external flash unit {{is shown in the}} center of the top view of the camera. The rapid <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> shown in the bottom view pivots on its right end and is pulled by the extension (shown folded out of the way) near the lens barrel. The bottom view also shows a reminder ring for noting the speed of the film currently in use.|$|R
50|$|The Pentax 6×7, {{designated}} product model number of 23400 by Asahi Pentax, {{is similar to}} any traditional 35mm SLR camera except in size. The hefty camera with a general dimension body of 7.25 inches × 4.5 inches × 3.75 inches / 18 cm × 11 cm × 9.5 cm and with the standard prism and 105 mm lens would bring it to 7.5 inches × 5.75 inches × 6.5inches / 18 cm × 14.5 cm × 17 cm. Users familiar with the diminutive cousins would find the Pentax 6×7 an easy transition due to {{the layout of the}} camera. Differing only in the location of the shutter speed knob as it is located on the left hand top. Location of the lens release is {{on the left side of}} the mirror housing, the shutter release and <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> are located on the right-hand side of the top. As naming conventions implies, the 6×7 indicates that this is a medium format camera and the negative produced is 6 cm by 7 cm (actual format 56mm X 70mm) and additionally the successors 67 and 67II remain the same format. The Pentax 6×7 has the ability to use either the 120 or 220 roll film, which produces ten or twenty respectively (twenty-one for the 1969 version). A small slotted selector on the right-hand side next under the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> of the camera selects the film type (properly operated when film door is opened prior to selecting), and also the film pressure plate inside has positions for either type, the thickness of the films being different as it passes the 'main roller' towards the 'take-up' spool. The pressure plate also maintains film flatness in this horizontal design during exposure, aiding the extreme sharpness across the entire image for which the camera is renowned. Other systems use film tension alone, or against rails at the film's edge, in more compact vertical-feed magazines found in 6×6 or 6×4.5 formats. The synonymous or standard equipment includes the Super Takumar and later the Super-Multi-Coated TAKUMAR/6×7 1:2.4 f=105 lens and the pentaprism finder that allows for the 'through-the-lens actual image (90% of actual area) of what is being composed.|$|R
50|$|The EF used {{a unique}} shutter among Canon's 35mm SLRs: a Copal Square vertical-travel metal blade focal plane shutter. Unusually, long {{exposures}} (from 1 second to 30 seconds) were electronically controlled, while shorter ones (1/1000 second to 1/2 second) were mechanically controlled. This was very useful in conserving battery power, and allowed one {{to use the}} camera even with dead batteries. The light metering system's power switch turned on the meter, removed the lock from the shutter trigger button and let the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> pop out 15 degrees from the camera body, all in one flick of the thumb.In the axis of the main switch, a multiple exposure button is located. Pressing this while cocking the shutter prevents <b>advancing</b> the <b>film.</b> The frame counter is also blocked, thus preserving the correct frame count.At the time, most cameras did not support longer exposure times than about one second, without having to use the bulb setting. Maybe this was why Canon placed a red LED {{to the left of}} the pentaprism, and had the LED flashing as long as the electronic shutter timer was running. The LED was also used for battery check.|$|R
5000|$|The first Retina, Nr. 117, was {{introduced}} in late July 1934. The successive model: Nr 118 Retina followed in 1935 with minor modifications to the Nr. 117. The Nr. 119 Retina (I) and the more expensive Nr. 126 Retina (I) follow in 1936. Nr. 117, Nr. 118 and Nr. 119 Retina cameras all had black lacquered top housings, black lacquered body edges and nickel-plated control surfaces. Nr. 126 Retina (I) was the first with a chrome-plated finish to the top housing, chrome-plated top deck below the rewind knob and chrome-plated control surfaces with the body edges being polished aluminum alloy with a clear lacquer coat. Nr. 122 Retina II {{was introduced}} in 1936 with a separate coupled rangefinder and viewfinder and at this point, Nr. 119 and Nr. 126 Retina cameras were designated as [...] "Retina I" [...] cameras. The Nr. 122 Retina II had a problematic <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> and was replaced in June 1937 by the Nr. 142 Retina II with {{a return to the}} knob advance. Nr. 141 Retina I is a chrome finished model with a shutter release on the top body which {{was introduced in}} late 1937. Nr. 143 Retina I was the black lacquer/nickel-plated version of the Nr. 141 Retina I introduced in early 1938. The identification of Retina I cameras is based on the finish and configuration of the top housings of each camera and should NOT be based on lens/shutter or serial number, as lenses, shutters and back doors can be easily interchanged by repairman. In 1939 a Nr. 150 Retina IIa was introduced to replace the Nr. 142 Retina II, but it was unrelated to the flash capable Type 016 Retina IIa series of the early 1950s. Also in 1939, the Nr. 148 Retina I and the Nr. 149 Retina I with double exposure prevention are introduced. Late versions of the Type 148 Retina I have a black lacquer finish to the body edges. The last pre-war Retina I is the Nr. 167 Retina I which was manufactured in July 1941 and was for export only. The Nr. 167 Retina I was a [...] "Retina" [...] version of the Nr. 160 Retinette II with basically the same body, but with [...] "Retina" [...] embossed on the back door and a chrome-plated top housing and chrome-plated deck under the rewind knob.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "n" [...] model had a new, re-contoured <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> {{which had}} smoother, rounded edges {{as opposed to}} the OM2 and OM2MD's <b>advance</b> <b>lever's</b> slimmer and sharper edges.|$|R

50|$|The Tenax was {{modified}} in 1953 with a fixed viewfinder integrated {{in a higher}} top plate with the exposure counter inside it, and a revised <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Soon after it was renamed Taxona, because the East German company had lost the rights to use the traditional Zeiss Ikon names, property of the Western Zeiss Ikon company.
