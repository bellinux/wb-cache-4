5|$|In blood plasma, zinc {{is bound}} to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and {{transferrin}} (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland,</b> prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.|$|E
30|$|The high {{accumulation}} of therapeutic radioligands in the <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> {{may result in}} the frequently observed, undesirable side effect xerostomia. External cooling of the <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> is hypothesized to cause vasoconstriction, reduce blood flow, and decrease PSMA uptake in the <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> to ultimately prevent the <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> for radiation toxicity [5]. Therefore, external cooling of the <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> with icepacks, {{considered to be a}} harmless and well-tolerable procedure, is currently performed in clinical practice [6]. To date however, there has been no established evidence that cooling indeed decreases PSMA uptake in the <b>salivary</b> <b>glands,</b> without additional patient discomfort.|$|R

5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E

5|$|Mup {{genes from}} other mammals also encode {{allergenic}} proteins, for example Feld4 is primarily {{produced in the}} submandibular <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> and is deposited onto dander as the cat grooms itself. A study found that 63% of cat allergic people have antibodies against the protein. Most had higher titres of antibodies against Feld4 than against Feld1, another prominent cat allergen. Likewise, Equc1 (Equus caballus allergen 1) is the protein product of a horse Mup gene that {{is found in the}} liver, sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. It is responsible for about 80% of the antibody response in patients who are chronically exposed to horse allergens.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} debates {{about whether the}} {{original}} gene duplication events occurred in a <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> or in body tissues themselves. The prevailing idea for many years is the birth-and-death model described above, in which genes in other body tissues are duplicated and then recruited to the venom gland before natural selection for toxicity. However, in 2014 a new model {{was proposed in which}} salivary protein genes are duplicated and then restricted to the venom gland. This model does away with the recruitment hypothesis and cites the homology between certain venom and body genes as unrelated in the linear fashion described in the traditional birth-and-death model.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} and {{diseases of the}} thyroid have been noted and treated for thousands of years, although the gland itself has only been described and named since the renaissance. The first recorded mention of the thyroid {{is in terms of}} goitre in Chinese texts circa 2700 BCE, of which there is general agreement. In 1600 BCE burnt sponge and seaweed were used within China for the treatment of goitres, a practice which has developed {{in many parts of the}} world. In Ayurvedic medicine, the book Sushruta Samhita written about 1400 BCE describes hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and goitre. Aristotle and Xenophon in the fifth century BCE describe cases of Grave's disease, which receives its name over two millennia later owing to descriptions provided by Robert James Graves in 1834, Hippocrates and Plato in the fourth century BCE provided some of the first descriptions of the gland itself, proposing its function as a <b>salivary</b> <b>gland.</b> Pliny the Elder in the first century BCE referred to epidemics of goitre in the Alps and proposed treatment with burnt seaweed, a practice also referred to by Galen in the second century, referred to burnt sponge for the treatment of goitre.|$|E
40|$|Malignant {{tumors of the}} <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> {{are rare}} {{malignancies}} {{and most of them}} affect major <b>salivary</b> <b>glands.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze trends in age-standardized incidence rates of major <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> tumors among the Belgrade population. Data were obtained from The Serbian Cancer Registry. We analyzed all cases of malignant tumors of major <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> registered in Belgrade from January 1 st 1999 to December 31 st 2010. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to define trends and annual percentage change (APC). A total number of 283 (168 in men and 115 in women) major <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> tumors were reported to The Registry during the study period. Age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) for entire period and for both sex was 0. 87 / 100. 000 person, 1. 13 for men and 0. 67 for women. ASR increased with APC of 6. 4 % in both sexes (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Background <b>Salivary</b> <b>glands</b> and {{pancreas}} {{are involved}} in saliva secretion, pancreatic fluid secretion and insulin secretion. These functions are essential for proper oral, pancreatic and glucose homeostasis. Aquaporins are water-permeable transmembrane protein involved in the physiology of these secretory gland functions. Scope of review This review gives {{an overview of the}} morphology of <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> and pancreas, the expression and localization of aquaporins, the secretion roles and mechanisms, the physiological roles of aquaporins, and the role of aquaporins in pathophysiological conditions. Major conclusions Several aquaporins are expressed in <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> and pancreas, and some play important physiological roles. Modulation of aquaporin expression and/or trafficking may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases affecting <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> and pancreas glands such as xerostomic conditions, pancreatic insufficiencies and diabetes. General significance Aquaporins {{are involved in}} physiological and pathophysiological processes in <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> and pancreas. They could represent therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases affecting the <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> and pancreas.

25|$|Hyposalivation is a {{clinical}} diagnosis {{that is made}} based on the history and examination, but reduced salivary flow rates have been given objective definitions. <b>Salivary</b> <b>gland</b> hypofunction {{has been defined as}} any objectively demonstrable reduction in whole and/or individual gland flow rates. An unstimulated whole saliva flow rate in a normal person is 0.3–0.4 ml per minute, and below 0.1 ml per minute is significantly abnormal. A stimulated saliva flow rate less than 0.5 ml per gland in 5minutes or less than 1 ml per gland in 10minutes is decreased. The term subjective xerostomia is sometimes used to describe the symptom {{in the absence of any}} detectable abnormality or cause. Xerostomia may also result from a change in composition of saliva (from serous to mucous). <b>Salivary</b> <b>gland</b> dysfunction is an umbrella term for the presence of either xerostomia or <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> hypofunction.|$|E

25|$|Direct {{sympathetic}} innervation of the {{salivary glands}} takes place via preganglionic nerves in the thoracic segments T1-T3 which synapse in the superior cervical ganglion with postganglionic neurons that release norepinephrine, {{which is then}} received by β-adrenergic receptors on the acinar and ductal cells of the salivary glands, leading {{to an increase in}} cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and the corresponding increase of saliva secretion. Note that in this regard both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimuli result in an increase in <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> secretions. The sympathetic nervous system also affects <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> secretions indirectly by innervating the blood vessels that supply the glands.|$|E

25|$|Oral dryness {{may also}} be caused by mouth breathing, usually caused by partial {{obstruction}} of the upper respiratory tract. Examples include hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Irradiation of the salivary glands often causes profound hyposalivation. Alcohol {{may be involved in}} the cause of <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> disease, liver disease, or dehydration. Smoking is another possible cause. Other recreational drugs such as methamphetamine, cannabis, hallucinogens, or heroin, may be implicated. Rarer causes include diabetes (dehydration), hyperparathyroidism, cholinergic dysfunction (either congenital or autoimmune), <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> aplasia or atresia, sarcoidosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection (due to antiretroviral therapy, but also possibly diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome), graft-versus-host disease, renal failure, hepatitis C virus infection, and Lambert-Eaton syndrome.|$|E
25|$|While {{clozapine}} is a muscarinic antagonist at the M1, M2, M3, and M5 receptors, clozapine is a {{full agonist}} at the M4 subset. Because M4 is highly expressed in the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland,</b> its M4 agonist activity {{is thought to be}} responsible for the hypersalivation.|$|E

40|$|Capsaicin (trans- 8 -methyl-N-vanilyl- 6 -nonenamide) is {{a unique}} {{alkaloid}} isolated from hot chili peppers of the capsicum family. Capsaicin is an agonist of transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV 1), which is expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons {{and a range of}} secretory epithelia, including <b>salivary</b> <b>glands.</b> Capsaicin has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in sensory neurons. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that capsaicin also affects saliva secretion and inflammation in <b>salivary</b> <b>glands.</b> Applying capsaicin increases salivary secretion in human and animal models. Capsaicin appears to increase salivation mainly by modulating the paracellular pathway in <b>salivary</b> <b>glands.</b> Capsaicin activates TRPV 1, which modulates the permeability of tight junctions (TJ) by regulating the expression and function of putative intercellular adhesion molecules in an ERK (extracelluar signal-regulated kinase) -dependent manner. Capsaicin also improved dysfunction in transplanted <b>salivary</b> <b>glands.</b> Aside from the secretory effects of capsaicin, it has anti-inflammatory effects in <b>salivary</b> <b>glands.</b> The anti-inflammatory effect of capsaicin is, however, not mediated by TRPV 1, but by inhibition of the NF-κB pathway.
