In addition, RAISE adopts the k-anonymity property for preserving user privacy, where a message cannot {{be associated with a}} common vehicle. In the case of the absence of an RSU, we further propose a <b>supplementary</b> <b>scheme,</b> where vehicles would cooperatively work to probabilistically verify {{only a small percentage of}} these mes-sage signatures based on their own computing capacity. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed scheme.

40|$|With {{more and}} more {{renewable}} energy generation (REG) connections, busbar voltage violation and line overloading problems may occur for some parts of a distribution network. However, building new circuits to accommodate REG may have high monetary and environmental costs. This paper considers distribution automation as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>scheme</b> to traditional primary asset investments and analyzes the operational benefits from introducing an autonomous regional active network management system (AuRA-NMS) to a practical distribution system with rich renewable sources. The benefits are quantified in terms of optimal power flow control and investment deferral, and the resulting quantification will inform distribution network operators of the trade-offs between investment in the automation system and in the primary assets, thus helping them to make cost-effective investment decisions. Time-series-based simulation for over an entire year is implemented to calculate the benefits of active power loss and curtailment reductions for AuRA-NMS over the current practice. Part I of this paper illustrates the current schemes for voltage control and constraint management, advanced voltage control and constraint management enabled by the distribution automation, and the annual benefit by introducing the AuRA-NMS to the system with different considerable new DG integrations.

40|$|To {{investigate}} a possible trade-off between homeownership and individual {{participation in a}} <b>supplementary</b> pension <b>scheme,</b> we use nine waves of the Bank of Italy’s Survey on Household income andWealth (1995 – 2012). Italy lends itself {{to this type of}} investigation because the Italian public pension system was heavily reformed in the period, providing in principle incentives for participation, and the homeownership rate is very high. The impact of homeownership is captured in two ways: by a dummy for being homeowner and by an index capturing household portfolio illiquidity due to housing. Our results show that, after controlling for a vast array of socio-economic characteristics and allowing for unobserved individual heterogeneity, both measures of homeownership are negatively associated with participation in <b>supplementary</b> pension <b>schemes.</b> Moreover such an effect persists both in boom and bust phases of the housing market and does not disappear even after tax incentives and a strong default option introduced by the 2007 reform...|$|R

40|$|Demographic change {{confronts the}} German Pay-As-You-Go pension system with serious problems. For this reason, {{reductions}} {{in the level of}} public pensions were adopted under the pension reform in 2001, which also strengthened significantly the funded second and third pillars of old-age provision. The introduction of the supplementary pension provision brings with itself two major risks we are going to analyse in the present paper. One risk is implied by the voluntariness of supplementary arrangements. There is uncertainty over whether households � in particular the less affluent ones � will show the willingness and/or the capability to accumulate supplementary savings for their old age consistently. A further risk for supplementary old-age provision - which could as well be seen as a chance � rests in the return on contributions. Critics of funded private retirement provision often point at the return risk, in particular {{against the backdrop of the}} recent developments on capital markets. This paper asks whether under these risks, households will be able to close the gap arising from a reduction of public pension levels and to which degree there is scope for temporary suspensions of contributions to <b>supplementary</b> <b>schemes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{reports a}} {{comprehensive study of}} <b>supplementary</b> control <b>schemes</b> for HVDC inter‐ties parallel to AC transmission lines {{in order to reduce}} electromechanical inter‐area oscillations employing a suitable two‐area power system. The study includes design procedure and an extensive analysis based upon time domain detailed simulations, developed using PSCAD/EMTDC. Results obtained from two‐area power system show how the control over the HVDC inter‐tie effectively reduces the electromechanical inter‐are oscillations. The supplementary outer control loop of the HVDC link, suitably designed, permits to increase the damping ratio of the system to a safe value, which can not be attained solely using power system stabilizers. Power modulation through the HVDC link effectively reduces electromechanical inter‐area oscillations under a wide range of composite static load characteristics. Response is however limited by the value of the voltage index for active power; the compensation loop is functional only when this index is greater than one. The effectiveness of the <b>supplementary</b> control <b>scheme</b> is barely affected by the value of the voltage index for reactive power; these results reduce the modeling considerations of the reactive power characteristics, which in practical circumstances are more variable and depending on several and sometimes unknown factors...|$|R
40|$|Aiming at {{the fact}} that {{large-scale}} penetration of wind power will to some extent weaken the small signal stability of power systems, in this paper, the dynamic model of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is established firstly, to analyze the impact of wind generation on power oscillation damping. Then, based on the conventional maximum power point tracking control of variable speed wind turbine, a <b>supplementary</b> control <b>scheme</b> is proposed to increase the damping of power system. To achieve best performance, parameters of the damping control are tuned by using a genetic algorithm. Results of eigenvalue analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of supplementary damping control with fixed wind speed. At last, due to the problem that fluctuation of output power of wind generators would cause the unstable performance of the DFIG damping controller above, a new algorithm that adapts to the wind variation is added to the <b>supplementary</b> damping control <b>scheme.</b> Results of the simulation show that an improved damping control scheme can stably enhance system damping under various wind speeds and has higher practical value...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the meanings and the problems of Reformed Pension Scheme in Sweden by making clear the features of the present pension systems. The present Swedish pension systems - the National Basic Pension and the National <b>Supplementary</b> Pension <b>Scheme</b> - were established a generation ago with the introduction of the <b>Supplementary</b> Pension <b>Scheme</b> in 1960. The pluralistic dynamism has brought the present pension systems in Sweden into the instability, the inequity, the distortion and the dualism. In 1990 the Commission presented the findings and proposals of the systems. Many considered that more far-reaching changes were necessary than those proposed by the Commission. The Working Group on Pension was therefor set up. In 1994, the bill containing guidelines for the reformed system was submitted to the Swedish Parliament. Parliament decided that these guidelines should form the basis for future reform. The features of the pension reform in Sweden have been formulated in following way: it is worthy of special mention to resume the contribution-payment of the employees and to take away financial difficulties by introducing the lifetime earning principle, the income index adjustment, the defined contribution scheme, and the coefficient of the average life expectancy. In this sense Sweden can obtain excellent results of the pension reform in 1998. But instead of the contribution-payment of the employees, the Swedish neo-corporatism guaranteed a wage increase, and can't lighten the burden of the employers. LO has gotten the advantage over the employers in the pluralistic society...|$|R

40|$|The public social {{insurance}} schemes are very important for people’s security and are in the focus of debate on loss of income {{in the event of}} unemployment, illness, occupational injury, old age and parental leave. Regardless of whether discussions concern the incentive to work or the effects of insurances on income distribution, they are usually about the public insurance schemes. However, there is not just {{social insurance}}. There are also <b>supplementary</b> insurance <b>schemes,</b> which affect both incentives and income distribution. The benefits decided upon in agreements between the social partners are the most important, but are not the only ones. These <b>supplementary</b> insurance <b>schemes</b> have previously not attracted much attention and many citizens have scant knowledge about the overall extent and content of the agreements, {{despite the fact that the}} benefits linked to the collective agreements cover the great majority of wage-earners. In this report to the Expert Group on Economic Studies (ESS), PhD Gabriella Sjögren Lindquist and Professor Eskil Wadensjö, both active at the Swedish Institute for Social Research at Stock-holm University, provide a general picture of how the agreement-based benefits, other supplementary benefits and {{social insurance schemes}} relate to and interact with one another. They underline the necessity of a holistic view of the social security schemes developed by the state and the social partners. It is thus not reasonable to disregard the agreement-based insurance schemes, if one wishes to know about, and research into, the effects that social security insurance schemes have on the economy. It is the total benefit and not only benefit from the public social insurance scheme that affects the incentives of individuals to make different decisions.
