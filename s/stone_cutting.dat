5|$|Seven {{thousand}} carvers {{and three}} thousand volunteers {{were put to}} work for the construction Akshardham. With over 6,000 tons of pink sandstone coming from Rajasthan, workshop sites were set up around places within the state. Amongst the carvers were local farmers and fifteen hundred tribal women who had suffered from a drought and received economic gain due to this work. The initial <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> was done by machine, while the detailed carvings were done by hand. Every night, over one hundred trucks were sent to Akshardham, where four thousand workers and volunteers operated on the construction site.|$|E

25|$|The {{town was}} {{located on the}} Berks-Dauphin Turnpike, and later it was served by the Union Canal which paralleled Swatara Creek {{bordering}} {{the north and the}} west sides of the town, and was opened in 1827. The Lebanon Valley Railroad arrived in 1858. This brought about many jobs of <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> and shipyard work and helped facilitate the Hummelstown Brownstone Company which became the leading employer of Hummelstown residents. The company mined Hummelstown brownstone at its quarries from 1867 until 1929. The company was the largest producer of brownstone on the East Coast.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outskirts}} of Bagalkot city there are many small-scale industries set up. These come under the Vidyagiri area of Bagalkot city, which is the latest extension of the city. Small-scale industries like Ceramic Tile Industry, tyre industry, <b>Stone</b> <b>Cutting</b> And polishing Industry, milk Dairy etc. are running successfully. At Gaddanakeri there are many limestone industries and brick industries. The limestone industries produce lime for whitewash and painting. The brick industries produce bricks required {{for the construction of}} houses. There are local oil industries and oil refineries which produce oil from groundnuts, sunflower, sesamum orientale, cotton etc.|$|E
25|$|On March 11, 1982, {{the revised}} design was {{formally}} approved, and on March 26, 1982, ground was formally broken. Stone {{for the wall}} came from Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It was chosen because of its reflective quality and also because of opposition to Swedish and Canadian stone, as those countries were destinations for draft evaders. <b>Stone</b> <b>cutting</b> and fabrication was done in Barre, Vermont. The typesetting of the original 58,195 names on the wall was performed by Datalantic in Atlanta, Georgia. Stones were then shipped to Memphis, Tennessee where the names were etched. The etching was completed using a photoemulsion and sandblasting process. The negatives used in the process are in storage at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{confirmation}} of Split using the basic {{design of the}} rectangular coat of arms, featuring the north walls of the Palace, dates to the early 14th century. <b>Stone</b> <b>cuttings</b> are preserved from the 14th and 15th centuries featuring the same arms with the shields about the belfry.

25|$|In 2009 the African American {{figure on}} the Soldiers and Sailors Monument was {{digitally}} scanned to create a three-dimensional image. The process of creating a computer model was completed in one evening using a hand-held laser scanning system. The data {{will be sent to}} a computer-controlled <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> machine for a rough cut of the sculpture in Indiana limestone. This material was chosen for E Pluribus Unum because of its prominence in Indianapolis architecture {{in the late nineteenth century}} and to reflect the state's geological heritage. Like the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, many official buildings and monuments in downtown Indianapolis are constructed with Indiana limestone. After the figure is cut from the stone, an artist will refine the sculpture's more detailed areas.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} {{similarity}} running through the carved design of most races of primitive culture, the chip form of ornament being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may no doubt {{be accounted for by}} the extensive use of <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by crowding on too much design as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal of restraint by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So far as his chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but when he takes to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hospital}} contacted design firm, , with {{studios in}} Indianapolis and Vancouver, BC, to start development on this sculpture and {{other pieces of}} art inside the IU Simon Cancer Center in 2004. Led by principal designer and 2nd Globe Studio co-founder Jeff Laramore, the firm submitted design intention documents in August 2005. [...] Local companies were contracted to supply the materials and fabrication. [...] 2nd Globe staff assembled the sphere's superstructure, an acrylic globe with internal supports and lighting attachments. [...] The Santarossa Mosaic and Tile Company (http://www.santarossa.com/idex.htm) of Indianapolis supplied the selected onyx <b>stone,</b> <b>cutting</b> each piece, applying the stones to the sphere and then grinding, polishing and installing the sphere on site. [...] Scenic View, Inc. of Chicago fabricated the curved walls under the artist's direction. [...] The center piece of the sculpture, the stone sphere, was installed in August 2008.|$|E

2500|$|The common method {{they all}} used was to clad the timber {{centring}} (also known as falsework) with planks, known as [...] "laggings", laid {{parallel with the}} abutments and carefully planed and levelled to approximate closely the required curve of the intrados of the arch. The positions of the courses {{in the vicinity of}} the crown were first marked out at right angles to the faces using long wooden straight-edges, then the remaining courses were marked out in parallel. The masons then laid the <b>stones,</b> <b>cutting</b> them to shape as required.|$|R
60|$|Cedars grew thickly {{all the way}} up the steeper part of the divide, {{and ended}} {{abruptly}} at a pathway of stone, where the ascent became gradual. When Silvermane struck out of the grove upon this slope Hare kept turning keen glances rearward. The dust cloud rolled to the edge of the cedars, and out of it trooped half-a-dozen horsemen who began to shoot as soon as they had reached the open. Bullets zipped along the red <b>stone,</b> <b>cutting</b> little puffs of red dust, and sung through the air.|$|E
6000|$|We {{were passing}} a small clump of alder bushes when a loud manly voice raised in prayer {{attracted}} our attention. Pushing aside the branches, {{we came upon}} a man, seated with his back up against a great <b>stone,</b> <b>cutting</b> at his own arm with a broad-bladed knife, and giving forth the Lord's prayer the while, without a pause or a quiver in his tone. As he glanced up from his terrible task we both recognised him as one Hollis, whom I have mentioned as having been with Cromwell at Dunbar. His arm had been half severed by a cannon-ball, and he was quietly completing the separation in order to free himself from the dangling and useless limb. Even Saxon, used as he was to all the forms and incidents of war, stared open-eyed and aghast at this strange surgery; but the man, with a short nod of recognition, went grimly forward with his task, until, even as we gazed, he separated the last shred which held it, and lay over with blanched lips which still murmured the prayer. (1) We could do little to help him, and, indeed, might by our halt attract his pursuers to his hiding-place; so, throwing him down my flask half filled with water, we hastened on upon our way. Oh, war, my children, what a terrible thing it is! How are men cozened and cheated by the rare trappings and prancing steeds, by the empty terms of honour and of glory, until they forget in the outward tinsel and show the real ghastly horror of the accursed thing! Think not of the dazzling squadrons, nor of the spirit-stirring blare of the trumpets, but think of that lonely man {{under the shadow of}} the alders, and of what he was doing in a Christian age and a Christian land. Surely I, who have grown grey in harness, and who have seen as many fields as I have years of my life, should be the last to preach upon this subject, and yet I can clearly see that, in honesty, men must either give up war, or else they must confess that the words of the Redeemer are too lofty for them, and that {{there is no longer any}} use in pretending that His teaching can be reduced to practice. I have seen a Christian minister blessing a cannon which had just been founded, and another blessing a war-ship as it glided from the slips. They, the so-called representatives of Christ, blessed these engines of destruction which cruel man has devised to destroy and tear his fellow-worms. What would we say if we read in Holy Writ of our Lord having blessed the battering-rams and the catapults of the legions? Would we think that it was in agreement with His teaching? But there! As long as the heads of the Church wander away so far from the spirit of its teaching as to live in palaces and drive in carriages, what wonder if, with such examples before them, the lower clergy overstep at times the lines laid down by their great Master? ...|$|E

The section of the railway over the Newcastle Range and through the Delaney Gorge, although it has more earthworks and <b>stone</b> <b>cuttings</b> than any other section of the railway, also demonstrates a cheap form of railway construction, due to its sharp curves and steep gradients.|$|R
