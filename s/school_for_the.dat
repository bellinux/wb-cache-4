5|$|In 1989, {{at the age}} of 18, Chen began {{attending}} school as a grade one student at the Elementary <b>School</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Blind in Linyi city.

They still fell short of the required $400 and university authorities reportedly had to be pleaded with before allowing Chen to enroll. He studied in Nanjing from 1998 to 2001, specializing in acupuncture and massage—the only programs available to the blind. Chen also audited legal courses, gaining a sufficient understanding of the law to allow him to aid his fellow villagers when they sought his assistance.
