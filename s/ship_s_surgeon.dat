The 2014 ASCRS Clinical Survey, conducted in April 2014, focused on the most compelling and controversial topics confronting members. Information was gathered from more than 1, 500 unique respondents. The survey included 268 data points from 137 questions on key clinical opinions and practice patterns. When members were asked about the percentage of their patients receiving laser-assisted cataract surgery (LACS) overall, respondents reported that 4. 8 % of their patients received this procedure (U. <b>S.</b> <b>surgeons,</b> 5. 8 %; non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>surgeons,</b> 3. 6 %). When questioned about the clinical benefits of LACS versus conventional cataract surgery, 42. 2 % of respondents believed it does not provide any im-provement in creating the capsulorhexis, 47. 9 % believed it does not improve lens fragmentation, and 40. 7 % believed it does not offer advantages in creating arcuate incisions (Figure 1).
