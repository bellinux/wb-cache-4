5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked,</b> particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 {{producers}} asked Barlow {{to return}} as Mavis, {{but she was}} too busy. In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were not good enough for Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E
5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage {{was in many}} ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E

Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer, telling her she is neither tough nor talented enough. Her mother is a nurse who lacks the {{competitive}} drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Her mother later tells Gracie that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to become a surgeon, but that option had not been available to her as a woman.|$|E
25|$|Inge King (née Ingeborg Viktoria Neufeld) {{was born}} in Berlin on 26 November 1915, the {{youngest}} of four girls in a well-to-do Jewish family. Her early childhood was typical one for a child of her class and time in a European city. But after World War I, conditions in Germany became increasingly difficult. The period of the Weimar Republic (1918–1933), though a culturally stimulating time, was never stable. Conditions were made more difficult by the hyper-inflation of the early 1920s and the depression of 1929. During that time, things became increasingly difficult for the Neufeld family. By the time King's father died in 1930, when she was 14, the family had lost most of its money. Her older sisters supported her to stay at school until she finished, in 1932, which enabled her {{to get a good}} education. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to have gone on to university, possibly to study medicine, but, financially, that was out of the question.|$|E

For his touch and his kiss had that nearness of a little boy's, which nearly melted her. She could almost have succumbed to him. If {{it had not been}} that with him there was no question of succumbing. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to take him between her hands and caress and cajole him like a cherub, into a fall. And though <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>like</b> to do so, yet that inflexible stiffness of her backbone prevented her. She could not do as she liked. There was an inflexible fate within her, which shaped her ends.|$|R
500|$|The band {{returned}} from Jamaica and resumed work in June 2001, collaborating with producers Nellee Hooper and Timbaland. The Timbaland track, titled [...] "It's a Fight", and a Dr. Dre-produced song titled [...] "Wicked Day" [...] {{were excluded from}} the album because their hip hop sounds did not work well on the album. The band then worked with producer and former Cars frontman Ric Ocasek in late June. Stefani commented that No Doubt worked with so many people for the record because none were available for the time needed to make an LP, but that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to work with Ocasek longer. The band and its A manager Mark Williams chose collaborators based on how well they thought the person would fit the personality of the song that No Doubt had written. In late August, the band returned to London for Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent to polish off the songs with audio mixing.|$|E
500|$|Personal {{accounts}} of the battle frequently magnified an individual's own role or minimised those of rivals. The politics of the time were complex and complicated by ethnic divisions between native Russian nobility and those having second and third-generation German descent, leading to rivalry for positions {{in command of the}} army. Not only does a historian {{have to deal with the}} normal problem of a veteran looking back and recalling events as he or <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> them to have been, but in some cases outright malice was involved. Nor was this strictly a Russian event, as bickering and sabotage were known amongst the French marshals and their reporting generals. To [...] "lie like a bulletin" [...] was not just a French affair either, with Kutuzov in particular promoting an early form of misinformation that has continued to this day. Further distortions occurred during the Soviet years, when an adherence to a [...] "formula" [...] was the expectation during the Stalin years and for some time after that. The over-reliance of western histories on the battle and of the campaign on French sources, has been noted by later historians.|$|E
500|$|Besides his bronchitis, Rutherford {{developed}} {{diabetes in}} later years. His wife monitored his sugar intake, though {{when they were}} apart Rutherford sometimes took less care than <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> him to. In 1938, possibly {{as a result of}} diabetes, he suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed and mute. He learned to walk again {{and with the help of}} a grade one reader got his speech back. September 13, 1940, Mattie Rutherford died of cancer. Less than a year later, June 11, 1941, Rutherford suffered a fatal heart attack while in hospital for insulin treatment. He was 84 years old. Alexander Rutherford was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Edmonton, alongside his family. [...] His name was attached to many institutions both during his life and after: Rutherford Elementary School in Edmonton was established in 1911 and the University of Alberta's Rutherford Library in 1951. In 1954, a mountain in Jasper National Park was named Mount Rutherford. [...] In 1980, the government of Alberta created the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship, which awards more than $20 million annually to high school students selected on the basis of a minimum of a 75% average. The top ten students receiving Alexander Rutherford scholarships are recognized as 'Rutherford Scholars', and are presented with an additional scholarship and plaque.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout her reign, Catherine {{remained}} {{committed to}} intellectual pursuits and encouraged {{members of her}} court to engage in them as well. The empress provided her palace staff with a library and reportedly spent an average of 80,000 rubles annually on books. [...] In his essay, [...] "Catherine the Great: Enlightened Empress?" [...] Simon Henderson implores the reader to consider the constraints the empress faced when deciding if she was truly an enlightened despot. Henderson asserts that despite her deceptive tactics, she always possessed an [...] "unswerving commitment to modernizing Russia,". Early on, Catherine concerned herself with the philosophies {{and culture of the}} enlightenment. Though she often agreed with their liberal positions, her status in court was entirely reliant upon the support of noble families. As a result, the Empress could not always implement reforms the way <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked.</b> For example, when confronted with the issue of serfdom, Catherine initially suggested in her proposal of [...] "the Instruction" [...] that landowners offer serfs the option to [...] "purchase their freedom" [...] or that the government limit the period of servitude to six years. However, the nobles omitted this section from the document as it did not benefit them. [...] "Rather than seeing her as insincere in her concern for the peasantry, historians have recently highlighted…what she might have achieved had the circumstances been different,". Despite the constraints, Catherine did manage to implement few policies that benefitted the serfs. In 1767 it was forbidden for foster parents to enserf illegitimate children and in 1781 enserfment of prisoners of war was prohibited and a law passes that saw marriage of a free man to a serf woman emancipate the woman. Catherine is known to have investigated and then bought out landowners who were reported to ill-treat their serfs,. Voltaire outwardly supported emancipation of the serfs. The philosopher believed that the Russian aristocracy [...] "should not permit {{the vast majority of the}} people to go on suffering from the arbitrariness of [...] very laws who ought to be to afford protection to each and all,". Furthermore, in an attempt to create a more educated bureaucracy, Catherine moved to bring better education to her people. In 1786, she established the Russian Statute of National Education to launch a national school system. As a result of her campaign to modify Russia, Catherine successfully introduced the tsardom to the Western world and furthered the degree to which it was involved in European affairs. While Catherine worked to bring enlightenment principles to Russia, Voltaire worked to improve her reputation in Europe. The philosopher enthusiastically adopted her cause, commending her to friends in high places, advising her in politics, and distributing her texts to the liberal media, thereby cementing her title as an enlightened despot. [...] "Voltaire participated in a campaign to protect Catherine's reputation…he wrote pamphlets in support of her policies… published her pronouncements in the western press,". In a letter to Marquis D'Argenson, a French statesman, Voltaire asked him to help [...] "re-establish [...] reputation in Paris", (Lentin 13). Catherine, happy with rise to popularity, admits to Prince De Ligne: [...] "It was certainly Voltaire who brought me into fashion,".|$|E

She then sang with Rudolph Dunbar's dance band and met Ivy Benson. She met the Cuban Don Marino Barreto (1907-1995) and he encouraged her career. He persuaded her that she should train again at the Guildhall School of Music and in return he would teach her Latin-American rhythm. She played piano in his band and they became a couple.|$|R
