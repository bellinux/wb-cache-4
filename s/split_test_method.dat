The conventional test procedure {{is known to have}} a number of limitations related to size effect and boundary conditions. Furthermore, it has been reported to be impossible to determine the tensile strength of Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) using the standard <b>splitting</b> tensile <b>test</b> <b>method.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a methodology to obtain a close estimate of the true tensile strength of FRC from an adjusted tensile <b>splitting</b> <b>test</b> procedure. <b>Splitting</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on cylindrical specimens of four FRC mixes. The transversal deformation perpendicular to the load direction was recorded during the tests.

The tensile strength can be calculated from the first peak which represents the elastic limit state for the material. The method is validated through numerical simulation of the <b>splitting</b> <b>tests</b> using a cohesive crack approach.

Interest in the engineering properties of bamboo and the use of bamboo in engineered construction is growing. Although often having superior mechanical properties than readily available sawn timber, bamboo, being largely an unidirectional fibrous material, is very susceptible to longitudinal splitting. Despite being the dominant limit state in many applications, very little previous work has addressed the characterization of bamboo splitting failure. The present research focuses on the development of a <b>split</b> pin <b>test</b> <b>method</b> for characterizing the splitting strength of bamboo culms.

An innovative test apparatus has been developed in this study to cure and test cement paste specimens under in-situ conditions, such as down-hole in oil wells with high temperature and high pressure. Two series of tests were performed using cement pastes prepared with four different classes of oilwell cement (namely Class A, C, G, and H cements). Specimens in groups of four were cured at temperatures ranging from ambient to 60 °C and pressures ranging from 0. 69 to 51. 7 MPa for a period of 48 or 72 hours.

Another {{major part of}} this work {{was focused on the}} development and trial of new/optimization of established <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> (thermal shock by heating via electron beam and wedge <b>splitting</b> <b>test).</b> Al 2 O 3 with the addition of 2. 5 wt. % ZrO 2 and TiO 2 respectively (AZT) leads to an improved thermal shock behaviour compared to pure Al 2 O 3 materials. Temperature dependent investigations revealed a thermal hysteresis of elastic modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio and thermal expansion, accompanied by a phase transformation of ZrO 2 (monoclinic -> tetragonal). High temperature (800 - 1000 °C) wedge <b>splitting</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with optical notch opening determination for Al 2 O 3 and AZT. The phase transformation of ZrO 2 leads to a more brittle behaviour of AZT at 800 °C compared to room temperature.

40|$|An {{innovative}} pavement system {{known as}} Ultra Thin Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (UTCRCP) was recently developed in South Africa. The technology {{is currently being}} implemented on some major routes in the country. The system consists of a high performance fibre reinforced concrete pavement slab with a nominal thickness of approximately 50 mm. The material has a significant post crack stress capacity compared to plain concrete. Current design methods for UTCRCP are based on conventional linear elastic concrete pavement design methodology, which {{does not take into}} account post crack behaviour. Questions can be raised with regards to the suitability of conventional approaches for the design of this high performance material. The hypothesis of the study is that the accuracy of design models for UTCRCP can benefit from the adoption of fracture mechanics concepts. The experimental framework for this study includes fracture experiments under both monotonic and cyclic loading, on specimens of different sizes and geometries and produced from several mix designs. The aim is to quantify size effect in the high performance fibre reinforced concrete material, to determine fracture mechanics material parameters from monotonic tests, and to investigate the fatigue behaviour of the material. As part of the study a method is developed to obtain the full work of fracture from three point bending tests by means of extrapolation of the load-displacement tail. This allows the specific fracture energy (Gƒ) of the material to be determined. An adjusted tensile <b>splitting</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> is developed to determine the tensile strength (ƒτ) of the material. The values of Gƒ and ƒτ are used in the definition of a fracture mechanics based cohesive softening function. The final shape of the softening function combines a crack tip singularity with an exponential tail. The cohesive crack model is implemented in finite element methods to numerically simulate the fracture behaviour observed in the experiments. The numerical simulation provides reliable results for the different mixes, specimen sizes and geometries and predicts the size effect to occur. Fracture mechanics based models for the prediction of the fatigue performance of the material are proposed. The predictive performance of the models is compared against a model representing the conventional design approach. It is concluded that the findings of the study support the thesis that design methods for UTCRCP can benefit from the adoption of fracture mechanics concepts. This conclusion is mainly based on the following findings from the study: The high performance fibre reinforced concrete material was found to be subject to significant size effect. As a consequence the MOR parameter will not yield reliable predictions of the flexural capacity of full size pavement structures, In contrast to the MOR parameter, the fracture mechanics damage models developed as part of this study do provide reliable predictions of the flexural behaviour of the material, The fatigue model developed based on fracture mechanics concepts, though not necessarily more precise, is more accurate.
