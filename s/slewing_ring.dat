The swing bridge raises some 300 mm on 4 main jacks, mounted on to substantial sub-frame in the turning pit. The swing bridge raises to clear the fixed span and land abutment's scarfed rail joints and to also clear the fixed overhead conductor rails, which are gantry mounted to the swing bridge and the approach spans. The bridge [...] "slew" [...] is provided by 2 hydraulic motors driving against the main <b>slewing</b> <b>ring</b> bearing, manufactured by Robello.

40|$|Due to {{size and}} costs of big <b>slewing</b> <b>rings,</b> the common methods of {{experimental}} trial and error together with destructive test methods for verification of the inductive hardening process are limited. Thereby {{it is essential to}} simulate the hardening process in addition to the tests. With these simulations, {{it should be possible to}} get conclusions for the hardening pattern, the residual stress and distortion. With actually existing methods a fully three dimensional simulation is extremely time consuming. For that reason, a new method was developed that combines two dimensional with three dimensional simulation to shorten the time for calculation tremendously...|$|R

In this paper, some {{experiments}} {{was implemented}} for analyzing the affecting factors on allowable contact stress of four-point-contact <b>slewing</b> <b>rings</b> with single row including the hardening depth, hardness and the osculation between the steel {{ball and the}} raceway. Firstly, the common material 42 CrMo was chosen and heat-treated with some process of heat treatment for getting different hardening depth. And then, the indentation tests were conducted with the test-rig, followed by the data process. Finally, some conclusions {{can be obtained by}} comparing and analyzing the data. It concludes that when the hardening depth beyond 0. 3 and the hardness is not lower than 57 HRC, a better allowable contact stress can be got, besides, the better osculation 0. 52 is better for the load capacity...|$|R

40|$|An Orbital Winch {{mechanism}} enables high-load, multi-line tethers to {{be deployed}} and retracted without rotating the spool on which the tether is wound. To minimize damage to the tether and the wound package during retraction or deployment under load, it can incorporate a Tension Management Module that reduces the infeed tension {{by a factor of}} 15 {{through the use of a}} powered capstan with guide rollers. This design eliminates the need for rotating high-voltage electrical connections in tether systems that use propellantless electro-dynamic propulsion. It can also eliminate the need for rotating optical connections in applications where the tether contains optical fibers. This winch design was developed to deploy a 15 -km-long, 15 -kg high-strength Hoytether structure incorporating conductive wires as part of the MXER- 1 demonstration mission concept. Two slewing rings that orbit around the tether spool, combined with translation of one of the slewing rings back and forth along the spool axis to traverse the wind point, enables the winch to wind the tether. Variations of the traverse motion of the <b>slewing</b> <b>ring</b> can accomplish level winds and conical pirn winds. By removing the non-traversing <b>slewing</b> <b>ring,</b> and adding an actuated guide arm, the winch can manage rapid, low-drag deployment of a tether off the end of a pirn-wound spool, followed by controlled retraction and rewinding, in a manner very similar to a spin-casting reel. The winch requires at least two motor driver controller units to coordinate the action of two stepper motors to accomplish tether deployment or retraction...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} to check to bolt {{pretension}} for high duty bolted joint in the <b>slewing</b> <b>ring.</b> The bolted joint in the <b>slewing</b> <b>ring</b> is of special type the loads acts off {{axis of the}} bolt. For this kind of bolted joint, {{there is no direct}} theory. Most of them are based on experiments and are empirical. Some is also based on standards and experience. In the recent years, some finite element simulation has been done by some researchers. In this thesis, a finite element model was made using ANSYS WORKBENCH and an analytical formulation was used to find the work load on the bolt and then applied it in the WORKBENCH simulation and the result was satisfactory. The main task included in this thesis is to investigate the effect on the fatigue life of bolt with reduced pretension. This was also done and the result was satisfactory. Another task was to investigate the effect of plastic material behavior if time is allowed. This task was not addressed here due to time limitations. Other software used for this thesis was AUTOCAD INVENTOR. This was used to develop the model and later the model was analyzed in the WORKBENCH. The loads which act on the slewing bearing in this case comes from load history of the crane. A FORTRAN CODE was written using stiffness method to get loads on the ring from load history. Few recommendations for future work with this topics has also been attached at the end. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{presented}} paper {{describes the}} experimental determination of fatigue crack growth parameters for {{high strength low-alloy steel}} 42 CrMo 4. The experiments were performed {{according to the}} ASTM E 647 standard and the parameters of the Paris equation (C and m) were determined. Test specimens were subjected to impulsive cyclic tensile loading on a testing machine. During that the fatigue crack propagation was monitored as a function of elapsed fatigue cycles. Taking these experimental results into account the fatigue crack growth rates at different stress-intensity factor ranges was determined. To consider the variable material properties of the <b>slewing</b> bearing <b>ring</b> trough depth, specimens of different hardnesses were tested. Beside the experimental result a 2 D contact fatigue crack propagation model is also presented. This model can be used for the simulation of surface initiated contact fatigue crack propagation on the roller slewing bearing’s raceway. As a computational example the results of a finite element method contact fatigue crack propagation simulation are presented...|$|R
40|$|Today´s {{industry}} is driven into development by an increasingly difficult situation of competition that gives less room for miscalculations in the production. One {{of the most}} important factors in maintaining your competitiveness is your ability to quickly and efficiently adopt new methods of manufacturing. With the help of new manufacturing methods, the company can improve product design, add new value creating features, and get a faster and more flexible production. However, problems arose with the grading of new manufacturing methods, in order to understand their matureness and if they are ready to be taken into production. This paper aims to investigate the possibility of a rating scale for manufacturing methods and then test this scale on a case study at Volvo CE, Eskilstuna, regarding their introduction of the method Power Skiving in their gear manufacturing. Through studying secondary data regarding already applicable methods for rating of the maturity of technologies and products that are to be introduced into production. Furthermore, have articles regarding proposed methods of rating the maturity of manufacturing methods been revised in order to get an insight into the current situation of rating manufacturing methods and to see what in specific could be of usefulness in rating manufacturing technologies. Beyond secondary data interviews have been conducted with the division of production development at Volvo CE Eskilstuna and with the Director Global Manufacturing Technology at Volvo CE. With the goal of gaining information regarding what they consider crucial in rating manufacturing methods and what is of importance in order to make this rating scale useful in the everyday work. Visits {{have been made in the}} production of <b>slewing</b> <b>rings</b> at Volvo CE in order to be able to gather data for the case study regarding the possible introduction of Power Skiving in Volvo CE´s gear manufacturing. The Authors have been able to construct certain criteria that aim to support todays rating matric of introduction of new products in order for it to also work for rating the readiness of new manufacturing methods. Today rating scales for manufacturing methods aren’t widely accepted, the authors, however, assume that it will gain acceptance and there will be more research regarding this subject. Further studies regarding documentation of the ratings and how this rating could be further integrated into daily operation at a company is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Motivation of this master‘s {{thesis is}} {{solution}} of practical {{problem of the}} newly developed <b>slewing</b> <b>ring</b> for tram Škoda, type: 15 T. Next impulse for thesis creation was the possibility to extend product range of roller bearing ZKL. There is processed strain – stress analysis of bearing inner design making use the finite element method (FEM). Obtained results are compared with classic approach based on the Hertz theory. Important aim of this work is three main parameters optimal establishment: rolling element diameter, arrangement radius and number of rolling elements. Optimization job is realized by solutions of direct tasks with different parameters. With regard to necessity of detailed stress analysis and conservation of reasonable computational time it was chosen approach of combination global and local FEM model.

40|$|At cable winding today {{one uses}} one portal, one caterpillar, one {{spooling}} boom and one tower {{and the same}} kind of set of equipment for unwinding. This kind of solution is both expensive and unpractical when one of the components of unwinding/winding is stationary for a long time without being used. To save unnecessary expenditure and maintenance it would have been practical to only use one set of caterpillar, tower, spooling boom and portal that later on can be rotated around the turntable when exporting the cable. The project that this work includes is to bring a concept that excludes two sets and thus provides the system with a rotatable spooling system. To get as much information about the product and of the manufacturing as possible several interviews has been done of the forging shop Ronneby Svets & Smide and also their fitters. At the concept generation several proposals was developed and to go further with only one of them a QFD and a SWOT analysis was made to get the best concept. Verification of solid mechanics on the construction with FEM-analysis has been implemented on beams, tubes and tube constructions. The project comprises constructing of details and drawings for structure of the concept and also commitment of assembly, maintenance, ergonomics and shipping. At the assembly has bolted joints been used on most attachments for fast assembling on site instead of welds. For commitment of maintenance it is thought that one should easily access for control and tighten afterwards of example the <b>slewing</b> <b>ring.</b> At the ergonomics the idea is put for example to accessing the workspace or maintenance areas in form of a ladder or a staircase. The shipping has played a major role for the construction parts and has then been divided for easiest and most practical way to be transported smoothly...|$|E
