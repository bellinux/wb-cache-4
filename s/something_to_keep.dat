25|$|As {{the global}} {{temperature}} of the Earth warms each year, many butterfly species are forced to shift northward {{in order to keep}} living in their preferred climates. Scientists have found that migratory species, such as monarch butterflies, are better able to adapt to the rising temperatures than sedentary species, such as Glanville fritillaries. Glanville fritillaries will migrate around the Åland Islands to different habitat patches, but they will not embark on great transcontinental seasonal migrations like other butterflies do. Because of this they are very susceptible to climate change, which is <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in mind when considering plans to aid in the conservation of this species.|$|E
25|$|Ayuki is {{interested}} in the sciences, though most specifically, biological sciences. During Hitoshi Sora's first biology lesson at school, Ayuki commented that he leads a most intriguing class, referring to the genetically modified sunflowers he engineered which also turned out to be rather harmful. When Hitoshi tells Hazumu friends that she only has one month left to live, Ayuki reveals that she knew he was the space alien this entire time, due to his vast knowledge of science. Unlike her usual self which is calm and generally quiet, Ayuki gets very upset by this news, and pleads Hitoshi to do <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Hazumu alive since he once before brought her back from the dead, eventually leading to Ayuki starting to cry. Hitoshi corrects her that his species is not omnipotent and while his people may be more advanced technologically, they are still inferior as a race compared to humans of Earth. After Ayuki learns that Hitoshi will remain on Earth for the next 100 years, she expresses interest in becoming a human collaborator in his observations of love.|$|E
25|$|The Wilson and Rawlinson {{families}} spent Christmas with Lord Roberts, who {{was strongly}} {{opposed to the}} planned legislation, as was Brigadier Johnnie Gough, with whom Wilson played golf on Boxing Day, as was Leo Amery with whom he lunched at White's on New Year’s Day. Wilson’s main concern was “that the army should not be drawn in”, and on 5 January he had “a long and serious talk about Ulster & whether we couldn’t do <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Army out of it” with Joey Davies (Director of Staff Duties since October 1913) and Robertson (Director of Military Training), and the three men agreed to take soundings of army opinion at the annual Staff College conference at Camberley the following week. At the end of February Wilson went to Belfast, where he visited the Unionist Headquarters at Old Town Hall. His mission was not secret – the official purpose was to inspect 3rd Royal Irish Rifles and give a lecture on the Balkans at Victoria Barracks, and he reported his opinion of the Ulster situation to the Secretary of State and to Sir John French – but attracted press speculation (5 March). Wilson was delighted by the Ulster Volunteers (now 100,000 strong), to whom he was also leaking information.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles's {{introduction}} to [...] "Prellies" [...] (Preludin) was in Hamburg. As {{the group had}} to play for hours, Sheridan offered them Preludin, saying: [...] "Here's <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you awake." [...] Astrid Kirchherr also supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with Preludin, which when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until {{the early hours of}} the morning. Looking back, Harrison said that the whole group would be [...] "frothing at the mouth" [...] and would sometimes stay awake for days. Lennon recalled, [...] "The waiters always had these pills , so when they saw the musicians falling over with tiredness or drink, they'd give you the pill. You could work almost endlessly until the pill wore off, and then you'd have another." [...] McCartney said that he would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five.|$|E

[...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E

500|$|Club {{folklore}} {{has it that}} Aston Villa Football Club {{was formed}} by four players from the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel cricket team. It is said that they [...] "met in 1874 under a gas-light in Heathfield Road" [...] to set about forming a new club. They were looking for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them occupied during the winter. The club's official history states that they chose football after witnessing an [...] "impromptu game on a meadow off Heathfield Road". The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood. Their first match was played against the local Aston Brook St Mary's Rugby team on Wilson Road, Aston. As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under rugby rules, and the second half under football rules. The game was a scoreless draw at half time but Jack Hughes scored a goal {{in the second half}} to ensure that Villa won their first ever game. Villa moved to their first official home, Wellington Road in Perry Barr, in 1876 after their captain, George Ramsay, noted that in order to progress, Villa would need to move into an enclosed ground to be able to collect gate money. The site was taken on a three-year lease at a rent of £7,10 shillings for the first year, rising to £15 and £20 in subsequent years. By the late 1870s, Villa were improving greatly and by 1880, Villa won their first senior honour when they won the Birmingham Senior Cup under the captaincy of Scotsman Ramsay.|$|E
2500|$|Baker {{described}} {{working with}} Michael E. Knight (Tad Martin) and Eakes as a fun but somewhat intimidating experience. [...] "They are naturals at it!" [...] she stated. She said that Eakes helped her {{feel more comfortable}} during her first few weeks as Babe, {{and to get a}} better understanding of the character. [...] "She came up to me the first day we worked together and offered to go over lines together and help me with anything I needed. She is a sweetheart," [...] said Baker. Baker revealed that in her spare time in between takes as the character, she managed to find <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> entertained by. [...] "It seems like there is always something to do when you have down time on the set," [...] she said. [...] "I either run lines with the other actors or hang out in the hair and makeup room. I love those ladies!" [...] Adding to Baker's enjoyment on the set was Young. [...] "He is always cracking jokes!" [...] stated Baker.|$|E
2500|$|Names {{that involve}} wordplay, such as Knockturn Alley and Pensieve are also {{difficult}} to translate. The former, an unsavoury area in London's magical market, is semi-homophonous with [...] "nocturnally," [...] suggesting darkness and evil. The latter is a magical bowl into which memories and thoughts {{can be placed}} and examined, and is a portmanteau of two words: pensive, meaning [...] "musingly or dreamily thoughtful," [...] and sieve, a type of bowl with perforations through which fine particles of a substance (such as flour) may be passed to separate them from coarser ones. Translators must creatively render such names. If the words are simply transliterated, the shades of meaning are lost; but, when new word-games are invented, they can end up sounding {{quite different from the}} original, and often reflect the translator's personal interpretation and preferences. For instance, the Turkish version of Pensieve is Düşünseli, which is a portmanteau of the words Düşünmek (to think, to imagine) and sel (a flood of water). The German version of Pensieve is Denkarium with denken, meaning [...] "to think," [...] and [...] "aquarium." [...] The Swedish version of Pensieve is Minnessåll which means memory's sieve. The Norwegian translation of Pensieve is tanketank which translates to Thought-tank. The Hebrew version achieves a similar effect to the English in its translation of Pensieve; Pensieve is הגיגית (Hagigit), which is a combination of the word הגיג (hagig) meaning thought, and the word גיגית (gigit) meaning tub. In the Czech translation, Pensieve is [...] "Myslánka" [...] (from [...] "myslet" [...] – think) and Knockturn Alley is Obrtlá ulice, a rather complex neologism with many meanings and associations, but based on the word [...] "obrtlík" [...] (swivel) and the phrase [...] "otočit se na obrtlíku" [...] (run away suddenly). The [...] "Nocturnal" [...] wordplay is not used in the Czech translation. The Vietnamese version of [...] "Pensieve" [...] is [...] "Tưởng Ký", which is a combination word of [...] "tư tưởng" [...] ("thought" [...] or [...] "mind") and [...] "ký" [...] (literally means <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> thoughts, like a diary.) ...|$|E
50|$|Through {{the ages}} {{firepower}} {{has come to}} mean offensive power applied from a distance, thus involving ranged weapons as opposed to one-on-one close quarters combat. Firepower is thus <b>something</b> employed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> enemy forces at a range {{where they can be}} defeated in detail or sapped of the will to continue.
