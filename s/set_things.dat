And with his longtime partner Trish undercover in the Order as the mysterious Gloria, they help lead Nero to discover the truth himself, whereupon he forges a mysterious connection to Yamato, which chooses to aid him in battle. Following a final confrontation against Dante, Dante ultimately decides that Nero's intentions are good, and he allows Nero to keep Yamato for the time being; finally sealing their alliance. Using his newfound power {{in the wake of}} Credo’s betrayal, Nero is able to help Credo turn against The Order after Sanctus successfully captures himself and Kyrie to use as leverage. Though Credo eventually gives his life in a vain attempt to <b>set</b> <b>things</b> right, Dante and Trish promise him that they will save Kyrie and Nero.|$|E

25|$|Despite a {{significant}} revenue stream of rents, museum admissions, and event fees, the Newseum loses {{significant amounts of}} money. In 2015, the museum lost more than $2.5 million on revenue of $59 million. The private foundation that runs the museum has had losses for several years, {{which has led to}} some controversial proposals to <b>set</b> <b>things</b> right. The issue reaches back to the Washington location's construction, which had significant cost overruns.|$|E

In Asgardia, the All-Mother {{explains}} to Valkyrie, Misty and Annabelle that the dead Vikings signal the return of the Doommaidens; corrupted valkyries, who come to fill the void left by Valkyrie's inability to assemble a new Valkyrior.

25|$|In the {{penultimate}} scenario, {{during an}} attempted {{invasion of the}} United States in 2098, General Sergei Molotov finally realizes that Grigor II became mad with power, and deserts. Cooperating with U.S. agent Molly Ryan, he re-enacts the Chinese plan, building a time machine and returning to 2018 in order to <b>set</b> <b>things</b> right. They arrived {{just a few minutes}} late, as Grigor already left Voronezh. In addition, Grigor II realized their plans and took the time machine, fortifying Volgograd with a sizeable detachment of cybernetic forces. A massive battle ensued, ending in the technologically horribly outmatched Molotov and Ryan destroying Grigor II and assassinating Grigor (who proved to be unreasonable due to knowledge of Novaya Russia's military might).|$|E
25|$|Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam {{make plans}} to <b>set</b> <b>things</b> right once more. With {{the help of}} the Cotton family, they lead an {{uprising}} of Hobbits and are victorious at the Battle of Bywater which effectively frees the Shire. At the very doorstep of Bag End, they meet Sharkey, who is revealed to be the fallen wizard Saruman, and his much-abused servant Gríma. After Saruman reveals that Gríma has murdered (and probably cannibalized) Lotho, Gríma then jumps on his back and cuts his throat. Gríma is himself slain by hobbit archers as he attempts to escape. Saruman's soul is blown away into the east, and his body decays instantly into a skeleton.|$|E

25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and <b>set</b> <b>things</b> up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|On the surface, Uhura convinces Evans to <b>set</b> <b>things</b> right, {{while in}} orbit, the Conqueror is {{severely}} damaged {{and about to}} be destroyed by a warp core breach. Harriman sets the ship on a collision course, but helm control fails and the Conqueror begins to drift off course; Chekov separates the saucer, which would allow the warp core explosion to ram it into Mitchell's flagship. Reaching out to try and divert it, Mitchell finds his powers have disappeared, and as the Conquerors engineering section explodes, the shockwave sending the saucer right into the flagship, Mitchell screams Kittrick's name as his ship is destroyed. At the same moment, Evans goes through the Guardian {{and returns to the}} point where he visited the outpost and demanded to know where Kirk was. Waiting for Evans this time, instead of the data clerk, was his future self, who shoots him with a phaser. The timeline reverts to normal, and the landing party returns to the museum ship.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Ament left us {{this morning}} after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to him, and I think he goes back well prepared to <b>set</b> <b>things</b> right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E

500|$|Shakespeare is also {{careful to}} make the {{distinction}} that Prospero presents himself as a rational, and not an occultist, magician. He does this by providing a contrast to him in Sycorax. Sycorax {{is said to have}} worshipped the devil and been full of [...] "earthy and abhored commands". She was unable to control Ariel, who was [...] "too delicate" [...] for such dark tasks. Prospero's rational goodness enables him to control Ariel where Sycorax can only trap him in a tree. Sycorax's magic is frequently described as destructive and terrible, where Prospero's is said to be wondrous and beautiful. Prospero seeks to <b>set</b> <b>things</b> right in his world through his magic, and once that is done, he renounces it, setting Ariel free.|$|E
500|$|In 1049, Abu'l-Aswar's nephew Lashkari, {{the emir}} of Ganja, died, after a troubled reign of 15 years. He was succeeded by his infant son Anushirvan, but actual power {{was in the}} hands of his chamberlain (hajib), Abu Mansur. After barely two months, a group of elders opposed to the new regime's {{policies}} deposed Abu Mansur while he was at Shamkur and called upon Abu'l-Aswar to assume control of Ganja as well. Abu'l-Aswar agreed and abandoned Dvin, which had become too exposed to the Byzantines. The city was left {{in the hands of}} a series of governors until 1053, when he appointed his son Abu Nasr Iskandar as ruler of the city and the surrounding regions. The Shaddadid ruler first <b>set</b> <b>things</b> in order in Shamkur, and then entered Ganja, taking possession [...] "all the lands of Arran and its fortresses".|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{multiple}} perspectives were commented on: James Hibberd wrote for Entertainment Weekly that [...] "for {{a show that}} can often seem disjointed due by having so many storylines unfolding in different locations, {{this was the most}} cohesive episode we've seen yet, as the entire realm was impacted by Ned Stark being arrested for treason." [...] At HitFix, Alan Sepinwall called it [...] "by far the busiest episode of the series to date," [...] remarking that it not only moved [...] "pieces around the chess board to <b>set</b> <b>things</b> up for the season's final two episodes," [...] but also included [...] "some crackling dialogue, a few good character moments and some of the best action the show has featured to date." [...] David Sims from the A.V. Club wrote that the episode [...] "masterfully kept us abreast of everything going on, while sticking to the point-of-view style the show has held from the start." [...] On his blog Cultural Learnings, reviewer Myles McNutt found the episode [...] "filled with moments where much is done with very little. We don't really spend a sustained period in any one location, with only brief scenes possible to establish some pretty substantial story developments." ...|$|E

500|$|With September nearly dead, Peter {{decides to}} use Walter's {{equipment}} {{to enter the}} Observer's mind to try to learn of Olivia's location. Within September's consciousness, Peter learns the Observers are {{a team of scientists}} from one possible future of humanity, having used technology to travel to the past to witness their own creation. September, however, disrupted events by attempting to observe the point where Peter's cure was discovered, and his disruption has since caused several unintended changes within the timeline, including the war between the two universes. Ultimately, this would lead to the birth of Henry, Peter's child with the parallel universe's Olivia, which September claimed never should have happened and will be a catalyst for disruption of future events. By Peter entering the Machine and altering the timeline, Henry also ceased to exist. September explains that Peter's reappearance may be a means to <b>set</b> <b>things</b> right, and insists he find a way to reunite his romance with his original Olivia. As the reality of September's mind breaks down and he claims [...] "they are coming", the Observer tells Peter to [...] "go home". [...] Peter is suddenly woken up in the lab, September's body goes into convulsions and vanishes.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Dalton Ross {{named the}} episode {{as one of}} the season's best, commending the fact that [...] "most of the main {{questions}} were actually answered," [...] unlike the season finale of Lost. He praised the Bree storyline as well as the conclusion to the Mary Alice mystery, calling it [...] "both shocking and satisfying." [...] Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC also compared the episode to the Lost season finale, writing: [...] "'Desperate Housewives' is willing to answer some of its mysterious questions and give readers a little bit of closure. 'Lost,' heading into its own two-hour finale this Wednesday, is still dangling a dozen carrots in front of impatient viewers." [...] Cooper felt that the episode was a satisfying conclusion to the season opining that [...] "by allowing some of its plots to remain tantalizing mysteries, yet offering up the satisfaction of explaining others, 'Desperate Housewives' has smartly <b>set</b> <b>things</b> up for its audience to return for its new season next fall." [...] Frazier Moore of USA Today called the finale [...] "a smashing close" [...] to the first season. Moore expressed interest in how the cliffhangers would be resolved, {{as well as in the}} Betty Applewhite character. He also theorized that Rex's death was a ruse, writing: [...] "Reminder: The audience saw no death scene and no body. When has Desperate Housewives exercised restraint without an ulterior motive?" ...|$|E
500|$|While {{attempting}} {{to fix a}} broken toaster, Homer accidentally turns it into a time machine. It transports him to prehistoric times where he realizes he {{must be careful not}} to do anything to change history. After swatting a mosquito, he returns to the present to find a dystopia where Ned is a dictator of the world. Homer travels back in time again {{attempting to}} <b>set</b> <b>things</b> right; however, he accidentally kills a walking fish, and after returning to the present, he finds Bart and Lisa are giants, narrowly avoiding being crushed by them. He then sneezes and infects the dinosaurs with a cold virus while defending himself from a Tyrannosaurus Rex, which proceeds to cause their extinction. He is initially pleased with the results in the present; amongst other perks, the family is now extremely wealthy and Patty and Selma have died, but is horrified upon discovering that donuts do not exist in this timeline and flees, only seconds before donuts begin raining from the sky. In another world, Willie attempts to help Homer, but is again struck in the back with an axe, this time by Maggie. After several more trips back and forth in time, Homer eventually arrives in a reality that appears normal; he finds humans eating with lizard-like tongues, but finally decides that it is [...] "close enough".|$|E
