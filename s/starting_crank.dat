Because we had all of these key components in place starting out, we were able to start asset production, and that's how I think we'll be able to ship a literally one-year project.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>starting</b> <b>cranks</b> {{had been}} {{replaced}} by electric starters for decades, Ford cars included a manual starting feature until 1948 as an antidote to dead-battery syndrome. The wheel-lug wrench served as a handle (also for the jack) and the jack shaft with bayonet-coupling pins could be inserted through a small hole in the grille to engage a bayonet socket on the forward end of the engine crankshaft. A quick-and-easy twist of the handle was sufficient to start the flat head V8, and the bayonet coupling was self-disengaging for safety.|$|R

5000|$|Schuco 'Studio' {{cars had}} a <b>starting</b> <b>crank,</b> {{removable}} wheels, varied gearing and {{rack and pinion}} steering. Cars came with miniature tool kits. Probably because the Schuco name ended in [...] "o", this started a tradition of naming vehicle lines and sets with a somewhat male, Italian-sounding [...] "o" [...] at the end. Thus, Studio, Piccolo, and Varianto. One notable Studio car was the Luigi Fagioli Auto Union Avus 'Streamline', built in 1937, which came in a detailed box, complete with tools. Only 1,000 were produced. Schuco 'Turn Back' cars had a metal pin sensor that made the car turn when approaching {{the edge of a}} table (King 1986, p. 173). Wooden pegs were actually provided with the toy so the car could be driven around them.|$|E
40|$|Purpose Several {{factors may}} {{influence}} cycling performance and effort intensity during cycling competitions. The present study aimed {{to investigate the}} conditions that may influence the initial acceleration during the first 5 m of a cycling competition, particularly riding position, starting angle of the crank and hand position on handlebars. To this aim, eight male cyclists amateur were tested in laboratory and on track. Methods Surface electromyography was also used to verify the influence of upper body on muscle activity. Moreover, to verify the results, 59 professional cyclists were observed on the track using the same set-up. Results Standing position increased by 10 % the initial speed and acceleration compared to seated position. A <b>starting</b> <b>crank</b> angle of 71 ° and {{the position of the}} hands on the upper bar of the handlebar also improved the acceleration. The effects of these parameters were additive and, therefore, the acceleration with standing position and initial crank angle of 71 ° was about 35 % greater than that with seated position with an initial crank angle of 47 °. Conclusions These effects were especially important when analysing the results of competitive athletes, which also showed better initial acceleration under spontaneously adopted optimal initial conditions. 2014 Springer-Verlag Italia...|$|E

50|$|Ecutek tuning on {{the other}} hand was the first company to {{manipulate}} and change shift points on the GTR in the TCM (Transmission Control Module) on automatic mode. This can be done at will by the driver. Ecutek also allows the driver to adjust launch control on the fly available with a wrap around boost gauge that can read over 20 PSI. Like COBB Tuning, Ecutek currently offers engine tuning on the ECU and TCM with different launch control software from LC1 up to LC5. Ecutek's RACEROM offers in addition Valet Mode, Per-Cylinder Fueling, RaceRom Launch Control, Speed Density, Map Switching, Enhanced Targeted Boost Control, Upshift boostspike prevention, Per-gear boost control limit, per-gear rev limits, RACEROM Boost control, MAF Left-Right Swap for Custom Intercoolers, Large Fuel Injector Support and Visual Knock Warning.On January 16, 2013, Ecutek also became the first company to construct and offer Flex Fuel hardware and software capability for all Nissan GTRs.

50|$|The term also {{referred}} to a (now obsolete) automobile engine component that lowered the supply voltage to the ignition system after the engine had been <b>started.</b> Because <b>cranking</b> the engine causes a very heavy load on the battery, the system voltage can drop quite low during cranking. To allow the engine to start, the ignition system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once cranking is finished, the normal operating voltage would overload the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system.|$|R
50|$|Early cars did {{not have}} batteries, as their {{electrical}} systems were limited. A bell was used instead of an electric horn, headlights were gas-powered, and the engine was <b>started</b> with a <b>crank.</b> Car batteries became widely used around 1920 as cars became equipped with electric starters. The sealed battery, which did not require refilling, was invented in 1971.|$|R

5000|$|The Once-ler {{arrives with}} his wagon and Melvin. Then Pipsqueak and Lou arrive. The Once-ler tells {{them not to}} have joyrides. When the Once-ler goes inside his house, Pipsqueak and Lou <b>start</b> <b>cranking</b> up the wagon, but Melvin refuses to pull it because he is angry that they whipped the reins. So Pipsqueak hangs a truffula fruit in front of Melvin as an incentive. However, Melvin gets {{exhausted}} going up a steep hill. Then the wagon gets unhooked from Melvin, and it rolls downhill backwards while Pipsqueak and Lou scream in terror. Melvin chases the runaway wagon. Lou tries to stop the wagon by stabbing a stick {{in one of its}} wheels, but he gets stuck on the wheel instead. Finally, he lands back on the seat next to Pipsqueak, who hugs him happily. The wagon hits a rock and is propelled downhill even faster. When it approaches a cliff, Pipsqueak panics and grabs the wagon canopy, which flies off—only to be held in place by Lou. The wagon flies off the cliff, but the canopy acts as a parachute and they make their descent calmly, landing in the same place they left. Melvin appears shortly after. The Once-ler comes {{out of the house and}} is surprised to see them. He expresses surprise that they listened to instructions, but just when it seems like they fooled him, Lou sneezes and the wagon falls apart. Melvin hides beneath his hooves and Lou and Pipsqueak curl up into a ball. The Once-ler looks annoyed and makes a small, disgruntled [...] "Grr" [...] sound, causing Lou and Pipsqueak to run away into the trees.|$|R
25|$|Chief {{advantages}} of the grasshopper engine were cheapness of construction and robustness, with the type said to require less maintenance than {{any other type of}} marine steam engine.

50|$|In the final, {{it was a}} {{reminder}} of 2008 on this same track as Richards-Ross was out aggressively, making up the stagger on Christine Ohuruogu and when she hit the home stretch, {{she was out of}} gas. Meanwhile, to their outside, Christine Day was running smoothly to give Jamaica a big lead, Shericka Jackson. Natasha Hastings ran a quick turn to barely hold off Anyika Onuora at the break. Jackson started her leg conservatively, so the gap looked manageable, until she <b>started</b> <b>cranking</b> and the lead gap started growing. Jamaica had an almost two second lead when Jackson handed off to Stephenie Ann McPherson, Hastings helped the USA hold off the British team before handing off to the American's star, Felix. The gap looked impossible at the beginning but Felix closed it down. It took Felix 350 metres to catch McPherson, but it was a steady race throughout and when Felix got there she just continued on by, handing off to world #3 Francena McCorory with the lead. Jamaica had Novlene Williams-Mills on the anchor leg, starting 2 metres down. Down the backstretch and into the final turn, McCorory held the same gap on Williams-Mills, then through the turn the gap started to widen. Onto the home stretch, Williams-Mills moved out to lane 2 to look for running room. 70 metres before the finish, McCorory's arm movement got bigger but her legs got noticeably slower. Williams-Mills cruised on by a helpless McCorory with powerful sprint form across the line for gold. Well behind the leaders, the British team was challenged by Nigeria until Patience Okon George met with a similar collapse. While Seren Bundy-Davies carried the British home for bronze, George was overtaken at the line by Russia's Kseniya Aksyonova.|$|R

In 1975 the hand <b>crank</b> <b>started</b> petrol/TVO (tractor vaporising oil) engine was replaced with a Perkins P6 diesel, giving the loco a modern radiator grill at the front. In 1984, the loco was rebuilt again, however this time it lost its fake steam outline and became an 0-4-2 similar to an industrial diesel shunter. It was named Perkins in 1985 and was given a twin-disc transmission in 1990 reverting to an 0-4-4.|$|R
