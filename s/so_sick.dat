While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he was <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> he would collapse on the dressing room floor in between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital. This was the first notable symptom of Gardiner's health issues.|$|E

She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day.

[...] Timberlake recalled that the dancers were [...] "painted all over in a hideous manner" [...] and that they [...] "danced in a very uncommon figure." [...] The town's chief, Cheulah, presented Timberlake {{with a string of}} beads and held another pipe-smoking ceremony. The non-stop pipe smoking made Timberlake <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> that he [...] "could not stir for several hours."

You've got to let him sing it." [...] Muddy Waters' previous albums replicated {{the sound of his}} live performances. Working with a studio band rather than his own was problematic for Muddy Waters, who could not perform material from the album live. He stated [...] "What the hell do you have a record for if you can't play the first time it's out? I'm <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> of that... If you've got to have big amplifiers and wah-wahs and equipment to make you guitar say different things, well, hell, you can't play no blues." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{earlier work}} was deemed [...] "vaguely funky white-soul" [...] and [...] "rock", recent ones have been judged {{to have a}} more reggae, anthemic pop sound, evoking {{comparisons}} to Coldplay. Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: [...] "There's so much variety in music, it's silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way". He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: [...] "Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven't {{figured out a way to}} use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing." [...] He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I was <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach".|$|E

In the United States, it premiered on June 23, 2003, on VH1.

These girls, you have to see the look on their faces — they're really bizarre." [...] Arianne Phillips created the costumes for the video and she described Madonna's looks as an homage to old Hollywood glamour, while trying to be literal as well as conceptual.

500|$|In November 1994, Yankovic entered Santa Monica Sound Recorders in Santa Monica, California {{to begin}} {{the first of the}} Bad Hair Day sessions, which he {{produced}} himself.

The first session started on November 30 and yielded two originals: [...] "Callin' In Sick" [...] and [...] "Everything You Know Is Wrong". The second session started the next day and produced the original songs: [...] "I Remember Larry", [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy", and [...] "Since You've Been Gone". The third session took place on November 5, 1995, and resulted in the original [...] "I'm <b>So</b> <b>Sick</b> of You" [...] and the parody [...] "Cavity Search". The fourth session yielded [...] "The Alternative Polka" [...] medley, and the two parodies [...] "Gump" [...] and [...] "Phony Calls".

The little girls would enjoy them, and it would go right over my grandparents' heads. But it would hit my ex-girlfriend like a ton of bricks. It was perfect." [...] He also comments on how MTV played an edited version of the song for the music video, with the word [...] "coming" [...] edited out of the line [...] "keep her coming every night". Levine noted, [...] "MTV has now edited the language. They won't let me say, 'Keep her coming every night', and they took the sinking out of 'sinking my fingertips'. It's like communist China. It's totally bizarre." ...|$|E

Spears references The Notorious B.I.G.'s hit [...] "Hypnotize" [...] in [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] in the line [...] "You must be B.I.G. because you got me Hypnotized". Spears' vocals on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] were deemed as [...] "robotic", but similar to the ones of [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] (2000). Jocelyn Vena of MTV noted the singer uses her deep vocals in lines such as [...] "And, yeah, your body looks <b>so</b> <b>sick,</b> I think I caught the flu" [...] and [...] "You must be B.I.G.

500|$|The singer had a {{very close}} {{relationship}} with her paternal grandfather, Ron Cyrus, a Democratic legislator {{in the state of}} Kentucky and public servant, whom she referred to as [...] "Pappy". He was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer that develops from the protective lining that covers many of the body's internal organs, and struggled with the illness for several years as result of exposure to asbestos. Cyrus then relocated from Franklin, Tennessee to Los Angeles, California to commence work on the Disney Channel original series Hannah Montana. At the sight of her grandfather ailing from afar, Cyrus was inspired to compose [...] "I Miss You". In her autobiography Miles to Go (2009), she explained, [...] "That's how I ended up writing the song 'I Miss You' for Pappy. He was <b>so</b> <b>sick.</b> I knew he was dying, and slowly so did my heart. I couldn't imagine life without him." [...] She co-wrote the song with her mother's dear friends Wendy Foy Green and Brian Green, and described it as the most difficult song for her write because of the subject matter. Cyrus attempted to halt writing [...] "I Miss You", telling her co-writers she could not bear anymore.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> of other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, everyone just standing around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there {{are always going to be}} heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to come to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E
500|$|... "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. While reviewing Femme Fatale, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Spears [...] "does what pop stars invariably do {{in lieu of}} having a detectable character of their own: {{goes on and on}} about sex", while commenting that [...] "after a while, you get the feeling the lyricists just gave up trying in the face of her indifference: 'You got me kind of hot … Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,' she sings, which somehow makes you think not of thrillingly sweaty congress but the smell of boiled cabbage." [...] Contemporary critic Robert Christgau noted the songs on the album are [...] "such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy", saying that the singer is [...] "just too straight-faced" [...] on [...] "the nauseous 'Your body look <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> I think I got the flu'". A reviewer of Samesame.com.au compared the background vocals of the song to Kesha's [...] "Blow" [...] (2010), and noted [...] "guest rapper Sabi wish she was Nicki Minaj". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani considered [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] one of the album's [...] "best offerings", comparing the song to Christina Aguilera's [...] "Desnudate" [...] (2010).|$|E

500|$|... "Diva" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist speaking {{about being a}} diva. Chipmunked vocal samples and overdubs aplenty make up the song's foundation. According to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce also salutes her earning power and proclaims herself as the [...] "number one diva in the game". [...] "Diva" [...] begins with metallic kick drum complemented by Beyoncé's robotic sly vocal stutters as she sings: [...] "I'm a, I'm a, a diva". She then starts the first verse, chanting the dictionary definition of a diva. She references her millions of dollars, and raps, [...] "I done got <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> and filthy with benjis, I can't spend it", channeling her alter ego. After repeating the introductory lines, Beyoncé employs breathy drawls and robotic shouts to chant the chorus, where the lines, [...] "Now diva is a female version of a hustla. Of a hustla. Of a, of a hustla", are looped. In the second verse, she finds love in the club, where she warns [...] "Better have a six-pack in the cooler ... If you ain’t gettin money, then you ain't got nothin for me", and asks, [...] "Where yo Boss at?" [...] After singing the third verse and the chorus for the third time, Beyoncé adopts her initial chipmunked vocals to end the song, chanting, [...] "I'm a, I'm a, a diva".|$|E
500|$|After {{the break}} up of Kara's Flowers, Levine, along with Carmichael, left Los Angeles to pursue further studies at Five Towns College in New York. On MTV News, in 2002, he said: [...] "That's when I started {{waking up to}} the whole hip-hop, R thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was not Brentwood High". After {{dropping}} out of Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York, where he and Jesse Carmichael spent a semester, they reunited with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form a band once more. They experimented with several styles, including country and folk, before deciding groove-based music would become their genre. Levine explained the need for a makeover for the band: [...] "We were just <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> of being a typical rock 'n'roll band ... I felt like I needed to look elsewhere for vocal inspiration." [...] The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman, and David Boxenbaum. [...] Following Berkman's advice, the band added a fifth member, James Valentine, and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters, Berkman explained that Levine [...] "seemed to be a very shy, shoe-gazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer , so he could be the star I perceived him to be".|$|E
500|$|... "I Remember Larry" [...] is a style {{parody of}} Hilly Michaels, and {{it tells the}} tale of a {{neighborhood}} bully who, after myriad pranks, is brutally murdered by the narrator. At the 3:10 mark, the song contains a backmasked message, which when reversed reads, [...] "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands". [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy" [...] tells the story of Santa snapping, embarking on a killing spree, and eventually being arrested. Originally, the song had a different third verse, differing in the fact that, {{at the end of the}} song, Santa is killed by the SWAT team. The [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version was eventually released on the single for [...] "Amish Paradise". Another version was written for the Touring with Scissors tour in 1999, combining elements of the album version and the [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version. [...] "Since You've Been Gone" [...] is a generic doo-wop a cappella track that details a lover's torment after the object of his affections breaks up with him. Yankovic performed most of the vocals himself, and to make sure that he stayed on key, a scratch guitar track was recorded; when the song was mixed, the guitar track was removed. Bassist Steve Jay provides the low voices in the song. Finally, [...] "I'm <b>So</b> <b>Sick</b> of You," [...] a style parody of Elvis Costello in which the singer tells his girlfriend all the things he hates about her.|$|E
