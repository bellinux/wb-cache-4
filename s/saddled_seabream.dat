50|$|It is a gregarious fish, {{spawning}} in June and July. The <b>saddled</b> <b>seabream</b> is an omnivorous fish, but feeds {{mainly on}} small invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|The <b>saddled</b> <b>seabream</b> (Oblada melanura), {{also called}} the saddle bream or oblade, is a species of fish of the family Sparidae. It is {{monotypic}} in the genus Oblada.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saddled</b> <b>seabream</b> can be hooked day and night, {{but much}} better during night. It will bait on bread, cheese, paste, fish chunks, mussels, but best {{results can be}} {{achieved}} using live bait like live prawns.|$|E

50|$|Haliakmon {{contains}} 33 {{kinds of}} fish. These include brown trout, gilt-head bream, sardine, carp, pike, eel, european anchovy, nursehound, bogue, garfish, red porgy, <b>saddled</b> <b>seabream,</b> angler, bream, mediterranean sand smelt, sand steenbras, mullus barbatus, freshwater bass, tuna, salmon, Mediterranean moray, weever, longfin gurnard, dogfish, dusky grouper, school shark and turbot. About 30 {{of them are}} indigenous, while the rest were introduced by human intervention. Many of them are considered scarce and one, mavrotsironi, lives nowhere else in the world, i.e. it is endemic. Μost {{of these kinds of}} fish have no commercial value but only biological, since they support the food web. Fish found in Haliakmon, like carp and rainbow trout, indicate that its water is still pure. Some eels are found in its estuaries, that cannot migrate, hindered by the dams.|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} structure of marine fishes is often cryptic, due to limited knowledge about life history and ecological habitats. Understanding environmental stability {{is a challenge}} to retrieve possible structuring patterns responsible for dispersal and demographic habits. In the present study, a combination of genetic and phenotypic assessments was applied in order to investigate {{population structure}} of the <b>saddled</b> <b>seabream</b> Oblada melanura in the Aegean Sea, eastern Mediterranean basin. Analyses of 6 microsatellite loci and 15 morphometric characters revealed that <b>saddled</b> <b>seabream</b> individuals differ among northern, southern and central Aegean populations. These observed boundaries {{may be related to the}} differentiated seascape of the Aegean Sea, suggesting that oceanographic factors are a significant stressor for population subdivision of the <b>saddled</b> <b>seabream.</b> Individual-based landscape genetic approaches and multivariate analysis of the morphometric characters suggest the presence of habitat-related limitations of <b>saddled</b> <b>seabream</b> dispersal potential. Molecular genetics and phenotypic analyses along with life-history traits provide useful informative data for the management and conservation schemes applied for this species in the Aegean Sea...|$|E
