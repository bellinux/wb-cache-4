50|$|In {{oceanography}} {{and marine}} biology, {{the idea of}} the littoral zone is extended roughly {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Starting from the shoreline, the littoral zone begins at the spray region just above the high tide mark. From here, it moves to the intertidal region between the high and low water marks, and then out as far as the edge of the continental shelf. These three subregions are called, in order, the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone,</b> the eulittoral zone and the sublittoral zone.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA 30 -year {{study of}} {{temporal}} changes in gastropod community structure on the reefs of a Pacific Ocean atoll (Fangataufa, Tuamotu Archipelago) subjected to atmospheric nuclear tests during the 1960 s offered {{the opportunity for}} an otherwise impossible field experiment that could help ecologists understand mollusc primary succession. Reef molluscs were partly or entirely wiped out by {{the heat of the}} nuclear tests and the reefs were recolonized by ocean larvae. On all reefs, community composition before the tests was very different from what it evolved to afterwards. A new method of analysis was developed to study the temporal variation in community composition before versus after the tests (temporal beta diversity). Analyses showed that community compositions diverged through time among the reefs. Only some species can survive the harsh conditions of <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zones,</b> so the same species recolonized them; environmental filtering controlled the development of the new communities. In the reef flat and edge zones, differences in community composition seem {{to be the result of}} neutral stochastic colonization by larvae coming from the open ocean.

40|$|Diatoms are {{important}} {{contributors to the}} benthic microeukaryote flora. This manuscript lays the foundation for future metagenomic and environmental sequencing projects off coastal China by curating diatom DNA sequences from the Yantai region of the Bohai and Yellow Seas (Northeast China). These studies are based on cultures established from samples collected in different seasons from marine littoral and <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zones</b> in 2013 and 2014. Thirty-six diatom strains were cultured successfully and identification of these clones was determined by light and scanning electron microscopy(LM and SEM) and DNA sequencing of the nuclear-encoded small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU) and chloroplast-encoded rbcL and psbC genes. The strains primarily represent raphid pennate genera, such as Amphora, Amphora (Oxyamphora), Caloneis, Diploneis, Halamphora, Navicula, Nitzschia, Parlibellus, Pleurosigma, Surirella and Tryblionella. When the DNA markers from these strains were analysed in a multi-gene phylogeny, we found that some clones-particularly within the genera Amphora, Navicula and Nitzschia-show greater than expected genetic diversity despite their very similar morphology and morphometrics. We also compared the molecular and morphological identities of several seemingly ubiquitous marine littoral taxa in the genera Amphora and Nitzschia from the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, the Red Sea and Adriatic Sea to their Yellow Sea counterparts...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Vertical zonation of {{intertidal}} organisms, {{from the}} shallow subtidal to the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zones,</b> is a ubiquitous feature of temperate and tropical rocky shores. Organisms that live {{higher on the}} shore experience larger daily and seasonal fluctuations in microhabitat conditions, due to their greater exposure to terrestrial conditions during emersion. Comparative analyses of the adaptive linkage between physiolog-ical tolerance limits and vertical distribution are the most powerful when the study species are closely related and occur in discrete vertical zones throughout the intertidal range. Here, I summarize work on the phys-iological tolerance limits of rocky intertidal zone porcelain crab species of the genus Petrolisthes to emersion-related heat stress. In the eastern Pacific, Petrolisthes species live throughout temperate and tropical regions, and are found in discrete vertical intertidal zones in each region. Whole organism thermal tolerance limits of Petrolisthes species, and thermal limits of heart and nerve function reflect microhabitat conditions. Species living higher in the intertidal zone are more eurythermal than low-intertidal congeners, tropical species have the highest thermal limits, and the differences in thermal tolerance between low- and high-intertidal species is greatest for temperate crabs. Acclimation of thermal limits of high-intertidal species is restricted as compared to low-intertidal species. Thus, because thermal limits of high-intertidal species are near current habitat temperature maxima, global warming could most strongly impact intertidal species...|$|R
50|$|Tidal {{movements}} of water creates zonation patterns along rocky shores from high to low-tide. The area above the high-tide mark is the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> which is virtually a terrestrial environment. The {{area around the}} high-tide mark {{is known as the}} intertidal fringe. Between the high and low-tide marks is the intertidal or littoral zone. Below the low-tide mark is the sublittoral or subtidal zone.The presence and abundance of different animals and algae vary in different zones along the rocky shore due to differing adaptations to the varying levels of exposure to sun and desiccation along the rocky shore.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== In {{the coastal}} waters {{there are three}} main {{vertical}} zones: <b>Supralittoral</b> <b>zone,</b> Intertidal zone and subtidal. The supralittoral, or splash zone, covers the area above the high tide mark; in the reserve this is mainly a region for algae, small crustaceans, and some beetles. The intertidal zone in the reserve is affected by warm temperatures in the summer, but scraped by ice and storms in the winter so that living creatures must cling in cracks and sheltered areas. The subtidal zone in the reserve, down to 200 meters, is the most biologically rich marine zone. Scientists of the Far East Marine Reserve have recorded 200 species of macroalgae, 200 of fish, 300 of molluscs, more than 200 of marine worms, and about 100 species of crustaceans. [...] For birds, the region is the richest in Russia - with over 340 species recorded. Great Pliez Island {{has some of the}} largest rookeries for the Japanese cormorant and black-tailed gull. The reserve is on the Far East flyway for migratory birds. The gulf is also known for its marine invertebrates, including cucumber, crab, and giant octopus. Minke whale, dolphins, and killer whales migrate into the gulf.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} the possible role of Ligia italica as a bioindicator for the monitoring of heavy metals {{pollution in the}} suppralittoral zone of marine rocky coasts. Between 2004 and 2011 specimens of L. italica were collected along the Eastern Sicilian coasts from sites known for their high pollution levels as they are near to an area where in September 2001 a refinery plant discharged into the sea some waste containing Hg. Other specimens were collected from the Vendicari Natural Reserve located about 30 miles from the polluted sites and used as control area. On a consistent number of animals, the concentration in toto of As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. On other animals, investigations were carried out in order to check for ultrastructural alterations of the hepatopancreas, that is the main metals storage organ in isopods. Results revealed the presence, in the animals collected in 2004 from the polluted sites, of considerable concentrations of Hg and of lower concentrations of other metals such as As, Pb and V. The Hg bioaccumulation resulted in remarkable ultrastructural alterations of the two cellular types (B and S cells) in the epithelium of the hepatopancreas. Surprisingly, a moderate amount of Hg was also found in specimens collected in 2004 from the Vendicari Natural Reserve, proving that the Hg pollution can also spread many miles away. Animals collected from the polluted sites in the following years showed a progressively decreasing Hg content, reaching very low levels in those from the last sampling. Also, the ultrastructural alterations found in the hepatopancreas of the animals from the last sample were quite irrelevant. In conclusion, Ligia italica can represent a good bioindicator and the ultrastructure of the hepatopancreas {{could be used as}} ultrastructural biomarker of heavy metals pollution in the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R

40|$|Complexity is {{increasingly}} the hallmark in environmental management practices of sandy shorelines. This arises primarily from meeting growing public demands (e. g., real estate, recreation) whilst reconciling economic demands with expectations of coastal users who have modern conservation ethics. Ideally, shoreline management is underpinned by empirical data, but selecting ecologically-meaningful metrics to accurately measure {{the condition of}} systems, and the ecological effects of human activities, is a complex task. Here we construct a framework for metric selection, considering six categories of issues that authorities commonly address: erosion; habitat loss; recreation; fishing; pollution (litter and chemical contaminants); and wildlife conservation. Possible metrics were scored {{in terms of their}} ability to reflect environmental change, and against criteria that are widely used for judging the performance of ecological indicators (i. e., sensitivity, practicability, costs, and public appeal). From this analysis, four types of broadly applicable metrics that also performed very well against the indicator criteria emerged: 1.) traits of bird populations and assemblages (e. g., abundance, diversity, distributions, habitat use); 2.) breeding/reproductive performance sensu lato (especially relevant for birds and turtles nesting on beaches and in dunes, but equally applicable to invertebrates and plants); 3.) population parameters and distributions of vertebrates associated primarily with dunes and the <b>supralittoral</b> beach <b>zone</b> (traditionally focused on birds and turtles, but expandable to mammals); 4.) compound measurements of the abundance/cover/biomass of biota (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates) at both the population and assemblage level. Local constraints (i. e., the absence of birds in highly degraded urban settings or lack of dunes on bluff-backed beaches) and particular issues may require alternatives. Metrics - if selected and applied correctly - provide empirical evidence of environmental condition and change, but often do not reflect deeper environmental values per se. Yet, values remain poorly articulated for many beach systems; this calls for a comprehensive identification of environmental values and the development of targeted programs to conserve these values on sandy shorelines globally...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{sandy beaches}} on Malta and two on Gozo were sampled for {{macrofauna}} {{to test the}} hypothesis that Maltese beaches have an intrinsically low diversity. Stations distributed in the <b>supralittoral</b> (dry <b>zone),</b> mediolittoral (wet zone) and upper infralittoral (submerged zone to 1 m water depth) were sampled by sieving core samples and standardised searching during daytime, and pitfall trapping and standardised sweeping of the water column using a hand-net at night, as appropriate. Physical parameters of the sediment were measured and human occupancy of the beaches was estimated. From the supralittoral and mediolittoral, 39 species represented by 1584 individuals were collected by the combined techniques of pitfall trapping, sieving and standard searching. For Ramla beach, which had the highest diversity, 267 individuals representing 25 infaunal species were collected by sieving from a combined volume of 1. 175 m 3 of sand, and 149 individuals representing 28 epifaunal species were collected by standardised searching from a combined area of 700 m 2 of sand during two winter and two summer sampling sessions between 1992 and 1993. For nine other beaches sampled during the summer of 2000, only six macrofaunal species were collected from core samples, with overall population densities ranging from 4. 13 to 45. 45 individualsm 2. Only 92 individuals belonging to 12 species were collected by hand-net from the uppermost infralittoral of five beaches sampled using this method during the summer of 2000. Taxa of gastropods, bivalves, decapods, mysids and staphylinid beetles generally abundant on Mediterranean sandy beaches, were entirely absent from the beaches sampled. Few correlations that could explain the impoverishment of Maltese sandy beaches were found between physical parameters and faunal abundances, and other factors such as inadequate sampling effort, human disturbance and marine pollution were also excluded; however, seasonally biased sampling may partly explain the results obtained. One factor that may explain why certain species are missing could be lack of recruitment, due to Malta’s geographical isolation from the European and African mainlands. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{structure}} of macrofaunal communities at two similar exposed sandy beaches {{on the western}} coast of Portugal was monitored for approximately 18 months by sampling all the beach area, from the shoreline {{to the base of}} the dunes. The beaches’ physical environment, as well as community density and composition, seasonal variations and the potential relationships between biological data and environmental parameters were studied. The two beaches had similar exposure to wave action, but differed in terms of sediment grain size, extent of the intertidal area, sediment moisture content and, especially, in the potential food availability in the form of allochthonous debris. Differences were observed with regard to the communities’ structure, namely regarding composition and relative contribution of the dominant species. Seasonality, especially temperature variations, and the interaction between seasons and the beach <b>zones</b> (<b>supralittoral</b> vs. intertidal) also had a strong influence on communities: controlling dominant species’ density and the horizontal distribution of the dominant species, and promoting a differential utilization of the beach by several resident macrofaunal animals. The present study allows the identification of key species in exposed sandy beaches of western Portugal and demonstrates that a steady community structure does not persist in the similarly exposed conditions observed, which may be mainly a response to distinct detritus subsidies, combined with differences in sediment grain size, sediment moisture content and extent of the intertidal area...|$|R

40|$|In a {{littoral}} cave system, abiotic environmental properties, such as {{the intensity}} and spectral distribution of light, often change going from the exterior to the interior part of the cave, filtering the light and thus creating a deep-sea irradiance setting for marine flora. In this mini-review, we suggest that the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> in littoral caves might provide a sanctuary for mesophotic calcifying algae. These abiotic conditions offered an opportunity for normally deep-water mesophotic species to expand their range due to their competitive advantage over shallow, open-water species. Supralittoral calcifying algae are significant for marine biodiversity but {{are likely to be}} damaged in the future by ocean acidification. We have summarized important abiotic factors regarding algae settlement and succession processes in the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> of littoral caves, including their photosynthetic pigments and habitat requirements. We describe their zonation according to irradiance, and review previous research on epilithic alga¬¬l assemblages in littoral caves. Although we found {{a great deal of information}} on the algae of sea caves and littoral caves, no such information was published on the algae of the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> of these caves. Nevertheless, some of the studies cited in this review have already set a good conceptual and methodological basis for the ecological research of the supralittoral algal flora of littoral caves...|$|E
30|$|A {{count of}} 1, 340 amphipod {{individuals}} was collected in different lagoons.

Moreover, the difference between lagoons was statistically significant (Anova test: F[*]=[*] 4.371; DF[*]=[*] 7; p[*]=[*] 0.001).|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{results showed}} that O. mediterranea {{presented}} the most important density in the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> of Bizerte lagoon (62 ind. m− 2). Whereas, O. gammarellus showed the most important density in the supralittoral zones of El Bcherliya (0.5 ind. m− 2), the old harbor of Ghar El Melh (19 ind. m− 2), the North (34 ind. m− 2) and South (34.5 ind. m− 2) lagoons of Tunis.|$|E

Thus, aims {{of this study were}} to produce a list of amphipod species collected in the supralittoral zones of different lagoons, to estimate species richness, abundance, and density, and we focus on environmental factors that may control their spatial distribution.|$|E
30|$|Globally {{the species}} {{richness}} was {{higher in the}} <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> of Bizerte lagoon than in the other stations. In this station, eight amphipod species were identified. This would {{be related to the}} presence of important vegetation in spring as well as the Cymodocea nodosa leaf litter and a high percentage of organic matter. In this same station, the highest diversity, abundance, and density were observed. Moreover, it was O. mediterranea that presented the most important density in this <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone.</b> In other type of wetlands such as oueds, species richness varied between one species in oueds Laakarit, Khniss, and El Fared and six species in Tinja (Korsi station) whereas in sebkhas, only two species were collected in sebkhas Gargour and Moknine (Jelassi 2014; Jelassi et al. 2013 c). In supralittoral zones of dams and hill lakes, no species has been found (Jelassi 2014). Using the same method of collection, Ayari (2012) showed the presence of five species namely T. saltator, D. deshayesii, O. gammarellus, O. montagui, and O. mediterranea in the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> of Bizerte Corniche beach and only one species, T. saltator, in the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> of Gabès beach. This author attributed the lowest species richness in the last station (Gabès) to the highest tidal amplitude reported in this beach and the highest species richness observed in Bizerte Corniche to the presence of Posidonia oceanica benches associated with other algae that provide shelter and food for different amphipod species. In Zouaraa beach, only two species were identified: T. saltator and Talorchestia brito living in sympatry with a total density generally low and never exceeded 860 ind.m− 2 (Charfi-Cheikhrouha et al. 2000). At Ouderef, Gabes, and Zarrat beaches (Gulf of Gabes, Tunisia), the amphipod T. saltator was the most abundant species, present in the three beaches studied; with the highest densities in Ouderef beach (Pérez-Domingo et al. 2008). O. montagui and D. deshayesii in the Bay of Bou Ismail reached more than 45.000 ind. m− 2 (Louis 1980), and O. mediterranea in the estuary of Bou Regreg, Morocco, attained 7, 000 ind. m− 2 (Elkaïm et al. 1985). On the Isle of Man, densities of T. saltator were estimated at 80 to 400 ind. m− 2 (Williams, 1995). Marsden (1991) and Cardoso and Veloso (1996) showed that fluctuations in population density were frequent in talitrids and indicated periods of intense reproduction. They observed, in fact, similar patterns of variation for Talorchestia quoyana and Pseudorchestoidea brasiliensis, respectively, with highest densities in summer and late winter.|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 1, 340 talitrids {{individuals}} was collected in different coastal lagoons. Abundance, density and diversity were {{more pronounced in}} the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> of Bizerte lagoon characterized {{by the presence of}} eight amphipod species: O. montagui, O. gammarellus, O. mediterranea, O. stephenseni, O. cavimana, P. platensis, D. deshayesii and T. saltator. Moreover, according to principal component analysis, the spatial distribution of species in the different lagoons in Tunisia depends on edaphic (heavy metals, granulometry, organic matter) and climatic (temperature, humidity) factors.|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{and the introduction}} of exotic species are the primary causes of biodiversity loss in tropical island ecosystems. Conservation efforts on oceanic islands are often biased towards charismatic vertebrate faunas, neglecting invertebrate assemblages. We sampled the land crab community on five islands in the central Seychelles; in the intertidal zone, in the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> and in nine different inland habitat types to explore the impacts of exotic vegetation and environmental variables on land crab abundance and community composition, and investigate whether land crabs {{can be used as a}} tool for the rapid assessment of habitat quality on tropical oceanic islands. We found that species richness and the abundance of the dominant ghost crab Ocypode cordimana was higher in native habitat types than habitats dominated by exotic vegetation. Available ground substrate suitable for burrowing may be a limiting factor for O. cordimana in exotic habitat types. Coenobita rugosus, the dominant crab in the <b>supralittoral</b> <b>zone</b> is largely absent where there is no supralittoral vegetation. These results suggest that land crabs could be reliable indicators of habitat quality on oceanic islands.
