5000|$|The {{concept of}} adding levees were briefly {{discussed}} among {{the residents of}} Chattanooga. However, the waterfront areas were deemed too valuable as a commercial resource to use {{for the construction of}} a levee. After the bouts of flooding, a local newspaper article was released that stated the city's leaders planned on raised the grade of the streets of Chattanooga so that they would no longer flood. The people of Chattanooga began to raise the level of a few of the city's streets by 3 to 15 feet. Around 40 blocks of downtown Chattanooga was raised. Market and Broad Streets were completely filled, as well as portions of Cherry and Chestnut Streets. The method in which the city was raised is disputed, because there is no historical documentation. It was speculated that what was used in the raising was dirt from higher level areas of the town. Later, available records and <b>soil</b> <b>boring</b> showed that a variety of different materials such as foundry waste and sawmill scraps had been used in raising the city's streets. [...] In 1933 the Tennessee Valley Authority in conjunction with Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal helped pass the Tennessee Valley Authority Act (1933) which prompted the construction of the Chickamauga Dam. After the dam was built in 1933, it helped to regulate the water levels of the Tennessee River near Chattanooga, preventing downtown from flooding.|$|E

While previous evaluations of site conditions utilized time-consuming conventional <b>soil</b> <b>boring</b> and monitoring well procedures, continuing investigation necessitated more advanced screening techniques. Since the principal site contaminants are hydrocarbons (both light and dense), Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) and Ultraviolet Induced Fluorescence (UVIF) technologies were chosen to evaluate subsurface conditions.

Some levee reaches were undamaged {{and some were}} slightly eroded, while other portions were completely breached. The in situ jet index test method was applied along selected post-storm reconstructed levee reaches to assess levee fill erodibil-ity. Jet index testing was also conducted at three undamaged (un-eroded) levee surface locations. Pre-storm levee profiles (elevations) were compared to post-storm modeled stormwater elevations to estimate overtopping depths at the test sites. Also, pre-storm levee profiles were compared to post-storm profiles to estimate erosion depths at the test sites. The jet index test results were integrated with pre-storm <b>soil</b> <b>boring</b> data (i. e., stratigraphy and soil classification), post-storm erosion depths, and overtopping depths to investigate soil surface erodibility relationships.

40|$|In October, 2007, the Commodity Credit Corporation of the U. S.

The IM was recommended to mitigate existing levels of carbon tetrachloride contamination identified in the vadose zone soils beneath the former facility and in the groundwater beneath and in the vicinity of the former facility, as well as to moderate or decrease the potential future concentrations of carbon tetrachloride in the groundwater. The Interim Measure Conceptual Design (Argonne 2007 a) was developed in accordance with the KDHE/BER Policy No. BERRS- 029, Policy and Scope of Work: Interim Measures (KDHE 1996). The hydrogeologic, geochemical, and contaminant distribution characteristics of the Centralia site, as identified by the CCC/USDA, factored into the development of the nonemergency IM proposal. These characteristics were summarized in the Interim Measure Conceptual Design (Argonne 2007 a) and were discussed in detail in previous Argonne reports (Argonne 2002 a, 2003, 2004, 2005 a,b,c, 2006 a,b, 2007 b). The identified remedial goals of the proposed IM were as follows: (1) To reduce the existing concentrations of carbon tetrachloride in groundwater in three 'hot spot' areas identified at the site (at SB 01, SB 05, and SB 12 -MW 02; Figure 1. 2) to levels acceptable to the KDHE. (2) To reduce carbon tetrachloride concentrations in the soils near the location of former <b>soil</b> <b>boring</b> SB 12 and existing monitoring well MW 02 (Figure 1. 2) to levels below the KDHE Tier 2 Risk-Based Screening Level (RBSL) of 200 {micro}g/kg for this contaminant. To address these goals, the potential application of an in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) treatment technology, employing the use of the EHC{reg_sign} treatment materials marketed by Adventus Americas, Inc.

The EHC materials are proprietary mixtures of food-grade organic carbon and zero-valent iron that are injected into the subsurface as a slurry (EHC) or in dissolved form (EHC-A) and subsequently released slowly into the formation.

As a result, underlying karst hazards such as incipient sinkholes are often hidden until they are suddenly revealed {{by the collapse of}} subsurface voids. Regionally, the economics of the dairy industry is causing a trend toward the consolidation and expansion of existing operations. As concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) or feedlots expand, state and local agencies are charged with enforcing regulations designed to protect environmental and water resources in agricultural areas. One of the key challenges in reviewing and siting expanded dairies is identifying potential karst hazards, particularly where they might undermine manure storage facilities or where they occur on croplands where manure is applied. Uncertainty about the location of karst hazards relative to proposed feedlot facilities {{is one of the reasons}} that feedlot expansions in the Driftless Area are often controversial. Recently, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency enacted strict guidelines that severely limit bedrock removal in order to facilitate the construction of manure storage containments. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that a minimum separation is maintained between intact bedrock and the containment liner to provide the opportunity for attenuation within the soil of contaminants that could potentially leak if the containment structure is compromised. Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) techniques have been employed to screen for karst hazards during the planning phase of feedlot expansions, and where present, to more accurately characterize the nature of the karst hazard. Because depth-to-bedrock is highly variable in the karst terrain of southeastern Minnesota, ERI has also been a useful tool to characterize this spatial variation under proposed manure containment sites. In this study, ERI was performed using a 56 -channel AGI Supersting™ system with post-processing of the data in EarthImager™ software. Dipole-Dipole and Wenner electrical resistivity arrays have been the most useful for identifying karst hazards. Electrode spacing of 3 to 5 m has provided a good balance between depth-of-image and the spatial resolution necessary to locate and identify karst hazards. <b>Soil</b> <b>boring</b> data, which is typically collected during pre-construction site investigations, is critical to the interpretation of ERI data. Although individual sites vary, most surface materials in southeastern Minnesota have resistivities that fall within predictable ranges: 20 - 80 ohm-m for soils, 80 - 100 ohm-m for epikarst and weathered residuum, and 3 ̆e 100 ohm-m for bedrock. Karst voids in the subsurface typically display resistivities greater than 1000 ohm-m, providing good contrast with the resistivities of the surrounding bedrock. ERI has been an effective tool in identifying karst hazards in agricultural settings of southeastern Minnesota. In addition to improving pre-construction site assessments, ERI has also helped to reduce potential controversy surrounding the karst hazards of proposed projects by providing more certainty about the underlying geology...|$|E

The works done to study the <b>soil,</b> were drill <b>bores</b> and dynamic penetration tests, classification of samples by size, Atterberg limits, physical and chemical analysis, showing the typical geotechnical composition of the Guadalquivir valley: an alluvial material composed by sand, gravels and silt clays. To study the foundations, inclined bore samples were extracted with 10 - 65 º, showing calcarenite stone ashlars and lime concrete alternating with stone and brick masonry...|$|R
40|$|Several methodologies were {{utilized}} {{to evaluate the}} microbiological and physico chemical properties of top <b>soil</b> samples <b>bored</b> from four municipal waste dumpsites and a farmland (control sample) all located in Benin City, Edo State. The soil samples were obtained {{during the month of}} January, 2013. The mean aerobic bacterial counts for the soil samples ranged from 9. 7 × 103 cfu/g for the control soil to 1. 80 × 104 cfu/g for the soil sourced from the dump site at Ikheuniro. The mean heterotrophic fungal counts varied from 7. 0 × 102 cfu/g for capitol dumpsite to 3. 3 × 103 cfu/g for the control soil. Ten (10) microbial isolates were characterized and identified; Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Aeromonas sp., Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp. and Staphylococcus sp., Aspergillus sp., Mucor sp., Saccharomyces sp. and Fusarium sp. respectively. Both Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were the most dominant amongst the bacterial isolates whilst Staphylococcus sp. was the least occurring bacterial isolate. Aspergillus sp. was the highest occurring fungal isolate while the least isolated fungal culture was Saccharomyces sp. The physico chemical results showed values which ranged from 5. 60 to 8. 08, 164. 00 µS/cm to 540. 00 µS/cm, 2. 378 mg/kg to 3. 444 mg/kg, 0. 009 mg/kg to 0. 016 mg/kg for pH, electrical conductivity, sulphate and cadmium. Despite the positive impacts of the dumpe...|$|R
40|$|Volume loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} risks when boring a tunnel. This is particularly true when a tunnel is being constructed in soft soils. The risk of excessive volume loss, if materialised can lead to large consequences such as damage in buildings on the surface. This paper describes the development and use of a Bayesian based risk model containing more than forty relevant risk factors associated with the occurrence of volume loss in soft <b>soils</b> in mechanized <b>bored</b> tunnels. The developed risk model takes into account additional factors other than those normally used in analytical methods to estimate volume loss. The considered risk factors involve issues related to the excavation process, design, monitoring, human factors as well as variables associated with ground conditions. By means of data elicited from tunnel experts and the analysis of the importance of the various factors using sensitivity analysis, the model is evaluated and its ability to provide information to derive specific risk measures is verified...|$|R
