5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1958. It {{was one of}} several species described and illustrated in the popular American weekly magazine Life ("Seeking the Magic Mushroom"), in which R. Gordon Wasson recounted the psychedelic visions that he experienced during the divinatory rituals of the Mixtec people, thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to Western popular culture; it was however, mislabeled as Psilocybe zaptecorum. Similarly, Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán suggests that P.zapotecorum, as described by Rolf <b>Singer</b> <b>in</b> 1958, is misidentified as it agrees well with the type of P.hoogshagenii. The species Psilocybe caerulipes var. gastonii, described by <b>Singer</b> <b>in</b> 1958, is a synonym of P.hoogshagenii.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{identifying}} <b>singers</b> <b>in</b> music recordings has received considerable attention with {{the explosive growth}} of the Internet and digital media.

The research presented in this paper attempts to automatically identify <b>singers</b> <b>in</b> music recordings that contain overlapping singing voices. Two approaches to overlapping singer identification are proposed and evaluated. Results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of the systems. 1...|$|R
