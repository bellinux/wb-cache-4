40|$|We have {{continued}} work on realistic numerical models of cratered surfaces, as first reported at last year's LPSC. We confirm the <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> level with a new, independent test. One {{of us has}} developed a realistic computer simulation of a cratered surface. The model starts with a smooth surface or fractal topography, and adds primary craters according to the cumulative power law with exponent - 1. 83, as observed on lunar maria and Martian plains. Each crater has an ejecta blanket with {{the volume of the}} crater, feathering out to a distance of 4 crater radii. We use the model to test the levels of <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> reached in naturally occurring systems, by increasing crater density and observing its dependence on various parameters. In particular, we have tested to see if these artificial systems reach the level found by Hartmann on heavily cratered planetary surfaces, hypothesized to be the natural <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> level. This year's work gives the first results of a crater population that includes secondaries. Our model 'Gaskell- 4 ' (September, 1992) includes primaries as described above, but also includes a secondary population, defined by exponent - 4. We allowed the largest secondary from each primary to be 0. 10 {{times the size of the}} primary. These parameters will be changed to test their effects in future models. The model gives realistic images of a cratered surface although it appears richer in secondaries than real surfaces are. The effect of running the model toward saturation gives interesting results for the diameter distribution. Our most heavily cratered surface had the input number of primary craters reach about 0. 65 times the hypothesized <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> but the input number rises to more than 100 times that level for secondaries below 1. 4 km in size...|$|E

40|$|An array {{spectrometer}} {{was used}} on the nights of 1985 May 30 -June 1 to observe the disks of Uranus and Neptune in the spectral regions 7 - 14 and 17 - 23 μm with effective resolution elements ranging from 0. 23 to 0. 87 μm. In the long-wavelength region, the spectra are relatively smooth with the broad S(1) H 2 collision-induced rotation line showing strong emission for Neptune. In the short-wavelength spectrum of Uranus, an emission feature attributable to C 2 H 2 with a maximum stratospheric mixing ratio of 9 × 10 - 9 is apparent. An upper limit of 2 × 10 - 8 {{is placed on the}} maximum stratospheric mixing ratio of C 2 H 6. The spectrum of Uranus is otherwise smooth and quantitatively consistent with the opacity provided by H 2 collision-induced absorption and spectrally continuous stratospheric emission, as would be produced by aerosols. Upper limits to detecting the planet near 8 μm indicate a CH 4 stratospheric mixing ratio of 1 × 10 - 5 or less, below a value consistent with <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> at the temperature minimum. In the short-wavelength spectrum of Neptune, strong emission features of CH 4 and C 2 H 6 are evident and are consistent with local <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> with maximum stratospheric mixing ratios of 0. 02 and 6 × 10 - 6, respectively. Emission at 8 - 10 μm is most consistent with a [CH 3 D]/[CH 4] volume abundance ratio of 5 × 10 - 5. The spectrum of Neptune near 13. 5 μm is consistent with emission by stratospheric C 2 H 2 in local <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and a maximum mixing ratio of 9 × 10 - 7. Radiance detected near 10. 5 μm could be attributed to stratospheric C 2 H 4 emission for a maximum mixing ratio of approximately 3 × 10 - 9. Quantitative results are considered preliminary, as some absolute radiance differences are noted with respect to earlier observations with discrete filters. © 1987...|$|E
40|$|Crater populations on Phobos {{appear to}} be {{at or near the}} <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> level. This level is defined from other cratered {{surfaces}} in the solar system, and also by numerical modeling of crater populations (Hartmann and Gaskell 1997). In the region of Mars, craters smaller than ~ 90 meters go into <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> within about 1 Gy, so the small-crater populations do not provide tight constraints on Phobos age. Near-saturation levels for the few larger craters suggest a very old surface. Crater saturation on Phobos’s surface does prove that saturation can be reached in the Martian environment. This is a useful indication, in turn, that the primordial Martian surface should have been saturated. Thus, the lack of saturation around 1 km crater diameters in even the oldest parts of Mars is due to crater loss processes, not a unique size distribution of early Martian impactors. Some craters in crater chains around Stickney appear to have raised rims. The linear chains suggest that the craters mark drainage of (dry) regolith into fractures, but the raised rims suggest that blowout of volatiles along the fractures may have accompanied their formation. This is consistent with Phobos having formed as a D, P, or C class asteroid...|$|E

40|$|Saturn’s giant moon Titan has a {{landscape}} made of organic molecules, which {{is exposed to}} hydrocarbon-based rains, rivers, and lakes. Many of Titan’s surface features could have resulted from dissolution, transport, and evaporite-formation of solid organic materials {{in a manner similar}} to dissolution/evaporation processes on Earth. We have constructed an experimental apparatus using a fiber optic UV probe able to determine the rate of dissolution and the amount of material dissolved in hydrocarbon fluids at Titan’s surface temperature of 94 K. For our initial work, benzene was selected as our proxy Titan organic molecule – there is spectral evidence that it exists on Titan’s surface and has been detected in suprising amounts in Titan’s upper atmosphere. Our initial results demonstrate that a ca. 10 mg sample of solid powdered benzene dissolves in 100 mL of ethane to its <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in about an hour at 94 K. The <b>saturation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is 18 mg per L. This compares to the value of quartz in water at neutral pH (9 mg per L). It should be noted that the waters of the Roraima massif in Venezuela, one of the areas with the best developed solutional landforms in quartzite, have dissolved silica concentrations of less than 1 mg per L. While benzene was selected for initial laboratory investigation, there are other organic molecules on Titan that are predicted to have orders of magnitude higher solubility and higher abundance on the surface, notably acetylene and hydrogen cyanide. The solubility of acetylene in a methane/nitrogen Titan rainfall mixture at 95 K is predicted to be of the same magnitude as that of gypsum and water at 298 K (25 C).

Carbon-carbonate buffers such as EMOG (enstatite-magnesite-olivine-graphite) provide a lower fO 2 limit for carbonate stability. For mantle compositions, the position of the carbonate-oxide equilibrium has been experimentally calibrated at 20 kbar and 1000 °C at graphite <b>saturation.</b> This <b>equilibrium</b> constrains the upper fO 2 limit for carbonate stability given that Fe contents are much less than Mg in both carbonate and spinel. The experimental results are in good agreement with calculations based on existing thermodynamic data. Using appropriate upper-mantle compositions and activity models for carbonate and spinel, it is thus possible, at any pressure, to constrain the stability field of carbonate as a function of temperature and oxygen fugacity. The calculated stability field is generally compatible with current estimates of upper-mantle fO 2 (FMQ ± 1. 5 log units). -from Author...|$|R
