5|$|In 1970, the Ebenezer Avery House was {{in danger}} of being torn down to {{construct}} apartments and it was purchased by R. Stanton Avery. R. Stanton Avery purchased the property with the intention of turning it over to the Avery Memorial Association. Edwin Park, an architect, assessed the house as in need of extensive reconstruction and the association discussed the plan to move the house to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park. A meeting held on the association on July 24, 1971, was held to discuss the movement plan which involved disassembling and reassembling the house at its new location. The project to move the house was a <b>shared</b> <b>cost</b> between R. Stanton Avery and the Avery Memorial Association. By the 1972 meeting, the total cost of the relocation was $43,000 and the act provoked interest from the State of Connecticut. The house was donated to the State of Connecticut for use as a historic house museum.|$|E

40|$|For {{a shared}} good, {{a group of}} users determines its nature and <b>shares</b> its <b>cost.</b> In spite of {{heterogeneity}} in preferences and ability to pay, equal <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> is common for such goods. To facilitate group decision-making, this paper proposes institutions based on a method of tatonnement to find an efficient outcome with full cost recovery. To test their efficacy, four different types of institutions were experimentally compared.
