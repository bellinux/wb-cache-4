Several of these kits are also available for the OO modeller who aims for more realistic track, since most RTR track is actually scaled to HO and does not represent any British prototype and the <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing</b> is too close together for scale. EM gauge has slightly overscale flanges and flangeways on point and crossing work; P4 is closer to scale but the smaller flanges and flangeways on P&C work expose poor track construction.|$|E
30|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{research}} of Remington and Witting, Thompson et al. [47, 48, 49] conducted many studies on a track–bridge vibration model. Under that model, first, the bridge combined with the track was considered as an infinitely long Euler–Bernoulli beam with continuous elastic support. Then, the continuous elastic support was replaced by a fixed equivalent point support (i.e., two layers of continuous elastic support were modeled). Finally, discrete point supports were inserted between the track and the bridge to account for the random distribution of support stiffness, <b>sleeper</b> <b>space,</b> and beam mass. This model was used to study problems related to steel-bridge noise and validated SEA for calculation of low-frequency bridge-borne noise. The results showed that SEA is applicable for calculation of sound radiation above 40  Hz and that sound radiation calculation results below 40  Hz can be inaccurate.|$|R

30|$|A {{major concern}} for the railway {{industry}} is the growth of rail roughness, the formation of rail corrugation and the generation of wheel/rail noise. It is now well known that these unwanted phenomena are generated from dynamical interactions between moving wheels and rails. Due to operations of high-speed trains and roughness of short wavelengths on the wheel/rail rolling surfaces, wheel/rail interactions are of high frequencies up to several thousand Hertz, and involve complex vibrational wave propagations and resonances in the track structure. For a track with sleepers, a major track type used worldwide, it is normally modeled to be a periodic structure consisting of an infinitely long uniform main structure (i.e., the rails) attached at a given spacing (i.e., the <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing)</b> by {{an infinite number of}} supports (i.e., the railpad/sleeper/ballast).|$|E

An extensive field test was, therefore, conducted on an in-service heavy haul corridor in Australia with the specific aim of understanding the effect of the track input on the response of the IRJs.

40|$|AbstractBallasted track {{sleepers}} have the important function of providing sufficient lateral resistance {{to prevent the}} lateral movement of rails. If the lateral force induced by the thermal expansion of steel rails overcomes the lateral resistance of sleepers, rail buckling may occur. More {{attention has been paid}} to this problem of lateral stability since the introduction of continuous welded rails. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the prediction of the lateral resistance of sleepers. In view of the foregoing, a series of laboratory tests was conducted on 1 / 5 -scale models to evaluate the lateral resistance of sleepers. Single-sleeper pullout tests and track panel pullout tests were conducted on different types of concrete sleepers. The results of the pullout tests revealed the effects of the sleeper shape, the <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing,</b> and the number of sleepers on the lateral resistance.

40|$|Abstract: The main design {{criteria}} of ballasted railway tracks include rail deflections, rail bending stresses, rail wheel contact stresses, sleeper bending moments and ballast sleeper contact pressures. Various criteria have been defined {{for the design}} of ballasted railway tracks due to the various mechanical properties of track components and their complex interaction. Therefore, the railway track design is a difficult and time-consuming process. These complications highlight the need to focus attention on the necessity of a thorough investigation into the effect of the track and rolling stock parameters on the {{design criteria}}. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a sensitivity analysis of the main railway track design criteria was conducted in this study. Consequently, the roles of track and rolling stock parameters (including track modulus, <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing,</b> train speed and axle load) in the design of railway track were investigated for various track design criteria. The research findings provide new and practical suggestions in the analysis and design of ballasted railway tracks...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{defective}} wheels and/or irregularities of the rails generate impact forces. Generally vertical impact forces are determined using either field measurement or 2 D simulation models. As part of ongoing research on degradation of wagon-track system, a three-dimensional wagon - track system dynamics (3 DWTSD) model with the potential to predict the simultaneous occurrence of vertical and lateral impact forces has been developed at the Centre for Railway Engineering. The influence of two important track parameters, namely, the <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing</b> and the ballast depth to the dynamic impact has been examined using the 3 DWTSD model and presented in this paper. The peak vertical and lateral impact forces at the wheel-rail contact patch, and the vertical impact force at the pad, the ballast, the subballast and the sUbgrade are reported in addition to the peak displacements of the track components. The results show that the larger spacing of the sleepers and the lower depth of ballast produce soft track condition which leads to larger track deflection and smaller wheel-rail impact forces...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present an innovative numerical tool to represent the track and platform dynamic behavior under passing trains. Dynavoie is currently being developed for engineering purposes at SNCF. It is specifically designed to correctly reproduce the track and platform dynamic behaviors in the time domain. This model is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), adapted to the railway track using model reduction techniques. Taking advantage of the periodicity of the track introduced by the regular <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing,</b> one or several basic slices containing all the geometric properties of the structure can be identified. Static and periodic responses of these slices are computed. Then, reduction is performed using these deformations. Thus the number of degrees of freedom of the model is highly reduced. This reduction induces a decrease in computation time with limited accuracy loss in the representation of track dynamics. The methodology will be further described in this paper. The second novelty of this work is to use this model to analyze the dynamic behavior of a transition zone located in a French high speed line...|$|E
40|$|The {{classic and}} {{reinforced}} railway track {{is composed of}} two infinite rails separated from sleepers by visco-elastic pads. There are numerous assumptions leading to different simplifications in railway track modelling. The rails are modelled as infinite Timoshenko beams, sleepers by lumped masses or elastic bodies and ballast as a visco-elastic foundation. Nowadays the interest of engineers {{is focused on the}} Y-shaped sleepers. The fundamental qualitative difference between the track with classic or Y sleepers is related to local longitudinal symmetric or antymetric features of railway track. The <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing</b> influences the periodicity of elastic foundation coefficient, mass density (rotational inertia) and shear effective rigidity. The track with classical concrete sleepers is influenced much more by rotational inertia and shear deflections than the track with Y sleepers. The increase of elastic wave velocity in track with Y sleepers and more uniform load distribution will be proved by the analysis and simulations. The analytical and numerical analysis allows us to evaluate the track properties in a range of moderate and high speed train. However, the correct approach is not simple, since the structure of the track interacts with wheels, wheelsets, boogies and vehicles, depending on the complexity of the analysis. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of ground vibration from trains presents {{a number of}} difficulties. The ground is effectively an infinite medium, often with a layered structure and with properties that may vary greatly from one location to another. The vibration from a passing train forms a transient event, which limits the usefulness of steady-state frequency domain models. Moreover, {{there is often a}} need to consider vehicle/track interaction in more detail than is commonly used in frequency domain models, such as the 2. 5 D approach, while maintaining the computational efficiency of the latter. However, full time-domain approaches involve large computation times, particularly where three-dimensional ground models are required. Here, a hybrid modelling approach is introduced. The vehicle/track interaction is calculated in the time domain {{in order to be able}} t account directly for effects such as the discrete <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing.</b> Forces acting on the ground are extracted from this first model and used in a second model to predict the ground response at arbitrary locations. In the present case the second model is a layered ground model operating in the frequency domain. Validation of the approach is provided by comparison with an existing frequency domain model. The hybrid model is then used to study the sleeper-passing effect, which is shown to be less significant than excitation due to track unevenness in all the cases considered...|$|E

It is not pleasant to cross a lofty trestle bridge on foot in broad daylight, for one must step from sleeper to <b>sleeper</b> over wide <b>spaces</b> with empty air beneath, and, as the ties are just wide enough to carry the single pair of rails, it would mean death to meet a train.

White mist and the roar of hurrying water rose out of the chasm beneath, but another sound broke through the noise of the swift stream.

30|$|A Fourier transform-based {{method has}} been {{developed}} for calculating the response of a railway track as an infinitely long uniform periodic structure subject to moving or stationary harmonic loads. The track may become a non-uniform periodic structure by, for example, rail dampers which are installed between sleepers to control rolling noise and roughness growth. The period of the structure may become greater than the <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing.</b> For those new situations, {{the current version of}} the method cannot be directly applied; it must be generalized and this is the aim of this paper. Generalization is performed by applying periodic conditions to each type of support and summarizing contributions from all types of support. Responses of the rail, sleeper, and damper are all formulated as an inverse Fourier transform from wavenumber domain to spatial domain. The generalized method is applied to investigate dynamics of a typical track with rail dampers of particular design. It is found that the rail dampers can significantly suppress the pinned–pinned vibration of the original track, widen the stop bands and increase vibration decay rate along the rail. However, it is also found that a new pinned–pinned mode is created by the dampers and between about 450 and 1, 300  Hz dampers vibrate stronger than the rail, making noise radiation from the dampers a potential issue. These concerns must be fully investigated in the future. The formulae presented in this paper provide a powerful tool to do that.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method was}} developed to investigate the vertical dynamic behaviour of a railway track subjected to the loading of a moving train. The numerical simulations are {{carried out in the}} time-domain with what is known as a moving mass model. This doctoral thesis emphasises especially the influence on the train-track dynamics of the ballast mass (giving rise to inertia forces when a train passes), the influence of the non-linear characteristics of the railpad and of the sleeper support, and the part played by scatter in some track structure properties, such as varying railpad stiffness, varying ballast stiffness and varying <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing.</b> Full-scale measurements in the field sometimes reveal a track resonance at low frequency (somewhere in the region of 20 to 150 Hz). This resonant behaviour cannot be modelled unless the ballast-subgrade inertia is included in the track model, which is done here. Both laboratory and full-scale field measurements have shown that the load deflection behaviour of the railpad and the sleeper support are non-linear. In a realistic demonstration example, the influence of a state dependent railpad on railpad compression and rail wear was investigated. It was shown that, for a weakly state dependent railpad, the difference in results compared with those obtained for a linear model is negligible. Measurements have also shown that track parameter values are not constant along the track. In fact, very dissimilar properties have been observed even between neighbouring sleepers. It is concluded that, if one wants to investigate the mean values and variations of selected track parameters, a method that does not restrict the variation and distribution of the stochastic variables is, while not necessary, certainly preferable...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the Fourier-series {{approach}} is employed to study wheel–rail interactions {{generated by a}} single, or multiple wheels moving at a constant speed along a railway track. This approach has been previously explored by other researchers and what is presented here is an improved version. In this approach, the track is represented by an infinitely long periodic structure with the period equal to the <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing</b> and the vertical irregular profile (roughness) of the railhead {{is assumed to be}} periodic in the track direction with the period equal to the length of a number (integer), N, of sleeper bays. By assuming linear dynamics for the wheel/track system and for steady state, each wheel/rail force is a periodic function of time and can be expressed as a Fourier series. Fourier coefficients are then shown to be determined by solving, separately, N sets of linear algebraic equations. The coefficient matrix of each set of equations is independent of rail roughness and therefore this {{approach is}} particularly useful in modelling the generation and growth of rail roughness of short wavelengths. Excitation purely from the axle loads moving over the periodic track structure is realised by assuming a smooth railhead surface, and subsequently roughness equivalent to such an excitation is defined and evaluated. This equivalent roughness may, in addition to the actual rail roughness, be input into models in which the effect of moving axle loads has been excluded, so that the predictions from those models can be improved. Results are produced using the improved Fourier-series approach to investigate the effects of wheel speeds, roughness wavelengths and interactions between multiple wheels on wheel/rail contact forces...|$|E
30|$|Now {{it is well}} {{understood}} that the pinned–pinned vibration of the rail has an important impact on noise radiation and roughness growth. Rail vibration dampers (or rail vibration absorbers) [24, 25] are thus designed and installed between sleepers in order to suppress the pinned–pinned vibration. The rail damper proposed in [24] are tuned, damped mass–spring absorber systems, with either a single mass or two masses enclosed in an elastomeric material. These rail dampers have been installed at several sites in Europe, with some variations in design. To evaluate the effect of rail dampers on wheel–rail interaction forces and rail roughness growth [26], based on [6], uses the FEM to model the track. The track is truncated to include 50 sleeper bays (30  m in length) and the rail is modeled using four Timoshenko beam elements per sleeper bay. With such a track model being used, differential equations have to be solved in the time-domain at a low computational efficiency and possibly at a low accuracy. This is an obvious disadvantage of the FEM modeling approach, since the prediction of roughness growth requires {{a very large number}} of repetitious wheel/rail interaction calculations. Wu [27] outlines guidelines for designing rail dampers. When the damper is not short compared to the <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing,</b> bending of the beam in a damper may play a role. However, it is demonstrated in [28] that it is the rigid body motion of the beam of the absorber that leads to energy dissipation of rail vibration, whereas the bending deformation of the beam is a minor factor. Therefore, a simple mass–spring model in which the mass is allowed to vibrate translationally and rotationally, instead of an advanced beam–spring model, is enough to represent the rail damper.|$|E
40|$|During train operation, {{geometrical}} irregularities {{develop in}} soil-supported ballasted railway tracks {{as a function}} of born tonnage. This form of degradation is combatted by periodic maintenance in the form of tamping by specially equipped trains in order to guarantee predefined levels of structural performance. The growth of irregular settlements depends on one hand on track properties (such as <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing,</b> rail bending stiffness, subsoil geotechnical properties) and the intensity of longitudinal stiffness variations (variations in soil profile, switches and crossings, transitions etc.). The latter stiffness variations include both the static and the dynamic, frequency-dependent stiffness. On the other hand also the nature of the loading has an important influence. Running trains exert – depending on their velocity – quasistatic loads on the infrastructure due to the passing axles with a constant loading. Apart from this a dynamic loading component may occur with different frequencies as a result of non-perfect wheels, {{as a function of}} the speed. In general, the structural design of a railway line can be optimised with respect to its structural performance for the whole lifecycle. However, for existing lines this is difficult, and the only way to limit degradation and associated costs is to influence the condition of the rolling stock. The present study discusses theoretical backgrounds of track degradation in the form of differential settlements. It then shows results of an analysis of the loading conditions on Dutch railway lines, with both mixed passenger and freight transport and with dedicated freight traffic, based on actual measurements. Conclusions are drawn regarding deterioration and the effects of different loading types. Results show that especially on freight lines huge improvements are possible, with reductions in geometrical degradation up to 52 % of actual values. The main driver of excessive degradation appears to be the low-frequency dynamic axle loading component. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Ground {{vibration}} from trains is {{an increasingly}} important environmental problem. This study investigates the various excitation mechanisms of ground vibration. An existing semi-analytical model, TGV, which considers both the quasi-static excitation due to moving axle loads and the dynamic excitation due to vertical rail irregularities, has been validated by an extensive measurement campaign. This involved the determination of soil properties at two sites with soft clay soil. These were found to exhibit an inversion of the wave speed profile. Good agreement was found between measurements and predictions of vibration due to train pass-bys. The relative importance of the dynamic and quasi-static excitation mechanisms has been investigated {{for a range of}} conditions including changes to track and vehicle parameters. The dynamic excitation mechanism is found to dominate the results above about 10 Hz and at all frequencies for distances beyond 10 m from the track. In order to study other excitation mechanisms a new hybrid model has been developed. This combines a wheel/track interaction model working in the time-spatial domain and an axisymmetric layered ground model working in the wave number-frequency domain. In the time domain model a ‘circular’ track is introduced to allow longer responses to be calculated. The model is then validated by comparison with the existing TGV model. A reasonable agreement is found. The hybrid model has then been used to investigate the relative importance of quasi-static loads, dynamic loads and some other excitation mechanisms for trains running on the ground. The sleeper-passing effect is investigated for both constant and variable <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing</b> but it is found to give much lower responses than those due to roughness. Variable ballast stiffness is also investigated and found not to be significant. Impact forces caused by the passage of wheels over dipped welds and stepped joints are found to generate ground responses that are considerably larger than roughness excitation in the region close to these track defects. However the response decays more rapidly with distance than that due to roughness. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three main parts: The first part that uses classic track models {{as a basis for}} further developments, the second part that deals with constitutive behaviour of granular materials and the third part that describes {{the development of a new}} triaxial cell apparatus and the testing of a ballast material using this apparatus. The description of classic track models is focused on the beam-on-elastic-foundation model (abbr. BOEF model), which make use of the Winkler foundation, and a simple beam element model with linear discrete support. The shortcomings of the BOEF model is discussed: It assumes a continuous foundation, a continuously welded track, the weight of the track ladder is not incorporated, linear support which imply prediction of tension in the uplift regions, no shear deformation in the rails is taken into account, it cannot predict stresses and strains within the granular layers. While some of the shortcomings may easily be incorporated others are not: Especially to remove tension in the uplift zones, and to calculate stresses and strains in the granular layers. The latter actually requires a continuum approach. A track model that approximately eliminates the tension in the uplift regions has been developed for a single axle load. As expected, the model shows that the length of the uplift zone and the amount of uplift have higher values than predicted by the BOEF model. The model may be useful when considering contact problems in the track, for instance in a buckling-of-rails analysis. For the BOEF model a tool that makes use of dimensionless sensitivity diagrams has been developed. The method will in an easy way provide the new maximum track reactions when one or more track parameters are changed. It is hoped that this tool will prove very helpful in a design process, at least as a first step. Dimensionless sensitivity diagrams have been worked out for rail deflection, rail moment, rail seat load, tensional rail base stress and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast. The parameters considered are the design wheel load, rail moment of inertia, position of neutral axis in the rail, <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing,</b> sleeper width and the length of the sleeper that carries the vertical load. The dimensionless sensitivity diagrams for the BOEF model may be used both for a single axle load and for a double axle load. Also for a beam element model with linear discrete support the dimensionless sensitivity diagrams may be used, but only for a single axle load which is located directly above one of the supports, i. e. a sleeper. For the beam element model the diagrams for the rail deflection, rail seat load and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast are almost identical to the ones for the BOEF model, while the diagrams for the rail moment and tensile rail base stress are somewhat different. A beam element model with Euler-Bernoulli beam elements resting on nonlinear discrete supports was developed for a single axle load. The discrete supports, which were located at the sleeper positions, were modelled by a two-parameter power function. The model takes advantage of a measured load-deflection relationship, which is also modelled by a two-parameter power function. These latter parameters are generally found by regression of the measured data, while the two parameters for the discrete supports are found as part of the overall solution to the problem. The present version of the model only takes into account a short track section and further development of the model is therefore needed. The track ladder weight and a no tension option in the uplift region are not incorporated in the present version. The model is useful when the BOEF model cannot be used because of nonlinear track response. Regarding constitutive behaviour it is argued that the plastic strain per load cycle in a well functioning railway track must be very small and normally below 1 / 100 000 of the elastic strain per load cycle. If also the hysteresis of the material during a load cycle is small, then an elastic approximation could be justified when it comes to calculating the stresses. The plastic strains may then be detached from the stress-strain calculation and modelled separately on the basis of laboratory or field measurements. Several elastic constitutive models are described: The Hooke's law generalised to three dimensions, the cross anisotropic elastic model, two versions of the k-model, and two hyperelastic models. The general elasto-plastic framework with isotropic hardening is also described. The basics of repeated loading of a frictional system is described by analogy to a simple model with springs and frictional sliders. This model can be viewed as the basis for the pure kinematic multisurface model by Mróz and Iwan. Through energy considerations in cyclic loading of the frictional system the concept of reclaimed plastic strain is rejected. The concept of initial stresses and strains is discussed. It is argued that initial stresses cannot be large in the upper part of a road or railway embankment. The main reason for this is that granular materials cannot self equilibrate stresses through tension. The development and construction of triaxial equipment for testing railway ballast in its original grading is described. The specimens are 300 mm by 600 mm (diameter by height). A new and direct way of applying the confining load was developed, which allowed faster variation of the confining stress. A new instrumentation concept was invented where instrumentation rings are fastened to material particles instead of being attached to the outer membrane or to plugs embedded in the material. This arrangement measures the horizontal deformation. The vertical deformation has to be measured over the whole specimen length as resilient particle rotations prevented on-sample instrumentation. A test series on Vassfjell railway ballast was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the new apparatus and to characterise the ballast material. The overall performance of the apparatus was found to be good with a reliable repeatability, but some modifications were suggested to improve the loading procedure in the beginning of the load steps. The test series on Vassfjell ballast was rather limited and no advanced modelling of the results was found to be appropriate. Instead an isotropic linear elastic approach was followed. Moisture was added, to the natural retention capacity, to some of the specimens. It was found that the added moisture only slightly affected the mechanical behaviour of the material. A somewhat denser grading was also tested, but the observed effect on the material properties was limited. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} vehicle dynamics on lateral deterioration of the track alignment. As rail traffic runs along a route, the forces imposed upon the track cause the ballast to settle, and hence the track geometry deteriorates. At a specified value of deterioration the track geometry needs to be restored by tamping or other methods. As the deterioration is mainly in the vertical direction, this aspect has been more widely studied and models {{have been developed to}} predict vertical track geometry deterioration. On the other hand, lateral track deterioration is not as well understood, and this thesis aims to fill the gap in this knowledge. However, the understanding of the lateral deterioration mechanisms becomes more important as speed and capacity increase. This thesis describes statistical studies of track lateral deterioration, as well as the development and validation of a vehicle-track lateral dynamic interaction model. This work is undertaken to contribute to the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of track lateral deterioration, therefore making the effective control and reduction of the lateral deterioration achievable. The statistical analysis provides a better understanding of three aspects of track lateral irregularities, namely: the relationship between vertical and lateral irregularities, the relationship between track curvature and track lateral irregularity and the change in track lateral deterioration over time. The vertical and lateral track irregularity magnitudes are clearly correlated. The track quality in the vertical direction is generally worse than in the lateral direction, however the number of track sections with lateral quality significantly worse than the vertical is non-negligible. The lateral irregularities tend to be larger on curves. It is notable that less than ten percent of the track studied has a constant lateral deterioration due to frequent maintenance activities and bidirectional lateral dynamic forces. Unlike vertical settlement, lateral deterioration develops exponentially in both magnitude and wavelength, and the major influences are found from the irregularities with wavelength longer than 10 m. The change in track lateral irregularity with different curve radii and the lateral deterioration rate are described in separate exponential power functions due to the limitation of the available track data. The parameters for these empirical equations do not remain constant due to the change in track conditions. Current track lateral models mainly focus on lateral failures such as buckling and lateral sliding. The development of lateral track irregularities tends to be studied using representative values of net lateral forces and net L/V (Lateral/Vertical) load ratios. Unlike other track lateral deterioration models, the model developed in this thesis focuses on the development of lateral irregularities based on the dynamic interactions between the vehicles and the track system. This model makes it possible to carry out more integrations and analysis of the track lateral deterioration in a realistic dynamic simulation, using vehicle models, contact conditions, track initial irregularities, and traffic mix more close to the reality. The vehicle-track lateral dynamic interaction model was validated against track geometry data measured on the West Coast Mainline (WCML) in England. It has been found that the model gives a reasonably accurate prediction of the development of lateral track irregularities. However, it also tends to predict a short wavelength deterioration that is not seen in the actual track deterioration. Improvements to the model are suggested by either adding more factors or simplifying the model depending on specific target application. Enhancing the model by including more details, such as longitudinal forces, temperature effect, more layered track systems, uneven track bed conditions and more representative wheel-rail contact conditions etc., may help understand the reason of the additional short wavelength. A sensitivity analysis was performed in order to identify the critical factors that influence lateral track deterioration. The track damage caused by specific vehicles can be controlled by understanding different vehicle dynamics behaviour on a particular track section or route. Vehicles with simple suspension design and heavy axle loads tend to cause more lateral track damage. Within a certain speed range, there will be a critical speed that generates the largest lateral deterioration. Vehicles with different dynamic behaviours can generate a potential offset of the lateral deterioration, so it is possible to design the traffic mix to cancel out the peak deterioration. However, it may not be very practical to redesign the traffic mix due to different traffic requirements. Subsequently, actions can be taken to effectively reduce track lateral deterioration, such as optimise the suspension design, vehicle weight, the selection of an optimal operation speed, and enhance the traffic mix design. As the most important interface between vehicle and track, the wheel-rail contact condition has an extremely large influence on lateral deterioration. Wheel and rail profiles with different wear conditions can cause altered vehicle-track lateral dynamic interaction. It is found that increasingly worn wheel/rail profiles within an acceptable tolerance can effectively reduce the lateral deterioration. Lateral deterioration can also be reduced by increasing all the track stiffness values, damping values and the mass of rails and sleepers, or alternatively, by decreasing the <b>sleeper</b> <b>spacing.</b> The sleeper-ballast interface is found to play the most important role in lateral deterioration. The interfaces between the sleeper and ballast shoulder, crib and base determines the non-linear characteristic such as hysteresis and sliding features. Improving the strength of the sleeper-ballast interface can improve the elastic limits and hysteresis characteristics, hence reducing the lateral deterioration. The findings of the investigation indicate that the model provides in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms influencing lateral deterioration and provides effective solutions with consideration of vehicles, wheel-rail contact and the track system. Further work would include track data with sufficient information in order to develop a more comprehensive empirical model that describes the lateral deterioration, inclusion of more potentially influential factors such as: temperature, ground condition, traffic etc. The model can be improved by taking into account additional factors such as the influence of longitudinal forces from the wheels to the rails, different weather and temperatures, subgrade and ground conditions, etc. The reason for the high frequency noise in the deterioration prediction is not understood yet and it should be discussed in terms of more accurate vehicle simulation results and more comprehensive rail and wheel worn profiles measured on the target track and vehicles. Furthermore, the sleeper-ballast lateral characteristics are not well understood and the previous research in this area is quite limited. To improve on the present work {{it would be useful to}} carry out laboratory tests in order to capture more accurately track lateral stiffness and damping values as well as the comprehensive non-linear characteristic of track lateral residual resistance behaviour...|$|E
