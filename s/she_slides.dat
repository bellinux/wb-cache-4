25|$|To {{convince}} Hitchcock {{that the}} scene would work as planned, eight days before shooting {{of the final}} shower scene, Bass used a newsreel camera and Janet Leigh’s stand-in Marli Renfro to shoot footage on the set to plan the shots in more detail. Working with Hitchcock's editor George Tomasini, he edited this footage following the storyboards to show Hitchcock how the scene could work. In the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a spray {{of blood on the}} chest of Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as <b>she</b> <b>slides</b> down the tiles, and a close-up of her belly getting stabbed.|$|E
25|$|Part of Duffy's talent– besides her ear for {{ordinary}} eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety– is her ventriloquism. Like {{the best of}} her novelist peers... <b>she</b> <b>slides</b> {{in and out of}} her characters' lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets– that is, she makes it look easy.|$|E
500|$|The {{rush for}} Madonna's fashion {{started with the}} music video for [...] "Lucky Star". In the video, Madonna wore an all-black outfit with leggings, ankle boots, and belly button, with her tangled hair tied in a floppy black ribbon. This was coupled with a shiny black miniskirt, an earring on her right ear, cut-off gloves and rubber bangles. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was {{credited}} with designing the outfit, although biographer Mary Cross noted that Madonna was after all wearing her day-to-day outfit. Mary Lambert, then a Rhode Island School of Design graduate, was decided for directing the video. However, Arthur Pierson replaced her as the director. Warner Bros. gave Pierson a small budget to make the video, shot in an afternoon. Madonna's brother, Christopher Ciccone, is a back-up dancer in the video. In his book Life with My Sister Madonna he says that although he was only paid $200 to dance in the video, {{at the time he}} was [...] "just happy to be part of it." [...] The video starts with the close-up of Madonna's face, as <b>she</b> <b>slides</b> her sunglasses down her nose. This scene was a reference to the character of Lolita in Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film of the same name, and Audrey Hepburn in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). The image then fades to white, denoting the celestial stars dazzle, and then resumes itself in color. Madonna is shown dancing against a stark white background, along with closeups of her mesmerised gaze. She is accompanied by Belle and brother Christopher, as backup dancers. The video ends with the initial black-and-white image repeated, but in retrograde, as Madonna puts back on the sunglasses. The taking down and putting up of those sunglasses provided a frame to contain the song, functioning like a curtain that marks the opening and closing of a stage performance.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{tells the}} story of a young mother who lives a hectic life. On a late-night Christmas Eve drive on a snow-covered road on her way to Cincinnati, Ohio, the woman begins sorting out her {{emotions}} and bemoans not having enough time to do the things that really matter. Then, her car hits a patch of black ice, causing the woman to lose control of her car. She panics, the car then crashes <b>she</b> <b>slides</b> across the ice. It ends up with her seeing her child safely asleep in the back [...] "sleeping like a rock" [...] and she prays to Jesus asking for forgiveness.|$|E

60|$|Soon {{they get}} glimpses of broad silver Whit, as <b>she</b> <b>slides,</b> with divided streams, through bright water-meadows, and stately groves of poplar, and abele, and pine; while, far aloft upon the left, the downs rise steep, crowned with black fir spinnies, and dotted with dark box and juniper.|$|E

50|$|Jungians emphasise the {{importance}} of recognising the patient's perspective throughout the episode, the danger being that 'if psychiatry itself considers the situation incomprehensible...many exclusion mechanisms will be set to work and <b>she</b> will <b>slide</b> down the slope of a deeper and deeper regression'.|$|R
6000|$|Enter JOSEPHINE and NAPOLEON together, {{somewhat}} out of breath. [...] With careless suppleness <b>she</b> <b>slides</b> {{down on a}} {{couch and}} fans [...] herself. Now that the candle-rays reach her they show her mellow [...] complexion, her velvety eyes with long lashes, mouth with pointed [...] corners and excessive mobility beneath its duvet, and curls of [...] dark hair pressed down upon the temples by a gold band.|$|E
6000|$|Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod's three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed, {{momentarily}} neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous {{attitude of}} the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, [...] "There <b>she</b> <b>slides,</b> now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman! Sail over him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|CHLOE, in a tea-gown, is {{standing}} by the forward end of the [...] sofa, very still, and very pale.

It [...] peers at CHLOE, vanishes, and the door is closed. CHLOE raises [...] her hands, covers her eyes with them, drops them with a quick [...] gesture, and looks round her. A knock. With a swift movement [...] <b>she</b> <b>slides</b> on to the sofa, and lies prostrate, with eyes [...] closed.|$|E

50|$|A slide {{with the}} skateboarder's {{frontside}} facing the obstacle he or <b>she</b> is <b>sliding</b> on, or the skateboarder {{is facing the}} direction of travel when sliding on flat ground.

6000|$|When Lankin and I {{descend to}} the cabin, then, {{the tables are}} full of gobbling people; and, though there DO {{seem to be a}} couple of places near Lady Kicklebury, {{immediately}} she sees our eyes directed to the inviting gap, <b>she</b> <b>slides</b> out, and with her ample robe covers even more than that large space to which by art and nature she is entitled, and calling out, [...] "Horace, Horace!" [...] and nodding, and winking, and pointing, she causes her son-in-law to extend the wing on his side. We are cut of THAT chance of a breakfast. We shall have the tea at its third water, and those two damp black mutton-chops, which nobody else will take, will fall to our cold share.|$|E
6000|$|The {{ship was}} very {{different}} now from {{what it had been}} when he first saw it. There were four little masts put up in it, on which were hoisted gay and gaudy flags. Her [...] "hull," [...] or body, was now coppered and neatly painted, while all the rubbish of the building-yard was cleared away, so that everything looked neat and clean. The stocks, or framework on which she had been built, sloped towards the water, so that when the props were knocked away from the ship, she would slide by her own weight into the sea. Ships are always built on sloping stocks near to the water's edge; for you can fancy how difficult it would be to drag such a great thing into the water by main force. In order to make her slip more easily, the [...] "ways," [...] down which <b>she</b> <b>slides,</b> are covered with grease.|$|E
6000|$|... "She expects, of course, {{the very}} highest wages, if she condescends to live out; and by {{help of a}} trim outside appearance, and the many {{vacancies}} that are continually occurring in households, she gets places, where her object is to do just as little of any duty assigned to her as possible, to hurry through her performances, put on her fine clothes, and go a-gadding. She is on free-and-easy terms with all the men she meets, and ready at jests and repartee, sometimes far from seemly. Her time of service in any one place lasts indifferently from a fortnight {{to two or three}} months, when she takes her wages, buys her a new parasol in the latest style, and goes back to the intelligence-office. In the different families where she has lived she has been told a hundred times the proprieties of household life, how to make beds, arrange rooms, wash china, glass, and silver, and set tables; but her habitual rule is to try in each place how small and how poor services will be accepted. When she finds less will not do, she gives more. When the mistress follows her constantly, and shows an energetic determination to be well served, she shows that she can serve well; but the moment such attention relaxes, <b>she</b> <b>slides</b> back again. She is as destructive to a house as a fire; the very spirit of wastefulness is in her; she cracks the china, dents the silver, stops the water-pipes with rubbish, and, after she is gone, there is generally a sum equal to half her wages to be expended in repairing the effects of her carelessness. And yet there is one thing to be said for her: she is quite as careful of her employer's things as of her own. The full amount of her mischiefs often does not appear at once, as she is glib of tongue, adroit in apologies, and lies with as much alertness and as little thought of conscience as a blackbird chatters. It is difficult for people who have been trained from childhood in the school of verities,--who have been lectured for even the shadow of a prevarication, and shut up in disgrace for a lie, till truth becomes a habit of their souls,--it is very difficult for people so educated to understand how to get on with those who never speak the truth except by mere accident, who assert any and every thing that comes into their heads with all the assurance and all the energy of perfect verity.|$|E
60|$|For the rest, Mary's {{talents in}} making a home {{agreeable}} have had since then many years of proof; and where any of the little domestic chasms appear which are formed by the shifting nature of the American working-class, <b>she</b> always <b>slides</b> into the place with a quiet grace, and reminds me, with a humorous twinkle of the eye, that she is used to being second girl.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{went out}} backwards, {{with a faint}} warmth in his face, {{and when he had}} brought {{in the rest of the}} baggage he went up and {{assisted}} Louis, their third hand, to break out the anchor and get the Sorata under way. <b>She</b> was <b>sliding</b> out through the Narrows when he dropped through the scuttle into the forecastle, and found Valentine filling a tray.|$|R

50|$|The Soup Dragon: {{a benign}} (female) {{creature}} with {{a penchant for}} Green Soup. The Soup Dragon dwells in the soup wells within the Clangers' planet. She is often summoned by tapping on the top of what look like small inactive volcanoes; <b>she</b> <b>slides</b> the lid back, and then takes a jug from (usually) Small Clanger, which she fills for them to eat. A green glow is visible beneath her when she emerges, suggesting the presence of a substantial lake of green soup.|$|E

She was laughing.|$|R

50|$|A slide {{with the}} skateboarder's back side facing the {{obstacle}} he or <b>she</b> is <b>sliding</b> on, or the skateboarder is not facing {{the direction of}} travel when sliding on flat ground.
