500|$|Dillard, the {{daughter}} of an oil company executive, grew up in an upper middle-class home in Pittsburgh.

[...] She attended Hollins College in Roanoke County, Virginia, receiving both a bachelor's (1967) and a master's degree (1968). [...] At Hollins she came under the tutelage of poet and creative writing professor Richard Henry Wilde Dillard, whom she married in 1965. [...] She would later state that Richard taught her everything <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> writing. [...] Her master's thesis, [...] "Walden Pond and Thoreau", studied the eponymous pond as a structuring device for Henry David Thoreau's Walden. [...] Dillard's knowledge of Thoreau's works was an obvious inspiration, although critics have pointed to many differences between their two works. [...] However, in a nod to his influence, Dillard mentions within the text that she named her goldfish Ellery Channing, after one of Thoreau's closest friends.|$|E

[...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E

The episode features a guest appearance by Patty Hearst, a wealthy heiress and famous kidnapping victim. Series creator Rob Thomas {{came up with the}} idea for Hearst's storyline in July 2006, stating, [...] "If we can get Patty Hearst to play a board of trustees member – what if she got kidnapped? That would be a pretty great story to tell. It's not an idea we've broken, but it's up on the wall as a possibility." [...] Hearst had recently appeared on single-episode parts on Boston Common and Son of the Beach. Due to a miscommunication between Thomas, Hearst, and her agent, Hearst was booked for Veronica Mars before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the guest role, with Thomas telling TV Guide that she was playing a character that was similar to herself. Hearst described reacting to the casting news: [...] "I was on the computer one day and read that I was going to be on Veronica Mars. Rob Thomas was giving an interview and happily saying, 'Oh yes, and we’re very excited.' [...] " [...] After hearing this news, Hearst contacted her agent and jokingly asked her when the agent was planning on telling her that she would be appearing on the show.|$|E

On June 30, 1994, after conducting its own investigation of the attack, the USFSA stripped her of her 1994 U.S. Championships title and banned her for life from participating in USFSA-run events as either a skater or a coach. The USFSA concluded that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the attack before it happened and displayed [...] "a clear disregard for fairness, good sportsmanship and ethical behavior". Although the USFSA has no control over non-competitive professional skating events, she was also persona non grata on the pro circuit because few skaters and promoters would work with her. Consequently, she failed to benefit from the professional skating boom that ensued {{in the aftermath of the}} scandal.|$|E
