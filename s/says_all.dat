5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and <b>says</b> <b>all</b> 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E

[...] "La Vailarina Vecina" [...] {{was inspired by a}} true story that happened to Arjona while he lived in Madrid. The singer commented about a woman: [...] "She was to do her trials and 'tickled', as the song <b>says,</b> <b>all</b> my roof, and those tickles didn't let me sleep." [...] He further commented that when he planned to meet her, he discovered that she was [...] "very beautiful".

500|$|These ten, the Commentator Buddhaghosa <b>says,</b> <b>all</b> {{fit within}} the three first bases of merit: 'Giving' {{includes}} 'Transferring merit to others' and 'Rejoicing in others' merit' by extension, whereas 'Virtue' includes 'Honoring others' and 'Offering service'. The remaining items 'Listening to Teachings', 'Instructing {{others in the}} Teachings' and 'Straightening one's own views' are part of 'Mental development'. Thus, in Theravāda Buddhism, merit is always accrued through morally (good) actions. Such good deeds are also highly valued {{in the other two}} Buddhist schools, that is Mahāyāna (China, Japan, etc.) and Vajrayāna (Tibet, Nepal, etc.). In some forms of Mahāyāna or Vajrayāna it is believed, however, that even more merit will accrue from certain ritual actions, sometimes called the 'power of blessed substances' (...) [...] These are considered an addition to the traditional list and can help protect against calamities or other negative events caused by bad karma.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, the Mosawa Center for Arab Rights in Israel {{paid for}} ads on {{television}} and radio stations in Israel. In the television ads, the Arabic phrase for [...] "have a nice day" [...] would flash onto the screen in black letters and on a red background. Immediately following the Arabic phrase would be a Hebrew phrase that said, [...] "Are you already against it without even knowing what it <b>says?</b> <b>All</b> we wanted to say is have a nice day." [...] Spokeswoman Abir Kopty stated that [...] "he purpose of this campaign was mainly to cause the Israeli public sitting at home, or walking down the street, to ask itself why it had a negative reaction to everything Arab, {{even if it is}} the simplest phrase." [...] Kopty further said that the Mosawa Center wanted to encourage Arabs to be more active and more visible in the community.|$|E
500|$|Kohl {{arrives with}} Jones' {{requested}} items and is told to come {{the following morning}} with some paperwork. Jones also asks Kohl for one more thing: Olivia. Peter insists on interrogating the wounded man himself and tells him he has radiation poisoning. The man breaks down and says he was hired freelance but does not know his boss's name. He <b>says</b> <b>all</b> he knows is that his crew is going to a field in Westford, and Olivia figures out it is Little Hill, a word previously given to Jones. Walter remembers the machine he built that is hidden in the safe deposit boxes is able to [...] "retrieve anyone from anywhere". Loeb and his remaining team begin setting up at Little Hill, while Jones kills Kohl in Frankfurt. Jones puts on Kohl's suit and is seen preparing for something by putting on suntan lotion and eye drops. While the FBI converge on Little Hill, Olivia is attacked and captured en route by Loeb's forces. Jones is successfully teleported from Frankfurt to Little Hill.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{historical}} events inspired Voltaire to write Candide, {{most notably the}} publication of Leibniz's [...] "Monadology", a short metaphysical treatise, the Seven Years' War, and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. [...] Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in Candide and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, tsunami, and resulting fires of All Saints' Day, had a strong influence on theologians {{of the day and}} on Voltaire, who was himself disillusioned by them. The earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism, a philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur. Optimism is founded on the theodicy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz that <b>says</b> <b>all</b> is for the best because God is a benevolent deity. This concept is often put into the form, [...] "all is for the best in {{the best of all possible}} worlds" [...] (Fr. Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles). Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into the optimist world view.|$|E

500|$|Acton's book {{is divided}} into {{chapters}} with brief, often single word titles such as [...] "Fish". In a marked departure from eighteenth century English cookery books like Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery, these are written as connected wholes. The chapter on fish begins with an essay on how to choose fish for freshness; there follows some {{advice on how to}} bake fish, and on the kinds of fat best used for frying fish. Suitable pans are illustrated. The recipes follow; these too are written as stories rather than simply as instructions. Where appropriate, recipes end with a list of ingredients, as well as the cooking time, in marked change from eighteenth century practice. Recipes are grouped, in the case of fish by species, and they form a connected story. Acton adds comments where she sees fit, indicating anything from when the food is in season to where a recipe came from, and how much she likes it. For example, she begins her account of the John Dory with a recipe which is more of an introductory essay than a set of instructions, though given the simplicity of the recipe, it <b>says</b> <b>all</b> that a cook would need to know on the matter: ...|$|E

2500|$|Inspired {{by these}} words, Bett sought the counsel of Theodore Sedgwick, a young abolition-minded lawyer, {{to help her}} sue for freedom in court. [...] According to Catherine Sedgwick's account, she told him, [...] "I heard that paper read yesterday, that <b>says,</b> <b>all</b> men are created equal, and that every man {{has a right to}} freedom. I'm not a dumb critter; won't the law give me my freedom?" [...] After much {{deliberation}} Sedgwick accepted her case, {{as well as that of}} Brom, another of Ashley's slaves. [...] He enlisted the aid of Tapping Reeve, the founder of Litchfield Law School, one of America's earliest law schools, located in Litchfield, Connecticut. They were two of the top lawyers in Massachusetts, and Sedgwick later served as US Senator. Arthur Zilversmit suggests the attorneys may have selected these plaintiffs to test the status of slavery under the new state constitution.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2001 book Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. Navy and the Spanish–American War, Wegner revisits the Rickover {{investigation}} and offers additional details. According to Wegner, Rickover inquired with naval historians, at the Energy Research and Development Agency, about Maine, after reading {{an article in}} the Washington Star-News in which its author, John M. Taylor, claimed the U.S. Navy [...] "made little use of its technically trained officers during its investigation of the tragedy." [...] The historians, then working with the admiral on a study of the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program, said they knew no details of Maines sinking. When Rickover asked whether they could investigate the matter, the historians, now intrigued, agreed. Knowing of Rickover's [...] "insistence on thoroughness," [...] Wegner <b>says,</b> <b>all</b> relevant documents were obtained and studied. These included the ship's plans and weekly reports of the unwatering of Maine, in 1912, by the chief engineer for the project, William Furgueson. These reports included numerous photos, annotated by Furgueson with frame and strake numbers on corresponding parts of the wreckage. Two experts on naval demolitions and ship explosions were brought in. Since the photos showed [...] "no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside," [...] they believed the explosion originated inside the ship.|$|E

2500|$|Some hint of Cnut's {{childhood}} can {{be found}} in the Flateyjarbók, a 13th-century source that says he was taught his soldiery by the chieftain Thorkell the Tall, brother to Sigurd, Jarl of mythical Jomsborg, and the legendary Joms, at their Viking stronghold on the island of Wollin, off the coast of Pomerania. His date of birth, like his mother's name, is unknown. Contemporary works such as the Chronicon and the Encomium Emmae, do not mention this. Even so, in a Knútsdrápa by the skald Óttarr svarti, there is a statement that Cnut was [...] "of no great age" [...] when he first went to war. It also mentions a battle identifiable with Sweyn Forkbeard's invasion of England and attack on the city of Norwich, in 1003/04, after the St. Brice's Day massacre of Danes by the English, in 1002. If Cnut indeed accompanied this expedition, his birthdate may be near 990, or even 980. If not, and if the skald's poetic verse references another assault, such as Forkbeard's conquest of England in 1013/14, it may even suggest a birth date nearer 1000. There is a passage of the Encomiast (as the author of the Encomium Emmae is known) with a reference to the force Cnut led in his English conquest of 1015/16. Here (see below) it <b>says</b> <b>all</b> the Vikings were of [...] "mature age" [...] under Cnut [...] "the king".|$|E
2500|$|In the basement, while Hook contemplates an escape, Zelena {{says that}} her anti-magic cuff is the real problem. Hook says he has magic in his hook, but says that {{the last time he}} helped her, she betrayed him. She says that even though he doesn't know if he can trust her, he has no choice now. He slips off the cuff and she gets rid of her shackles, and puts herself into a fresh outfit, before coming over to Hook and undoing his shackles. Zelena tells Hook they have to sneak out the back, but Hook says he’s not going. When Zelena {{questions}} why, Hook says he needs to stop Emma, and Zelena bids him goodbye. Hook searches Emma's house then takes a painting off the wall, but then, Emma comes in, saying that she was trying to help Hook. Hook finds the squid ink {{on the back of the}} painting and splashes her with it, saying that she’s a villain now, like Regina said. He says she has to tell him what happened in Camelot, but Emma says that he can't make her. Zelena returns and says she that she couldn't leave without making the Dark One pay. Zelena stabs Hook in the chest, but he doesn't bleed or suffer any wounds, and he demands to know what’s happening. She says she found a Dreamcatcher outside, which can explain what happened. Emma whispers to him not to trust her and that she can explain everything. Hook tells Zelena to do it and she shows him his memories. The Dreamcatcher shows Hook his memories in Camelot, before showing him the events involving his current situation. It turns out that Hook was fatally wounded by Excalibur, and in order to save him, Emma tethered his life to Excalibur, which turned into another Dark One. Emma tells him that she’s sorry and says she had no choice. Hook says there must be another explanation. Zelena hands Hook the re-united Excalibur and she removes a glamour spell, and shows him that his name is on the bottom part of the sword while Emma’s name is on the dagger end, gloating about them being [...] "the Dark Ones." [...] Emma says she wanted to make up for this, and {{says that her}} plan was the only way to get rid of the darkness in both of them. She <b>says</b> <b>all</b> she did was to try to save him, but Hook is enraged, saying, [...] "So much for our future, Swan." [...] Zelena asks if he’s ready to find out what else happened in Camelot and he says yes, much to Emma's dismay. But Hook tells Zelena that first, they have to take care of Emma.|$|E
