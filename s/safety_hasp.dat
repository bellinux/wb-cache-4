40|$|Developing {{standard}} operating procedures is an essential feature of most workplaces. They range from words of caution and a checklist for new employees in a retail store to extensive tomes and material data safety sheets in a manufacturing facility. Formal health and <b>safety</b> plans (<b>HASPs)</b> are a requirement for hazardous waste work, and embody the training, equipping, and evaluation of workers. There are relatively few manuals that provide practical guidance in what a HASP should cover or how to create and implement one. This paper details development of a HASP to cover field researchers and the ship’s personnel in a remote {{area of the world}} (western Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific Ocean), hundreds of kilometers from the nearest emergency room. It illustrates the meshing of a general HASP with a ship safety plan, a dive safety plan, an on-Island remote camping and trekking plan and covers components including firearms and vehicle safety and communication strategy. An expedition of this sort requires extensive planning and experienced safety personnel, and cannot rely on luck to assure the safe return of participants...|$|R

40|$|The Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant is {{currently}} under a Federal Agreement to define soil and groundwater contamination and develop remedies to protect {{human health and}} the environment. The western end of the site is known to have a former nitric acid disposal pit that has been remediated and capped. Remedial investigation data indicate this pit was a source of nitrate, uranium, technetium, and other metals contamination in groundwater. The downgradient receptor of this contamination includes Bear Creek and its tributaries. A feasibility study is under way to develop a remedy to prevent further contaminant migration to this receptor. To support the feasibility study, the treatability study is being completed to examine groundwater treatment at the S- 3 site. This document serves as the top-level command medium for Phase II of the Bear Creek Valley (BCV) Treatability Study and, as such, will be the primary resource for management and implementation of field activities.

40|$|This revised health & <b>safety</b> plan (<b>HASP)</b> {{addendum}} {{was prepared}} {{on behalf of}} Ford Motor Company to describe air monitoring activities to be implemented during upcoming excavation work at SR- 3 and other site areas. Air monitoring activities are designed to assure that remediation work conducted within SR- 3 (and subsequent locations) is conducted {{in a manner that}} is protective of human health and the environment, with particular emphasis on the health of site workers and local residents. The scope of work proposed is outlined in the following sections. Background ARCADIS has performed health & safety monitoring throughout excavation activities to ensure that site workers are not exposed to unsafe concentrations of airborne contaminants. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are monitored using an Ultra-RAE photo-ionization detector (PID), with testing for specific compounds conducted using compound-specific draeger tubes. To date, monitoring performed by ARCADIS has indicated that airborne volatile organic compounds were not present at concentrations in excess of Level C action levels within the work zone as defined in Table 1 below. Compound-specific sampling using draeger tubes has also confirmed that benzene was not detected at a concentration in excess of the draeger tube detection limit (0. 5 ppm). However, recent test pitting activities within sludge removal area SR- 3 have indicated that airborne VOCs may be generated by excavation activities at concentrations in excess of Level C action levels in the work zone. Objectives Air monitoring will be performed within, and at the perimeter of the SR- 3 work zone during remedial activities to fulfill the following objectives: ARCADIS G&M, Inc...|$|R
