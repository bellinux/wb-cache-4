40|$|Much attention, both {{nationally and}} internationally, {{has been given}} to {{mathematics}} teaching and student mathematical performance (e. g. No Child Left Behind Act (2001), National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1991, 2000) standards, Common Core State Standards Initiative, Trend in International Mathematics and Science Study (2013), and Program of International Student Assessment PISA (2013)). Teachers of mathematics have come under greater scrutiny and demands for student success have been placed upon them. Research has shown that teacher efficacy and mathematics teaching efficacy, forms of self-efficacy beliefs (Bandura, 1977, 1997), can {{have a positive impact on}} teaching and learning. Yet, there has been limited research on the mathematics teacher efficacy of preservice elementary teachers (Swars, 2005). This study examined the impact of the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> on the mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of preservice elementary teachers. What happens to the level of mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of preservice teachers during the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience?</b> What are the characteristics of preservice teachers with low and high levels of efficacy beliefs? What factors from the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> influenced efficacy beliefs? A qualitative case study (Merriam, 2009) with an embedded survey was used to address the previous questions. The results of this study demonstrate that mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of preservice teachers rose significantly during the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience.</b> However, the change was not uniform. Personal mathematics teaching efficacy (PMTE) increased significantly. Although mathematics teaching outcome expectancy (MTOE) increased, it was not significant. Furthermore, the research indicates four characteristics influenced mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs: attitude toward mathematics, use of manipulatives, motivation to teach, and persistence.

The objectives were to: (1) compile a list of clinical experiences, both early field and <b>student</b> <b>teaching,</b> that currently are provided in the clinical experiences for students of agricultural education in three selected teacher education programs, and (2) determine which tasks should be included for both the early field and <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences.</b> A modified Delphi technique was used to collect data via three questionnaires. Data were analyzed using mean scores and standard deviations of tasks rated on a five point Likert-type scale. Those tasks that the panelists rated with a standard deviation of less than or equal to one were considered to have met consensus, as suggested by Shinn (1998). The population for this study consisted of agriculture teachers, secondary school administrators, agricultural education field staff, and agricultural education teacher educators from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Thirty-four Delphi panel members were purposively selected from the population.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} the effects of the influence of cooperating teachers on how student teachers prioritize particular goals of education. This was accomplished by administering a predetermined list of eighteen educational goals to a group of student teachers prior and subsequent to their quarter-long <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience,</b> and to their respective cooperating teachers during their student teaching quarter. The list enabled the teacher groups to rank the goals in order of priority. In this way the cooperating teachers 2 ̆ 7 goal rankings were compared to both the student teachers 2 ̆ 7 pre and post student teaching goal rankings. Twenty-three student teachers and their respective cooperating teachers in secondary and special education served as subjects. The Phi Delta Kappa Goal Setting Instrument was used as the goals list in the study. The questions explored were: 1) are there differences between the relative importance as signed to selected educational goals by student teachers prior to the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> and the relative importance assigned to the same goals by the cooperating teachers; 2) are there differences in the relative importance assigned to selected educational goals by student teachers before their <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> as compared to their assigned rankings after their student teaching experience; and 3) is there a relationship between any changes in the relative importance assigned by the student teachers prior and subsequent to the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> and the relative importance assigned by the cooperating teachers. To test the hypotheses under investigation, eighteen one-way analyses of variance with repeated measures were computed. Significant F ratios were found for two of the eighteen goals; the remaining F ratios were not statistically significant. The results suggest some tentative support for student teachers 2 ̆ 7 goal prioritizations of two goals changing after the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience.</b> Some tentative support was also suggested on these two goals for the student teachers 2 ̆ 7 goal prioritizations changing after the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> to become more similar to the cooperating teacher 2 ̆ 7 s goal prioritizations. However, the lack of significant change in sixteen of the eighteen goals more strongly suggested that the influence of a) the experience of the student teaching activity and b) the cooperating teachers 2 ̆ 7 own goals prioritization biases upon the student teachers did not markedly affect student teacher goal prioritization behavior.

Subjects included 35 undergraduate elementary education majors enrolled in reading methods courses and student teaching across three semesters, and the 35 cooperating teachers of the student subjects. Three hypotheses were tested during the five phases of the study. Hypothesis 1 examined the relationship between subjects' theoretical orientations to reading and their reading methods coursework. Hypothesis 2 focused on the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> and the theoretical orientations of the cooperating teachers.

40|$|This {{inquiry is}} the first {{systematic}} study of cooperating teachers ’ perceptions of the agricultural education <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> in Oklahoma {{in more than three}} decades. The sampling frame (N = 64) included cooperating teachers representing 55 student teaching centers. A questionnaire was sent to cooperators via postal mail. The instrument included 13 items identifying selected characteristics of cooperating teachers and centers. In addition, teachers rated 34 elements of the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> using a Likert-type scale (“ 5 ” = “High Importance [...] . “ 1 ” = “No Importance”); final return rate was 77 %. Cronbach’s coefficient alpha reliability estimates for five core areas of the <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> ranged from. 47 to. 87; the overall importance scale yielded an estimate of. 93. Respondents rated 33 of 34 elements as having “much importance ” or greater (M> 4. 00). The highest rated element was “a well rounded program emphasizing instruction, SAEs, and youth leadership activities ” (M = 4. 92; SD =. 34). The core area “Cooperating Teacher-Student Teacher Relationships ” accounted for seven of the ten highest rated elements. Recommendations and implications point to the need for greater diversity in cooperating teachers and centers, for instrument re-design as related to the construct of instruction, and for the provision of targeted professional development opportunities for cooperating teachers...|$|E
30|$|However, some teacher {{education}} programs have transitioned to a service learning approach for their experiential education component. While not an explicit focus of this paper, {{it is important to}} note that service learning has mutual benefits for both the individual who is providing the service as well as the person and/or community receiving the service, which is substantially different from traditional practicum and <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experienced</b> by most prospective mathematics teachers [48]. Specifically, “service learning is a pedagogical approach in which students learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized service experiences that meet actual community needs” [11], p. 28). Therefore, as prospective teachers participate in service learning, they actively engage in and reflect on the service experience [6, 11].|$|R

To assist us in our future careers, we chose to research the best practices and write lesson plans that correlate with these studies. Our goal is to incorporate our findings into our curriculum. We have included a review of literature to summarize our research. Also, we created a weekly schedule based on our <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences.</b> The lessons are to serve as a structure in building this ideal classroom community. Classroom management, physical factors, routines and procedures, community circles, and character education are essential components of our lessons. As all experienced educators do, we too must reflect on our work. To conclude this thesis, we have included a reflection piece that explains our thoughts and ties everything together.

40|$|In this {{research}} inquiry, I focused on my <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences</b> {{in an urban}} Kindergarten classroom where I observed students developed multiple reading needs, wants, and interests. I investigated {{how to use the}} classroom library to motivate students in their learning and personal reading. I developed and implemented a plan that used student activity centers, questionnaires, and lesson plans that utilized my cooperating teacher’s classroom library. I analyzed data using content analysis (Neuendorf, 2002). Classroom activities involve listening, implementing word workstations that featured books in the classroom library, using book displays to drive instruction, and incorporating literature in lessons. They were examined through student inquiries and interviews. My findings support that motivation is influenced by the way the classroom library is presented and how well it is utilized to engage students in reading...|$|R
