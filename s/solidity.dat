Miller was a mediocre student, which disappointed Woodfull; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller {{was selected for}} the school's first XI, scoring 44. His control and <b>solidity</b> prompted the spectators to call him The Unbowlable—Woodfull's own nickname.

5|$|In {{line with}} Müller's advice, Jovanović avoided {{creating}} a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters and situations he observed {{during his time}} in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first-hand experience. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent of images of the lamentation over the body of Christ. The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanović thus directs the viewer's eye from left to right, foreground to background, through the circular pattern of the groupings as well as the diagonal lines of the peasants' swords. In line with Müller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanović adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making it appear as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the <b>solidity</b> of the walls to quick short ones that make it appear like the figures are in motion.|$|E
5|$|Miller went to {{the local}} state school before {{transferring}} to Melbourne High Schoola selective government institution that accepted students through an academic examat the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was {{more in line with}} that of a private school than a standard government school. Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.}} Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student.Perry, p. 18. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto Honour the Work in exhorting his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and <b>solidity</b> prompted the spectators to call him the Unbowlable, the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne {{went on to win the}} match,Perry, p. 20. and Miller impressed his captain Keith Truscott, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would follow in his footsteps. Truscott's social influence compounded the distractions from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class,Perry, p. 21. and was forced to repeat year 9.|$|E

Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm {{is used to}} handle multiobjective {{design optimization}} problems. Performances of compressors are evaluated by using the axisymmetric through-flow code UD 0300 M that employs the streamline curvature method. To demonstrate feasibility of the present method, a multiobjective optimization of a four-stage compressor design was performed for maximization of the overall isentropic efficiency and the total pressure ratio. Total pressure and <b>solidities</b> at the rotor trailing edges, and flow angles and <b>solidities</b> at the stator trailing edges are considered as design parameters.

40|$|A new {{analytical}} {{model for the}} permeability of anisotropic porous media composed of a periodic in-line arrangement of long rectangular rods, {{also referred to as}} 'fibers', was developed. This analytical permeability model was based on an approximation of the microscopic velocity and pressure fields that develop in the pores of the porous medium. The analytical approximation of the velocity field was assessed by an extensive set of numerical simulations of the microscopic velocity and pressure fields for various <b>solidities</b> and aspect ratios of the rectangular rods. The numerical results were obtained by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, using a volume-penalizing immersed boundary method in which a binary 'masking function' was used to represent the inner geometry of the fluid domain. At the pore scale, laminar flow develops, which is dominated by viscous effects. Therefore, an analytical approximation of the microscopic velocity field based on Poiseuille flow through long slender channels of variable width was proposed. This extended Poiseuille model was compared to the numerical simulations in case the pressure gradient was imposed either 'transverse' or 'longitudinal' to the solid rods that make up the porous medium. The simulated velocity fields compare quite closely with the Poiseuille model for a range of <b>solidities.</b> Based on the extended Poiseuille flow approximation of the velocity field, an {{analytical model}} for the effective, anisotropic permeability was developed, which can be used in macroscopic simulations of porous transport. This permeability model was found to describe the permeability for the 'transverse' and 'longitudinal' configurations accurately for viscous, laminar flow (Re less than or similar to 5) at <b>solidities</b> greater than or similar to 0. 35. The proposed permeability model was found to be more reliable, for the transverse direction, if the fibers were positioned relative to the flow such that the longest side of the cross section of a fiber was aligned with the main flow direction.

The S-wave velocity data, {{all of them}} were accurately measured in boreholes using the PS suspension logging tool, were collected from two regions, seven sites, 128 boreholes, and more than 6, 000 points. We tried to obtain the original waveform data wherever possible and reanalyzed them to have high quality and precision on S-wave velocities. N-values obtained by in situ Standard Penetration Test (SPT), bulk densities, <b>solidities,</b> and mean grain sizes measured by the standard soil test, and elastic constants determined by tri-axial dynamic loading tests were correlated with the S-wave velocities at the same horizons in the same boreholes. Lithofacies based on detailed core investigation were taken account of in the correlation analysis. Conventionally, S-wave velocities were correlated to N-values. However the dynamic range and measurement accuracy of SPT is too low to compare with S-wave velocity data obtained using the suspension logging tool. So it is possible to estimate N-values from S-wave velocity data using an empirically synthesized equation, but is very hard to estimate S-wave velocities from the low quality SPT data. A clear relationship was recognized between S-wave velocities and <b>solidities,</b> and it varies with lithofacies and depositional age.
