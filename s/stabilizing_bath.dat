40|$|AbstractNi–P {{electroless}} coating {{was applied}} on {{low carbon steel}} with the incorporation of different amounts of nano Al 2 O 3 powder (ranging from 3 g/l to 30 g/l) in electroless bath. Corrosion properties and microstructures of the coating were studied. The dispersion stability of alumina colloidal particles stabilized by polymeric (non-ionic) surfactants in an electroless bath was also investigated. The surface morphology and the relevant structure were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Corrosion behavior of the coated steel was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization techniques. The results showed that increasing alumina concentration not only changed the surface morphology, but also promoted the corrosion resistance. Addition of surfactants has an indirect effect {{on the amount of}} the incorporated particles. Meanwhile, in the presence of surfactant, corrosion resistance of Ni–P coating containing even a small quantity of alumina was improved since a <b>stabilized</b> <b>bath</b> was obtained...|$|R
40|$|Background. Osmotic {{dehydration}} (OD) is {{a technology}} that allows the concentration mainly of fruits and vegetables, without change of phase, through partial water removal, when immersed in a hypertonic solution of sugar, salt or others. It can be successfully ap-plied to some products whose production is not fully marketed in fresh form. However, an additional process is necessary to stabilize the product. The process leads to the achievement of high quality alternative products, with an extended shelf-life, economy in storage and transport. The aim of this work was to study, at a pilot scale, the behaviour evaluation of a sucrose dehydration solution, during twelve OD reuses, {{and the quality of}} processed mandarins. Material and methods. The process was carried out using mandarins (Citrus reticulata Blanco) cv Clementina Nova, from Algarve, Portugal, manually peeled and segments chemically skinned. In assays a 60 °Brix sucrose solution was used, conducted in thermo [...] <b>stabilized</b> <b>baths,</b> at 45 °C, 16 h, 40 oscillations per minute and a fruit:solution ratio of 1 : 2 (m/m). After each OD cycle, the solution was filtered and reconcentred to 60 °Brix by sucrose addition, and adjusted to original volume. The osmodehydrated mandarins were stabilized by pasteurization. The drying solution behaviour and mandarins ‟ qualit...|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} large, close-packed arrays of x-ray transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters. In such a device, sufficient heat sinking {{is important to}} to minimize thermal cross talk between pixels and to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>bath</b> temperature for all pixels. We have measured cross talk on out 8 x 8 arrays and studied the shape and amount of thermal crosstalk {{as a function of}} pixel location and efficiency of electrothermal feedback. In this presentation, we will compare measurements made on arrays with and without a backside, heat-sinking copper layer, as well as results of devices on silicon-nitride membranes and on solid substrates, and we will discuss the implications for energy resolution and maximum count rate. We will also discuss the dependence of pulse height upon bath temperature, and the measured and required stability of the bath temperature...|$|R

The experiment was carried out in a temperature-controlled <b>bath</b> <b>stabilized</b> to better than ± 0.01 K which houses a cylindrical copper shell as the sample container. The typical data-taking time for a given frequency scan over the full range is 30 min. After each scan, the suspension is shaken in an ultrasonic shaker before the next run begins.|$|R

The present process permits contact- free thin films to be produced more rapidly than conventional processes, and allows precise control of the final film thickness. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|A time {{dependent}} {{thermal model}} for a superconducting constriction based weak-link (WL) is discussed for investigating the deterministic dynamics of its temperature and phase. A new dynamic regime is found where a non-zero voltage exists across the WL and its temperature <b>stabilizes</b> between the <b>bath</b> temperature and superconductor's critical temperature. This regime exists over a limited bias current range and {{gives rise to a}} new hysteretic regime in current-voltage characteristics. We also discuss the effect of fluctuations on the current-voltage characteristics and experimental implications of this dynamic regime. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures; revised on 25 Nov 201...|$|R
40|$|Cu 2 O {{coatings}} with 111 orientation comprising crystallites with {{a triangular}} pyramidal morphology could be deposited at pH = 12 from <b>baths</b> <b>stabilized</b> {{with a variety}} of ligating agents showing that oriented crystallization is independent of the ligand structure. When the deposition is carried out at very high OH- concentrations (pH > 14), the coatings are unoriented and comprise crystallites with octahedral morphology. In some of these coatings, the loss of orientation is attributed to the random tilt of the long axes of the crystallites with respect to the normal to the substrate. In others, the loss of orientation is due to the redissolution of pre-grown faceted crystallites. Given that the dominant morphology of the crystallites obtained under these conditions is octahedral, crystal growth takes place under conditions of thermodynamic control.

40|$|Cathodic {{reduction}} of a strontium bicarbonate <b>bath</b> <b>stabilized</b> {{by a variety}} of amine-carboxylic acids as ligands resulted in the deposition of micrometers-thick SrC O 3 coatings by electrogeneration of base. The use of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) yielded SrC O 3 coatings with a distinct c -axis orientation. The degree of orientation is higher in thick rather than thin coatings. The degree of orientation is also reduced when the DTPA concentration is increased or the pH is increased. These observations suggest that oriented crystal growth is due neither to the template effect of the substrate nor any additive mediated interaction due to DTPA but is solely due to the kinetics of crystallization. The SrDTPA complex has the highest stability constant among the ligands studied, indicating the low degree of supersaturation in this bath compared to those stabilized by other complexing agents. SrC O 3 deposition is a good model for the study of aragonite CaC O 3 deposition by virtue of being isostructural with the latter and having the smallest lattice mismatch with aragonite among the heavier metal carbonates.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{thiourea}} nd guanidine hydrochloride on electroless copper plating were studied by voltammetric and gravimetric methods. Thiourea <b>stabilizes</b> the plating <b>bath</b> and simultaneously decreases the plating rate. The effect of stabilization {{is attributed to}} the strong complexing ability of thiourea with Cu(I) and the surface adsorption of thiourea on copper. The surface adsorption {{is the main reason}} for the decrease in plating rate. In the case of guanidine hydrochlo-ride, the plating rate is maximum when its concentration is approximately 5 mg/liter. The occurrence of the maximum is interpreted in terms of the interplay of the delocalized ~- electron effect of guanidine hydrochloride and its surface ad-sorption on copper. Since ABS was plated with metals successfully in 1960 (1), the technology of plastics plating has been improving continuously (2, 3). Numerous parts for industrial and household products formerly made with metals were re-placed by plated plastics (4 - 6). The demand for plated plastics has been increasing rapidly; hence, the technique of preparing more stable electro]ess plating baths wit...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a lattice gas model of cluster growth via the diffusive aggregation of particles {{in a closed}} system obeying a local, deterministic, microscopically reversible dynamics. This model roughly corresponds to placing the irreversible Diffusion Limited Aggregation model (DLA) in contact with a heat bath. Particles release latent heat when aggregating, while singly connected cluster members can absorb heat and evaporate. The heat bath is initially empty, hence we observe the flow of entropy from the aggregating gas of particles into the heat bath, which is being populated by diffusing heat tokens. Before {{the population of the}} heat <b>bath</b> <b>stabilizes,</b> the cluster morphology (quantified by the fractal dimension) is similar to a standard DLA cluster. The cluster then gradually anneals, becoming more tenuous, until reaching configurational equilibrium when the cluster morphology resembles a quenched branched random polymer. As the microscopic dynamics is invertible, we can reverse the evolution, observe the inverse flow of heat and entropy, and recover the initial condition. This simple system provides an explicit example of how macroscopic dissipation and self-organization can result from an underlying microscopically reversible dynamics.
