40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the application of}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to qualitative estimate of the erosion phenomena expected in the actual <b>Slurry</b> <b>Mixer</b> Evaporator (SME) and MFT (Melter Feed Tank) process facilities by calculating erosion drivers. Using the transport equations governing the slurry flow, two erosion mechanisms were considered to evaluate high erosion sites and to investigate {{the primary cause of}} erosion damage for the modeling domain representative of the actual mixing process in the SME/MFT vessels. One of the two erosion mechanisms is the abrasive erosion which is worn by high wall shear of viscous liquid or by continuous contact or low-angle collision of the moving solids with rough surface, and the other is the chip-off erosion which is mainly governed by high-angle impingement of particles. Ductile wall material such as stainless steel is damaged by wall mechanism when particles are impinged on the ductile surface of the present coil guide geometry with wide-open space and no closed- and curved-flow path. The previous results show that the primary locations of high erosion due to particle impingement are at the occurrence of sudden change of flow direction, sudden contraction, and flow obstruction...|$|E
40|$|The United States Department of Energy (US DOE) has {{determined}} that Tanks 18 -F and 19 -F have met the F-Tank Farm (FTF) General Closure Plan Requirements and are ready to be permanently closed. The high-level waste (HLW) tanks have been isolated from FTF facilities. To complete operational closure they will be filled with grout for the purpose of: (1) physically stabilizing the tanks, (2) limiting/eliminating vertical pathways to residual waste, (3) discouraging future intrusion, and (4) providing an alkaline, chemical reducing environment within the closure boundary to control speciation and solubility of select radionuclides. Bulk waste removal and heel removal equipment remain in Tanks 18 -F and 19 -F. This equipment includes the Advance Design Mixer Pump (ADMP), transfer pumps, transfer jets, standard <b>slurry</b> <b>mixer</b> pumps, equipment-support masts, sampling masts, dip tube assemblies and robotic crawlers. The present Tank 18 and 19 -F closure strategy is to grout the equipment in place and eliminate vertical pathways by filling voids in the equipment to vertical fast pathways and water infiltration. The mock-up tests described in this report were intended to address placement issues identified for grouting the equipment that will be left in Tank 18 -F and Tank 19 -F. The Tank 18 -F and 19 -F closure strategy document states {{that one of the}} Performance Assessment (PA) requirements for a closed tank is that equipment remaining in the tank be filled to the extent practical and that vertical flow paths 1 inch and larger be grouted. The specific objectives of the Tier 1 A equipment grout mock-up testing include: (1) Identifying the most limiting equipment configurations with respect to internal void space filling; (2) Specifying and constructing initial test geometries and forms that represent scaled boundary conditions; (3) Identifying a target grout rheology for evaluation in the scaled mock-up configurations; (4) Scaling-up production of a grout mix with the target rheology (16 second flow cone value) from 0. 25 cubic feet to 4. 3 cubic feet. (Ten 0. 43 cubic batches were produced because full-scale equipment was not available for the Tier 1 A test.); (5) Demonstrating continuous gravity filling of the ADMP mock up test form; (6) Demonstrating continuous gravity filling of 1 inch and 2 inch schedule 40 pipe; and (7) Demonstrating filling of 1 inch and 2 inch schedule 40 pipe from the bottom up by discharging through a tube inserted into the pipes. The Tier 1 A mock-up test focused on the ADMP and pipes at least one inch in diameter. The ADMP which is located in center riser of Tank 18 -F is a concern because the column for this long-shaft (55 ft) pump is unique and modification to the pump prior to placing it in service limited the flow path options for filling by creating a single flow path for filling and venting the ADMP support column. The large size, vertical orientation, and complicated flow path in the ADMP warrants a detailed description of this piece of ancillary equipment...|$|E
50|$|Ceramic shell casting {{techniques}} using silica, zirconia {{and other}} refractory materials are currently {{used by the}} metal parts industry for 'net casting', forming precision shell moulds for molten metal casting. The technique involves a successive wet dipping and dry powder coating or stucco {{to build up the}} mould shell layer. The shell casting method in general is known for dimensional stability and is used in many net-casting processes for aerospace and other industries in molten metal casting. Automated facilities use multiple wax patterns on trees, large <b>slurry</b> <b>mixers</b> and fluidic powder beds for automated dipping.|$|R
40|$|Erosion {{occurring}} in equipment dealing with liquid-solid mixtures such as pipeline parts, slurry pumps, liquid-solid stirred reactors and <b>slurry</b> <b>mixers</b> in various industrial applications results in operational failure and economic costs. A slurry erosion tank test rig is designed and {{was built to}} investigate the erosion rates of materials and the influencing parameters such as flow velocity and turbulence, flow angle, solid particle concentration, particles size distribution, hardness and target material properties on the material loss and erosion profiles. In the present study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool is used to simulate the erosion rate of sample plates in the liquid-solid slurry mixture in a cylindrical tank. The predictions were made in a steady state and also transient manner, applying the flow at the room temperature and using water and sand as liquid and solid phases, respectively. The multiple reference frame method (MRF) is applied to simulate the flow behavior and liquid-solid interactions in the slurry tank test rig. The MRF method is used since it is less demanding than sliding mesh method (SM) and gives satisfactory results. The computational domain {{is divided into three}} regions: a rotational or MRF zone containing the mixer, a rotational zone (MRF) containing the erosion plates and a static zone (outer liquid zone). It is observed that changing the MRF zone diameter and height causes a very low impact on the results. The simulated results were obtained for two kinds of hard metals namely stainless steel and ST- 50 under some various operating conditions and are found in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Tank 30 H is {{the receipt}} tank for {{concentrate}} from the 3 H Evaporator. Tank 30 H has had problems, such as cooling coil failure, which limit {{its ability to}} receive concentrate from the 3 H Evaporator. SRS High Level Waste wishes to use Tank 37 H as the receipt tank for the 3 H Evaporator concentrate. Prior to using Tank 37 H as the 3 H Evaporator concentrate receipt tank, HLW must remove 50 inches of salt cake from the tank. They requested SRTC to evaluate various salt removal methods for Tank 37 H. These methods include <b>slurry</b> pumps, Flygt <b>mixers,</b> the modified density gradient method, and molecular diffusion...|$|R
5000|$|Standardized {{concrete}} is {{a highly}} durable material, predominantly thanks to the increasing amount of cement at stricter environmental classes. But cement is a costly component and has a relatively powerful impact on the environment. Partly because of this, alternative binders such as fly ashes and slags are applied in the concrete sector. As a result, the content of Portland cement can be reduced in many cases. Other recycled raw materials can also contribute to a more economic or less environmental polluting concrete composition. 1. Usage of residual products from the concrete industry, for example stone dust (from crushing aggregates), concrete <b>slurry</b> (from washing <b>mixers)</b> or concrete waste2. Usage of residual products from other industries, for example fly ash from coal plants and slags from the metallurgical industry3. Usage of new types of cement with reduced environmental impact (mineralized cement, limestone addition, waste-derived fuels) ...|$|R
40|$|Tank 40 {{simulation}} models with four submersible slurry pumps {{available for the}} CST suspension operations {{have been developed to}} provide operational guidance of slurry pumps for an efficient sludge removal. A series of the modeling calculations have been performed for key operational parameters such as pump operation mode, number of operating pumps, and to provide a recommendation for CST suspension and mixing operations in Tank 40. Reference design and operating conditions shown in Table 1 were used to perform the modeling analysis of the tank CST mixing. In the analysis, the pump was assumed to be stationary or rotating. Solid obstructions including the pump housing, the 14 inches riser, and 6. 75 -ft tank support column were included in the {{simulation models}}. Free surface motion of the tank liquid was neglected for high tank liquid level using the literature information. Steady-state and transient analyses with a two-equation turbulence model were performed with FLUENTTM. All analyses we re based on three-dimensional results. A suspension capability was evaluated assuming that local fluid velocity {{can be used as a}} measure of CST suspension and mixing. For a minimum suspension velocity of 1. 1 ft/sec for the largest CST size of 700 microns, the results indicated that at least two existing <b>slurry</b> <b>mixers</b> running at 3800 gpm flowrate per nozzle could keep CST solids suspended from the tank with a 200 in liquid level. In this case, the exception is for the fluid region with less than 20 wt contents of CST material. This is based on the conservative assumption that the largest CST size of 700 micron diameter remains unchanged neglecting a friable effect during the entire period of pump operations. The length of time that the CST material is exposed to the liquid stream lower than minimum suspension velocity is also important in affecting the ability of the liquid stream to suspend CST particle, and this effect is quantified in the present analysis by using the literature result s. The model results show that at least two pumps on opposite sides could keep suspending the CST material based on the slurry with 35 wt contents, but that at lower concentrations, particles larger than about 400 microns would tend to settle quickly and probably not remain in suspension long enough for the opposite jet to come around and stir that region of the tank. The main conclusions are as follows: The steady-state flow patterns on the horizontal discharge plane follow a series of parabolic curves similar to that of a free jet available in the literature. For the simulations, a series of the modeling calculations was performed with indexed stationary and rotating pump operations. The calculated results demonstrated that the existing slurry pumps running at 7600 gpm could suspend the CST particles from the tank with a 200 in liquid level, based on a minimum sludge suspension velocity of about 1. 1 ft/sec for 700 micron CST particle. The suspension distance for the transient model with pump rotations is smaller than that of the steady-state model with indexed pump orientations for given operating conditions. However, total suspension extents for the two modeling cases have about the same area...|$|R
