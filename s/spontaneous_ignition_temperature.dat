40|$|Many {{municipal}} waste combustors use preheated primary {{air in the}} first zone to dry the waste. In most cases the preheat temperature does not exceed 140 °C. In previous experiments {{it is found that}} at temperatures around 200 °C, in some circumstances, self- or spontaneous ignition can be achieved. Using preheated air can be a powerful tool to control the ignition and combustion processes in a waste combustion plant. To use this tool effectively, the influence of the preheated air on the fuel bed needs to be well understood. The present work is done to investigate in a systematically way the spontaneous ignition behaviour of a packed bed heated with a preheated air stream. Experiments on a lab scale packed bed reactor are carried out for various fuel types. Because MSW is an highly inhomogeneous fuel, wood and char are used as model fuels. To include the inhomogeneous character of MWS, also experiments are carried out with RDF. Parameters such as primary air flow velocity and temperature, addition of inert material, moisture content of the fuel (wood chips) and particle size (char) have been changed to see their effect on the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> and on the minimum air temperature needed for ignition. The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> is defined as the bed temperature at which a transition takes place from a negligible or slow fuel reaction rate to a rapid oxidation of either the volatiles or the solid fuel without an external source such as a spark or a flame. The minimum or critical air temperature is defined as the lowest air temperature at which ignition can be obtained. It is found that the type of fuel has influence on the ignition temperatures. Besides both the critical air temperature needed for the spontaneous ignition and the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> increase with an increase in the primary air velocity (between 0. 1 and 0. 5 m/s) and increasing the added inert fraction (between 0 and 40 wt%), irrespective of the fuel type. The effect of air flow velocity and temperature and also the effect of inert on both the critical air temperature and the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> can be explained qualitatively by using Semenov’s analysis of thermal explosions.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{thorough}} examination of high-pressure enriched oxygen system design and analysis focussing on material selection and incident investigation. The aims are {{to develop a}} model to predict <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> (SIT), enable the use of more accessible measurement apparatus, and to devise a scientific methodology to investigate oxygen incidents. Chapter 1 contains examples of incidents in high-pressure enriched oxygen and outlines current methods of material selection and incident investigation. The major flaws with the current systems are explored and the objectives of this work are identified. Chapter 2 details {{the current state of}} the knowledge in relation to oxygen incidents. Materials flammability is explored, and the importance of correct material selection is established. The criteria, standards and test methods currently used to aid this decision are assessed, and the importance of proper oxygen incident investigation is determined. Chapter 3 shows a programme of experimental work with details on the use of different apparatus for the measurement of SITs. Data acquired from the BS 4 N 100 bomb test, and pressurised, and ambient, differential scanning calorimetry are recorded. The use of Thermal Desorption/Gas Chromatography is explored to identify polymer evaporation and degradation products. In Chapter 4 a simple model is developed to adapt SIT allowing calculation of the SIT of a non-metal in any pressure or oxygen concentration. Data obtained in chapter 3, and from the literature, is used to validate this model. Data on metals is also collected from the literature to be incorporated into a methodology demonstrating the kindling chain. Chapter 5 covers the development of a ‘tool kit’ for oxygen incident analysis. Understanding of ignition modes, heat transfer modelling, flow diagrams, and the SIT model are used to examine past oxygen incidents, and understand kindling chains. Chapter 6 examines ‘real life’ incidents and applies the Chapter 5 ‘tool kit’ as a clear scientific methodology, identifying likely incident ignition sources and kindling chains. Finally Chapter 7 gives conclusions, identifying the successes and limitations of this work, and points where difficulties were encountered. Areas where further scientific investigation is required are identified...|$|R

40|$|Many {{municipal}} waste combustors use preheated primary {{air in the}} first zone to dry the waste. In most cases the preheat temperature does not exceed 140 °C. In previous experiments {{it is found that}} at temperatures around 200 °C, in some circumstances, self- or spontaneous ignition can be achieved. Using preheated air can be a powerful tool to control the ignition and combustion processes in a waste combustion plant. To use this tool effectively, the influence of the preheated air on the fuel bed needs to be well understood. The present work is done to develop a model that predicts the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of the fuel bed and the critical temperature of the primary air at which the fuel bed ignites. The influence of primary air flow rate and addition of inert are modeled for a packed bed of wood. From the model a dimensionless parameter is derived in which all investigated parameters (fuel type, air flow rate and inert fraction) are combined. This parameter appears to be sufficient to describe both the spontaneous ignition and the critical air temperature. The results from the model are validated with experiments presented in previous work [1]. The model slightly over-predicts the temperatures by 6 – 7 °C, and the trends are predicted well. Besides calculations for the temperatures, the ignition time and location are calculated as well. The ignition time is under-predicted due to the assumption of a uniform temperature distribution inside the particles. The location of ignition is predicted well. For char, a minimum <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> is derived from DSC measurements. The temperature at which the interaction of char and oxygen switches from endo- to exothermic seems to coincide with the spontaneous ignition temperatur...|$|E

40|$|High {{pressure}} enriched oxygen {{is used in}} a wide {{number of}} areas, including aircraft, medical breathing apparatus, diving, mining and mountaineering operations. It is also used {{for a number of}} industrial processes, but is most commonly used for combustion. Where the pressure or concentration of oxygen is increased well above that of atmospheric, oxidation reactions occur more readily, and at a faster rate, relative to those under atmospheric conditions. Thus the criteria used for polymer selection is key to preventing, or at least limiting, the possibility of a catastrophic oxygen incident which endangers both property and human life. In this work <b>spontaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> (SIT) data obtained in high pressure enriched oxygen from both differential scanning calorimetry and oxygen bomb testing are compared. A model is derived to enable the calculation of a SIT of a non-metal at any pressure and oxygen concentration using existing test data from other pressures. This has been shown to work with reasonable success for most materials tested, being validated using the comparison of test data from the oxygen bomb test and Pressurised Differential Scanning Calorimetry (PDSC) testing. These results may indicate the suitability of a PDSC for safety testing in the future. Further work is needed to increase the data base of ignition test data from PDSCs, and thermodynamic constants to allow for the direct comparison, and to assess the suitability of this apparatus for safety testing of more materials...|$|E
