5|$|Bird, who was Pixar's first outside director, {{developed}} {{the film as}} an extension of 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after the box office disappointment of his first feature, The Iron Giant (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop The Incredibles. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing and realistic <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair.</b> Michael Giacchino composed the film's orchestral score.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, to lubricate and waterproof the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> of mammals. In humans, they occur in the greatest number on the face and scalp, but also on {{all parts of the}} skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine.|$|E
5|$|W3 {{is found}} in Arabian horses descended from R Khasper, a near-white {{stallion}} born in 1996. Neither of his parents were white, and the causative mutation (c.706A>T) {{is thought to have}} originated with this horse. It is a nonsense mutation on Exon4. Horses with the W3 allele often retain interspersed flecks or regions of pigmented <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair,</b> which may fade with time. Some members of this family possess blue eyes, but these are thought to be inherited separately from the white coat. Based on similar studies in mice, researchers have named W3 as potentially homozygous nonviable.|$|E
50|$|The colors used {{to depict}} the family is {{different}} on The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show. Weirdly's green skin has a muddier tone <b>and</b> his <b>hair</b> is changed from dark green to light brown, while Gobby is changed from having light blue <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> purple <b>hair</b> to pale green <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> bright blond <b>hair.</b> Creepella has white <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> black <b>hair</b> (in contrast to the green <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> red <b>hair</b> shown previously on The Flintstones), and speaks with a faux-Transylvanian accent instead of a high-pitched voice. It is {{this version of the}} character that the modern-age villainous Laff-A-Lympics character Mrs. Creepley is based upon.|$|R

5|$|Mosaicism in horses {{is thought}} to account for some {{spontaneous}} occurrences of white, near-white, spotted, and roan horses. Mosaicism refers to mutations that occur after the single-cell stage, and therefore affect {{only a portion of}} the adult cells. Mosaicism may be one possible cause for the rare occurrence of brindle coloring in horses. Mosaic-white horses would be visually indistinguishable from dominant whites. Mosaicism could produce white or partially white foals if a stem cell in the developing foal underwent a mutation, or change to the DNA, that resulted in unpigmented <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair.</b> The cells that descend from the affected stem cell will exhibit the mutation, {{while the rest of the}} cells are unaffected.|$|E
5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair.</b> Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E
5|$|In a 2015 study, {{high-quality}} genome sequences {{from three}} Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. Approximately 1.4 million DNA nucleotide {{differences were found}} between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair,</b> storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice, and have wavier hair. There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.|$|E

25|$|True white horses have unpigmented pink {{skin and}} unpigmented white hair, though eye color varies. The lack of pigment in the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> {{is caused by}} the absence of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Some coat colors are {{characterized}} by light or white-like coats and even pinkish skin, however these white-like coats are not lacking melanocytes. Instead, white-like coat colors result from various changes in the ways melanocytes produce pigment.|$|E
25|$|The hue {{of human}} <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> is {{determined}} by the presence of pigments called melanins. Human skin color can range from darkest brown to lightest peach, or even nearly white or colorless in cases of albinism. Human hair ranges in color from white to red to blond to brown to black, which is most frequent. Hair color depends on the amount of melanin (an effective sun blocking pigment) in the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair,</b> with hair melanin concentrations in hair fading with increased age, leading to grey or even white hair. Most researchers believe that skin darkening is an adaptation that evolved as protection against ultraviolet solar radiation, which also helps balancing folate, which is destroyed by ultraviolet radiation. Light skin pigmentation protects against depletion of vitamin D, which requires sunlight to make. Skin pigmentation of contemporary humans is clinally distributed across the planet, and in general correlates with the level of ultraviolet radiation in a particular geographic area. Human skin also has a capacity to darken (tan) in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

25|$|DHT is biologically {{important}} for sexual differentiation {{of the male}} genitalia during embryogenesis, maturation of the penis and scrotum at puberty, growth of facial, body, and pubic hair, sebum production, and development and maintenance of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. It is produced from the less potent testosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase in select tissues, and is the primary androgen in the genitals, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> follicles.|$|E
25|$|Genes {{affecting}} keratin {{were found}} to have been introgressed from Neanderthals into modern humans (shown in East Asians and Europeans), suggesting that these genes gave a morphological adaptation in <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> to modern humans to cope with non-African environments. This is likewise for several genes involved in medical-relevant phenotypes, such as those affecting systemic lupus erythematosus, primary biliary cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, optic disk size, smoking behavior, interleukin 18 levels, and diabetes mellitus type 2.|$|E
25|$|MC1R {{is one of}} the key {{proteins}} {{involved in}} regulating mammalian <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> color. It is located on the plasma membrane of specialized cells known as melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin through the process of melanogenesis. It works by controlling the type of melanin being produced, and its activation causes the melanocyte to switch from generating the yellow or red phaeomelanin by default to the brown or black eumelanin in replacement.|$|E
