25|$|The server {{component}} of RDS is Terminal Server (termdd.sys), which listens on TCP port 3389. When a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client connects to this port, it is tagged {{with a unique}} SessionID and associated with a freshly spawned console <b>session</b> (<b>Session</b> 0, keyboard, mouse and character mode UI only). The login subsystem (winlogon.exe) and the GDI graphics subsystem is then initiated, which handles the job of authenticating the user and presenting the GUI. These executables are loaded in a new session, rather than the console session. When creating the new session, the graphics and keyboard/mouse device drivers are replaced with RDP-specific drivers: RdpDD.sys and RdpWD.sys. The RdpDD.sys is the device driver and it captures the UI rendering calls into a format that is transmittable over RDP. RdpWD.sys acts as keyboard and mouse driver; it receives keyboard and mouse input over the TCP connection and presents them as keyboard or mouse inputs. It also allows creation of virtual channels, which allow other devices, such as disc, audio, printers, and COM ports to be redirected, i.e., the channels act as replacement for these devices. The channels connect to the client over the TCP connection; as the channels are accessed for data, the client is informed of the request, which is then transferred over the TCP connection to the application. This entire procedure {{is done by the}} terminal server and the client, with the RDP mediating the correct transfer, and is entirely transparent to the applications. RDP communications are encrypted using 128-bit RC4 encryption. Windows Server 2003 onwards, it can use a FIPS 140 compliant encryption schemes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{group was}} {{originally}} based on Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, {{but by the}} 1960s had developed a unique sound based on emerging styles of soul and funk music, with a notable penchant for bizarre lyrics. The group struggled for hits {{during most of the}} 1960s, recording singles on a variety of small record labels. They switched labels many times, and released several double-sided singles without success, including [...] "Poor Willie" [...] (on Apt Records), [...] "Lonely Island" [...] (on Flipp) and [...] "Heart Trouble" [...] (on Golden World Records). Eventually, Clinton gained employment at Motown Records as a songwriter and producer, making weekly trips to Detroit to produce for The Pets, Roy Handy, and other acts. In 1967 the Parliaments released [...] "(I Wanna) Testify" [...] on Revilot and finally achieved a hit single, with the song reaching #3 R&B and #20 Pop on the Billboard charts. In reality, Clinton was {{the only member of the}} Parliaments to appear in the song, as the other members were unable to travel to Detroit for the recording <b>session</b> (<b>session</b> singers and musicians rounded out the recording). To capitalize on the singles success, Clinton put together a backing band for a tour, expanding the Parliaments to the five singers plus five backing musicians.|$|E
