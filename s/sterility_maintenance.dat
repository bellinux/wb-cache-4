On the other hand, very few research works investigate {{the effect of}} the sterilization processes on the properties of functionalized biomaterials. In this study, the effects of different sterilization techniques (e. g. gamma and electron beam irradiation, ethylene oxide) on the enzymatic activity of bioactive glasses and Ti 6 Al 4 V grafted with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) have been analyzed. <b>Sterility</b> <b>maintenance</b> and in vitro bioactivity of the sterilized surfaces have also been investigated.

40|$|Mitochondrial DNA from 1 fertile and 6 cytoplasmic {{male sterile}} (CMS) {{sunflower}} genotypes was studied. The CMS genotypes had been obtained either by specific crosses between different Helianthus species or by mutagenesis. CMS-associated restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) {{were found in}} the vicinity of the atpA locus, generated by various restriction enzymes. The organization of the mitochondrial genes 26 S rRNA, 18 S+ 5 S rRNA and coxII was investigated by Southern blot analysis. These genes have similar structures in fertile and all studied sterile sources. Using the atpA probe, 5 from the 6 investigated CMS genotypes showed identical hybridiation patterns to the Petiolaris CMS line, which is used in all commercial sunflower hybrids. Only 1 cytoplasm derived from an open pollination of Helianthus annuus ssp. texanus, known as ANT 1, contained a unique mitochondrial DNA fragment, which is distinguishable from the fertile and sterile Petiolaris genotypes and from all investigated CMS genotypes. Male fertility restoration and male <b>sterility</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the ANT 1 line are different from the Petiolaris CMS system, which is a confirmation that a novel CMS genotype in sunflower has been identified. ...|$|E

40|$|Cytoplasmic-nuclear male {{sterility}} (CMS), a potential system for economical hybrid seeds production, results from disharmonious {{interaction between the}} cytoplasmic and nuclear genetic factors. Evaluation of CMS system for its utility is determined by many factors. Unstable {{male sterility}} increases cost and affects quality of hybrid seed production. Cooler weather during panicle development promotes instability in maize and pigeonpea, high humidity in pearl millet and hot temperature of 42 °C and above in sorghum. Effect of genetic background of B-lines on male sterility {{has been found in}} case of Al CMS system in pearl millet and sorghum, and fertility restorer gene expressivity in rice. Maintainer gene frequency in germplasm is another factor to be considered which has bearing on genetic diversification of A-lines. In case of Al CMS system in sorghum and pearl millet landraces have greater proportion as restorers. Character association influences the commercial viability of a CMS system. Approaches to estimate the diversity of CMS systems to enhance the exploitation of outstanding inbred lines and also to overcome the risk of disease and pest epidemics, include both traditional field evaluation of hybrids for differential patterns of male fertility restoration and RFLP analysis of mitochondFial DNA. Steps involved in CMS utilization in hybrid cultivar breeding including (i) identification of potential CMS sources, (ii) development of seed parents (A lines) exhibiting complete <b>sterility,</b> (iii) <b>maintenance</b> of seed parents by taking appropriate steps to prevent contamination with foreign pollen, (iv) development of restorer parents through identification of promising restorers, genetic improvement of existing restorers and transfer of restorer genes into high yielding inbred lines and (v) hybrid seed production keeping in view the four key elements - isolation distance, off type removal, flowering synchrony between Aand R-lines, and A:R lines ratio are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Similarly, marker-assisted {{selection}} {{has also been}} implemented in the improvement of parental lines of hybrid rice for resistance to bacterial blight and blast diseases. Incorporation of R genes into the elite restorer line (paternal line) has been recognized as {{an efficient way to}} resist the diseases in hybrid rice (Chen et al. 2001; Fan et al. 2017; Gouda et al. 2013; Luo et al. 2012; Singh et al. 2013; Xiao et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2006). However, in F 1 hybrid rice, the resistance to disease may also be influenced by the incomplete dominance of R genes in the heterozygous background (Luo et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2006). Thus, transferring the R genes into the male sterile line (maternal parent) is critical for further enhancing disease resistance of hybrid rice. So far, little {{attention has been paid to}} the improvement of male sterile line for disease resistance through {{marker-assisted selection}}. The lack of adequate research is due to the challenge in reconstituting the P/TGMS traits, such as stable <b>sterility</b> period. Nevertheless, <b>maintenance</b> of P/TGMS traits while incorporating the resistance genes into P/TGMS line has been successfully demonstrated in two-line hybrids rice breeding (Jiang et al. 2015; Ni et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Acinetobacter {{species are}} {{assuming}} {{an increasingly important}} role in modern medicine, with their persistent presence in health-care settings and antibiotic resistance. However, clinical reports addressing this issue in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis are rare. All PD peritonitis episodes caused by Acinetobacter that occurred between 1985 and 2012 at a single centre were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical features, microbiological data, and outcomes were analysed, with stratifications based upon temporal periods (before and after 2000). Acinetobacter species were responsible for 26 PD peritonitis episodes (3. 5 % of all episodes) in 25 patients. A. baumannii {{was the most common}} pathogen (54 %), followed by A. iwoffii (35 %), with the former being predominant after 2000. Significantly more episodes resulted from breaks in exchange sterility after 2000, while those from exit site infections decreased (P =  0. 01). The interval between the last and current peritonitis episodes lengthened significantly after 2000 (5 vs. 13. 6 months; P =  0. 05). All the isolates were susceptible to cefepime, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycosides, with a low ceftazidime resistance rate (16 %). Nearly half of the patients (46 %) required hospitalisation for their Acinetobacter PD-associated peritonitis, and 27 % required an antibiotic switch. The overall outcome was fair, with no mortality and a 12 % technique failure rate, without obvious interval differences. The temporal change in the microbiology and origin of Acinetobacter PD-associated peritonitis in our cohort suggested an important evolutional trend. Appropriate measures, including technique re-education and <b>sterility</b> <b>maintenance,</b> should be taken to decrease the Acinetobacter peritonitis incidence in PD patients...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{packages}} {{have to meet}} highly {{specific criteria}} over and above other types of packages. Protection of contents from microbial contamination and physical damage is a priority. The permeability to sterilizing gas; retention of properties and appearance after sterilizing radiation; printability and aseptic presentation {{all have to be}} present at reasonable cost. The most important is maintenance of sterile integrity. In order to have sterile integrity, the medical package must have high barrier properties. <b>Sterility</b> <b>maintenance</b> is the ability of porous packaging materials to act as barriers to microorganisms. The random non- woven structure of spunbonded olefin creates a highly complex maze through the sheet. This torturous path coupled with infinitesimally small openings presents bacteria with an impossible task to penetrate the spunbonded olefin. Thus by virtue of the properties exhibited similar to the 2 ̆ 2 Size Exclusion 2 ̆ 2 principle, spunbonded olefin maintains permeability for gas sterilization but not for microorganisms. The immediate consequences of this morphology are: high opacity, high filtration efficiency, acceptable to high air permeability and excellent strength. Strength of a spunbonded sheet {{is directly related to the}} strength of the individual fibers and how are they bonded. It is clear that to have an effective material; strength, permeability and barrier have to be balanced in an optimum structure. Packages made from spunbonded olefin can be sterilized by ionizing irradiation which is commercially exposure to ionizing radiation, high energy electron from electron beams or gamma rays from Cobalt- 60 or Cesium- 137 radioisotopes. Irradiation does not leave a residue in the spunbonded olefin and it does not make it radioactive. The low energy level of Cobalt and Cesium isotopic gamma rays does not induce any radioactivity. Although, irradiation has the same sterilizing effect on spunbonded olefin packages as ethylene oxide gas treatment, it does not appreciably raise the temperature of the medical product as does an Eto cycle. One of the characteristic advantages of the irradiation process is that the medical product can be irradiated even after package has been sealed so recontamination after processing is prevented. It is not possible for the medical product itself to become radioactive, and there are no residues of any kind left by this process. Once treated, medical packages are considered sterile and ready for use...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{field of}} tissue {{engineering}} requires {{the design and}} verification of an environmentally-controlled sterile incubator volume. As this technology advances and the field of cell printing emerges, {{the need for such}} a volume increases. This volume shall maintain post-deposition cell viability of printed cells, by maintaining volume sterility and controlling temperature. This becomes more important as more delicate cells are used. <b>Sterility</b> <b>maintenance</b> prevents contamination of the cells, while temperature regulation maintains the optimum temperature for cell viability. Several existing incubator systems are capable of regulating environmental conditions, but none are designed to function with a moving cell deposition head. The Sterile Incubator Volume System was developed to accommodate cell printing needs. The primary challenge was to create a sterile volume, with environmental conditions suitable for cell growth; it must interface with a moving deposition head. Numerous engineering practices were included in this design process: defining design inputs and outputs, brainstorming, using decision matrices, considering manufacturing constraints, prototyping, and testing. The final design consists of a portable, self-contained volume capable of maintaining cell viability for at least 4 hours. This environment features feedback-regulated temperature, which is controlled via an external feedback loop by a proportional-integral-derivative (P-I-D) temperature controller. This configuration optimizes temperature regulation while minimizing the risk of contamination from external elements by placing the heating element external to the sterile volume. The volume is compact (62 ̆ 2 x 62 ̆ 2 x 22 ̆ 2), with an easily removable snap-fit lid for simple assembly and disassembly in a sterile hood. A latex cover maintains sterility inside the container while allowing adequate movement of the deposition syringe. A septum permits the syringe to penetrate the latex and be removed without compromising the interior sterility of the volume. The design was verified through a series of tests, including temperature and pH regulation, resterilizability, evaporation, cell viability and systems integration trials. Temperature, pH, resterilzability and evaporation tests yielded quantitative data; while the cell viability and systems integration tests compared cells from the Sterile Incubator Volume System to control cells (from a commercial incubator). These tests verified that the system can maintain cell viability for up to 4 hours; it follows that the allowable cell print time will increase, due to optimized conditions for the cells during deposition and experimentation. These trials found cell viability in the Sterile Incubator Volume System to be comparable to cells from the commercial incubator. This design is simple, autonomous, and can be integrated into most existing tissue engineering and cell culture experiments with minor changes. The potential for maintaining cell viability could be further enhanced by future developments, including humidity and carbon dioxide regulation, expanding the volume size, and creating additional print-head interface variations to increase the diversity of the printed assemblies. These potential enhancements must consider the design intent and simplicity. The design of this sterile incubator volume system is an important step in improving tissue engineering technology and the types of tissues that can be engineered...|$|E
