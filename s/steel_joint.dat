The corrosion problems were solved by removing the steel bolts and angle irons and replacing them with bronze components, and by cleaning as much gypsum as possible from the statue interiors.

Extensive research performed on the robustness of <b>steel</b> <b>joints</b> in fire has revealed that failure at elevated tem-perature may be controlled by bolt shear for fin plate and web cleat connections. Hence, this study focussed on the use of stainless steel in experimental tests conducted on fin plate and web cleat connections at high temperatures.

The results of the fatigue testing initially showed that the specimens that were subjected to corrosion failed at lower cycles than the non-corroded specimens.

Though the fatigue test was inconclusive with regards to number of cycles to failure, the investigation of corroded surface with the scanning electron microscope showed promising results with regards to pitting corrosion.
