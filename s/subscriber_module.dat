40|$|Sensors play an {{important}} role in the execution of robot tasks as {{an important}} component of understanding the world. In this paper, we propose a role-based sensor management framework on ROS (Robot Operating System), in which the role is a set of information needed for robot sensor development. Firstly, we develop a sensor management interface to facilitate the development of sensor applications on robot. And a <b>subscriber</b> <b>module</b> is proposed to shield the details of the sensor driver and the communication between processes, the sensor drivers on the robot are effectively managed. Robot sensors have different executive ability in different situations when robot performing tasks. For example, we know that RGB camera can collect a clear image when the light is strong, while generate a blurred image in weak light environment. Secondly, we propose an environment based sensor role dynamic evaluation mechanism to get the confidence of sensor in a certain environment. The confidence represents the executive ability of sensor when performing tasks. The confidence provides the basis for switching the task schemes. In the mechanism we can dynamically configure the environment information and confidence calculation method. In the experiment phase, we verify the effectiveness of the framework through a robot patrol task. Experiment results show that our framework can effectively manage the robot sensors with a certain environmental adaptability...|$|E

50|$|A <b>subscriber</b> {{identity}} <b>module</b> or <b>subscriber</b> identification <b>module</b> (SIM) is {{an integrated}} circuit that {{is intended to}} securely store the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and computers). It is also possible to store contact information on many SIM cards. SIM cards are always used on GSM phones; for CDMA phones, they are only needed for newer LTE-capable handsets.

50|$|Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA), is an EAP {{mechanism}} for authentication and session key distribution using the UMTS <b>Subscriber</b> Identity <b>Module</b> (USIM).

50|$|GSM {{cellular}} networks use a <b>subscriber</b> identity <b>module</b> card {{to carry}} out user authentication.

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely known {{digitally}} secure telecommunication device is the SIM (<b>Subscriber</b> Identity <b>Module)</b> card, a device that is embedded {{in most of the}} world’s cellular devices before any service can be obtained.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the required improvement in the user profile, there is necessity for reliable and secure authentication system. In the first releases of IMS (before Release 7), the only authentication and key agreement (AKA) system which was specified by the 3 GPP was IMS-AKA. This is an authentication system based on USIM/ISIM approach. The UMTS <b>Subscriber</b> Identity <b>Module</b> (USIM) and IMS <b>Subscriber</b> Identity <b>Module</b> (ISIM) are found on the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) of 3 G devices [28]. USIM-based IMS-AKA and ISIM-based IMS-AKA authentication require the phone to be equipped with the operator UICC card (i.e., a 3 G SIM card) with USIM or ISIM capability. In the absence of UICC (because of hardware limitation), ISIM can be provided as a software module on end devices (PCs).|$|R
