40|$|By {{comparing}} Australia {{with the}} USSR (and {{not with the}} UK or other British dominions as is most often done) we advance two principal arguments. Firstly, despite the claims of some historians, veterans as a social entity are not the exclusive product of postwar discourse and the postwar political, cultural and social milieux in the countries for which soldiers fought. Rather, their emergence as a social group reflects the experience of mass soldiering {{in an age of}} total war. Secondly, it is possible to identify the factors which influenced the extent to which veterans 2 ̆ 7 claims to <b>special</b> <b>entitlements</b> were translated into special status. We identify eight structural factors which, if they did not determine, at least heavily influenced, the policy outcomes of veterans 2 ̆ 7 activism. © 2013 The Authors.

40|$|Recently, proliferating discourses on autochthony and indigeneity {{have been}} noted as the flip-side of globalization. Against this backdrop, this article synthesizes {{insights}} from studies of nationalism and research on autochthony, explaining how identity formations literally ‘take place’ by conceptualizing ‘autochthony’ – the proclaimed ‘original’ link between individual, territory and group – as the root phenomenon. Two causal logics underlying this autochthonous ethnicity are distinguished, which honour time differently: ‘individualized autochthony’ links the individual, territory and group {{in such a way}} that shared culture/descent follow from place of birth/residence within the same present, whereas ‘collectivized autochthony’ inverts this causality on the basis of continuously evoking the same past. The article concludes by distinguishing between ‘indigeneity’ and ‘nationalism’ as alternative modes for targeting the state: whereas indigeneity refers to cases of autochthony that demand <b>special</b> <b>entitlements</b> from the state, nationalism denotes such cases that aim for the very entitlement of the state itself...|$|E

The factory was a source of income for many aborigines who were attracted to the area for seasonal employment after their dispersal from their native grounds, and a large Yanyuwa camp was established nearby, at Liwurriya for that reason. In 1964 the area inclusive of Manankurra was enveloped within a pastoral lease. The Yanyuwa and Garrwa peoples claimed a <b>special</b> <b>entitlement</b> to the old ritual ground, which they desired to be excised from the lease to enable them to restore their management of the ceremonial landscape, a claim they underwrote by a journey, which {{was the subject of a}} film,Buwarrala Akarriya, (Jurney East) which took place from Borroloola to Manankarra in 1988.

40|$|Since John Locke's Second Treatise in 1680, {{liberals have}} often used rights {{discourse}} {{as a way}} to advance freedom within society. 1 As <b>special</b> <b>entitlements,</b> liberals firmly believe that rights protect the liberty of the human subject by overriding society's will to use a person as {{a means to an end}} and/or impose a particular worldview on them. According to Ronald Dworkin, a noted American legal philosopher, “these rights function as trump cards held by individuals; they enable individuals to resist particular decisions in spite of the fact that these decisions are or would be reached through normal workings of the general institutions… ” (71). Using this rationale, then, rights safeguard freedom by enabling individuals to: choose their own telos (purpose, end, fate), engage in certain activities, and make certain choices, irrespective of societal standards or beliefs. Perhaps no aspect of rights discourse more tellingly illustrates this concept than the right to privacy. This broad right permits individuals to exercise absolute freedom in the private sphere (referring to the home or domestic environment) without the political or social interventions of the public sphere (referring to the government and civil society). In this way, the right to privacy appears to maximize freedom by enabling human subjects to create and practice their own beliefs and values. Nonetheless, by isolating individuals from the public sphere, the right to privacy can (especially if it is interpreted as an absolute right) paradoxically limit one's freedom by sanctioning the cultivation and diffusion of values that may conflict and clash with the liberal values of equality and liberty. In isolating the private sphere, the right to privacy permits individuals to cultivate their own values, thus liberating the...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} theses {{addresses the}} phenomenon of the unregistered mark for goods and services in accordance with trade mark law of the Czech Republic, while taking into consideration the given scope of EU law and its comparison with the legal protection of applied trade marks in the framework of the "passing-off" doctrine of the legal systems of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. While the subject of trade marks has already been thoroughly established in juristic theory and has also become commonplace in legal practice, the institute of the unregistered trade mark has not yet to be comprehensively examined, and as such it presents significant difficulties in applied practice, as it bears no solid legal foundation, and {{in the context of the}} regulations of trade mark law it is always possible to identify specific <b>special</b> <b>entitlements</b> arising from the existence or application of unregistered trade marks, whereas the nature of their verbal formulations and systematic classification presents difficulties in the interpretation and application of such entitlements. The basis for this reasoning is namely the historical evolution of {{the phenomenon of}} the unregistered mark in trade mark law in Austrian, respectively in subsequent Cisleithania, and its reception and evolvement within Czechoslovak law as the legal predecessor to the Czech Republic. The goal of the research presented herein is to identify answers to the underlying theoretical questions concerning unregistered marks of fundamental significance to applied practice, and in so far as they concern the nature of the unregistered mark as perceived by trade mark law and its definitional attributes, terms of origin, duration, and expiration of unregistered marks, or more precisely as they concern rights to them, as well as the terms and scope of disposition with unregistered marks, namely in so far as they in turn relate to transfer or conversion and the grant of license or other temporary right of use. Subsequently, the establishment of answers to the aforementioned questions addresses the problem of the absence of an explicit legal principle to {{the phenomenon of the}} unregistered mark and the interpretation difficulties offered in the poorly formulated laws and subsequent fluctuations in legal practice. This problem is examined within the legal setting of the Czech Republic as a democratic nation with a market economy, in which holds true the classic legal rudiment of "that which is not prohibited by law is permitted", and in which hold true the fundamental and indefeasible rights of man, a component of which is the right to freely pursue economic activities and possess property within a framework of restrictions favouring the preservation of the rights of others as set forth by the law...|$|E
40|$|The Third WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle in November 1999 is {{expected}} {{to pave the way}} to the ninth multilateral round of trade negotiations, labelled Millennium Round (MR). Like the preceding Uruguay Round (UR), it will have the twin targets of preventing domestic measures from discriminating against foreign supply and of dismantling border measures such as tariffs and non-tariff barriers. The core challenge of the MR will be to defend the WTO framework against efforts to sacrifice its genuine target of guaranteeing and enforcing access to markets by compromising this target with other targets such as protecting the environment, workers' rights, foreign investors' rights and competition. The GATT experience with a contradictory and inefficient mixture of aid targets (special treatment for developing countries and least-developed countries) and trade principles (non-discrimination between all WTO member states) underlines the importance of clearly separating targets, instruments and responsibilities of actors through different institutional set-ups instead of forcing them into a single framework. This holds especially {{for the protection of the}} environment and of workers' rights, where existing frameworks should be used and/or new frameworks be founded. For competition and investment, existing elements of the WTO can be used to keep markets open and to level the playing field between foreign and domestic investors. Liberalising trade in services and enforcing free access to service markets through the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) will be the most important concrete liberalisation objective in the MR. As the GATS principle is bottom-up (service-industry-specific liberalisation with many loopholes) while the GATT principle for goods is topdown (across-the-board cut of border measures), the best liberalisation results would be achieved if the top-down principle could be applied to services as much as possible. Linking services to goods as joint products bound to GATT rules and/or defining services as goods wherever possible (for instance, in e-commerce) could be instrumental to anchor the top-down principle in services. In traditionally highly protected sectors with <b>special</b> <b>entitlements</b> like agriculture and textiles (including clothing), the MR must counter efforts of big players like the EU and partly the US to play for time by postponing UR commitments to the latest possible date. In doing so, they will deliberately create an adjustment jam, which would trigger requests for further safeguards. Should the WTO fail to discipline the players in these sectors, frustration in developing countries can weld the vast majority of WTO members into a stumbling block against the MR. Further needs to reform the current WTO framework can be identified in disciplining mushrooming regional integration schemes, which undermine the most-favoured nation treatment principle, in dismantling still existing tariff escalation, which discriminates against manufactured goods exporters, in fundamentally redressing the abuse of contingent protection measures such as anti-dumping and safeguards and, finally, in solving the still pending issue of China's accession to the WTO. The MR without China refutes the WTO's claim to be a universal institution. In a mercantilist world, negotiation strategies matter. Notwithstanding the lack of a fast-track mandate for the US administration, it seems that the US together with Asian countries prefer sector-specific negotiations with a focus on agriculture, services, and government procurement. In contrast, the EU prefers negotiations on all issues in a socalled comprehensive round. Developing countries still hesitate to participate at all but their hesitancy can prove to be a promising strategy to push the EU and the US toward accelerating the implementation of UR commitments. All participants will experience that there are first-mover advantages and that leapfrogging technological progress in the cross-border movement of persons, goods and services will impose high costs on those who get stuck in old-style nitty-gritty trade diplomacy.

The measures were administered either pre-treatment only, pre-and post-treatment, or post-treatment only. Five measures were self-report measures completed by offenders, and eight were administered and scored by qualified corrections personnel.

40|$|This Article {{considers}} a burning issue in society today—whether, {{and under what}} circumstances, religious groups and individuals should be exempted from the dictates of civil law. The “political maelstrom” over the Obama administration’s sterilization and contraceptive coverage mandate {{is just one of}} many clashes between religion and the state. Religious groups and individuals have also sought religious exemptions to the duty to assist with abortions or facilitate same-sex marriages. In all these contexts, religious objectors claim a <b>special</b> right of <b>entitlement</b> to follow their religious tenets, in the face of equally compelling claims that religious accommodations threaten access and may impose significant costs on others. Legislators and other policymakers have struggled with how to advance two compelling, and at times conflicting, values—access and religious liberty. This Article examines, and responds to, a number of “sticking points” voiced by legislators about a qualified exemption for religious objectors that would permit them to step aside from facilitating same-sex marriages so long as no hardship will result. These concerns bear an uncanny resemblance to reasons why some believe the Obama administration should not yield further on the coverage mandate. This Article maintains that religious accommodations qualified by hardship to others can transform what could be a zero-sum proposition into one in which access and religious freedom can both be affirmed...|$|R
40|$|The {{expansion}} of police involvement at schools has had serious implications {{for students with}} disabilities. By enacting IDEA, Congress recognized that these students deserve <b>special</b> protections and <b>entitlements.</b> In the most recent amendments to this federal law, Congress included important guidelines regarding functional behavioral assessments (FBAs) and behavior intervention plans (BIPs) to outline how school personnel must respond to undesired behavior {{of students with disabilities}}. Recognizing the special behavioral needs of students with disabilities is one way to reduce the current reality where students with disabilities are suspended, expelled, restrained, and secluded at much higher rates than their peers. Although SROs can play a valuable role in the school environment, SROs also must recognize the unique needs and legal protections of students with disabilities. The existing case law reveals two important points. First, SROs can act reasonably towards students with disabilities where safety concerns exist. Second, SROs also can overreact and respond in punitive ways when responding to behavioral incidents involving students with disabilities. Of concern, a few of these recent cases have involved SROs mistreating young children with disabilities. These cases reveal the need for a comprehensive training program for SROs, clear delineation of the scope of—and limitations on—the SROs’ duties, and strict adherence by both school personnel and the SROs to their respective roles. Ultimately, we hope that this article will increase the awareness of this significant issue and result in a multi-prong approach that involves a variety of stakeholders, including school administrators, teachers, SROs, and parents of students with disabilities...|$|R
40|$|If I promise Stephanie that I {{will help}} her move house, then not only ought I help her, I also owe it to her to do so. If I fail to comply with this obligation, I not only do wrong, but I wrong someone, namely Stephanie. The duty to keep my promise is a {{directed}} duty, with Stephanie as its addressee. Directed duties and related normative concepts {{play a central role}} in non-consequentialist moral theories. For example, moral rights, which seem to rule out consequentialist moral theories, are closely connected to directed duties: if S has a right that J phi, then J owes it to S to phi. But directed duties remain poorly understood. For this reason, consequentialists dismiss talk of directed duties as justified, at best, by its tendency to promote good outcomes. I aim to characterize directed duties in a way that shows that treating duties as directed is not simply instrumentally convenient, but is a way of acknowledging an important dimension of morality. An account of directed duties should answer three distinct questions: (1) Direction. Why is a particular duty owed to S rather than T? (2) Practical Difference. What difference does the directedness of a duty make to what we appropriately think and do? (3) Importance. What is lost when a moral community fails to acknowledge the directedness of duties? Distinguishing these questions allows us to adopt insights from theories that would otherwise be seen as competitors. (1) Direction. In Chapter 1, I develop a contractualist account of direction: the addressee is the person whose representative role grounds a complaint which justifies the duty. For example, the act of promising establishes several representative roles: promisor, promisee, and third party. The duty to keep one’s promise is justified by the fact that, in a representative case of promising, the promisee has a generic interest in assurance, and this interest grounds a complaint that outweighs the complaints available to the promisor and third parties. Since the complaint attached to the representative role of promisee grounds the duty, in a particular case it is the promisee who is owed the duty. This means that the promisee—and more generally, the addressee of a directed duty—has a special place in an agent’s deliberation: it is the potential complaint based on their generic interests that determines how the agent should act. (2) Practical Difference. Directed duties make a difference not only to how we deliberate intrapersonally, but, crucially, to how we hold one another accountable interpersonally. A directed duty gives its addressee special standing in the practice of accountability and moral repair: in particular, <b>special</b> <b>entitlement</b> to apology and redress, and special power to accept apology and forgive the wrongdoer. I develop this account of Practical Difference in Chapter 2, comparing it with competitors the Demand, Claim, and Blame Theories. (3) Importance. In Chapter 3 I consider what would be lost if we failed to recognize directed duties. Observe that when J infringes a duty to S, the injury to S consists not only in the setback to her interests but also in the lack of recognition of those interests. Requiring that apology be directed to S in particular [...] -that the apology be addressed to S in order to count as an apology [...] -enables apology to serve as a form of recognition, one that serves to repair the original lapse of recognition. Observe further that S determines the significance to herself of how her interests have been affected, since she takes a stand on the value of what has been lost and the role that the loss will play in her life. Requiring that forgiveness be sought from S in particular enables the seeking of forgiveness to serve as a way of recognizing this fact. In sum, a practice of accountability that grants special standing to S acknowledges that she is the kind of creature who not only has interests but can take an interest in them, and can take an interest in whether others recognize them. In this way the practice of directed duties makes available a form of respect for persons grounded in their distinctive capacity to take an interest in how their interests are regarded by others. Chapter 4 broaches the question of the relation between rights, duties, and wrongs, by engaging with Nicolas Cornell’s view that rights are not co-extensive with special standing in our practice of accountability. Since Cornell endorses the Hohfeldian claim that rights and directed duties are coextensive, his view poses a direct threat to the account I have been developing here. In Chapter 4 I argue that the threat is not a real one, that some of the interesting observations Cornell makes about contract law can instead be accounted for by weakening the Hoheldian claim, and that Cornell’s view makes it difficult to understand the scope of accountability. Chapter 5 considers whether collectives, and in particular corporations, are the types of entities that can be owed directed duties. The view developed in this dissertation encourages us to think that there is no reason to think we owe moral duties to an entity that lacks an interest in recognition. Chapter 5 argues that collectives lack such an interest, and therefore cannot be owed moral duties. But this argument is compatible with the fact that collectives can be owed legal duties...|$|R
