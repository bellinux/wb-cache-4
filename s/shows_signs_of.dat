5|$|During the ice ages, Northern England {{was buried}} under ice sheets, and little {{evidence}} remains of habitation – either because the climate made the area uninhabitable, or because glaciation destroyed most evidence of human activity. The northern-most cave art in Europe is found at Creswell Crags in northern Derbyshire, near modern-day Sheffield, which <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> Neanderthal inhabitation 50 to 60 thousand years ago, {{and of a}} more modern occupation known as the Creswellian culture around 12,000 years ago. Kirkwell Cave in Lower Allithwaite, Cumbria <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the Federmesser culture of the Paleolithic, and was inhabited some time between 13,400 and 12,800 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Cave 19 is a cell {{without a}} front wall and a bench {{runs along the}} left wall. The ceiling <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a dressed stone or wooden screen from the right wall {{to the end of}} the bench. To the right is a small cell in the same roof, {{probably}} connected with cave 19. The small cell has a bench along its right wall and the grooved doorway. The cave has two cisterns.|$|E
5|$|Like all of Uranus' moons, Ariel {{probably}} {{formed from}} an accretion disc {{that surrounded the}} planet shortly after its formation, and, like other large moons, it is likely differentiated, with an inner core of rock surrounded by a mantle of ice. Ariel has a complex surface consisting of extensive cratered terrain cross-cut by a system of scarps, canyons, and ridges. The surface <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> more recent geological activity than other Uranian moons, most likely due to tidal heating.|$|E

5|$|Located near Alnair is NGC 7213, a face-on type 1 Seyfert galaxy located {{approximately}} 71.7 million {{light years}} from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.1. Appearing undisturbed in visible light, it <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> having undergone a collision or merger when viewed at longer wavelengths, with disturbed patterns of ionized hydrogen including a filament of gas around 64,000 light-years long. It {{is part of}} a group of ten galaxies.|$|E
5|$|As {{the school}} year ends, Charlie is anxious about losing his older friends—especially Sam, who is leaving for a summer college-preparatory program and has learned that her boyfriend cheated on her. When Charlie helps her pack, they talk about his {{feelings}} for her; she is angry that he never acted on them. They begin to engage sexually, but Charlie suddenly grows inexplicably uncomfortable and stops Sam. Charlie begins to realize that his sexual contact with Sam has stirred up repressed memories of him being molested by his Aunt Helen as a little boy. Charlie <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> PTSD from the incident and the revelation of his abuse helps the reader understand his view of relationships and love.|$|E
5|$|FBI {{special agent}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) goes to {{investigate}} the murder. The victim, a twenty-two-year-old backpacker, now <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> body decay usually associated with old age. Later, at a pay-phone, she asks her partner, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), to check the X-Files for cases mentioning glycoproteins. While discussing the case with Doggett, the bus passes her, and she follows it to a gas station {{in the middle of}} the desert. A man with an injured hand learns that she is a medical doctor and fills her car with gasoline laced with water. Scully returns to the gas station and is told that rain got into the gas canisters.|$|E

In addition the two main centres of Zürich and Geneva are recognised for their particularly great quality of life.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the series, Hime is an {{extremely}} feminine-looking second-year high school student who gets troubled by debt collectors because his parents have racked up {{a large amount of}} debt in his name for constantly traveling overseas. When the student council pays off his creditors, he is obligated to join them as a servant, and must also cross-dress {{for the rest of his}} time in high school.

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a case where fake stigmatics are being murdered. When a boy <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> being a real stigmatic, Mulder and Scully attempt to protect him, fearing {{that he will be}} the latest victim.|$|E

5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this {{by suggesting that}} Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, {{but after a while}} tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas {{as they were in the}} older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E
5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E

5|$|Qatna was {{inhabited}} by different peoples, most importantly the Amorites, who established the kingdom, {{followed by the}} Arameans; Hurrians {{became part of the}} society in the 15th century BC and influenced Qatna's written language. The city's art is distinctive and <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> contact with different surrounding regions. The artifacts of Qatna show high-quality workmanship. The city's religion was complex and based on many cults in which ancestor worship played an important role. Qatna's location {{in the middle of the}} Near East trade networks helped it achieve wealth and prosperity; it traded with regions as far away as the Baltic and Afghanistan. The area surrounding Qatna was fertile, with abundant water, which made the lands suitable for grazing and supported a large population that contributed to the flourishing of the city.|$|E
5|$|Scholars cannot {{pinpoint}} the exact date of composition. Orm wrote his book {{over a period}} of decades and the manuscript <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> multiple corrections through time (Burchfield 1987, p.280). Since it is apparently an autograph, with two of the three hands in the text generally believed by scholars to be Orm's own, the date of the manuscript and the date of composition would have been the same. On the evidence of the third hand (that of a collaborator who entered the pericopes at the head of each homily) it is thought that the manuscript was finished circa 1180, but Orm may have begun the work as early as 1150 (Parkes 1983, pp.115–27). The text has few topical references to specific events {{that could be used to}} identify the period of composition more precisely.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts of}} the present structure are the nave and the chancel, which are 13th-century. The church <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> alterations and additions in subsequent centuries. A transept or chapel {{was added to the}} south side of the chancel in the late 13th or early 14th century. The arch between them was once the archway between the chancel and the nave but was later moved. The bellcote at the west end of the roof was added in the 14th century. The porch on {{the south side of the}} nave was built in about 1500, and was re-roofed in 1725. A doorway in the north wall of the nave was inserted in the late 15th or early 16th century, and now leads into a vestry added in the 19th century. The main roof is largely 17th-century. Some repairs were carried out in the 1840s, with further repairs in 1854 under the supervision of the diocesan architect, Henry Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Transcription in archaea {{more closely}} resembles {{eukaryotic}} than bacterial transcription, with the archaeal RNA polymerase being {{very close to}} its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seems {{to be close to}} that of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{waking up}} again, Wells is {{surprised}} to find no bullet wounds on his body. Scully and Doggett arrive to interrogate Wells, but he is confused {{about what is going}} on. A furious Doggett claims that he has been accused of murdering his wife, Vicky, and initially believes that Wells is faking his confusion in order to build an insanity defense. However, Doggett <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> doubt when he notices Wells' genuine anguish over Vicky's death. Wells is brought into court and he recognizes his father-in-law, Al Cawdry, as the man who shot him. When Wells' next court date is announced to be Thursday, he realizes that he has somehow travelled back to the day before his shooting. When the judge decides to transfer Wells to a different cell, he makes a scene in the court and accuses Cawdry of planning to kill him during the transfer.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing <b>shows</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
