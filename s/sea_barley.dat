40|$|Spatial Sciences InstituteSea barley grass (Hordeum marinum) is {{considered}} an important early indicator of emerging soil salinity. Saline areas that have good cover of salt tolerant plants are difficult to map with broadband satellite imagery. Hyperspectral imagery may provide a more reliable salinity mapping method because of its potential to discriminate halophytic plant cover from non-halophytes. In this paper we statistically compare the reflectance spectra of <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass to other annual plant species, {{to determine whether the}} <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass {{has the potential to be}} discriminated and mapped with hyperspectral imagery. Plant spectra were collected during spring senescence in an attempt to capture the spectral differences between the late senescing <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass and other annual grasses. Multiple reflectance spectra of each species were collected with an ASD Fieldspec Pro spectrometer. The plant spectra were collected at plot scale in the field, and at plant and foliage scale in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Two-group t-tests comparing reflectance of pairs of species at each wavelength showed broad spectral regions where <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass differed significantly from other species for both field and laboratory spectra. The existence of these broad regions of spectral difference suggests that it should be possible to discriminate and map <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass during spring senescence with hyperspectral imagery.

40|$|Hyperspectral {{images from}} three sensors were {{compared}} {{for their ability}} to discriminate and map selected symptoms of salinity in a dryland agricultural area in southern Australia. The symptoms mapped are widespread in this environment: the perennial halophytic shrub samphire (Halosarcia pergranulata), a salt tolerant grass, <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass (Hordeum marinum) and salt encrusted pans. Airborne HyMap and satellite Hyperion imagery were acquired in the late summer dry season to maximise soil and perennial vegetation discrimination, while airborne CASI imagery was acquired in late spring to capture senescence of the annual <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass. Image spectra were used to map surface salinity symptoms using partial spectral unmixing techniques. Saltpans were discriiiminated using the gypsum 1750 nm absorption feature, while full-wavelength image spectra were necessary to map the halophytic plants. Salinity symptom maps were validated at over 100 random field sites and compared with independent mapping of soils and salinity from aerial photography and Landsat imagery. HyMap imagery produced the most accurate maps of samphire and saltpans, compared with CASI and Hyperion, discriminating samphire from other perennial native vegetation and saltpans from other reflective non-saline sands and soils.

40|$|Airborne hyperspectral imagery has the {{potential}} to overcome the spectral and spatial resolution limitations of multispectral satellite imagery for monitoring salinity at both regional and farm scales. In particular, saline areas that have good cover of salt tolerant plants are difficult to map with multispectral satellite imagery. Hyperspectral imagery may provide a more reliable salinity mapping method because of its potential to discriminate halophytic plant cover from non - halophytes. HyMap and CASI airborne imagery (at 3 m ground resolution) and Hyperion satellite imagery (at 30 resolution) were acquired over a 140 sq km dryland agricultural area in South Australia, which exhibits severe symptoms of salinity, including extensive patches of the perennial halophytic shrub samphire (Halosarcia pergranulata), <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass (Hordeum marinum) and salt encrusted pans. The HyMap and Hyperion imagery were acquired in the dry season (March and February respectively) to maximise soil and perennial vegetation mapping. The optimum time of year to map <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass, an annual species, was investigated through spectral discrimination analysis. Multiple reflectance spectra were collected of <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass and other annual grasses with an ASD Fieldspec Pro spectrometer during the September spring flush and in November during late senescence. Comparing spectra of different species in November attempted to capture the spectral differences between the late senescing <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass and other annual grasses. Broad NIR and SWIR regions were identified where <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass differs significantly from other species in November during late senescence. The <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass was therefore shown to have {{the potential}} to be discriminated and mapped with hyperspectral imagery at this time and as a result the CASI survey was commission for November. Other salinity symptoms were characterised by collecting single field and laboratory spectra for comparison to image derived spectra in order to provide certainty about the landscape components that were to be mapped. Endmembers spectra associated with saltpans and samphire patches were extracted from the imagery using automated endmember generation procedures or selected regions of interest and used in subsequent partial unmixing. Spectral subsets were evaluated for their ability to optimise salinity maps. The saltpan spectra contained absorption features consistent with montmorillonite and gypsum. A single gypsum endmember from one image strip successfully mapped saltpans across multiple images strips using the 1750 nm absorption feature as the input to matched filter unmixing. The individual spectra of green and red samphire are dominated by photosynthetic vegetation characteristics. The spectra of green samphire, often seen with red tips, exhibit peaks in both green and red wavebands whereas the red samphire spectra only contain a significant reflectance peak in the visible red wavelength region. For samphire, Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering using image spectra, containing all wavelength regions, from known samphire patches produced the most satisfactory mapping. Output salinity maps were validated at over 100 random sites. The HyMap salinity maps produced the most accurate results compared to CASI and Hyperion. HyMap successfully mapped highly saline areas with a good cover of samphire vegetation at Point Sturt without the use of multitemporal imagery or ancillary data such as topography or PIRSA soil attribute maps. CASI and Hyperion successfully mapped saltpan, however, their samphire maps showed a poor agreement with field data. These results suggest that perennial vegetation mapping requires all three visible, NIR and SWIR wavelength regions because the SWIR region contains important spectral properties related to halophytic adaptations. Furthermore, the unconvincing results of the CASI <b>sea</b> <b>barley</b> grass maps suggests that the optimal sensor for mapping both soil and vegetation salinity symptoms are airborne sensors with high spatial and spectral resolution, that incorporate the 450 to 1450 nm wavelength range, such as HyMap. This study has demonstrated that readily available software and image analysis techniques are capable of mapping indicators of varying levels of salinity. With the ability to map symptoms across multiple image strips, airborne hyperspectral imagery {{has the potential}} for mapping larger areas covering sizeable dryland agriculture catchments, closer in extent to single satellite images. This study has illustrated the advantage of the hyperspectral imagery over traditional soil mapping based on aerial photography interpretation such as the NLWRA Salinity 2000 and the PIRSA soil landscape unit maps. The HyMap salinity maps not only improved mapping of saline areas covered with samphire but also provided salinity maps that varied spatially within saline polygons. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The hyperspectral mapping identified some saline areas that had not been delineated in previous aerial photo interpretation and provided enhanced spatial information on the distribution of particular salinity indicators. The 3 metre ground resolution of the HyMap imagery also provided greater definition of symptoms within saline areas identified in prior 1 : 50, 000 soil-landscape mapping. The study demonstrates that hyperspectral imagery can improve discrimination of vegetation and mineral indicators of surface salinity, that seasonality of the imagery is important in capturing diagnostic spectral differences, and that consistent spectral mapping can be achieved over sizeable areas using high-resolution airborne imagery. The increased spatial resolution and additional information about landscape composition derived from the hyperspectral imagery are significant improvements over traditional soil and salinity mapping based on aerial photography interpretation.

No F 1 hybrids were found within the individuals of the two species grown, neither with morphological nor with genetic markers. Also, no evidence of introgression of wheat traits into E. caninus was observed. However, in one individual of H. marinum which had the typical morphology of this species, numerous species-specific DNA markers of wheat were amplified, thereby demonstrating previous hybridization.
