5000|$|Milton H. Graham (March 23, 1919 [...] - [...] August 25, 2006) was an American politician. He {{served as}} mayor of Phoenix, Arizona from 1964 to 1970. A veteran of World War II, he was a water <b>softening</b> <b>equipment</b> distributor.|$|E
50|$|This {{level was}} added during the 1948-to-1952 renovation, and {{contains}} {{the air conditioning}} and water <b>softening</b> <b>equipment.</b> The sub-basement and mezzanine also contain storage areas, the heating system, elevator machinery rooms, an incinerator, a medical clinic, a dentist's office, the electrical control system, a laundry room, and flatware and dishware storage.|$|E
50|$|Three {{partners}} {{created the}} J.W. Anderson Company in Dundas, Ontario in 1952 to serve domestic demand for water <b>softening</b> <b>equipment.</b> In 1965, Anderson expanded into the industrial water treatment market. Installations through the 1960s and 70's {{were used by}} various industries such as food & beverage, pulp & paper, chemical, power generation and pharmaceutical. From this experience in 1974 Anderson became the first Canadian distributor for DuPont membranes. In the early 1980s Anderson pioneered the split-flow counter-current ion exchange process while expanding into the United States market. Five officers of the J.W. Anderson Company bought it out in 1985, forming Anderson Water Systems Limited which saw continued growth driven by projects in oil and petrochemical.|$|E
40|$|The tort crisis, {{sometimes}} called the insurance crisis, still afflicts us. Although today some commentators are claiming that the crisis has subsided, they are confusing the recent softening within some insurance lines with the long-term, perhaps permanent, changes in underlying insured activity that has made possible the <b>softening.</b> The playground <b>equipment</b> removed from public parks and the diving boards removed from city schools have not been replaced. The large numbers of products withdrawn from consumer markets remain withdrawn. The huge premium increases of early 1986 are largely intact, thus, necessitating continued price increases and sustaining diminished consumer demand for insured products and services. Many manufacturers, service-providers, and, especially, municipalities no longer openly complain about insurance unavailability because they have continued operations either without market insurance by self-insuring or by joining mutual insurance groups. This adjustment, however, no more than delays the impact of increased tort liability. These entities have chosen to put off paying advance premiums equal to expected liability only to suffer actual liability once it occurs. The single most important phenomenon of the recent tort crisis, crucial for its diagnosis, is {{the withdrawal of the}} insurance industry from the business of insurance. The withdrawal of the industry is obvious with respect to those few insurance lines for which market insurers have refused to offer coverage altogether: nurse-midwives, day care, municipal liability. But the withdrawal from the insurance business is reflected in other, more widespread, changes in commercial casualty insurance offerings. In particular, the adoption of the claims-made as the basic commercial casualty policy, the general increase in retention (insured deductibles), the decline in levels of aggregate coverage, and the introduction of specific coverage exclusions reflect such changes...|$|R
40|$|Fractal {{distributors}} {{have been}} proven to improve fluid distribution in chromatographic applications. Recent reports also demonstrate that fractal distribution principles are very useful in ion exchange softener applications â€“ significantly reducing resin requirements and allowing thin juice exhaustion flowrates as high as 500 BV/hr. An effort has now been made to expand fractal distribution principles to thick juice decolorization {{with the goal of}} reducing resin inventories and improving operational characteristics. The results of a pilot study are presented where highly colored thick juice was decolorized with strong base resin. Color removal is compared for conventional and shallow resin bed height. Potential utilization of <b>softening</b> <b>equipment</b> during the off-campaign period for decolorization of thick juice streams is discussed...|$|E
