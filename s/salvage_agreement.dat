5000|$|A Lloyd's Open Form, {{formally}} Lloyd's Standard Form of <b>Salvage</b> <b>Agreement,</b> {{but more}} {{commonly referred to}} as LOF, is a standard legal document for a proposed marine salvage operation. The two-page contract is published by Lloyd's of London. It is called [...] "open" [...] because it is literally open, with no amount of money being stipulated for the salvage job: the sum to be paid is determined later in London by a professional arbitrator. At the top of page one, beneath the title [...] "Salvage Agreement" [...] is a statement of the contract's fundamental premise. [...] "NO CURE [...] - [...] NO PAY". The form originated in the late 19th century and is the most common such form of international <b>salvage</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{particularly}} difficult situation arose on the tenth stalemated {{day of the}} talks. The issues of Israeli settlement withdrawal from the Sinai {{and the status of}} the West Bank created what seemed to be an impasse. In response, Carter had the choice of trying to <b>salvage</b> the <b>agreement</b> by conceding the issue of the West Bank to Begin, while advocating Sadat's less controversial position on the removal of all settlements from the Sinai Peninsula. Or he could have refused to continue the talks, reported the reasons for their failure, and allowed Begin to bear the brunt of the blame.|$|R
50|$|On {{their arrival}} at Juneau, the {{expedition}}'s ship, the MV Jolly Roger, was boarded by a US Deputy Marshal, and the expedition was {{served with a}} Temporary Restraining Order, obtained by a rival salvage company, Yukon Recovery of Seattle. Yukon Recovery claimed rights to the wreck {{on the grounds that}} they had salvaged a light fitting and a bottle, under the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act. OceanMar, who had extensively researched Islander asserted that the wreck had never been abandoned and their <b>Salvage</b> <b>Agreement</b> which was with the original insurers consequently took precedence.

A <b>salvage</b> <b>agreement</b> was made with Titan Salvage under Lloyd's Open Form rules, but it was later decided that the ship was a constructive total loss. Titan were then awarded another contract to remove pollutants from the wreck. This work commenced on 4 March 2010, and completed on 21 April. The wreck has been designated a protected site by the The Saint Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority, who have issued a Wreck Removal Order.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} few years after Florida was {{acquired}} by the United States, salvage awards were determined either by prior agreement between the wreck master and the captain of the wrecked ship, or by arbitration. As the persons available to serve as arbitrators usually had ties to the wrecking industry, if not a direct business relationship with the wreck master and/or the owners of the wrecking vessels, the process was often abused, with awards as high as 90% of the salvaged value. In 1829 a United States District Court was established in Key West with admiralty jurisdiction, after which most salvage cases were decided in court. Court awards for a wrecking operation averaged about 25% of the <b>salvage</b> value. Private <b>agreements</b> and arbitration remained an option, however, particularly when the judge was not available. A visitor to Key West in the 1880s reported that the United States District Court was in session almost every week, and had heard more than 700 Admiralty law cases during the preceding year.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{of law is}} not a smooth, linear process. Theories are developed and laws are drafted in response to particular events.

The loss of the early supertanker Torrey Canyon in 1967 led to the Intervention Convention, which clarified a nation-state 2 ̆ 7 s rights to defend itself from a vessel leaking oil. The rust-bucket Argo Merchant, lost on Nantucket Shoals in 1977, created the impetus to give the Coast Guard greater regulatory powers over tank vessels through the Port and Tanker Safety Act the following year. The loss of the enormous supertanker Amoco Cadiz in 1978, while the vessel 2 ̆ 7 s master and salvors were arguing over the terms of the <b>salvage</b> <b>agreement,</b> led to a restructuring of the internationally accepted Lloyd 2 ̆ 7 s Open Form <b>Salvage</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Finally, the dramatic loss of the Exxon Valdez in 1989 created the political environment that made the passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), our nation 2 ̆ 7 s most encompassing oil spill liability legislation, a reality. Despite OPA 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 great leap forward 2 ̆ 2 in 1990, one segment of the oil transportation business remained largely unregulated: the tug and barge industry.

40|$|Low {{intracellular}} folate levels {{diminish the}} growth rate of HT- 29 human colon cancer cells. This is accompanied by a metabolic shift from cytosolic glycolysis towards mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, as demonstrated by a lower lactate production and an increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. To obtain insight in the molecular effects underlying these changes, the steady state gene expression profiles of HT- 29 cells with different intracellular folate concentrations were compared. The gene expression profile of HT- 29 cells with low intracellular folate levels (grown for 3 weeks in 10 ng/ml folic acid (PGA)) was clearly distinct from that of the other exposure conditions, which provide sufficient intracellular folate levels (100 ng/ml PGA, 10 ng/ml methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) or 100 ng/ml MTHF). Intracellular folate deficiency, contrary to expectation, did not lead to major changes in expression of genes involved in energy metabolism. This suggests that the shift towards mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is not mediated at the transcription level. Furthermore, only minor changes in the expression of folate metabolism related genes were observed. The changes that were observed were consistent with nucleotide <b>salvage</b> and in <b>agreement</b> with nucleotide need of the slow-growing folate-deficient HT- 29 cells. The major observed effects were on cell cycle related gene expression, which was increased and interferon-responsive gene expression, which was reduced. The increase in cell cycle related gene expression seems compensatory to the reduced cell growth. Down-regulation of the interferon-response may be explained by decreased expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 upon folate deficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is why some {{negotiated}} peace settlements succeed at ending communal violence, while others fail. About {{half of all}} negotiated settlements fail within five years of the signing of a peace agreement. It is therefore important to identify factors that influence the stability of peace processes and determine how they can affect stability. As there is no coherent body of theory that treats this topic, I draw on several works to develop a framework {{that can be used}} to analyze settlement stability. The factors thought to influence settlement stability are grouped under four main headings: 1) mutually hurting stalemate and ripeness, 2) the terms of settlement, where underlying causes and the institutional guarantees in the agreement are discussed, 3) continuing conflict potential, that explores the areas of implementation, internal politics of each side, economic incentives, and spoilers, and 4) external factors, that examine systemic and regional actors and third parties acting as guarantors. Comparative analysis is used to examine why some settlements fail and others succeed through case studies of Angola, Mozambique and Cambodia. In relation to Angola the main explanations for why peace has failed were that all the factors that can contribute to continued conflict were present. Elections were held before disarmament and demobilization were completed, internal disagreement over policy led both sides to fail to implement the accords, economic resources gave the opportunity to continue war as well as something to fight for, and spoilers were not managed correctly. In addition, neighboring countries have benefited by continued instability, and, the monitoring and observing mission that accompanied the Bicesse Agreement was not sufficient. The success in Mozambique was ascribed to several factors. Both regional and international actors supported the peace process. The peace agreement and its implementation were successful in reducing the parties security fears. Despite the delay in implementation, most items were implemented prior to the elections. The UN operation was a success in terms of facilitating implementation, reassuring the parties and identifying and dealing with spoiler behavior. Lastly, there were no resources over which to fight and the only resource that was abundantly available was the UN s and international donors millions. These millions gave the international community substantial leverage with the parties. In Cambodia, peace did not succeed immediately following the Paris Agreements as one of the parties to it, the Khmer Rouge, continued armed struggle. As in Angola, all the factors contributing to continued conflict potential were present. The weak guarantees in the agreement, together with lack of implementation, internal power struggles between and within the coalition parties, and failure to manage the CPP s spoiler behavior led to continued instability and war. Some of the factors that first contributed to the continuation of armed conflict later facilitated the cessation. Tightened Thai control over illegal timber and gemstone trade with the Khmer Rouge coupled with economic incentives offered by the Cambodian government led Khmer Rouge commanders to surrender. This also contributed to the fragmentation and eventual demise of the Khmer Rouge, and thus the end of the war. There are several points where a peace agreement can fail. The problems can lie in the agreement itself, which can both lack the provisions needed for the parties to feel secure, as well as contingency plans for what is to be done in case the parties do not live up to their commitments. However, a peace agreement with defects can work if the parties are willing and in a position to renegotiate. A third party who can enforce an agreement can also help <b>salvage</b> a flawed <b>agreement.</b> In addition, third parties have a role to play by offering economic incentives to the parties and develop strategies to manage spoilers and limit illegal arms trade and looting of natural resources. There are several sources of continuing conflict potential. New funding for warfare can change the calculation of the parties. External actors or lootable natural resources can supply means for continued war effort. The fragmented internal politics of the parties can be another basis for continued conflict. Finally, spoilers that are not managed correctly are a threat to the stability of peace processes. Evidence from the case studies and the evaluation of the various factors led to the conclusion that hurting stalemates do not explain settlement stability, while systemic changes contributed to the onset of negotiations, but not to the implementation, and are not in the future likely to account for why some settlements succeed while others fail. The factors that are likely to influence settlement stability and should be given attention when examining settlement stability are: the settlement provisions, continuing conflict potential, and third parties...|$|R
