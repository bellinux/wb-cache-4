Participants were 458 college students in Atma Jaya Catholic University Jakarta (229 males and 229 females), they responded {{to a set of}} questionnaire that includes scales to measure BMI (Body Mass Index); subjective evaluation (satisfaction) on one’s own body; negative thinking habit about one’s own body; body esteem; and self esteem.

However, individual’s subjective evaluation contribute more in the development of self esteem compared to the more objective measure of body proportion such as the BMI. Consequently, body esteem and negative thinking habit about one’s own body predicted the more general self esteem.

Here, we describe the revised Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R), a paradigm enabling the study of behavioral and neural responses to intended and unintended social norm violations among both adults and adolescents. We investigated how participants (adolescents and adults, n = 87) rate intentional and unintentional social norm violations with respect to inappropriateness and embarrassment, and we examined the brain activation patterns underlying the processing of these transgressions in an independent sample of 21 adults using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized to find activation within the medial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in response to both intentional and unintentional social norm violations, with more pronounced activation for the intentional social norm violations in these regions and in the amygdala. Participants' ratings confirmed the hypothesis that the three types of stories are evaluated differently with respect to intentionality: intentional social norm violations were rated as the most inappropriate and most embarrassing. Furthermore, fMRI results showed that reading stories on intentional and unintentional social norm violations evoked activation within the frontal pole, the paracingulate gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus. In addition, processing unintentional social norm violations was associated with activation in, among others, the orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule, while reading intentional social norm violations was related to activation in the left amygdala. These regions have been previously implicated in thinking about one's <b>self,</b> <b>thinking</b> about others and moral reasoning.

Bogotá (San Cristóbal, specifically), with the purpose of identifying the understanding of health before and after {{an intervention}} when promoting health drives with a healing focus, and the transformation that is generated after such intervention. In order to explore the concept of health and the actions needed to preserve health before and after, we used the semi-structured interview instrument, as of the judgments issued by women. We identified criteria and defined categories {{in order to understand the}} health concept and its evolution. At the beginning of the intervention, half the women understood health in terms of the absence of illnesses; one fifth associated it with corporal care, psycho spiritual and environmental care and one third integrated complex elements close to the category comprehension of healing in ones health. After the interventions the majority of the judgments issued by participants included criteria in this latter category. As a conclusion it is shown that the intervention strategy of promoting health with a healing focus to adult young women favors <b>self</b> <b>thinking</b> and the evolution of health conception, towards the recognition by women of their definitive role in being healthy and in the need for social contributions to a life project. Através de un estudio de intervención con diseño antes-después, se trabajó con un grupo de 100 mujeres en-tre 20 y 40 años residentes en la Localidad Cuarta del Distrito Capital de Bogotá (San Cristóbal), con el objetivo de identificar la comprensión de la salud antes de una intervención en promoción de la salud con enfoque sanológico, y la transformación que se genera después de la intervención. Para explorar el concepto de salud y las acciones para mantener la salud antes-después se utilizó como instrumento la entrevista semiestructurada, a partir de los juicios emitidos por las mujeres, se identificaron los criterios y se construyeron categorías para comprender el concepto de salud y su evolución. Al inicio de la intervención, la mitad de las mujeres comprendían la salud en términos de ausencia de enfermedad; un quinto la asociaba con el cuidado corporal, psicoespiritual y ambiental y un tercio integraba elementos complejos cercanos a la categoría comprensión sanológica de la salud.

40|$|Abstract Bent (2015) A flow Paradox There are {{no studies}} known on flow {{interventions}} by supervisors of Dutch secondary schools {{on how to}} enhance the flow of their teachers. Yet, in the higher educational context, Steele and Fullagar (2009) claim that professors can enhance college students’ flow by (1) Provision of feedback and (2) support for autonomy. However, Steele and Fullagar (2009) do not distinguish between the three flow dimensions as e. g. (Bakker, 2005) does in the educational context in music schools. He describes three core aspects of flow: Absorption, enjoyment and intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, Steele and Fullagar (2009) do not include Bakker’s (2005) claim that flow is contagious, which means that flow of supervisors and teachers go together well. In addition, they do not differentiate between levels of feedback as Hattie and Timperley (2007) do: Task, process, self-regulation (action) and <b>self</b> (<b>thinking)</b> levels. Finally, they do not discrimate the degree of tentavity in feedback (Barunek & Rynes, 2010) and references to positive emotions (Bono and Ilies, 2006). This investigation concludes that from a teachers’ experience, the school supervisors’ flow interventions enhanced associating flow and its dimensions absorption and enjoyment, while these interventions maintained the relationship between flow and motivation from the period prior to the interventions. The interventions connected feedback and autonomy in the teachers’ experience, while they did not in the supervisors’ perceptions. These interventions did not link flow (or any of its dimensions) {{and the provision of}} feedback and support for autonomy from the teachers’ perspective. The interventions decreased the teachers’ support for autonomy experiences in the supervisors’ perceptions, while they did not from the teachers’ perspective. Next, enhancing teachers’ flow resulted in a decreased supervisors’ flow in their perceptions. Finally, the flow interventions were focussed on the provision of feedback. The provision of feedback before a task was conducted was more effective as were personal, limited positive emotional and tentative feedback styles. While feedback on task and process levels enhanced flow, feedback at a personal level and posing questions decreased it. This investigation implies that the claim by Steele and Fullagar (2009), that ‘flow is enhanced by the of feedback and by support for autonomy’ in the higher educational context of professors and college students, was transferred on the ‘provision of feedback’ to the secondary educational context of school supervisors and teachers, while it was not on ‘support for autonomy’. Furthermore, the findings of this thesis contradicted the claim by Bakker (2005) {{in the context of the}} educational domain in secondary education that flow is contageous, as the teachers’ flow enhancement resulted in decreased supervisors’ flow. However, this investigation only included a group of seven supervisors and one of their teachers, selected by these supervisors themselves. Thus, these implications should be seen as preliminary. Yet, as these implications seem to falsify the core of the current flow theory, further research is recommended. Finally, additional research should include the measurement of the supervisors’ perceptions of their teachers’ flow. A primary provisory practical implication is that school supervisors by enhancing their teachers’ flow, might focus, on the task level, on feedforward: performance information provided before a task is conducted. Furthermore, it appears that these supervisors might direct this feedforward primarily at the self-regulation level such as self-monitoring and self-reflecting of their teachers on their teaching, and on their conversations with pupils and their preparations for classes. In this way viable lessons might be established. In addition, supervisors are recommended to provide feedback in personal, tentative dialogues about the feelings of a person in relation to work. Most of all, these supervisors should be aware of the flow paradox: enhancing their teachers’ flow might decrease their own flow. However, small interventions and tentative approaches in the conversations and dialogues might prevent their flow decrease...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{attempt to}} look at the {{differential}} (as in interventionist) readings undertaken by speculative realists (A school of contemporary thought reacting against post-Kantian 'Correlationism') Iain Hamilton Grant and Ray Brassier, with the former concentrating on reading Schelling's naturalism relating to reason, while the latter claiming the constancy of thought's connection to thought. For Brassier, thought must be transcendentally separate from nature, or what he calls 'exteriority', and Grant insists on nature's thinking as plain nature. This doesn't mean 'interiority' is given weight in Grant's thought, but, on the contrary isn't a concern, as for him, the limiting factor of thinking (dichotomy in subject-object relationality) is the regionality of a particular identity attempting to grasp nature's infintude. Brassier maintains scientific statements as capable of supplying reasons for believing in the possibilities of determining thought's tracking and missing nature. He accomplishes this by clarifying notions of concept and distinguishing objects from concepts. This alien-ness of thought generates the possibilities of questioning the human production as against nature. This cardinal issue tries to answer the repercussions probably generated in the wake of either apathetic aspects of mind or the deepest powers of speculation. Not only that, a simultaneous questioning of the legitimacy of ontology and epistemology in the natural world is encountered. Grant advocates the objectifying of the self to grasp the productivity of <b>self's</b> <b>thinking,</b> {{but at the same time}} considering objectifying as an ongoing process, a kind of 'becoming'. In other words, it is the questioning of the limits of 'being' in the creation of episteme that takes precedence in Grant. Brassier on the other hand is concerned with the doing away of the dichotomy of being and thinking of meaning. This tension raises the issue of nature philosophy in a duel of 'eliminativism' and 'materialism', between the extent that calls for grounding nature without reliance on a structure undermining the discovery of contemporary science or supporting an anthropic view...|$|R

We found that with age, adolescents were increasingly sensitive to the perspective of the other player, as indicated by their reciprocal behavior. These advanced forms of social perspective-taking behavior were associated with increased involvement of the left temporo-parietal junction and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
