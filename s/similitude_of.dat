In the novel The New Japanese Women: Modernity, Media, and Women in Interwar Japan mentioned Shōnen Sekai in the notes to chapter 3 {{as one of}} many magazines that Hakubunkan made to relate to different parts of society. Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War also mentioned Shōnen Sekai as a popular magazine of that time, with an additional mention to Shōjo Sekai, its female equivalent. Issei: Japanese Immigrants in Hawaii mentioned Shōnen Sekai as just a publication of Hakubunkan. In the novel No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai'i During World War II had mention of Shimanuki Hyotayu who writes about immigration matters in Shōnen Sekai.

The boy immediately developed a love of music and worked at creating musical compositions himself, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The Universal Journal of Music 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, [...] "It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody, – ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the <b>similitude</b> <b>of</b> the portrait." ...|$|E
2500|$|Published {{alongside}} Decembrie, în direct, Capul lui Moţoc ("Moţoc's Head") reinterprets Alexandru Lăpuşneanu, a novella by the Romanian classic Costache Negruzzi, which romanticizes {{events in}} Moldavia's medieval history. Integrating further allusions to Romanian folklore (the Meşterul Manole myth), Shakespeare and various others, {{it is also}} seen by Alina Nelega as a close rendition of Ion Luca Caragiale's style. The protagonist, a treacherous Moldavian boyar {{by the name of}} Moţoc, uses a discourse rich in political imagery, and {{towards the end of the}} play reveals himself as an alter ego of communist theorist Karl Marx. Nelega is critical of the text, arguing that it [...] "does not surpass the gratuitousness of petty pokes" [...] and is [...] "more burlesque than absurd", concluding: [...] "I fear that Gârbea did not know how to end his play and quickly fabricated, deus ex machina, the <b>similitude</b> <b>of</b> a profound sense where there was nothing." ...|$|E

'And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness.--So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him' (Gen 1:26,27). Mark, in His own image, in the image of God created He him; or, as James hath it, it is 'made after the <b>similitude</b> <b>of</b> God,' (James 3:9); like Him, having in it that which beareth semblance with Him. I do not read of {{anything}} in heaven, or earth, or under the earth, that is said to be made after this manner, or that is at all so termed, save only the Son of God Himself. The angels are noble creatures, and for present employ are made a little higher than man himself, (Heb 2); but that any of them are said to be made 'after God's image,' after His own image, even after the <b>similitude</b> <b>of</b> God, that I find not. This character the Holy Ghost, in the Scriptures of truth, giveth only of man, of the soul of man; for it must not be thought that the body is here intended in whole or in part. For though it be said that Christ was made after the <b>similitude</b> <b>of</b> sinful flesh (Phil 2), yet it is not said that sinful flesh is made after the <b>similitude</b> <b>of</b> God; but I will not dispute; I only bring these things to show how great a thing, how noble a thing {{the soul is}}; in that, at its creation, God thought it worthy to be made, not like the earth, or the heavens, or the angels, seraphims, or archangels, but like Himself, His own self, saying, 'Let Us make man in Our own likeness. So He made man in His own image.' This, I say, is a character above all angels; for, as the apostle said, 'To which of the angels said He at anytime, 'Thou art my Son?' So, of which of them hath He at any time said, This is, or shall be, made in or after Mine image, Mine own image?
