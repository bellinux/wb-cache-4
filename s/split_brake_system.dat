It includes detailed studies of individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement. A full <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation model was designed, prepared, and used to predict <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> performance and to design a <b>system</b> with better <b>brake</b> pedal ‘feel’.
