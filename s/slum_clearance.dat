5|$|By 1890 {{official}} <b>slum</b> <b>clearance</b> programmes had begun. One was {{the creation}} of the world's first council housing, the LCC Boundary Estate, which replaced the neglected and crowded streets of Friars Mount, better known as The Old Nichol Street Rookery. Between 1918 and 1939 the LCC continued replacing East End housing with five or six storey flats, despite residents preferring houses with gardens and opposition from shopkeepers who were forced to relocate to new, more expensive premises. The Second World War brought an end to further <b>slum</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historically the {{population}} of Manchester began to increase rapidly during the Victorian era, peaking at 766,311 in 1931. From then {{the population}} began to decrease rapidly, due to <b>slum</b> <b>clearance</b> and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Manchester City Council after the Second World War such as Hattersley and Langley.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of late Iron Age and Roman settlements in the area. At {{the time of the}} Domesday Book, Knowle was a rural area assessed at a taxable value of two geld units. Knowle West remained rural in character until the 1930s, when a council housing estate was developed to provide homes for people displaced by <b>slum</b> <b>clearance</b> in the centre of the city.|$|E

5|$|Broadwater Farm in Tottenham, in the Borough of Haringey, north London (N17), {{emerged from}} the British government's policy from the 1930s onwards of <b>slum</b> <b>clearance,</b> in which poorly {{maintained}} terraced houses were bulldozed {{to make way for}} high-rise social housing. Built between 1967 and 1973, the Farm consists of 1,063 flats (apartments) in 12 blocks raised on stilts, linked by first-floor outdoor connecting walkways; no homes or shops were built at ground level for fear of flooding from the nearby River Moselle. At the time of Blakelock's death, the estate housed 3,400 people, 49% white, 43% African Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|It {{closed in}} 1840 after its owners {{suffered}} bankruptcy, but re-opened in 1841. It changed hands in 1842, and was permanently closed in 1859. The land was redeveloped {{in the following}} decades, but <b>slum</b> <b>clearance</b> in the late 20th century saw {{part of the original}} site opened up as a public park. This was initially called Spring Gardens and renamed in 2012 as Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. It is managed as a public park by the London Borough of Lambeth. Vauxhall Gardens is depicted in a tile motif at Vauxhall tube station, done in about 1971 by George Smith.|$|E
5|$|Following the deindustrialisation of Greater Manchester in the mid-20th century, {{there was}} a {{significant}} economic and population decline in the region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced housing that were built throughout the Victorian era were found to be in a poor state of repair and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered from chronic social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. <b>Slum</b> <b>clearance</b> and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a decrease in population in central Greater Manchester. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population of Greater Manchester declined by over 8,000inhabitants a year. While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population of Greater Manchester decreased by only 8%.|$|E

50|$|The years {{following}} the Second World War {{saw one of the}} most intense periods of building in the city's history, referred to as the <b>slum</b> <b>clearances.</b> <b>Slum</b> housing was replaced with a number of large tower blocks, many of which have since been demolished and replaced with housing once more.|$|R
5|$|Soon after {{attaining}} the premiership, Chamberlain obtained {{passage of}} the Factories Act 1937. This Act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children. In 1938, Parliament enacted the Coal Act 1938, which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major law passed that year was the Holidays with Pay Act. Though the Act only recommended that employers give workers a week off with pay, it led to a great expansion of holiday camps and other leisure accommodation for the working classes. The Housing Act of 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging <b>slum</b> <b>clearance</b> and maintained rent control. Chamberlain's plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the raising of the school-leaving age to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, did not go into effect. In the event, it wasn't until 1 September 1972 when the age was raised from 15 to 16, following preparations which began 1964.|$|E
5|$|This victory did not {{delay the}} workhouse's fate; {{the site was}} duly sold to the Catholic Church for £110,000, and {{demolition}} began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a <b>slum</b> <b>clearance</b> campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E
5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove <b>Slum</b> <b>Clearance</b> Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 December 1955, Powell was {{appointed}} parliamentary secretary to Duncan Sandys at the Ministry of Housing. He called it [...] "the best ever Christmas box". In early 1956, he {{spoke for the}} Housing Subsidies Bill in the Commons and argued for the rejection of an amendment that would have hindered <b>slum</b> <b>clearances.</b> He also spoke {{in support of the}} <b>Slum</b> <b>Clearances</b> Bill, which provided entitlement for full compensation for those who purchased a house after August 1939 and still occupied it in December 1955 if this property would be compulsorily purchased by the government if it was deemed unfit for human habitation.|$|R

50|$|St Mary's parish had {{a school}} and parish hall, known as Ashton Hall, {{both of which have}} been closed and demolished. From 1934 a {{programme}} of <b>slum</b> <b>clearances</b> reduced the population of the parish by half within four years.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, Carlton Hill's notoriety as a slum increased. Poverty, drunkenness, disease and low living {{standards}} were rife. Brighton's reputation was damaged by a disparaging article in The Lancet in 1882: making reference to Carlton Hill, it criticised the town's poor standards of health. Assisted by government funding, Brighton Corporation undertook extensive <b>slum</b> <b>clearance</b> from 1928 until {{the start of}} World War II, transforming the area's appearance. Two large blocks of flats—Brighton Corporation's first council flats—were built to rehouse many of the displaced residents. The Milner Flats, a long four-storey block, stand {{on the site of}} Woburn Place, and were completed in 1934. Alderman Hugh Milner Black, a Corporation member who campaigned for housing improvements in Brighton, was commemorated in the naming. Kingswood Flats, on the site of Nelson Place and a Primitive Methodist chapel, were built in 1938. The name refers to Minister for Health Kingsley Wood. Some displaced residents were moved out of the area: the new council estates of Whitehawk and Moulsecoomb, built in the 1920s and early 1930s on the fringe of Brighton, accommodated many former Carlton Hill residents. An earlier low-rise development took place in 1931, when the small Tarnerland council estate was built on empty land near Tilbury Place.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Birmingham and Black Country urban areas were {{coalescing}} into a single extensive conurbation spanning the borders of three counties: Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire. Other similar urban areas in England, such as Lancashire, Tyneside, London and within Yorkshire West Riding, had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, <b>slum</b> <b>clearance,</b> and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The Local Government Act 1958 appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a West Midlands Special Review Area, whose recommendations would ultimately form the West Midlands Order 1965 legislation. A second report known as the West Midlands General Review looked into the administrative authorities within the wider region, including the remainder of Worcestershire.|$|E
5|$|The older houses relied {{mainly on}} heating from open coal fires, {{which led to}} {{problems}} with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the Clean Air Act 1956. Although a <b>slum</b> <b>clearance</b> scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme to get well under way. In the 1950s, the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks. By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a larger social housing stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood.|$|E
50|$|The {{largest single}} housing {{development}} in Leamore is the Beechdale housing estate {{which was built}} by Walsall council in the 1950s to rehouse people from the town centre <b>slum</b> <b>clearances.</b> Noddy Holder, the lead singer of Slade, grew up in Beechdale.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Hunslet's fanbase went into decline as post-war <b>slum</b> <b>clearances</b> changed {{what had been}} a {{residential}} area into an industrial one.

50|$|During the <b>slum</b> <b>clearances</b> in the 60's Garrowhil grew as {{council housing}} and estates {{were built in}} the area as large work was being done {{building}} the neighbouring area of Easterhouse where many people were moved from the inner city tenements into both Garrowhil and Easterhouse.|$|R
5|$|Even {{with the}} growth of {{industry}} there were not enough good jobs: as a result, from 1841 to 1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the First World War, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. While emigration began to tail off in England and Wales after the First World War, it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, 10 per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s there were no easily available jobs in the US and Canada, and emigration fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass migrations that had opened in the mid-eighteenth century. This contributed to the growth of the population, which reached a peak of 5,240,800 in 1974. Thereafter it began to fall slowly, moving down to 5,062,940 in 2000. There was also a decrease in some urban populations as a result of <b>slum</b> <b>clearance,</b> overspill and relocation to new towns, with the population of Glasgow falling from over a million in 1951 to 629,000 in 2001. Rural areas also saw a loss of population, particularly the Highlands and Hebrides. In {{the early part of the}} twenty-first century Scotland saw a rise in its population to 5,313,600 (its highest ever recorded) at the 2011 census.|$|E

In the UK, the <b>slum</b> <b>clearance</b> effort was bigger in scale than the formation of British Railways, the National Health Service and other state programs. UK Government data suggests the clearances that took place after 1955 demolished about 1.5 million slum properties, resettling about 15% of UK's population out of these properties. Similarly, after 1950, Denmark and others pursued parallel initiatives to clear slums and resettle the slum residents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slum</b> <b>clearances</b> {{during the}} 1960s and early 1970s {{saw some of}} the old Victorian housing stock demolished.

The area around the church was still mostly slum housing with some crime, one of the gangs involved in the Sheffield Gang Wars of the mid 1920s was of Irish descent with most of its members from the St Vincent’s parish. The Great Depression in the United Kingdom caused great hardship in the parish, it eventually resulted in a programme of <b>slum</b> <b>clearances</b> which began in 1929. Many acres of old properties were demolished in the parish and the residents moved to more spacious housing in the suburbs. The <b>slum</b> <b>clearances</b> continued up to 1938 when they were suspended because of the imminence of war.|$|R
