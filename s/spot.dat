5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark <b>Spot,</b> an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red <b>Spot</b> of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see the}} Great Dark <b>Spot</b> on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark <b>Spot</b> was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{start to}} their league campaign, with one defeat {{in their first}} 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first <b>spot.</b> Although the club were winless during the Christmas period, their chances of winning the title {{remained}} intact. A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe, as it moved Arsenal down to fourth <b>spot.</b> Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his team out of the title race and make priority to second <b>spot,</b> which came with a qualifying <b>spot</b> for the Champions League. Defeat to Newcastle United in the penultimate {{game of the season}} all but ended Arsenal's chances of finishing second, given Newcastle's superior goal difference. A win on the final day against Derby County meant the club finished third, level on points with Newcastle and Liverpool.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} of {{interactions}} between Jupiter <b>spots,</b> using the Voyager 2 cylindrical projection mosaics, notes that collisions between <b>spots</b> are irreversible, {{in contrast with}} solitary wave-type interactions. In 23 of 27 cases, interactions lead to a merging of the two original <b>spots.</b> Interactions of <b>spots</b> with filamentary regions usually lead to a disappearance of the spot; filamentary regions are noted to be {{the major source of}} <b>spots.</b> Stable <b>spots</b> do not generate other <b>spots,</b> instead destroying each other by merging. Most <b>spots</b> are anticyclonic, and lie in cyclonic shear zones...|$|R
5|$|On July 19, 2009, {{an impact}} site was {{discovered}} at approximately 216 degrees longitude in System 2. This impact {{left behind a}} black <b>spot</b> in Jupiter's atmosphere, similar in size to Oval BA. Infrared observation showed a bright <b>spot</b> where the impact took place, meaning the impact warmed up the lower atmosphere in the area near Jupiter's south pole.|$|E

5|$|The Great Red <b>Spot,</b> a {{prominent}} oval-shaped {{feature in the}} southern hemisphere of Jupiter, may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the Great Red <b>Spot</b> in 1831.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River Plain is a {{volcanic}} province {{that was created}} {{by a series of}} cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 15 million years ago. A migrating hotspot thought to now exist under Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated. This hot <b>spot</b> was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11million years ago but 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward. Pressure from the hot <b>spot</b> heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot <b>spot</b> passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.|$|E
5|$|The {{climb up}} or down from the summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known {{accident}} <b>spot.</b> In winter it involves climbing down another snow cornice onto steep icy ground.

5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future <b>spot</b> exchange rate. Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and <b>spot</b> rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future <b>spot</b> rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E

Two uneven rows of yellowish-orange <b>spots</b> run {{from the top of}} the head (near the eyes) to the tip of the tail.
