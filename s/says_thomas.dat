"No event," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Thomas</b> Raikes ('Personal Reminiscences', p. 284), ever {{produced}} so great a sensation in English society as {{the introduction of}} the German waltz.... Old and young returned to school, and the mornings were now absorbed at home in practising the figures of a French quadrille or whirling a chair round the room to learn the step and measure of the German waltz. The anti-waltzing party took the alarm, cried it down; mothers forbad it, and every ballroom became a scene of feud and contention. The foreigners were not idle in forming their 'élèves'; Baron Tripp, Neumann, St. Aldegonde, etc., persevered in spite of all prejudices which were marshalled against them. It was not, however, till Byron's [...] "malicious publication" [...] had been issued and forgotten that the new dance received full recognition. [...] "When," [...] Raikes concludes, [...] "the Emperor Alexander was seen waltzing round the room at Almack's with his tight uniform and numerous decorations," [...] or [Gronow, 'Recollections', 1860, pp. 32, 33] [...] "Lord Palmerston might have been seen describing an infinite number of circles with Madame de Lieven," [...] insular prejudices gave way, and waltzing became general.|$|E

[...] "Between ourselves the young Baronet carries matters with rather a high hand sometimes, and I am not sorry that you gave him a little dressing. But you were too hard upon him, Colonel--really you were." [...] "Had I known that child-deserting story I would have given it harder still, sir," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Thomas</b> Newcome, twirling his mustachios: [...] "but my brother {{had nothing to do with}} the quarrel, and very rightly did not wish to engage in it. He has an eye to business, has Master Hobson too," [...] my friend continued: [...] "for he brought me a cheque for my private account, which of course, he said, could not remain after my quarrel with Barnes. But the Indian bank account, which is pretty large, he supposed need not be taken away? and indeed why should it? So that, which is little business of mine, remains where it was; and brother Hobson and I remain perfectly good friends.|$|E

[Then as BULGIN elbows his way towards the platform, with calm bathos.] You'd like to break my jaw, John Bulgin. Let me speak, then do your smashing, if it gives you pleasure. [BULGIN Stands {{motionless}} and sullen.] Am I a liar, a coward, a traitor? If only I were, ye'd listen to me, I'm sure.

Is there a man of you that has given up eight hundred pounds since this trouble here began? Come now, is there? How much has Thomas given up--ten pounds or five, or what? You listened to him, and what had he to say? [...] "None can pretend," [...] he said, [...] "that I'm not a believer in principle--[with biting irony]--but when Nature says: 'No further, 't es going agenst Nature.'" [...] I tell you if a man cannot say to Nature: [...] "Budge me from this if ye can!"-- [with a sort of exaltation] his principles are but his belly. [...] "Oh, but," [...] Thomas says, [...] "a man can be pure and honest, just and merciful, and take off his hat to Nature!" [...] I tell you Nature's neither pure nor honest, just nor merciful. You chaps that live over the hill, an' go home dead beat in the dark on a snowy night--don't ye fight your way every inch of it? Do ye go lyin' down an' trustin' to the tender mercies of this merciful Nature? Try it and you'll soon know with what ye've got to deal.

6000|$|Just such a gestour, or {{narrative}} poet, was Chaucer himself; for, as Warton has remarked, he excelled {{alike in}} the pathetic and the gay, and, {{if he was}} more admirable in one than in the other, his [...] "tales of weeping" [...] were superior to his [...] "tales of game." [...] None of our poets, except Shakespeare, can compete with him in versatility of genius. His numerous characters are conceived with equal truth and distinctness; his dialogue is lively and natural; his humour is sometimes broad, sometimes subtle, and always racy; his tenderness is unrivalled in its mingled depth, simplicity and refinement; his descriptions, whether serious or comic, have never been surpassed in ease and vividness. His pre-eminence appears the more conspicuous when we contrast his living strains with the feeble diffuse monotony of his successors and predecessors. He may be compared, <b>says</b> <b>Thomas</b> Warton, to a premature summer's day in an English spring. The autobiographical passages in his works afford {{a glimpse of the}} varied tastes and pursuits which rendered him one of the most comprehensive writers in the world. His keen observation of mankind was blended with the plodding of a student. He tells us that he lived the life of a hermit, and was entirely ignorant of what was passing among the neighbours who [...] "dwelt almost at his door." [...] His custom when the duties of the day were over was to withdraw to his house, and sit down [...] "as dumb as any stone" [...] to his books, till he was [...] "dazed" [...] with reading. His love of nature could alone compete in intensity with his love of literature. The single thing which had power to entice him from the studies he held [...] "in reverence" [...] was the singing of birds and the blooming of flowers. The month of May had a peculiar fascination for him. [...] "Then," [...] he exclaims, [...] "farewell my book," [...] and transported by the opening beauties of the year he gave himself up to the exhilarating effects of renovated nature. The [...] "flower of flowers," [...] in his eyes, was the daisy, and there was never a morning that he was not out at dawn in the meadows, kneeling on the [...] "soft, sweet grass," [...] and watching his little favourite unclose its petals to the sun. In the evening he returned to see the daisies [...] "go to rest," [...] and no sooner were they shut up than he hastened home to bed, that he might be awake in time to witness the renewal of the scene. The sight was to him so [...] "blissful" [...] that it [...] "softened all his sorrow," [...] nor did the commonness of the occurrence abate the charm. He protests that he still feels within him the fire which impelled him to rise with glad devotion before break of day that he might behold the resurrection of his cherished flower, and do it reverence; for the friendly daisy was-- ...|$|E
