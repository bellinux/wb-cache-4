5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner <b>steps</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E

500|$|The debut episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Kinney Littlefield of The Orange County Register said, [...] "One {{word about}} 'Gone for Goode' - wow." [...] Littlefield praised the episode for dropping the viewer {{into the middle}} of an episode with complex characters and storylines without getting too confusing. People magazine reviewer David Hiltbrand called the episode [...] "extraordinary" [...] and gave it an A grade. He complimented the realism, the hand-held camera work and the cast, particularly Belzer. Lon Grahnke of the Chicago Sun-Times complimented the cast and praised the show for not depending on car chases or action sequences. Grahnke also said the show [...] "has the spice, dry wit and ethnic diversity of the Hill Street Blues crew, with even more eccentricities and a heightened sense of realism". John Goff of Daily Variety said the episode was well filmed and edited, and included a strong cast with performances [...] "above normal level of series work". Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts particularly praised Andre Braugher's performance: [...] "It's not often you actually witness a TV star being born... The moment the galvanic actor <b>steps</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> screen, though, he owns it." [...] The New York Times television critic John J. O'Connor praised the performance of Jon Polito, and said the role could be [...] "the kind of career break Joe Pesci found in the Lethal Weapon movies".|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey walking down some <b>steps</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> beach {{wearing a black}} bathing suit and high heel shoes, which she takes off when she gets {{to the bottom and}} walks onto the sand. Carey is seen in {{different}} shots standing next to a cliff-face {{as well as in the}} middle of the beach for the majority of the video. For the bridge, Carey is seen in multiple different shots as she walks along the shoreline, which changes as the last verse takes place, where her outfit changes from a black bathing suit to a different style white bathing suit whilst the sun sets in the background. As the video comes to an end, the scenery has changed to nighttime, and Carey is wearing another black bathing suit with a black jacket standing against a rock-face. Carey then inscribes into the sand [...] "H.A.T.E.U." [...] using her fingers, which she underlines as the video fades to black. The video is also inter-cut throughout with shots of the scenery on the beach. Rap-Up described the video as [...] "picturesque". Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that it is a [...] "slow-mo, beachwear fashion show". He continued, [...] "Equally depressed by the end of a relationship and inspired by the scenery, Mimi spends a few minutes suggestively touching herself and staring into the middle distance. What becomes of the broken-hearted?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Chicken Little (1943) {{is similar}} to 5th Column Mouse in that it depicts how the Nazis tried to instill fear into their enemies. [...] The cartoon begins with a {{barnyard}} scene which introduces the main characters: [...] “Cocky Locky” is depicted as the leader of, “Henny Lenny” is the gossip queen, “Turkey Lurkey” is shown as the educated elite, and “Chicken Little", the dunce. [...] The animals are all seen as happy because of a large fence protecting them. [...] However, “Foxy Loxy” wants {{to get in and}} uses a book entitled [...] "Psychology" [...] to not just get one chicken, but “get them all” by aiming for least intelligent chicken in order to eventually influence the masses. [...] It also instructs that if telling a lie, it is best to make it a big one. [...] The fox then convinces Chicken Little that the sky is falling. [...] Chicken Little initially convinces the barnyard that the sky is falling, leading to panic. [...] Cocky Locky <b>steps</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> scene to calm the situation explaining that Chicken Little was not hit on the head by a piece of the sky. [...] The crowd is dispersed with Chicken Little left crying and ashamed. [...] The fox then realizes that he must “undermine the faith of the masses in their leaders” according to the psychology book. [...] The fox then convinces Henny Lenny and her gossiping crowd that Cocky Locky may be wrong and if so, they will all be killed. [...] The fox then convinces Turkey Lurkey and his educated elite that Cocky Locky is displaying “totalitarian tendencies and is trying to dictate to us.” [...] The fox next reads, “By the use of flattery, insignificant people can be made to look at themselves as born leaders.” [...] Chicken Little is convinced by the fox that everyone will listen to him now and should save all the other animals and tell them what to do. [...] When the animals begin to fear for their lives and ask to know what to do, Chicken Little, who is a puppet of the fox, tells them to run to the cave. [...] When they all run inside the fox ties a napkin around his neck and announces, “dinner is served.” [...] The film quite unashamedly got across the message the dangers of creating panic and not using logic and reason in a time of crisis. [...] The book Foxy read early in the film was originally intended to be Mein Kampf, however the producers thought that this might come across as too strong to the audience.|$|E

Hence, for the lead this would be two counts with the weight on the left leg while the right leg moves, two counts with weight on the right leg while the left leg moves, followed by a quick <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> left and then a quick <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> right.
