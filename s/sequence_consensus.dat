40|$|Abstract Background RNA-binding {{proteins}} (RBPs) play diverse {{roles in}} eukaryotic RNA processing. Despite their pervasive functions in coding and noncoding RNA biogenesis and regulation, elucidating the sequence specificities that define protein-RNA interactions remains a major challenge. Recently, CLIP-seq (Cross-linking immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing) {{has been successfully}} implemented to study the transcriptome-wide binding patterns of SRSF 1, PTBP 1, NOVA and fox 2 proteins. These studies either adopted traditional methods like Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) to discover the <b>sequence</b> <b>consensus</b> of RBP's binding sites or used Z-score statistics {{to search for the}} overrepresented nucleotides of a certain size. We argue that most of these methods are not well-suited for RNA motif identification, as they are unable to incorporate the RNA structural context of protein-RNA interactions, which may affect to binding specificity. Here, we describe a novel model-based approach [...] RNAMotifModeler to identify the consensus of protein-RNA binding regions by integrating sequence features and RNA secondary structures. Results As an example, we implemented RNAMotifModeler on SRSF 1 (SF 2 /ASF) CLIP-seq data. The sequence-structural consensus we identified is a purine-rich octamer 'AGAAGAAG' in a highly single-stranded RNA context. The unpaired probabilities, the probabilities of not forming pairs, are significantly higher than negative controls and the flanking sequence surrounding the binding site, indicating that SRSF 1 proteins tend to bind on single-stranded RNA. Further statistical evaluations revealed that the second and fifth bases of SRSF 1 octamer motif have much stronger sequence specificities, but weaker single-strandedness, while the third, fourth, sixth and seventh bases {{are far more likely to}} be single-stranded, but have more degenerate sequence specificities. Therefore, we hypothesize that nucleotide specificity and secondary structure play complementary roles during binding site recognition by SRSF 1. Conclusion In this study, we presented a computational model to predict the <b>sequence</b> <b>consensus</b> and optimal RNA secondary structure for protein-RNA binding regions. The successful implementation on SRSF 1 CLIP-seq data demonstrates great potential to improve our understanding on the binding specificity of RNA binding proteins. </p...|$|E

40|$|Many protein {{interaction}} domains bind short peptides {{based on}} canonical <b>sequence</b> <b>consensus</b> motifs. Here we report {{the development of}} a peptide array-based proteomics tool to identify proteins directly interacting with ligand peptides from cell lysates. Array-formatted bait peptides containing an amino acid-derived cross-linker are photo-induced to crosslink with interacting proteins from lysates of interest. Indirect associations are removed by high stringency washes under denaturing conditions. Covalently trapped proteins are subsequently identified by LC-MS/MS and screened by cluster analysis and domain scanning. We apply this methodology to peptides with different proline-containing consensus sequences and show successful identifications from brain lysates of known and novel proteins containing polyproline motif-binding domains such as EH, EVH 1, SH 3, WW domains. These results suggest the capacity of arrayed peptide ligands to capture and subsequently identify proteins by mass spectrometry is relatively broad and robust. Additionally, the approach is rapid and applicable to cell or tissue fractions from any source, making the approach a flexible tool for initial protein-protein interaction discovery.

They have been proposed to be involved not only in oxygen transport but also in other biological functions, such as protection against reactive nitrogen species, photosynthesis or to act as terminal oxidases.

Additionally, concerted structural modifications allow burying of the heme group and define the distal site, which hosts a TyrB 10, GlnE 7 residue pair.

40|$|Background: The {{analysis}} of next-generation sequencing data from large genomes is a timely research topic. Sequencers are producing billions of short sequence fragments from newly sequenced organisms. Computational methods for reconstructing sequences (whole-genome assemblers) are typically employed to process such data.

Results: We present Mapsembler, an iterative targeted assembler which processes large datasets of reads on commodity hardware.

We introduce new algorithms to retrieve homologues of a sequence from reads and construct an extension graph. Conclusions: Mapsembler is the rst software that enables de novo discovery around a region of interest of gene homologues, SNPs, exon skipping as well as other structural events, directly from raw sequencing reads.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ATF/CREB-like sequences confer either repression or activation of transcription, depending on the promoter context. By isolating mutations that alleviate the repression mediated by ATF/CREB sites, we define a new yeast gene, ACR 1, which encodes an ATF/CREB transcriptional repressor. ACR 1 contains a bZIP domain that is necessary for homodimer formation and specific DNA binding to an ATF/CREB site. Within the bZIP domain, ACR 1 most strongly resembles the mammalian cyclic AMP-responsive transcriptional regulators CREB and CREM; it is less similar to GCN 4 and YAP 1, two previously described yeast bZIP transcriptional activators that recognize the related AP- 1 <b>sequence</b> (<b>consensus</b> TGACTCA). Interestingly, deletion of the ACR 1 gene causes increased transcription through ATF/CREB sites that {{does not depend on}} GCN 4 or YAP 1.
