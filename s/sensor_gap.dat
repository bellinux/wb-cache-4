40|$|Due to {{increased}} interest in visual surveillance, various multiple object tracking methods have been recently proposed and applied to pedestrian tracking. However in presence of intensive inter-object occlusion and <b>sensor</b> <b>gaps,</b> most of these methods result in tracking failures. We present a two-stage multi-object tracking approach to robustly track pedestrians in such complex scenarios. We first generate high confidence partial track segments (tracklets) using a robust pedestrian detector and then associate the tracklets in a global optimization framework. Unlike the existing two-stage tracking methods, our method uses the unassociated low confidence detections (residuals) between the tracklets, which improves the tracking performance. We evaluate our method on the CAVIAR dataset and show that our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of 3 D {{articulated}} multi-person tracking in busy street scenes from a moving, human-level observer. In order to handle the complexity of multi-person interactions, we propose to pursue a twostage strategy. A multi-body detection-based tracker first analyzes the scene and recovers individual pedestrian trajectories, bridging <b>sensor</b> <b>gaps</b> and resolving temporary occlusions. A specialized articulated tracker is then applied to each recovered pedestrian trajectory in parallel to estimate the tracked person’s precise body pose over time. This articulated tracker is implemented in a Gaussian Process framework and operates on global pedestrian silhouettes using a learned statistical representation of human body dynamics. We interface the two tracking levels through a guided segmentation stage, which combines traditional bottom-up cues with top-down information from a human detector and the articulated tracker’s shape prediction. We show the proposed approach’s viability and demonstrate its performance for articulated multi-person tracking on several challenging video sequences of a busy inner-city scenario. ...|$|R

However, due to differing technical backgrounds and languages, cross-sectorial communication between this group and remote-sensing scientists is often hampered. Hardly any really comprehensive studies exist that are directed towards the conservation community and provide a solid overview of available Earth observation sensors and their different characteristics. This article presents, categorizes, and discusses what spaceborne remote sensing has contributed to the study of animal and vegetation biodiversity, which different types of variables of value for the biodiversity community can be derived from remote-sensing data, and which types of spaceborne sensor data are available for which time spans, and at which spatial and temporal resolution.

40|$|Abstract — We present {{exploration}} and mapping strategies for a mobile robot moving among a finite collection of convex obstacles in the plane. The obstacles are {{unknown to the}} robot, which does {{not have access to}} coordinates and cannot measure distances or angles. The robot has a unique <b>sensor,</b> called the <b>gap</b> <b>sensor,</b> that tracks the direction of the depth discontinuities in the robot’s visibility region. Furthermore, the robot can only move towards depth discontinuities. As the robot moves, the depth discontinuities split and merge, and these changes are encoded in a Gap Navigation Tree. We present a strategy for this robot that is guaranteed to explore the whole environment, but that cannot decide whether the exploration has been completed. If in addition it is assumed that the robot has access to a pebble, which is an identifiable point that the robot can manipulate, then we prove that the robot can decide (in polynomial time in the number of obstacles) whether the environment has been completely explored. For this, the robot is able to distinguish every obstacle using only the <b>gap</b> <b>sensor</b> and a single pebble. These results are a continuation of our previous work on gap sensing for multiply connected environments [24], in which we reduce the sensing requirements for the robot by constraining the shape of the obstacles.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development, calibration, {{and testing of}} the adaptive optics system for the 6. 5 m Multiple Mirror Telescope. By employing a deformable secondary mirror, the MMT adaptive optics system uniquely solves several problems typical of astronomical adaptive optics systems. Extra components are eliminated, improving throughput and reducing emissivity. Since the adaptive secondary is integral to the telescope, a corrected beam is presented to any instrument mounted at Cassegrain focus. The testing of an adaptive mirror, which is large and convex, poses a new and difficult problem. I present a test apparatus that allows complete calibration and operation, in closed-loop, of the entire adaptive optics system in the laboratory. The test apparatus replicates the optical path of the telescope with a wavefront error of less than 500 nm RMS. To simulate atmospheric turbulence, machined acrylic plates are included. A phase-shifting interferometer allows calibration of the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor and reconstruction algorithms; comparisons agree to one-third of the root-mean-square wavefront. First, techniques were developed to align the apparatus and measure residual aberration. Then, the wavefront sensor was calibrated by measuring its response to introduced tilt. Lastly, a Fourier wave-optics approach was used to produce a modal wavefront reconstructor. The adaptive secondary mirror uses electro-magnetic force actuators. Capacitive position sensors are placed at each actuator to permit control of the mirror shape without measuring the reflected wavefront. These sensors have nanometer resolution, but require calibration. To calibrate the sensors, I developed a small optical instrument which measures the thickness of transparent films to an absolute accuracy of 5 nm with a precision of 2 nm. The device has applications far {{beyond the scope of}} this research. Twenty-four of these optical <b>gap</b> <b>sensors</b> have been built to calibrate the 336 capacitive sensors on the adaptive secondary mirror.

40|$|The ArfGAP Glo 3 is {{required}} for coat protein I vesicle generation in the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shuttle. The best-understood role of Glo 3 is the stimulation of the GTPase activity of Arf 1. In this study, we characterized functional domains of the ArfGAP Glo 3 and identified an interaction interface for coatomer, SNAREs and cargo in the central region of Glo 3 (BoCCS region). The GAP domain together with the BoCCS region is necessary and sufficient for all vital Glo 3 functions. Expression of a truncated Glo 3 lacking the GAP domain results in a dominant negative growth phenotype in glo 3 Delta cells at 37 degrees C. This phenotype was alleviated by mutating either the BoCCS region or the Glo 3 regulatory motif (GRM), or by overexpression of ER-Golgi SNAREs or the ArfGAP Gcs 1.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to develop sensors that allow condition based monitoring of critical combustion parts of gas turbines. Siemens teamed with innovative, small companies that were developing sensor concepts that could monitor wearing and cracking of hot turbine parts. A magnetic crack monitoring sensor concept developed by JENTEK Sensors, Inc. was evaluated in laboratory tests. Designs for engine application were evaluated. The inability to develop a robust lead wire to transmit the signal long distances resulted in a discontinuation of this concept. An optical wear sensor concept proposed by K Sciences GP, LLC was tested in proof-of concept testing. The sensor concept depended, however, on optical fiber tips wearing with the loaded part. The fiber tip wear resulted in too much optical input variability; the sensor could not provide adequate stability for measurement. Siemens developed an alternative optical wear sensor approach that used a commercial PHILTEC, Inc. optical <b>gap</b> <b>sensor</b> with an optical spacer to remove fibers from the wearing surface.

Testing in an F-Class engine installation showed that the optical spacer wore with the wearing part.
