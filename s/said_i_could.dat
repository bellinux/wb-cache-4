25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not. You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E
500|$|Petacci {{was sitting}} on the bed and Mussolini was standing. [...] "John" [...] took me outside and told me his orders were to {{eliminate}} them both, because Petacci knew many things. I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not shoot Petacci, so John said he would shoot her himself, while making it quite clear that Mussolini however, had to be killed by an Italian.|$|E
2500|$|On that {{occasion}} {{the prospect of}} inviting Baba Hari Dass to the US was raised. [...] "They stayed with {{me and asked me}} to go to the United States. I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go anywhere. I was ready to move to the higher mountains".|$|E
6000|$|I {{asserted}} my Ego. 'Certainly,' I answered, with my coolest air. 'I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage {{you for a}} week; and I {{have managed}} you.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{shook my}} head and <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not, and next moment was sorry, for she {{proceeded}} to explain.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> this <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{hear the}} rattle and clatter {{of the train}} running past the semaphores and switch points and slacking to a stop.|$|R
2500|$|However, in 1988 Anna Wing {{began to}} grow disillusioned with the {{direction}} the show was going in. She felt EastEnders did not fit in with her beliefs as a Quaker, commenting [...] "We had 31 million viewers and it was shown all over the world, and I suddenly thought 'Should I be in this?'...I had a crisis of conscience." [...] After three years playing Lou, Anna Wing asked to be written out. Wing has since revealed that creator Julia Smith was devastated {{when she decided to}} leave, commenting [...] "she <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have been in it for ever and ever until I popped off for real." ...|$|E
2500|$|I kept {{up playing}} drums until I moved to London. I'd {{always wanted to}} be a good drummer and it's just ironic that I've turned out to be a bass player. The way I started playing bass was that when I arrived in London I was looking for a job, and the only place I could find one was in Macaris in Charing Cross Rd. I wanted to get {{something}} involved in music, and that seemed like a good place to be. But Macaris didn't sell drums, and so I lied and <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> play bass. They said, [...] "Fine, you sell the basses, and sweep up and get the coffees and whatever".|$|E
2500|$|His sister-in-law, Princess Charlotte, {{claims that}} the King did {{participate}} in homosexual activity after his trip to Italy in 1784 {{and that there were}} several rumors about this: she claims that she herself had witnessed that the park at Drottningholm Palace had become a place where male courtiers searched for homosexual partners, and in a letter to Sophie von Fersen, she writes in code: [...] "It is said that the King recently attacked a young man in the park at night and offered him the post of chamberlain to the Queen if he agreed to his lusts, but the young man preferred to leave. Agree that this is to take things to far. It is said that the trips to Svartsjö Palace are made to be provide privacy, it is unbelievable, but {{it is what it is}} <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell you a million things about this." [...] In 1791, Sophia Magdalena herself paid a surprise visit to the King during his stay at the Gustav III's Pavilion, where the King had spent more time since he came in conflict with the nobility after the 1789 parliament; and where he was reputed to indulge in orgies. She found the King in bed, and he asked one of his favorites, Count Fabian Wrede, to show her around. In the King's private chamber, however, the Queen found the actor and page of the King, Lars Hjortsberg, sleeping, naked. The Queen reacted by interrupting the tour by saying to Wrede that he apparently did not know his way around Haga, as he had obviously showed her the chamber of the staff rather than the King by mistake.|$|E

6000|$|Roberts: [...] "Oh, come now, Willis! You don't think she'll {{make any}} trouble? <b>I</b> apologized. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{everything}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of. She must think I was sincere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is I, Richard Carvel, Mr. Manners," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> shortly. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not keep}} out the {{contempt}} from my tone. [...] "I beg a word with you." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E

60|$|Soon I {{heard him}} earnestly entreating {{me to be}} composed. I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{while he was in}} such a passion.|$|E

60|$|Bun. To whom <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{follow my}} calling and that too, namely, preaching the Word; and I did look upon it as {{my duty to}} do them both, as I had an opportunity.|$|R

60|$|Then, I should ride, I <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not have}} come through Canterbury today without stopping, if I had been coming to anyone but her.|$|E

6000|$|... "I said that," [...] {{answered}} Joan. [...] "I {{wanted to}} do it and I talked and talked, so hard. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> everything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of. But that was the only answer: I mustn't do it." ...|$|R

5000|$|....but when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not be a}} candidate, I mean it! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not receive}} the {{nomination}} without placing not only myself but the Democratic party in a false position. God bless you for your kindness to me, but your candidate I cannot be.|$|R
6000|$|They {{told me you}} {{had been}} to her, [...] And {{mentioned}} me to him: [...] She gave me a good character, [...] But <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not swim.|$|E
60|$|I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not look}} at it: and thereupon he gave me some brandy and water in a tin pannikin, and left me once more to myself.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Altogether, it {{is worse}} than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have thought possible,' <b>said</b> Philip. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have {{believed}} him unstable and thoughtless; but the concealment, and the attempting to gain poor Amy's affections {{in the midst of}} such a course--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can’t call to mind exactly," [...] {{he said at}} length. [...] "But, you may {{rely upon}} it, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{everything}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> against you. But she never did care much for you. She told me so herself." ...|$|R
60|$|Goodness {{knows what}} <b>I</b> should have <b>said</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have thought of}} {{anything}} to say. But just then the music stopped, and somebody on the floor below began to speak.|$|R

6000|$|... "Old Beavan--he's the wheelwright--said it couldn't; and Dad <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly {{expect him}} to send the canoe back to Kingston. He bought it for me at an exhibition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] <b>said</b> Holmes--and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see by {{his eyes}} that he was much excited--"was this a mere {{addition}} to the first or did it appear to be entirely separate?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We talked--some time ago," [...] he went on, [...] "about my getting away. You {{promised that}} you would help me. You <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get off to Africa or America to-morrow." ...|$|R
60|$|At length, having got room to speak, I {{told him}} that, as <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> before, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> deny him {{but one thing}} in the world; I was very sorry he should propose that thing only that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not grant.|$|R
