The company's primary goal was to <b>supply</b> <b>software</b> <b>services</b> to the oil and gas industries throughout Texas, but it was not very successful. Sandy Cook, David's wife, suggested that he enter the video rental business. Cook sold his oil and gas software to its managers and founded Blockbuster Video in 1985.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThis paper aims to {{investigate}} the effectiveness {{in the use of}} public procurement as an alternative for inducting innovations in <b>software</b> <b>services</b> <b>supplying</b> companies. It analyses the purchase requirements of governmental clients and its impacts in inducting innovations. It is a study of multiple cases with ten analysis units conducted using semi-structured interviews with professionals in the companies. Innovations are identified in three steps: pre-sale, service providing, and post-sale. The results show that the provision of services to governmental clients is defined by bureaucratic parameters and by the attendance to different process conditions, which restrict the emergence of innovative solutions and, especially, its reuse with non-governmental clients. The study confirms the induction of innovations by governmental clients. Even though this induction is not intentional, it meets the main trajectory presented in the Chain-Linked Model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract –The {{interest}} of both researchers and practitioners around {{the use of}} Internet-based technologies to support the supply chain management has been very high.

The <b>software</b> focused <b>supply</b> chain is a <b>supply</b> chain of <b>software</b> focused products and services. In this paper, four e-business strategies for the <b>software</b> focused <b>supply</b> chain management are identified.

Key areas of a development strategy are the variability, the asset, the legacy integration and the change.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} paradigm shifts of software business is that individual organizations no longer compete as single entities but as complex dynamic supply networks of interrelated participants that provide blends of software design, development, implementation, publication and services. Understanding these intricate <b>software</b> <b>supply</b> networks is a difficult task for decision makers in software businesses.
