5|$|The {{terminus}} of the Rother Navigation {{was on a}} <b>side</b> <b>stream,</b> at {{the southern}} edge of Midhurst. There was a wharf and basin, close to a road which is still called The Wharf, and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between the wharf and the junction with the main river. It was built in 1794, and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The first lock was near Little Topham farm. There was a lock cut across a loop to the north. Costers Brook, which flows north from springs near Cocking, and then alongside the river for a short distance, joins below the site of the lock. The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791, with a main arch across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north, which has been repaired with brick. Moorland Lock was on a straight cut across a large meander to the south, close to Moorlands Farm. Lodsbridge Lock also bypasses a meander to the south, which fed Lodsbridge Mill. The mill building dates from the eighteenth century, and has been converted into a house. The seventeenth-century timber-framed mill house is also a listed building. There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill. A modern timber yard and saw mill is located {{to the north of the}} lock site, and Lods Bridge, which carries a minor road over the river, dates from the construction of the navigation. The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge.|$|E

25|$|By far, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used commercial process for treating acid mine drainage is lime precipitation in a high-density sludge (HDS) process. In this application, a slurry of lime is dispersed into a tank containing acid mine drainage and recycled sludge to increase water pH to about 9. At this pH, most toxic metals become insoluble and precipitate, aided by the presence of recycled sludge. Optionally, air may be introduced in this tank to oxidize iron and manganese and assist in their precipitation. The resulting slurry is directed to a sludge-settling vessel, such as a clarifier. In that vessel, clean water will overflow for release, whereas settled metal precipitates (sludge) will be recycled to the acid mine drainage treatment tank, with a sludge-wasting <b>side</b> <b>stream.</b> A number of variations of this process exist, as dictated by the chemistry of ARD, its volume, and other factors. Generally, the products of the HDS process also contain gypsum and unreacted lime, which enhance both its settleability and resistance to re-acidification and metal mobilization.|$|E
40|$|Sodium {{polyacrylate}} (Na-PA) is a super absorbent polymer, {{which is}} commonly used in diverse hygiene products. The polymer is currently produced from fossil feedstock and its production consequently leads to adverse environmental impacts. Na-PA production from sugars present in pulp mill <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> can potentially be a successful way to achieve a more sustainable production of this polymer. In order to guide {{the development of a}} novel biochemical process for producing Na-PA, a life cycle assessment was done in which Na-PA produced from <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) and sulfite pulp mills were compared. Furthermore, a comparison was made with Na-PA produced from fossil resources. The results show that the main determinant of the environmental impact of the bio-based Na-PA production is the free sugar content in the <b>side</b> <b>streams.</b> The lowest environmental impact is achieved by the least diluted <b>side</b> <b>streams.</b> More diluted <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> require larger amounts of energy for concentration, and, if the diluted streams are not concentrated, processes such as hydrolysis and detoxification, and fermentation are the environmental hotspots. Furthermore, the higher the yield of the fermentation process, the lower the environmental impact will be. Lastly, the production of bio-based Na-PA led to a lower global warming potential for some of the considered pulp mill <b>side</b> <b>streams,</b> but all of the other impacts considered were higher, when compared to fossil-based Na-PA production. Therefore, in parallel with efforts to develop a high-yield yeast for the fermentation process, technology developers should focus on low energy concentration processes for the <b>side</b> <b>streams...</b>|$|R

40|$|The AQUAREL project {{studied the}} {{availability}} and optional utilization methods for fish processing <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> and other aquatic biomaterial in the Republic of Karelia. Additionally processing aquatic biomaterial with manure and sewage sludge was studied. Based on the results, the most feasible option today is to process fish <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> to fish oil and dewatered oil-free residue and to use them for fish or animal feed production. However, {{it is necessary to}} highlight, that changes in e. g. economic environment, energy prices and demand may require re-evaluating the results and conclusions made in the project. Producing fish oil from fish processing <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> is an easy and relatively simple production process generating a valuable end product. The functionality of the process was confirmed in a pilot conducted in the project. The oil and solids are separated from the heated fish waste based on gravity. The fish oil separating on top of the separator unit is removed. Fish oil can as such be utilized for heating purposes, fish meal or animal feed production, {{but it can also be}} further processed to biodiesel. However, due to currently moderate energy prices in Russia, biodiesel production is not economically profitable. Even if the fish oil production process is not complicated, the operative management of small-scale fish oil production unit requires dedicated resources and separate facilities especially to meet hygiene requirements. Managing the <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> is not a core business for fish farmers. Efficient and economically profitable fish oil production requires a centralized production unit with bigger processing capacity. One fish processing unit needs to be designed to manage <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> collected from several fish farms. The optimum location for the processing unit is in the middle of the fish farms. Based on the transportation cost analysis in the Republic of Karelia, it is not economically efficient to transport bio-wastes for more than 100 km since the transportation costs start increasing substantially. Another issue to be considered is that collection of <b>side</b> <b>streams,</b> including the dead fish, from the fish farms should be organized on a daily basis in order to eliminate the need for storing the <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> at the farms. Based on AQUAREL project studies there are different public funding sources available for supporting and enabling profitable and environmentally sustainable utilization, research or development of fish processing <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> and other aquatic biomaterial. Different funding programmes can be utilized by companies, research organizations, authorities and non-governmental organizations...|$|R

60|$|The Upper Fall of the Tees, Yorkshire, {{engraved}} in the England series, may {{be given}} as a standard example of rock-drawing to be opposed {{to the work of}} Salvator. We have, in the great face of rock which divides the two streams, horizontal lines which indicate the real direction of the strata, and these same lines are given in ascending perspective all along the precipice on the right. But we see also on the central precipice fissures absolutely vertical, which inform us of one series of joints dividing these horizontal strata; and the exceeding smoothness and evenness of the precipice itself inform us that it has been caused by a great separation of substance in the direction of another more important line of joints, running in a direction across the river. Accordingly, we see on the left that the whole summit of the precipice is divided again and again by this great series of joints into vertical beds, which lie against each other with their sides towards us, and are traversed downwards by the same vertical lines traceable {{on the face of the}} central cliff. Now, let me direct especial attention to the way in which Turner has marked over this general and grand unity of structure, the modifying effects of the weather and the torrent. Observe how the whole surface of the hill above the precipice on the left[60] is brought into one smooth, unbroken curvature of gentle convexity, until it comes to the edge of the precipice, and then, just on the angle, (compare § 2,) breaks into the multiplicity of fissure which marks its geological structure. Observe how every one of the separate blocks, into which it divides, is rounded and convex in its salient edges turned to the weather, and how every one of their inward angles is marked clear and sharp by the determined shadow and transparent reflex. Observe how exquisitely graceful are all the curves of the convex surfaces, indicating that every one of them has been modelled by the winding and undulating of running water; and how gradually they become steeper as they descend, until they are torn down into the face of the precipice. Finally, observe the exquisite variety of all the touches which express fissure or shade; every one in varying directions and with new forms, and yet throughout indicating that perfect parallelism which at once explained to us the geology of the rock, and falling into one grand mass, treated with the same simplicity of light and shade which a great portrait painter adopts in treating the features of the human face; which, though each has its own separate chiaroscuro, never disturb the wholeness and grandeur of the head, considered as one ball or mass. So here, one deep and marked piece of shadow indicates the greatest proximity of the rounded mass; and from this every shade becomes fainter and fainter, until all are lost in the obscurity and dimness of the hanging precipice and the shattering fall. Again, see how the same fractures just upon the edge take place with the central cliff above the right-hand fall, and how the force of the water is told us by the confusion of débris accumulated in its channel. In fact, the great quality about Turner's drawings which more especially proves their transcendent truth, is the capability they afford us of reasoning on past and future phenomena, just as if we had the actual rocks before us; for this indicates not that one truth is given, nor another, not that a pretty or interesting morsel has been selected here and there, but that the whole truth has been given, with all the relations of its parts; so that we can pick and choose our points of pleasure or of thought for ourselves, and reason upon the whole with the same certainty which we should after having climbed and hammered over the rocks bit by bit. With this drawing before him, a geologist could give a lecture upon the whole system of aqueous erosion, and speculate as safely upon the past and future states of this very spot, as if he were standing and getting wet with the spray. He would tell you, at once, that the waterfall was in a state of rapid recession; that it had once formed a wide cataract just at the spot where the figure is sitting on the heap of débris; and that when it was there, part of it came down by the channel on the left, its bed being still marked by the delicately chiselled lines of fissure. He would tell you that the foreground had also once been the top of the fall, and that the vertical fissures on the right of it were evidently then the channel of a <b>side</b> <b>stream.</b> He would tell you that the fall was then much lower than it is now, and that being lower, it had less force, and cut itself a narrower bed; and that the spot where it reached the higher precipice is marked by the expansion of the wide basin which its increased violence has excavated, and by the gradually increasing concavity of the rocks below, which we see have been hollowed into a complete vault by the elastic bound of the water. But neither he nor I could tell you with what exquisite and finished marking of every fragment and particle of soil or rock, both in its own structure and the evidence it bears of these great influences, the whole of this is confirmed and carried out.|$|E

40|$|In {{our modern}} society {{there is a}} great need for the {{production}} of food, feed and raw materials from alternative sources of biomass. In the search for answers to the future food challenges and for sustainable production of raw materials, insects and microalgae offer excellent opportunities. Thomas More provides, in cooperation with KU Leuven, multidisciplinary research on the growth and use of insects and microalgae for various applications. Both insects and microalgae possess numerous of interesting properties to serve as resources in a biobased economy. Insects are omnivorous animals with a high fecundity. They can be reared easily on a relatively small surface. They feature excellent feeding conversions and can be grown on organic <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> obtained from industry and farming. Additionally, insects are high value biomass, considering their protein and lipid composition and the presence of chitin. Microalgae are another promising source for a sustainable supply of high-value biomolecules such as fatty acids, anti-oxidants, vitamins and essential amino acids which can be used as food additives, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as well as in aquaculture, feed and the chemical industry. Algae doesn’t require fertile farmland, they can be cultivated in salt water not suitable for drinking and they are able to process various aqueous <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> and flue gases. In Thomas More, research on insects as well as algae is performed on both laboratory scale and pilot scale. The insect research focuses on testing the processing of different organic <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> with different insect species. The effect of the different diets on the nutritional composition of the insects can be further investigated. Moreover, different compounds can be extracted, both on laboratory scale and pilot scale. Together with the industry, we look for interesting applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Currently, Thomas More, together with KU Leuven, investigates also the possibilities to process insects into human food and as a protein source in broiler feed. The algae research focuses on the optimization of the cultivation conditions for different algae strains, to stimulate different metabolic pathway, to valorize different <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> and above all to obtain a sustainable and economic viable production process with high yields.
