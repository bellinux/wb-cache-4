40|$|Abstract: The key {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to explore the impact of different macroeconomic variables on the <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> in India using annual data from 1990 - 91 to 2010 - 11. A multiple regression model is designed to test the effects of macroeconomic variables on the <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> and granger causality test is conducted to examine whether there exist any causal linkage between <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> and macro economic variables. Our estimates of multivariate Granger causality indicate that there is no causal association between <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and interest rate, <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and index of industrial production, but unidirectional causality exist between <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and inflation, <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and foreign direct investment,stock price and gross domestic product, <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and exchange rate, <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and gross fixed capital formation. However, bi- directional causality exist between <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and foreign exchange reserve, <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and money supply, <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and crude oil <b>price</b> and <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> and whole price index.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two studies. The first study examines whether the mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) affects <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> informativeness, {{as measured by the}} extent to which firm-specific information is capitalised into the <b>stock</b> <b>price.</b> Using a sample of 6, 367 firm-year observations from 970 publicly listed UK firms during the period from 1990 to 2013, the results show that the mandatory adoption of IFRS does make the <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> more informative. In particular, the results suggest a significant negative relationship between IFRS adoption and the <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> synchronicity. This indicates that the increased transparency following the mandatory adoption of IFRS facilitates the incorporation of firm-specific information into the <b>stock</b> <b>price,</b> leading to more informative <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> In this study, the effect of financial analysts’ activities on the relationship between IFRS adoption and <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> informativeness is also considered. The regressions results show that, within the IFRS adopters, the firms followed by a higher number of financial analysts have a higher <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> synchronicity than those followed by a lower number of financial analysts, suggesting that the IFRS adoption increases financial analysts’ ability to incorporate market-wide and industry-wide information into the <b>stock</b> <b>price.</b> Furthermore, these results indicate that the financial analysts’ activities attenuate the synchronicity-reducing effect of mandatory IFRS adoption. The second study, examines the effect of earnings quality on the informativeness of the <b>stock</b> <b>price,</b> using a sample of 5, 214 firm-year observations, collected from 880 UK firms for the period from 1994 to 2013.
