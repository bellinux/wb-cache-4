40|$|A new {{fluorescent}} sensor for {{nitric oxide}} (NO) is presented {{that is based}} on its reaction with a non fluorescent substance, reduced fluoresceinamine, producing the highly fluorescent fluoresceinamine. Using a portable homemade <b>stabilized</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> consisting of 450 nm LED and fiber optics to guide the light, the sensor responds linearly within seconds in the NO concentration range between about 10 – 750 µM with a limit of detection (LOD) of about 1 µM. The system generated precise intensity readings, with a relative standard deviation of less than 1 %. The suitability of the sensor was assessed by monitoring the NO generated by either the nitrous acid decomposition reaction or from a NO-releasing compound. Using relatively high incubation times, the sensor also responds quantitatively to hydrogen peroxide and potassium superoxide, however, using transient signal measurements results in no interfering species...|$|E
40|$|Zur Kalibrierung von photoelektrischen Detektoren zur Messung der Photolysefrequenz jNO_ 2 wurde ein chemisches Aktinometer entwickelt, das auf der zeitaufgeloesten spektroskopischen Messung der NO_ 2 -Konzentration in einem zylindrischen, statischen Reaktor beruht. Das Geraet wurde im Labor getestet und im Juli 1995 fuer eine Kalibration eingesetzt. Neben einer Beschreibung des Aufbaus und der Durchfuehrung aktinometrischer Messungen steht in diesem Bericht eine ausfuehrliche Analyse moeglicher Messfehler aufgrund reaktionskinetischer und geometrischer Faktoren. Die Absolutgenauigkeit aktinometrischer Messungen betraegt demnach 4. 5 %. Die Streuung der Messungen vom Juli 1995 liegt bei 4 % und koennte wahrscheinlich durch den Einsatz einer stabileren Lichtquelle und einer praeziseren Datenaufzeichnung reduziert werden. (orig.) The {{photolysis}} {{frequency of}} NO_ 2 {{is a key}} parameter in tropospheric ozone production. Accurate measurements are {{needed in order to}} simulate the chemistry in the atmosphere and to predict the rate of photochemical ozone formation. Because of the easiness with which they are handled, photoelectric detectors using a filter combination that matches the spectral sensitivity of NO_ 2 are widely used in field measurements to determine jNO_ 2 (cf. [Volz-Thomas et al., 1995]). However, these instruments require an absolute calibration which can best be done with chemical actinometry. The chemical actinometer that has been built in our institute consists of a cylindrical quartz vessel and is operated as a static reactor. Purified NO_ 2 is filled into the quartz tube at a pressure around 1 mbar. The NO_ 2 concentration is continuously monitored by measuring its absorption at 486 nm. Between two measuring cycles the system is evacuated to approximately 10 "-" 3 mbar. Since the pressure of the gas is measured before and after each measurement, impurities of the NO_ 2 can easily be detected and the stoichiometry of the photolysis reaction can be checked. In this report the set-up of our actinometer is described, and potential errors are investigated. Taking into account the uncertainties of the kinetic parameters of the reactions involved and of minor geometric corrections that have to be performed, the accuracy of actinometric measurements is estimated to #+-# 4. 5 %. The precision is 4 % as is demonstrated with a series of measurements performed in Juelich on July, 31, 1995. The precision of the measurements should be improved when using a better <b>stabilized</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> and a data acquisition with higher resolution. (orig.)

40|$|An integrated-optical {{wavelength}} sensor {{for detecting}} wavelength shifts of <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> as laserdiodes, superluminescentdiodes and Nd:YAG lasers is reported. The output signal {{can be used}} to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>light</b> <b>source.</b> The basic element of the integrated-optical wavelength sensor is an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder-interferometer. The amount of its phase sensitivity is determined by the path length difference between the interferometer arms. Because of the temperature dependence of the effective refractive index and the thermal expansion of the substrate, the sensor also shows a temperature sensitivity. For the realization of a special sensor application, e. g. wavelength sensor, the compensation of thermally induced phase shifts would be desirable. Thus purpose requires some difference of the thermal coefficients. Based on the electro-optic material LiNbO_ 3 and the waveguide fabrication technique of annealed proton-exchange (APE) a methode was developed to compensate thermally induced phase shifts. It was shown that the temperature compensation can be reached by insertion of a not annealed (PE) segment with another thermo-optic coefficient than the annealed proton-exchanged channel waveguide.

Reflection spectra displacement mechanism of the fiber Bragg gratings under the external temperature effects and the static pressure is described. The experiment has shown that reflection spectra displacement of Bragg gratings reduces the visibility of the interference pattern. A method of center wavelength adjustment is proposed for the optical radiation source in accord ance with the current Bragg gratings reflection spectra based on the impulse relative modulation of control signal for the Peltier element controller.
