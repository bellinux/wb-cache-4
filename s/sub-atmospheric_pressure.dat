From the experimental results, several interesting features and effects were observed, namely, heat transfer coefficient maxima at around zero thermodynamic quality were observed for high inlet liquid subcoolings at low <b>sub-atmospheric</b> <b>pressures,</b> which were attributed to local thermal non-equilibrium instability (Jeglic and Grace, 1965). Such effects were also observed in boiling of pure hydrocarbons in vertical tubes (Kandlbinder, 1997; Urso et al., 2002) and were explained and explored quantitatively with a thermal non-equilibrium slug flow model (Barbosa and Hewitt, 2005) that associates vigorous bubble growth at <b>sub-atmospheric</b> <b>pressures</b> to the formation of large Taylor bubbles separated by subcooled liquid slugs...|$|R

50|$|The {{protocol}} of {{loading and}} securing the tissue sample into the inspection zone helps {{understand how this}} approach acknowledges whole organ functions. After immersing the tissue segment into the loading well, the loading process is driven by a syringe withdrawing a constant flow rate of buffer solution {{at the far end}} of the loading channel. This causes the transport of the artery towards its dedicated position. This is done with closed fixation and superfusion in/outlet lines. After stopping the pump, <b>sub-atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied through one of the fixation channels. Then after sealing the loading well shut, the second fixation channel is subjected to a <b>sub-atmospheric</b> <b>pressure.</b> Now the artery is symmetrically established in the inspection area, and a transmural pressure is felt by the segment.

In addition to the new impeller, a special seal was invented to extend the life of the pump. With these innovations the pump creates a <b>sub-atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> region within the pump's seal chamber. As the impeller draws in the vapor it is mixed with the liquid being pumped and compressed into micro-fine bubbles. Because of the close tolerance between the backvanes of the impeller and the backplate of the pump the vapor is sheared into fine bubbles and then they are compressed in the <b>sub-atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> region of the pump.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model is developed {{to simulate the}} impingement of liquid sprays on surfaces heated at temperatures ranging from nucleate to film boiling. The droplets are modeled in the Lagrangian frame of reference, and are dispersed stochastically in the continuous gas phase. The model {{is based on the}} fundamental basics of single droplet impingements extended to full sprays, where the overall heat transfer process is broken down into its basic components: conduction associated with the droplet contact, bulk air convection, and surface radiation. Droplet dynamics at the wall are modeled based on an empirical correlation relating the droplet incoming to outgoing Weber number. Droplet contact heat transfer is modeled using an effectiveness parameter for the heat transfer that {{is a function of the}} droplet Weber number. This attempt of numerically modeling the droplet-wall dynamics with multiple wall collisions and the droplet contact heat transfer has not been addressed before in a {{numerical model}}. Simulations are presented for: single-stream droplet impactions, multiple-streams droplet impactions, and conical sprays. The model is tested at atmospheric pressure using experimental data for nozzles that dispense non-uniform droplets. Favorable comparison with the test data is demonstrated. The model capability is then extended to simulate high and <b>sub-atmospheric</b> ambient <b>pressure</b> conditions with a proper accounting of the droplet-wall interaction and air-mist heat transfer mechanism. At high and <b>sub-atmospheric</b> <b>pressures,</b> the model was tested against experiments for single stream impactions at various pressures. Spray simulation conducted for a wide range of pressures reveals the following important issues regarding to the droplet dynamics, heat transfer and vaporization: 1) At higher pressures, the larger the droplet size, the better is the droplet-wall impaction, while for <b>sub-atmospheric</b> <b>pressures,</b> larger droplets have a detrimental effect due to their ballistic impaction. 2) At higher pressures, the Leidenfrost point shifts to a higher temperature that leads to an increase in the droplet wetting capability, and to a higher heat transfer effectiveness. 3) At higher pressures, more vapor is generated from each droplet impaction on the surface, resulting also in an increase in the heat transfer effectiveness...|$|R
