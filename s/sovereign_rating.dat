We find that <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> upgrades (downgrades) have strong effects on bank rating upgrades (downgrades). The impact of sovereign watch status on bank rating actions is much weaker and often insignificant. The sensitivity of banksâ�� ratings to <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> actions {{is affected by the}} countriesâ�� economic and financial freedom and by macroeconomic conditions.

Using members of the United Nations from 1995 to 2012 as the research sample, this study investigated the influence of national leader change on corruption and <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> by analyzing one year after the change in national leadership. The results showed that national leader change exerted a significant, positive effect on the degree of corruption and the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> one year after the change in national leadership. By including national characteristics, this study found that for countries that have adopted the semipresidential system, national leader change had a significant, negative effect on the degree of corruption and the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating.</b> For extreme human development countries, national leader change had a significant, negative effect on the degree of corruption but did not significantly affect the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating.</b> The results of this study can serve as a reference for investors engaged in international investment decision-making...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} reducing inflation volatility {{and the impact of}} enhancing financial institutions on economic welfare. First, an empirical analysis of the impact of inflation, inflation volatility, and financial institutions on a country’s <b>sovereign</b> debt <b>rating</b> is undertaken. Using a sample of 37 developed and developing countries over the period 1989 - 2006, the study estimates a non-linear rating regression that interacts inflation volatility with an index for financial institutions developed in this paper using principal component analysis. The results suggest that reducing inflation volatility can have a statistically and economically significant positive effect on a country’s <b>sovereign</b> debt <b>rating.</b> The results also show that improving financial institutions has a statistically and economically significant positive direct and indirect effect on a country’s <b>sovereign</b> debt <b>rating.</b> These empirical results are then used to calibrate the neoclassical one-sector growth model of Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) in order to quantify the welfare implications under two policy scenarios; 1) a one standard deviation decrease in inflation volatility and 2) a one standard deviation increase in the level of financial institutions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} Eurozone sovereign credit rating announcements by three leading rating agencies on exchange rates from January 1, 2009 to March 31, 2011.

Secondly, thanks to the high integration in Europe, we extend our analysis to the movement of USD/SEK {{in order to see}} how non-Eurozone countries, such as Sweden, are affected by Eurozone <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> news. Furthermore, we exclude the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> news concerning some small Eurozone countries during this period to observe any different results. We conclude that <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> announcements greatly affect the volatility rather than the mean of USD/EUR. It is noteworthy that markets only react to the news of review concerning large economies and tend to ignore those about small economies. Markets will be adjusted when the real rating actions concerning small economies happen. In addition, Eurozone <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> news only slightly influences the mean of USD/SEK, which implies non-Eurozone countries, such as Sweden, are somewhat indirectly affected by Eurozon...|$|E

40|$|South Africa {{has been}} under {{pressure}} with an imminent <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>rating</b> review and the potential threat of a downgrade to sub-investment grade in December 2016. Recent downgrades in Turkey and Brazil have {{raised the question of}} how credit rating changes impact emerging market economies, more specifically their Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Very little research has been done on the impact of <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>rating</b> changes in emerging markets. Three countries, similar in GDP size to South Africa have been selected for review so to anticipate the impact a credit rating downgrade might have on the South African economy. This empirical study takes the form of explanatory research as it aims to understand the relationship between macroeconomic and financial factors and how these drive GDP in the countries Brazil, Bulgaria and Russia. The analysis includes three Vector Error Correction Models (VECMs) and uses impulse response and variance decomposition to answer the three research questions: 1) What are the effects of credit rating changes on emerging market economies? 2) Are the effects of credit rating shocks evident immediately or is there a delay in response? 3) Do credit rating changes affect {{one or more of the}} countries more significantly than the others, and if so then why? The results reveal that <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>rating</b> upgrades positively impact the GDP output of all three countries, however less significantly for Brazil and Bulgaria than for Russia. The reaction to <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>rating</b> shocks differ between the countries and results for Brazil and Russia are immediate whilst in Bulgaria, credit rating shocks have a delay, only displaying a response to GDP from quarter fifteen onwards. When comparing the effects of <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>rating</b> shocks to that of other macroeconomic variables, shocks to credit ratings display the lowest significance in Brazil and Bulgaria, whilst bank lending interest rates and inflation display the most significant impulse responses. Conversely, in Russia, credit rating shocks have the most significance, whilst trade and inflation have the lowest significance and thus smallest effect on GDP. Variance decompositions show Bulgaria and Russia's economies to be most vulnerable to change in the long-run, and it is suggested that monetary policy changes are implemented to decrease credit risk due to inflation (Bulgaria) and political and <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>rating</b> risk (Russia) ...|$|R
