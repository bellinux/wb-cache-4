5|$|According to the church's caretaker, Brenda Hiett, the church's {{roof and}} siding were {{installed}} around 1900. A wrought iron fence, made by Stewart Iron Works in Cincinnati, Ohio, was installed around the church's cemetery. Electrical conduits {{were added to}} the interior of the church when it was electrified around 1930, and further electrical updates were made in 2011. The church's perimeter foundation of concrete blocks replaced the original stone piers in the early 1970s, and its wide, heart pine plank floors were <b>sanded</b> and re-lacquered. Around 1990, the Stewart Iron Works fence and gate were restored by White’s Ornamental Ironworks.|$|E

5|$|Further {{investigations}} {{were then}} performed in 1900 by Alessandro Barsanti, who uncovered the {{vertical access shaft}} leading to the burial chamber. Barsanti, seeing that several corridors and chambers were seemingly unfinished and that all were completely devoid of artefacts, deemed that the pyramid had never been used. Shortly after, in 19101911, George Reisner and Clarence S. Fisher worked on the site, excavating {{the north and east}} exteriors of the pyramid as well as the cemeteries surrounding it. The dimensions of the pyramid as estimated by Barsanti, Reisner and Fisher differ greatly and even the numbers of subterranean galleries they report are in disagreement. Unfortunately, the pyramid lies within a restricted military area since 1970 and consequently no excavation has been undertaken there since Reisner and Fisher's superficial work, leaving the structures beneath the pyramid in doubt. Furthermore, the pyramid is now <b>sanded</b> up, hampering modern estimations of its dimensions.|$|E
5|$|There {{was limited}} {{interference}} from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included {{the addition of}} a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then <b>sanded,</b> painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and <b>sanded.</b> Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and <b>sanded</b> down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E

30|$|Now {{coming to}} the effect of {{gradation}} of <b>sand</b> on the strength, it can be seen for any type of clay used in this study, the gradation of <b>sand</b> has shown a significant influence on the strength of clay–sand mixture at any percentage of <b>sand.</b> The gradation effect is prominently seen with natural clay–sand series rather than artificial clay–sand series. It can be further observed from the figures that maximum strength at the optimum level of clay–sand combination, clay-medium <b>sand</b> mixtures have shown to have maximum strength, followed by clay-fine <b>sand</b> and clay-coarse <b>sand</b> mixtures. An exception to this behavior is only kaolinite-sand series, where clay–coarse <b>sand</b> series has shown higher strength when compared to medium and fine <b>sand</b> series. This may be explained based on the observations reported by Prakasha and Chandrasekaran [8], that inclusion of <b>sand</b> grains in a clay matrix leads to an increase in pore pressure resulting in a decrease in undrained shear strength. Probably, in the presence of lesser quantity coarse <b>sand</b> fractions in pure kaolinite clay, the pore pressures developed may be less compared that of medium <b>sand</b> and fine <b>sand.</b> However, at optimum <b>sand</b> content, kaolinite- medium <b>sand</b> has shown to have higher strength than kaolinite clay-coarse <b>sand.</b> More detailed studies may throw light on this aspect of clay–sand interactions with different grades of <b>sand.</b> Further, it was observed that, {{it was not possible to}} prepare clay-coarse <b>sand</b> specimens when the <b>sand</b> content was above 60 %, except in the case of bentonite-coarse <b>sand</b> series. Hence, the results could not be obtained for those percentages of <b>sand</b> i.e., 70 and 80 % <b>sand.</b> It is to be noted that, since this was a preliminary attempt to understand the effect of gradation of <b>sand</b> clearly, this study was restricted to use of individual grades of <b>sand</b> and not in combination.|$|R

As the contractors renovated each apartment, they kept the original hardware, including the glass doorknobs and brass hinges, as well as the kitchen cabinets and apartment doors, and they <b>sanded</b> and stained the original wood floors. To bring the building up to current standards, they replaced the wiring and plumbing, and installed a sprinkler system and central air-conditioning in the apartments and public areas. The central air-conditioning replaced the huge basement fans, which had been in use since 1931, as well as window units. The company put new stoves and refrigerators in the apartments and, for the first time, washers and dryers. Shops and businesses on the lobby floor supplied such services for the residents.|$|E
