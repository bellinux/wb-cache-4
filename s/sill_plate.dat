25|$|If the {{blocking}} or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the {{shear forces}} {{applied to the}} building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between the <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing the <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, {{it may be necessary}} to pre-drill a hole for the nail in the old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also be appropriate to tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and bolts glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation.|$|E
25|$|Good {{practices}} in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate {{that there be}} good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> to vertical studs to plate cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, {{each of which is}} secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.|$|E
25|$|Single or two story wood-frame {{domestic}} structures {{built on}} a perimeter or slab foundation are relatively safe in an earthquake, but in many structures built before 1950 the <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> that sits between the concrete foundation and the floor diaphragm (perimeter foundation) or studwall (slab foundation) may not be sufficiently bolted in. Additionally, older attachments (without substantial corrosion-proofing) may have corroded {{to a point of}} weakness. A sideways shock can slide the building entirely off of the foundations or slab.|$|E

The buffer beam section is also a separate part, which allows replacement if it is damaged in a collision.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sill</b> <b>plates</b> [...] - [...] a lower {{wall plate}} which is bolted or {{strapped}} securely {{to the top}} of a foundation wall or concrete slab. These hold the house down against heavy winds. Normally, [...] "J-bolts" [...] are placed in the curing concrete after the mason levels the foundation and finishes dressing the concrete or anchor bolts are drilled into the concrete foundation. Newer systems of galvanized strapping with a J-bolt like anchor placed in the concrete allows the builder to avoid the mating step of drilling the <b>sill</b> <b>plates</b> for the bolts.|$|R

50|$|In modern, wood {{construction}} sills {{usually come}} in sizes of 2×4, 2×6, 2×8, and 2×10. In stick framing, the sill {{is made of}} treated lumber and is anchored to the foundation wall, often with J-bolts to keep the building from coming off the foundation during a severe storm or earthquake. Building codes require that {{the bottom of the}} <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> be kept 6 to 8 inches above the finished grade. This is a building code requirement to hinder termites and prevent the <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> from rotting.|$|E
50|$|The leather / Alcantara {{seats were}} {{replaced}} with cloth items and the rear bench was downgraded to match. The engine cover and <b>sill</b> <b>plates</b> were removed and {{the steering wheel}} was downgraded to no longer include the RenaultSport Logo or rubber thumb grips.|$|R

50|$|Pre-cut studs save a framer much time, {{because they}} are pre-cut by the {{manufacturer}} for use in 8-, 9-, and 10-ft (2.44, 2.74 and 3.05 m) ceiling applications, which means the manufacturer has removed a few inches or centimetres of the piece {{to allow for the}} <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> and the double top plate with no additional sizing necessary.|$|E
50|$|In the {{historical}} region of New France poteaux-en-terre was a historic style of earthfast timber framing.
