40|$|The questimed {{document}} examination {{plays an}} important role in forensic science. In Chinese documents, such as business contracts, there are <b>stamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>signatures</b> (<b>or</b> fingerprints) over them. Sometimes, those patterns (stamps, <b>signatures</b> <b>or</b> fingerprints) may superimpose on each other. When the documents being served as evidences to court, the overlapped patterns become contentious usually. Even in the document examination, overlapped patterns may interfere with the examination work. It will be helpful if we can reduce the overlapping influence before processing the document examination. The objective of image segmentation is to find regions that represent objects or meaningful parts of objects. The method for image segmentation is to find the measure of homogeneous regions of objects or to detect the boundaries between objects. In this paper, we review some color image models and explain how we apply the image segmentation method to analyze overlapped patterns in the document examination. Synthetic images and one real case image are used to show the capability of the image segmentation method...|$|R

40|$|An {{aggregate}} signature {{provides a}} method for combining n signatures of n different messages from n different signers into one signature of unit length. The main benefit of such schemes is that they allow bandwidth and computational savings. There exist several trials {{for the construction of}} ID-based aggregate signature schemes so far. Unfortunately, the computational complexity <b>and</b> (<b>or)</b> <b>signature</b> length of these schemes grow linearly with the number of signers. This paper focuses on the solution of these problems and proposes a new ID-based sequential aggregate signature scheme based on IB-mRSA. It is compatible with RSA and has the fixed signature length. The security analysis shows that it is secure in the random oracle model with the assumption of classical RSA...|$|R

40|$|In 2004, 13 {{percent of}} American rural {{households}} were "food insecure," meaning {{that at some}} point during the year they did not have access to enough food for all household members, and 4 percent of rural households experienced hunger. The Food <b>Stamp</b> <b>and</b> the National School Lunch programs play a vital role in helping poor, rural Americans obtain a more nutritious diet and alleviate food insecurity and hunger. Congress is currently debating the 2007 Farm Bill. One of the provisions in that bill addresses domestic food and nutrition assistance and includes reauthorization of the Food <b>Stamp</b> Program <b>and</b> the Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program, among others. The Food Stamp Program is a central component of the nation's policy to alleviate hunger and poverty and helps low-income families and individuals purchase a nutritionally adequate diet. The Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program distributes fresh fruits and vegetables to elementary, middle, and high school children in participating schools, and is administered by each state's National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, which are funded under the Child Nutrition Act.

40|$|Airborne radars {{that track}} moving targets face the {{challenge}} of surveillance over large geographic areas where military vehicles are interspersed with civilian traffic. There is a major need to develop robust, efficient, and reliable identification and tracking techniques to identify selected targets, and to maintain tracks for selected critical targets, in dense target environments. Traditionally, tracking and identification have been considered separately; we identify a target first, and then we track it kinematically to sustain the identification. The difficulty with separate identification and tracking is that neither task is sufficient by itself to satisfy the demands of the other. We need to incorporate the distinctive target signature information into the tracker, so that identification <b>and</b> tracking, <b>or</b> <b>signature</b> comparison <b>and</b> tracking, perform together as a unit. The moving-target identification and feature-aided tracking approach described in this article combines kinematic association hypotheses with accumulated target classification information obtained from high range resolution (HRR), inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), and syntheti...|$|R

Post-marks were his business; and had he given all his mind to postmarks, he would have sufficiently carried out that great doctrine of doing the duty which England expects from every man.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{multiplexing}} technologies {{has raised the}} possibility that disease states can be defined using discrete genomic <b>and</b> proteomic patterns <b>or</b> <b>signatures.</b> However this emerging area has been limited by the 'content problem', arising from the uncertainty of which molecules to focus on. The human cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens are expressed on cells of the human immune system (leukocytes) and on other cell types. These heterogeneous molecules perform a host of roles essential to immune function and to the physiology of other lineages. The 339 defined CD antigens and their as yet, undefined counterparts constitute key components of the expressed human cell surface proteome. We propose that CD antigen expression patterns will {{form the basis of}} a rational, discrete and generalized diagnostic and prognostic system. Furthermore, disease-specific CD antigen proteomic signatures {{are likely to be more}} robust than corresponding genomic signatures and will also help to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention...|$|R
