However, Jain scholars such as Haribhadra also wrote satires against Hindu gods, mocking them with novel outrageous stories where the gods misbehave and act unethically. The Hindu gods are presented by some Jain writers as persecuting or tempting or afraid of or serving a legendary Jina before he gains omniscience. In other stories, one or more Jinas easily defeat the Hindu deities such as Vishnu, or Rama and Sita come to pay respect to a Jina at a major Jain pilgrimage site such as Mount Satrunjaya.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{history of}} awareness of Hinduism in the United States {{was in the early}} nineteenth century through the translated books of Bhagavad Gita from the Sanskrit text of the Hindus, which were very well received by noted scholars like Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson in the field of transcendentalism. This was followed by the visit of P. C. Mozoomdar, a scholarly teacher from India, to Massachusetts in 1880. When he returned along with Swami Vivekananda to attend the 1893 World Parliament of Religions, he was overshadowed by Swami Vivekananda with his great oratorical skill. The beginning of <b>Hinduism’s</b> <b>influence</b> on the US is attributable to Vivekananda who established the Ramakrishna Mission (a non-sectarian organization that does not subscribe to caste distinctions) in India after visiting New York and Los Angeles in 1895.|$|R
5000|$|The Nyaya {{school of}} <b>Hinduism</b> <b>influenced</b> all other schools of Hindu philosophy, {{as well as}} Buddhism. Despite their differences, these {{scholars}} studied {{with each other and}} debated ideas, with Tibetan records suggesting that Buddhist scholars spent years residing with Hindu Nyaya scholars to master the art of reasoning and logic. This cooperation has enabled scholars to place the currently surviving version of the Nyayasutras, to a terminus ante quem (completed before) date of about the 2nd century CE, because {{one of the most famous}} and established Buddhist scholars of that era, Nagarjuna, explicitly states, [...] "sutra 4.2.25 is addressed against the Madhyamika system" [...] of Buddhism. Other ancient Buddhist texts confirm that Nyayasutras existed before them, and the text is considered the primary text of old Nyaya school of Hinduism.|$|R
50|$|Creation myths in many {{religions}} {{recall a}} story involving {{the creation of}} the world by a supernatural deity or deities, including accounts wherein the land is separated from the oceans and the air. The Earth itself has often been personified as a deity, in particular a goddess. In many cultures, the mother goddess is also portrayed as a fertility deity. To the Aztecs, Earth was called Tonantzin—"our mother"; to the Incas, Earth was called Pachamama—"mother earth". The Chinese Earth goddess Hou Tu is similar to Gaia, the Greek goddess personifying the Earth. Bhuma Devi is the goddess of Earth in <b>Hinduism,</b> <b>influenced</b> by Graha. In Norse mythology, the Earth giantess Jörð was the mother of Thor and the daughter of Annar. Ancient Egyptian mythology is different from that of other cultures because Earth (Geb) is male and sky (Nut) is female.|$|R

50|$|The {{most popular}} tariqa in the West is the Mevlevi Order, named after Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi. In {{the same time}} the Bektashi Order was also founded, named after the Alevi Muslim saint Haji Bektash Veli. The four main tariqas in South Asia are: the Naqshbandi Order, named after Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari; the Qadiri Order, named after Abdul Qadir Jilani; the Chishti Order, named after Khawaja Mawdood Chisti while Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti is the most famous sheikh; the Suhrawardi Order, named after Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi. Others can be offshoots of a tariqa. For example, the Qalandariyya has roots in Malamatiyya (with Buddhism and <b>Hinduism</b> <b>influence)</b> and Wafa'i (a {{combination}} Yasawiyya-Sunni and Batiniyya-Shia) of orders are offshoots of the Suhrawardi order. The Ashrafia after the 13 the century illustrious sufi saint Ashraf Jahangir Semnani is the sub branch of Chisti spiritual lineage. The Maizbhandari Tariqa or Maizbhandari Sufi Order is a liberated Sufism order established in the Bangladesh in the 19th century by the Gausul Azam Hazrat Shah Sufi Syed Ahmadullah Maizbhandari (1826 AD − 1906 AD), 27th descendent of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.|$|R
