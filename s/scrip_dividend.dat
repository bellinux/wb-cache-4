50|$|A scrip issue, {{also known}} as {{capitalisation}} issue or bonus issue, {{is a form of}} secondary issue where a company's cash reserves are converted into new shares and given to existing shareholders, or an issue of additional shares to shareholders in proportion to the shares already held. In the United Kingdom, public limited companies, those listed on the London Stock Exchange, have a number of ways to create new shares. A scrip issue is the process of creating new shares which are given free of charge to existing shareholders. To the individual investor, this is known as a <b>scrip</b> <b>dividend.</b> This would normally be done in place of paying a dividend.|$|E
50|$|In February 2016, Jean Bernard Lévy, EDF Chief Executive, {{confirmed}} a 68% drop in net {{profits and}} cut in dividend, saying that a final investment decision on the project would follow 'when all this is fully organised'. Also in February 2016, another source said 'the question of the funding {{is far from being}} resolved, EDF and the French state would need to sell assets under good conditions and {{in a short period of}} time, which seems quite complex at the moment considering EDF’s share price'. In March 2016, Thomas Piquemal, EDF's Chief Financial Officer resigned after 'saying the company should wait another three years before making the final investment decision on the project' where Jean Bernard Lévy disagreed 'saying he wanted it to happen as early as next month'. In March 2016, Jean Bernard Lévy wrote to EDF staff that he was in talks to 'obtain commitments from the state to help secure our financial position' and would 'not engage in the Point project before these conditions are met'. In March 2016, Emmanuel Macron, the French Minister of Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs said that a final investment decision would not be made until May 2016. On 25 April 2016, EDF announced plans to sell €4 billion of new shares to 'help it finance the building of the Hinkley Point nuclear plant' with the French government subscribing €3 billion of these shares 'as well as taking a <b>scrip</b> <b>dividend</b> option for 2016 and 2017'.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} on dividend policy by studying optional stock dividends, a mechanism that allows firms to cut cash payouts without a negative market reaction. We find that highly leveraged firms with limited cash holdings and large institutional ownership {{are more likely}} to offer optional stock dividends to their hareholders. These firms are the most committed to paying dividends, and optional stock dividends provide them with an opportunity for a stealth cut in dividends during economic downturns. Shareholders overwhelmingly approve optional stock dividends at general meetings with the majority favoring stock dividends over cash dividends. Further, in contrast to dividend cuts, shareholders do not view optional stock dividends as bad news. Our results support the monitoring explanation of optional stock dividends and show that shareholders value a firm’s ability and willingness to pay dividends, even if the final cash payout is reduced.

40|$|Thesis (MAcc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Scrip {{dividends}} {{have become}} increasingly popular in South Africa SInce the introduction of secondary tax on companies (STC) in the 1993 budget. There {{is more than one}} approach to the treatment of <b>scrip</b> <b>dividend</b> schemes for accounting purposes, i. e. the reinvestment approach and the capitalisation issue approach. Unfortunately guidance {{in the form of a}} statement or guideline from the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants has not been forthcoming. Companies in the United States of America account for stock dividends (capitalisation issues) in a variety of ways and several studies have analysed the effect of these accounting treatments on retained earnings and the retained earnings hypothesis. Several empirical studies in the United States of America and the United Kingdom have documented marked differences in the ability of companies in these countries to make distributions to shareholders. For this reason the accounting treatment of stock dividends and scrip dividends in these countries was examined and compared to the methods used in South Africa. Earnings per share is often used by financial analysts to analyse and compare companies. The methods used in South Africa to account for scrip dividends result in different calculations of earnings per share and therefore the effect of the different methods was examined. This study concludes that the reinvestment approach is theoretically the most acceptable accounting treatment of <b>scrip</b> <b>dividend</b> schemes In South Africa. A representative sample of companies which declared scrip dividends in the period 1993 to 1999 was selected to determine how these schemes are implemented in the South African economy. These companies' financial statements were analysed to determine if the <b>scrip</b> <b>dividend</b> schemes were treated in terms of the accounting method proposed in this study and if the necessary information was disclosed in the financial statements. This study finds that different accounting approaches are used in South Africa, that earnings per share and secondary tax on companies are not calculated consistently for accounting purposes and that the information disclosed to the users of the financial statements differs from company to company. It is recommended that the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants issue accounting guidelines to the drafters of financial statements regarding <b>scrip</b> <b>dividend</b> schemes. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die verklaring van skripdividende het in Suid-Afrika in gewildheid begin toeneem met die inwerkingstelling van sekondere belasting op maatskappye (SBM) in die 1993 -begroting. Daar is meer as een metode om skripdividendskemas rekeningkundig te verantwoord, naamlik die herbeleggingsbenadering en die kapitalisasieuitgiftebenadering. Die Suid-Afrikaanse Instituut vir Geoktrooieerde Rekenmeesters het egter op hierdie stadium nog nie 'n rekeningkundige standpunt of riglyn oor die rekeningkundige verantwoording van skripdividendskemas uitgereik nie. In die Verenigde State van Amerika kan maatskappye kapitalisasie-uitgifte op verskillende maniere rekeningkundig verantwoord en verskeie studies het die invloed ondersoek wat hierdie metodes op verdeelbare reserwes en die behoue wins-hipotese het. Verder het studies wat in die Verenigde State van Amerika en die Verenige Koningkryk gedoen is, bevind dat hierdie lande se beperkings op verdelings aan aandeelhouers baie van mekaar verskil en om die rede is die metodes wat in die lande toegepas word om kapitalisasie-uitgifte en skripdividendskemas rekeningkundig te verantwoord, ondersoek en met die metodes vergelyk wat in Suid-Afrika toegepas kan word. Aangesien verdienste per aandeel dikwels deur finansiele ontleders gebruik word om maatskappye te ontleed en met mekaar te vergelyk en omdat die metodes wat in Suid- Afrika toegepas kan word verskillende berekeninge van verdienste per aandeel tot gevoIg het, is die uitwerking wat die verskillende metodes op die berekening van verdienste per aandeeI het ook ontleed...|$|E
40|$|A UK {{company may}} give its {{shareholders}} {{the option to}} elect to receive additional shares in the company {{in lieu of a}} cash dividend. The share alternative is referred to as a <b>scrip</b> <b>dividend.</b> Scrip dividends offer tax savings to some UK companies, and may be beneficial to certain shareholders. The type of company that can benefit from scrip dividends is one that has structural surplus advance corporation tax (ACT). This may arise because the company distributes either foreign source profits or preference income (income that is subject to tax). There has been a {{decline in the number of}} companies with structural surplus ACT over the past ten years. This has been largely due to the reduction of preference income following the Finance Act of 1984. On the basis of the analysis presented in the paper it is expected that companies with structural surplus ACT will offer scrip dividends and, as the number of companies in this position has declined over the past decade, there will be a reduction in the number of companies offering scrip dividends. A company without structural surplus ACT obtains a timing benefit rather than a tax savings by offering scrip dividends. As there are costs in offering scrip dividends, it is expected that companies without structural surplus ACT will not offer scrip dividends. The results of the study show that the scrip dividends became popular amongst UK companies when fewer companies had preference income as the effect of the Finance Act of 1984. Also, contrary to expectations, companies without structural surplus ACT offer scrip dividends. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in the paper. The tax rules on scrip dividends make a <b>scrip</b> <b>dividend</b> equivalent to the value of the net cash dividend unattractive to some groups of shareholders. It is therefore expected that the take-up of the scrip alternative will be low. This is confirmed by the results of the stud...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{classical and}} modern investment theory, and whether actual observations {{in the oil}} and gas industry coincide with the classical assumptions or if the modern theory more accurately explain observations. Classical investment theory presumes rationality and perfect capital markets, however actualities the recent years imply that the market development is in fact not supported by these assumptions. In {{the oil and gas}} industry, the capital expenditures have peaked over the last decade, as well as the oil price and earnings, while the oil companies' profits and share prices have experience a more moderate trend. This investment theory study provides a systematic review of available literature on classical investment theory and modern investment theory. The review establishes a foundation to investigate whether recent contributions to investment decision theory can enhance quality, further than classical investment theory, to the explanation of later developments in oil and gas investments. Furthermore, the thesis comprises a detailed analysis that focus on five peculiarities. These are accommodated by distinctive and recurring investment patterns observed in the market. First, oil and gas investments respond to short-term oil price change when these investments usually have a long-term horizon, and they retain dividend payouts sacrosanct when cash flows are under pressure. Second, investors are reluctant to raise debt to finance their investment plans, whereas rationality implies indifference about sources from where to collect capital. Further, announcement of cutbacks in investment are met by an increase in share price, a phenomenon that contradicts benchmark models of investment behavior and corporate finance. In addition, shareholders do not wish to receive <b>scrip</b> <b>dividend</b> instead of cash, even when offered a price discount per share that should be considered as “money in the street”. The main finding is that modern contributions to investment theory can in fact provide explanations of the investment behavior in {{the oil and gas industry}} that correspond to a larger extent with the observed pattern, than classical investment theory. All the peculiarities may be explained by recognizing that the oil and gas industry could have been characterized by asymmetric information, agency problems, overconfidence and optimism, miscalibration, empire building and cost overruns. Whereas numerous of the investment decisions made by managers in the oil companies has not increased the firm and shareholder value, which contradicts a central principle in classical investment theory...|$|E
