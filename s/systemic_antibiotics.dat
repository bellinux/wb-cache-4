5|$|Acute cholangitis {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk of death, {{the leading cause}} being irreversible shock with multiple organ failure (a possible complication of severe infections). Improvements in diagnosis and treatment {{have led to a}} reduction in mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%. Patients with signs of multiple organ failure are likely to die unless they undergo early biliary drainage and treatment with <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Other causes of death following severe cholangitis include heart failure and pneumonia.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{can include}} topical steroids to {{diminish}} the inflammation. Antibiotics {{to diminish the}} proportion of aerobic bacteria is still a matter of debate. The use of local antibiotics, preferably local non-absorbed and broad spectrum, covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, can be an option. In some cases, <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> can be helpful, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or moxifloxacin. Vaginal rinsing with povidone iodine can provide relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. Dequalinium chloride can also be an option for treatment.|$|E

50|$|There is {{reasonable}} evidence that taking probiotics containing Lactobacillus species {{may help prevent}} antibiotic-associated diarrhea and that taking probiotics with Saccharomyces (e.g., Saccharomyces boulardii) may help to prevent Clostridium difficile infection following <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> treatment.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} this problem, {{it is imperative}} to apply antiseptics at once. Hydrogen peroxide (a near-universal toxin) is not recommended for this task as it increases inflammation and impedes healing. [...] Dressings with cadexomer iodine, silver, or honey have been shown to penetrate bacterial biofilms. <b>Systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> are not recommended in treating local infection in a pressure ulcer, as it can lead to bacterial resistance. They are only recommended if there is evidence of advancing cellulitis, bony infection, or bacteria in the blood.|$|E
2500|$|The use of <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics,</b> {{including}} (but {{not limited}} to) any penicillin-based antibiotic such as ampicillin, cephalosporins, and clindamycin, causes the normal bacterial flora of the bowel to be altered. In particular, when the antibiotic kills off other competing {{bacteria in the}} intestine, any bacteria remaining will have less competition for space and nutrients. The net effect is to permit more extensive growth than normal of certain bacteria. Clostridium difficile is one such type of bacterium. In addition to proliferating in the bowel, C. difficile also produces toxins. Without either toxin A or toxin B, C. difficile may colonize the gut, but is unlikely to cause pseudomembranous colitis. The colitis associated with severe infection {{is part of an}} inflammatory reaction, with the [...] "pseudomembrane" [...] formed by a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis in severe acute pancreatitis {{in relation to}} outcome. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for RCTs that studied the effectiveness of <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis in severe acute pancreatitis. A meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model. Methodological quality was quantified by a previously published scoring system (range 0 - 17 points). RESULTS: Six studies, {{with a total of}} 397 participants, obtained a methodological score of at least 5 points and were included. <b>Systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis had no significant effect on infection of pancreatic necrosis (absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0. 055; 95 % CI - 0. 084 to 0. 194) and mortality (ARR 0. 058, 95 % CI - 0. 017 to 0. 134). Spearman correlation showed an inverse association between methodological quality and ARR for mortality (correlation coefficient - 0. 841, p = 0. 036). CONCLUSIONS: The inverse relationship between methodological quality and impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on mortality emphasizes the importance of high-quality RCTs.

40|$|Both <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> {{therapy and}} nasal packing are used {{frequently}} in septoplasty. Nevertheless, {{there is still}} great disagreement among authors around the real advantages {{with regard to the}} efficacy of both of these procedures in septal surgery. The aim of the present review was to evaluate the more recent data published on this topic. One appropriate string was run on PubMed to retrieve articles dealing with the topics mentioned above. A double cross-check was performed on citations and full-text articles found using the selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. Overall, the articles we analyzed indicated the poor utility of routine antibiotic therapy and nasal packing during septoplasty, the latter procedure producing more complications than advantages. In conclusion, {{on the basis of the}} recent literature, the use of <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis and nasal packing in septal surgery seems to be a non-rational procedure...|$|R

50|$|The {{treatments}} {{used for}} plaque psoriasis {{can also be}} used for guttate psoriasis. Few studies have specifically focused on guttate psoriasis management, so there is currently no firm guidelines for managing guttate psoriasis differently from plaque psoriasis. Due to the role streptococcal infection plays in the development of guttate psoriasis, <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> have been considered as a potential treatment option. Although <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> may be considered to treat the initial infection at its source, there is no support for their use in the management of subsequent guttate psoriasis itself. The condition often usually clears up on its own within weeks to months, and only about one third of patients will develop chronic plaques.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} series of 30 {{consecutive}} patients with 31 infected total hip arthroplasties treated by a single surgeon over a 4 -year period in whom a shortened post-operative course of antimicrobial chemotherapy was used. The treatment protocol consisted of a two-stage exchange with removal of infected components, insertion of an interim antibiotic eluting cement spacer and re-implantation of an extensively coated uncemented prosthesis on the femoral side. <b>Systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> treatment following each stage consisted of an abridged course of 5 days post-operative intra-venous administration followed by complete cessation of anti-microbial therapy. At a mean follow-up of 35 months (minimum 24 months), there were no cases of recurrent prosthetic infection and no patient had required revision for aseptic loosening or mechanical instability on the femoral side.
