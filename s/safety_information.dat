40|$|This study {{constructs}} {{the network}} diffusion model {{of food safety}} scare behavior under the effect of information transparency and examines the network topology and evolution characteristics of food safety scare behavior in a numerical simulation. The main conclusions {{of this study are}} as follows. (1) Under the effect of information transparency, the network degree distribution of food safety scare behavior diffusion demonstrates the decreasing characteristics of diminishing margins. (2) Food safety scare behavior diffusion increases with the information dissemination rate and consumer concern about food safety incidents and shows the characteristics of monotone increasing. And with the increasing of the government food <b>safety</b> supervision <b>information</b> transparency and media food <b>safety</b> supervision <b>information</b> transparency, the whole is declining characteristic of diminishing marginal. In addition, the extinction of food safety scare behavior cannot be achieved gradually given a single regulation of government food <b>safety</b> supervision <b>information</b> transparency and media food <b>safety</b> supervision <b>information</b> transparency. (3) The interaction effects between improving government food <b>safety</b> supervision <b>information</b> transparency or media food <b>safety</b> supervision <b>information</b> transparency and declining consumer concerns about food <b>safety</b> incidents or <b>information</b> transmission rate can engender the suppression of food safety scare behavior diffusion...|$|R

The research of literature was conducted with the aim to present different defini-tions {{of the concept of}} information. The importance and the role of information for enterprises was defined.

The role and importance of risk management and the estimation of risk in the <b>information</b> <b>safety</b> process was determined and the threats resulting from the use of social networking websites were discussed.

The {{meeting was}} to share knowledge and experiences regarding biosafety, chemical, radiological, and industrial safety {{issues that were}} common to the operations at the three principal biological warfare (BW) laboratories of the U.S. Army. Because of the potential implication of the work conducted at biological warfare laboratories, the conferences were restricted to top level security clearances. Beginning in 1957, these conferences were planned to include non-classified sessions as well as classified sessions to enable broader sharing of biological <b>safety</b> <b>information.</b> It was not until 1964, however, that conferences were held in a government installation not associated with a biological warfare program.|$|E
25|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is the U.S. Federal agency {{responsible}} for conducting research and making recommendations for prevention {{of all kinds of}} occupational injuries and illnesses. Over the past 10 to 15 years, NIOSH has devoted considerable effort to building its capacity for research and prevention activities related to occupational road safety. This has been accomplished through analysis and interpretation of injury and fatality data development of injury prevention resources, and research to advance prevention of MVCs and resulting injuries in high-risk populations. NIOSH seeks to effect change through a variety of mechanisms: communication of research results through the peer-reviewed literature and industry channels, <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> targeted to employers and workers, changes in government regulations, and development of voluntary consensus standards.|$|E

40|$|In the informatization {{process of}} {{construction}} projects, safety management informationization {{tends to be}} neglected. Although injuries and fatalities related accidents occur regularly in construction works, safety management has not attracted enough attention from practitioners in the construction industry. In particular, the research focusing on safety management informationization is relatively immature and hence deserves more efforts. From an owner&# 039;s perspective, this paper first established the design guidelines for developing the <b>safety</b> management <b>information</b> system, and then analysed the key functional modules embedded in the system. Through the investigation of three cases and one national standard, this paper derived the guarantee and general items of the <b>safety</b> management <b>information</b> system. In addition, this paper conducted the business process analysis on typical modules in the <b>safety</b> management <b>information</b> system from the owner&# 039;s viewpoint, and further designed and developed forms to correspond {{to the process of}} safety management, including input forms, audit forms and output forms.

500|$|Other {{than the}} {{contraceptive}} and treatment in emergencies, ponies from the Maryland herd are treated much like other wildlife, with no extra {{attention paid to}} them by Park Service employees. It is thought likely that the Maryland herd carries equine infectious anemia (EIA); they are effectively quarantined, however, by allowing no riding or camping with privately owned horses along the mainland shore during the insect season which stretches from mid-May to October. Due to their treatment as wild animals, ponies from the Maryland herd can be aggressive, {{and there have been}} reports of them tearing down tents and biting, kicking and knocking down visitors. In 2010, after an increase in biting incidents, the National Park Service implemented new measures for educating visitors about the ponies. These measures included new <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> in brochures and recommended viewing distances between the visitors and the ponies. There is also some danger to the ponies from the visitors: ponies have become ill from being fed inappropriate human foods, and on average one Maryland pony a year is killed by a car.
