40|$|The {{existing}} sodium cooled fast reactors (SFR) {{have two}} types of designs – loop type and pool type. In the loop type design, such as JOYO (Japan) [1] and MONJU (Japan), the primary coolant is circulated through intermediate heat exchangers (IHX) external to the reactor tank. The major advantages of loop design include compactness and easy maintenance. The disadvantage is higher possibility of sodium leakage. In the pool type design such as EBR-II (USA), BN- 600 M(Russia), Superphénix (France) and European Fast Reactor [2], the reactor core, primary pumps, IHXs and direct reactor auxiliary cooling system (DRACS) heat exchangers (DHX) all are immersed {{in a pool of}} sodium coolant within the reactor vessel, making a loss of primary coolant extremely unlikely. However, the pool type design makes primary system large. In the latest ANL’s Advanced Burner Test Reactor (ABTR) design [3], the primary system is configured in a pool-type arrangement. The <b>hot</b> <b>sodium</b> at core outlet temperature in hot pool is separated from the cold sodium at core inlet temperature in cold pool by a single integrated structure called Redan.

Influence of SLM pixelation on trap stiffness is observed and can be utilized to design calibrated HOTs more effectively. It is also shown that the <b>HOTs</b> <b>trapping</b> stiffness can vary significantly over short distances. Then we use HOTs cell adhesion assays investigate the viscoelastic and adhesive nature of chondrocytes' pericellular matrix (PCM) at two different time steps (30 minute and 24 hour incubation periods). Surprisingly, no physical influence of the large, presumably gel-like PCM is observed. However, a difference is discerned in the adhesiveness of {{the two sets of}} cells. The early-stage cells have reversible adhesion with negatively-charged and fibronectin-coated microspheres even after they are held at the cell surface for 10 seconds. In contrast, late stage cells stick irreversibly to all types of beads: positive, negative, fibronectin and hyaluronan-coated. Additionally, only the late stage cells produce membrane tethers. These observations suggest that the late-stage chondrocytes have less surface-associated hyaluronan and have interesting implications for the role of hyaluronan {{in the early stages of}} cell adhesion...|$|R
40|$|The European Space Agency’s four-spacecraft Cluster {{mission has}} been observing the Earth’s {{dynamical}} magnetotail region since early 2001. The magnetotail, {{and in particular}} the <b>hot</b> <b>trapped</b> plasma sheet, is a critical region in the coupled Sun-Earth system. Changes in the solar wind have direct influence on the properties and dynamical processes occurring in this region, which in turn directly influence operational near-Earth space, the upper atmosphere, and even induce large-scale currents in the ground. As part of the European Cluster Assimilation Technology (ECLAT) project, a magnetotail plasma region dataset has been produced to facilitate magnetospheric research and further our understanding of the important processes linking the solar wind-magnetospheric-ionospheric system. The dataset consists of a comprehensive list of plasma regions encountered in the nightside magnetosphere of the Earth by each of the four Cluster spacecraft in the years 2001 – 2009. The regions identified are those where major energy transport/conversion processes take place and are important regions for system level science.

40|$|Holographic optical {{tweezers}} (HOTs) enable {{the manipulation of}} multiple traps independently in three dimensions in real time. Application of this technique to force measurements requires calibration of trap stiffness and its position dependence. Here, we determine the <b>trap</b> stiffness of <b>HOTs</b> as they are steered in two dimensions. To do this, we trap a single particle in a multiple-trap configuration and analyze the power spectrum of the laser deflection on a position-sensitive photodiode. With this method, the relative trap strengths can be determined independent of exact particle size, and high stiffnesses can be probed {{because of the high}} bandwidth of the photodiode. We find a trap stiffness for each of three <b>HOT</b> <b>traps</b> of kappa approximately 26 pN/microm per 100 mW of laser power. Importantly, we find that this stiffness remains constant within +/- 4 % over 20 microm displacements of a trap. We also investigate the minimum step size achievable when steering a <b>trap</b> with <b>HOTs,</b> and find that traps can be stepped and detected within approximately 2 nm in our instrument, although there is an underlying position modulation of the traps of comparable scale that arises from SLM addressing. The independence of trap stiffness on steering angle over wide ranges and the nanometer positioning accuracy of HOTs demonstrate the applicability of this technique to quantitative study of force response of extended biomaterials such as cells or elastomeric protein network...|$|R
50|$|The target facility, {{which holds}} the {{inventory}} of about 10 m3 of Li, forms and conditions the beam target. The Li screen fulfills two main functions: to react with the deuterons to generate a stable neutron flux in the forward direction and to dissipate the beam power in a continuous manner. The flowing Li (15 m/s; 250 °C) is shaped and accelerated in {{the proximity of the}} beam interaction region by a two-stage reducer nozzle forming a concave jet of 25 mm thickness with a minimum radius of curvature of 250 mm in the beam footprint area. The resulting centrifugal pressure raises the boiling point of the flowing Li and thus ensures a stable liquid phase. The beam power absorbed by the Li is evacuated by the heat removal system and the lithium is cooled to 250 °C by a serial of heat exchangers. The control of impurities, essential for the quality of the liquid screen, will be done through a tailored design of cold and <b>hot</b> <b>trap</b> systems, and purities of Li during operation better than 99.9% are expected. On-line monitoring of impurities will detect impurity levels over 50 ppm.

Simulations with and without the hot plasma show different flow properties; the formation of electrostatic shocks occur only in the former case. The simulation with the hot plasma also reveals that the magnetic trapping {{in conjunction with the}} evolution of the electrostatic potential barrier produces ion velocity distribution functions consisting of a cold core and a hot ring in the perpendicular velocity.
