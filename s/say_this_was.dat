Heller flew {{north of the}} Yalu River in search of MiG formations. Heller and Overton both shot down aircraft, some sources <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> one of Overton's first five victories, while others say they were his sixth and seventh, for which he never received credit, but Heller {{was struck by a}} MiG and crashed. He was either 60 or 150 miles north of the Yalu River line, so a rescue attempt was not made. This was later seen as one of the reasons Overton was singled out for reprimand for crossing the Yalu River. Most sources attribute Overton with only five victories.|$|E

25|$|Marlon Brando was {{the first}} to bring a natural {{approach}} to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable. Critics would later <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.|$|E

25|$|Metro is {{publicly}} owned, receiving {{funding from}} council tax payers and government. Nexus, which owns and manages Metro, contracted out operations and train maintenance {{as part of}} a deal with the UK Government to secure modernisation investment and operating subsidy for the system between 2010 and 2021. Nexus continued to set fares, set frequency of services and Metro operating hours. Opponents <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> privatisation by the back door, though some services had already been contracted out, such as cleaning of stations and ticket inspections. On 3 November 2008, Nexus invited potential bidders to declare an interest in a contract to run the operations side of the business on its behalf. The successful bidder was to obtain a seven-year contract commencing on 1 April 2010, with up to an additional two years depending on performance. In February 2009 four bids were shortlisted; DB Regio, MTR Corporation, Serco-Abellio, and an in-house bid by Metro. By October 2009 the shortlist had been reduced to bids from DB Regio and Nexus. In December 2009, DB Regio was named as the preferred bidder. The contract for operating the system was signed on 2 February 2010, and the service was handed over to DB Regio on 1 April 2010.|$|E

[...] The north-central constituency boundaries radiated out from Edmonton and some <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a case of gerrymandered electoral boundaries. Rutherford emerged from the March 1909 election leading another formidable majority, that clearly reflected the broad popular support he and his government enjoyed. He would resign as premier 14 months later, in May 1910, after his government was implicated in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal.|$|E

McCarthy died at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. His death certificate listed the cause of death as [...] "Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown".

Details of his mission (what letters he was carrying, and to whom) are not known.|$|E

The idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer, who wanted to make an episode in which Homer becomes addicted to medicinal marijuana. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean thought that the premise sounded [...] "very funny" [...] and assigned Vitti to write the episode's first draft. Vitti wrote the script at his home and {{did not participate in}} any rewriting sessions with the other staff writers. [...] " [...] it's a funny bunch of people", he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "You definitely lose touch with what the movies you're supposed to see, what's good on TV..." [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] is the second episode Vitti wrote in which a character forgets to vote at an election, and the second episode he wrote in which Homer takes a chemical that causes him to be promoted by Burns and run into conflict with Smithers. [...] "You can't do anything {{for the first time at}} this point", Vitti quipped. Producer and former showrunner Mike Reiss has stated that he thoroughly enjoyed working on [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".

On 12 September 2008, Pietermaritzburg Judge Chris Nicholson held that Zuma's corruption charges were unlawful on procedural grounds {{in that the}} National Directorate of Public Prosecutions ("NDPP") did not give Zuma {{a chance to make}} representations before deciding to charge him (this is a requirement of the South Africa Constitution), and directed the state to pay legal costs.

It remained competent for the NDPP to recharge Zuma, however, only once he had been given an opportunity to make representations to the NDPP in respect of the NDPP's decision to do so.

2500|$|Codenamed [...] "Erika", {{the third}} {{generation}} Escort was launched in September 1980. The car, Ford Europe's second front-wheel drive model, was originally meant {{to be called the}} [...] "Ford Erika", but ended up retaining the Escort name. Some <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to British consumers reluctance {{to let go of the}} [...] "Escort" [...] badge (as the first two generations of Escort had been among Britain's most popular cars, with the Mk II being Britain's best selling car in 1976), and some say that the Germans were concerned with the song Erika, which was a famous battlemarch of the German armed forces during World War II. The North American Escort introduced at this time was a distantly related derivative. Sales in the United Kingdom increased, and by 1982 it had overtaken the ageing Cortina as the nation's best-selling car, beginning an eight-year run as Britain's best selling car. Unlike the Mark II, which had essentially been a reskin of the original 1968 platform, the Mark III was a completely new [...] "wheels-up" [...] design, and was conceived as a hi-tech, high-efficiency vehicle which would compete with the Volkswagen Golf and Honda Civic – considered at the time the class benchmarks, and indeed the car was launched with the advertising tagline [...] "Simple is Efficient". The Mark III was a departure from the two previous models, the biggest changes being the adoption of front-wheel drive, and the new hatchback body. It was Ford Europe's second front-wheel drive model launch, the first being the smaller Fiesta in 1976, while the hatchback bodystyle had debuted in the company's range in 1974 on the second generation Capri.|$|E
