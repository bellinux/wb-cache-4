40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{options for}} vehicle antennas {{to be used}} in mobile satellite communications systems. Two types of antennas are identified. A non-steerable, azimuthally omnidirectional antenna with a modest gain of 3 to 5 dBi is suggested when a low cost is desired. Alternatively, mechanically or electronically <b>steerable</b> <b>antennas</b> with a higher gain of 10 to 12 dBi are suggested to alleviate power and spectrum scarcity associated with mobile satellite communications. For <b>steerable</b> <b>antennas,</b> both open-loop and closed-loop pointing schemes are discussed. Monopulse and sequential lobing are proposed for the mechanically steered and electronically steered antennas, respectively. This paper suggests a hybrid open-loop/closed-loop pointing technique as the best performer in the mobile satellite environment...|$|R

30|$|A Q-D channel {{model and}} a link level-focused model were introduced. The two models follow {{different}} approaches.
