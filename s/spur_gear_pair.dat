40|$|Under driving conditions, {{a typical}} geared {{system may be}} {{subjected}} to large dynamic loads. Also, the vibration level of the geared system {{is directly related to}} the noise radiated from the gear box. The steady state dynamic behavior of the system is examined in order to design reliable and quiet transmissions. The scope is limited to a system containing a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> with backlash and periodically time varying mesh stiffness, and rolling element bearings with clearance type nonlinearities. The internal static transmission error at the gear mesh, which is of importance from high frequency noise and vibration control view point, is considered in the formulation in sinusoidal or periodic form. A dynamic finite element model of the linear time invariant (LTI) system is developed. Effects of several system parameters, such as torsional and transverse flexibilities of the shafts and prime mover/load inertias, on free and forced vibration characteristics are investigated. Several reduced order LTI models are developed and validated by comparing their eigen solutions with the finite element model results. Using the reduced order formulations, a three degree of freedom dynamic model is developed which includes nonlinearities associated with radical clearances in the radial rolling element bearings, backlash between a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> and periodically varying gear mesh stiffness. As a limiting case, a single degree of freedom model of the <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> with backlash is considered and mathematical conditions for tooth separation and back collision are defined.

Thus, a mechanical system exhibiting combined parametric excitation and clearance type nonlinearity is examined by means of numerical integrations and continuation methods {{in an effort to}} explain its complex behaviour, as it is commonly observed in the steady state forced response of rotating machines. The specific case of a preloaded mechanical oscillator having a periodically time varying stiffness function and subject to a symmetric backlash condition is considered.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} study, a comprehensive spur gear lubrication analysis {{has been carried out}} to understand the gear contact behaviour under lubrication conditions. The modelling works have been extended to consider the effects of thermal mechanical, non-Newtonian fluid, surface roughness, transient squeeze and dynamic load conditions. First, the elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory is studied and relevant numerical approaches are introduced. The reduced Reynolds equation technique is applied to deal with any potential "asperity contacts" or any other ultra-thin film situations. Those situations could be a result of the surface roughness or the dynamic load effect. This approach allows us to capture local information about pressure, traction, film thickness, etc., within the nominal contact zone. Influence of working conditions, i. e. load, rolling speed, as well as the sliding to roll ratio are discussed with those models (Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluids, isothermal or thermal conditions). The non-Newtonian fluid effect has been investigated with a Ree-Eyring fluid model and a power-law fluid model and the thermal effect is studied by solving energy equations of interacting solids and the film numerically with the sequential sweeping technique. The dynamic effect on contact performance is also studied. The dynamic load is calculated using a two degree-of-freedom lumped parameter system dynamic model in which the varying mesh stiffness is considered as the excitation. The dynamic model is solved using the Runge-Kutta method. The effects of the dynamic load effect on pressure distribution and film thickness in a whole mesh period are discussed. The normal contact stiffness of a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> is also predicted based on the deterministic tribology models. The main contributions from {{the present research}} could be summarized as follows: i. An elastohydrodynamic lubrication model for a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> is developed by taking into account the effects of transient squeeze, the non-Newtonian fluid, the rough surface and the thermal mechanical contacts which makes the proposed model one of the most advanced models currently evaluating gear lubrication performance. This model can also be applied to bearings, cams, or other gear types with some modifications. ii. The friction behaviour, which is not investigated as extensively as the film thickness in existing work, is studied. The effects of the working conditions (the load, the rolling speed, the slide/roll ratio), the non-Newtonian conditions, the rough surface conditions, as well as the thermal conditions on friction behaviour are discussed. The conclusions suggest controlling surface topography patterns and working conditions aiming at a reduced friction coefficient and a longer service life. iii. The dynamic effect on lubrication performance and effect of lubrication on normal contact stiffness of a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> are studied. The work provides a potential gateway for a more comprehensive evaluation of <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> working performance using a tribology-dynamic coupled method which is the next area this author would like to explore...|$|E

40|$|The {{lubrication}} regime in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> is usually elasto-hydrodynamic, i. e. solid deformations {{due to the}} fluid pressure are not negligible. It {{is well known that}} lubrication in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> depends upon a number of kinematical parameters, so that it is a non stationary EHD problem. Moreover, it depends upon the dynamic response (i. e. the dynamic load) of the <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> [1 - 5]. The problem of finding the dynamic response in <b>gear</b> systems, especially <b>spur</b> <b>gears,</b> has been studied by many research works. Most of them consider as the main source of vibration the time variation of the number of teeth pairs that are in contact at the same time. This fluctuation makes the transmission more stiff, when two pair of teeth are in contact, more deformable when only one pair is in contact. This behaviour can cause oscillations of the gears, and eventually detachment of the teeth in contact, with impacts and noise. The purpose of the present work is to investigate the effect of the varying rotational velocity of the <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> on the film thickness and the contact pressure distribution.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 07 / 10 / 2010. The gear noise problem that widely occurs in power transmission systems is typically characterised {{by one or more}} high amplitude acoustic signals. The noise originates from the vibration of the gear pair system caused by transmission error excitation that arises from tooth profile errors, misalignment and tooth deflections. This work aims to further research the effect of tooth profile modifications on the transmission error of gear pairs. A <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> was modelled using finite elements, and the gear mesh was simulated and analysed under static conditions. The results obtained were used to study the effect of intentional tooth profile modifications on the transmission error of the gear pair. A detailed parametric study, involving development of an optimisation algorithm to design the tooth modifications, was performed to quantify the changes in the transmission error as a function of tooth profile modification parameters as compared to an unmodified gear pair baseline. The work also investigates the main differences between the static and dynamic transmission error generated during the meshing of a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> model.

In this paper, a developed computer program is introduced to analyze dynamic behavior of <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> with asymmetric teeth that have a potential use for higher performance in wind turbine gearboxes. This program can be used to compare conventional <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> with symmetric teeth and <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> with asymmetric teeth. By using this program, gear designers can design a <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> and obtain results, e. g dynamic Load, transmitted torque, static transmission error, and frequency spectra of static transmission error etc., just by pressing a command button...|$|R
