To alleviate the credit crunch faced by small businesses, the program provided 30 trillion yen of loan guarantees which was more than 10 % of total small business loans outstanding.

We evidence an increase of long-term loans ratio and profitability among existing program users. It is consistent more with the relaxing borrowing constraint hypothesis than with moral hazard. To evaluate the <b>special</b> <b>guarantee</b> program, we need to compare this positive effect with the default cost of guarantee users. 2 1...|$|R

Newcastle disease has been eradicated in most countries, but in developing countries occasional outbreaks occur and are mandatory reported to OIE. Development of new technologies in production of eggs of <b>special,</b> <b>guaranteed</b> quality by using hens housed in free ranges is becoming very popular trend in our country (Pavlovski et al., 2010). In order to further develop such practice our country must be free of ND. The latest notifaction of ND in Serbia and Belgrade, was in the period from 2006 to 2007. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) caused sporadic outbreaks among non-vaccinated domestic fowl (backyard chickens). The comparative serological data prior to the outbreak (in one district) has shown high titers in unvaccinated backyard flocks. This finding suggested that the virus was not dormant. The distribution of the high antibody titers tends to suggest close contact with infected birds and/or other means of virus transmission tha...|$|R
