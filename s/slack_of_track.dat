40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the idea of}} managing the comprising computations of an application performed by an embedded networked system. An efficient algorithm for exploiting the timing <b>slack</b> <b>of</b> building blocks of the application is proposed. The <b>slack</b> <b>of</b> blocks can be utilized by replacing them with slower but cheaper, i. e. better, modules and by assigning the computations to the proper resources. Thus, our approach manages the comprising computations and system resources and can indirectly assist the realtime scheduling of computations on system resources. This is performed without compromising the timing constraints of the application {{and can lead to}} significant improvements in power dissipation, computation accuracy or other metrics of the application domain. Our algorithm is well-suited for arbitrary tree computations. Moreover, it delivers solutions that are desirably close to the optimal solution. Experimental results for a number <b>of</b> object <b>tracking</b> applications implemented in an networked system with embedded computation resources, exhibit a significant amount <b>of</b> <b>slack</b> utilization...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the online competitiveness for scheduling a single resource non-preemptively {{in order to}} maximize its utilization. The <b>slack</b> <b>of</b> a job is equal to the gap between its release time and the last possible time at which it may be started while still meeting its deadline. When no restrictions are placed on either the length or <b>slack</b> <b>of</b> any job, previous lower bounds show that no algorithm, deterministic or randomized, can guarantee any constant bound on the competitiveness of a resulting schedule. We examine a natural restriction in which each job must o#er slack at least proportional to the job's processing time. Specifically, we will say that a problem instance has patience #, if any job of length #J# has a <b>slack</b> <b>of</b> at least # #J#. We show that for any # > 0 a simple greedy algorithm is (2 + 1 #) - competitive even when arbitrary job lengths are allowed. We give lower bounds showing that this is the best possible result for a deterministic algorithm even if all jobs have [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Factors {{of delay}} {{variation}} such as process variation and noise effects may cause a manufactured chip {{to violate the}} pre-specified timing constraint. Traditional methods add a pessimistic timing margin to alleviate delay variation problems. In this thesis, we propose a re-synthesis technique to tolerate delay variation for domino circuits. Note that <b>slacks</b> <b>of</b> nodes along critical paths is zero; any delay addition to those zero-slack nodes will worsen the final performance of a circuit. Our basic idea is to increase <b>slacks</b> <b>of</b> nodes in the critical region by appending a redundant auxiliary sub-circuit to the original circuit. The auxiliary sub-circuit can cause critical paths to become false paths or imperceptible paths [8] so as to improve the capability of delay variation tolerance. Experimental results are very encouraging...|$|R
40|$|Several {{factors such}} as process {{variation}}, noises, and delay defects can degrade the reliabilities of a circuit. Traditional methods add a pessimistic timing margin to resolve delay variation problems. In this paper, instead of sacrificing the performance, we propose a re-synthesis technique which adds redundant logics to protect the performance. Because nodes in the critical paths have zero slacks and are vulnerable to delay variation, we formulate the problem of tolerating delay variation to be the problem <b>of</b> increasing the <b>slacks</b> <b>of</b> nodes. Our re-synthesis technique can increase the <b>slacks</b> <b>of</b> all nodes or wires to be larger than a pre-determined value. Our experimental results show that additional area penalty is around 21 % for 10 % of delay variation tolerance...|$|R
