40|$|AbstractLet φ be a generically surjective {{morphism}} between direct sums of line bundles on Pn {{and assume}} that the degeneracy locus, X, of φ has the expected codimension. We call Bφ=kerφ a (first) Buchsbaum–Rim sheaf and we call X a standard determinantal scheme. Viewing φ as a matrix (after choosing bases), we say that X is good if one can delete a generalized row from φ and have the maximal minors of the resulting submatrix define a scheme of the expected codimension. In this paper we give several characterizations of good determinantal schemes. In particular, it is shown that being a good determinantal scheme of codimension r+ 1 is equivalent to being the zero-locus of a regular section of the dual of a first Buchsbaum–Rim sheaf of rank r+ 1. It is also equivalent to being standard determinantal and locally a complete intersection outside a subscheme Y⊂X of codimension r+ 2. Furthermore, for any good determinantal subscheme X of codimension r+ 1 {{there is a good}} determinantal subscheme S codimension r such that X <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>S</b> <b>in</b> a nice way.

40|$|International audienceWe {{discuss the}} {{possible}} existence a spin singlet excitation with charge ± 2 (η-mode) originating the A 1 g Raman resonance in cuprate superconductors. This η-mode relates the d-wave superconducting singlet pairing channel to a d-wave charge channel. We {{show that the}} η boson forms a particle-particle bound state below the 2 ∆ threshold of the particle-hole continuum where ∆ is the maximum d-wave gap. Within a generalized random phase approximation and Bethe-Salpether approximation study, we find that this mode has energies similar to the resonance observed by Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) below the superconducting (SC) coherent peak at 2 ∆ in various SC cuprates compounds. We show {{that it is a}} very good candidate for the resonance observed in Raman scattering below the 2 ∆ peak in the A 1 g symmetry. Since the η-mode <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> the <b>S</b> = 0 channel, it may be observable via Raman, X-ray or Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy probes...|$|R

40|$|The {{sequence}} of a Drosophila melanogaster cDNA encoding a novel 35 kDa protein serine/threonine phosphatase, termed PPV, is presented. PPV is 40 - 41 % identical to Drosophila PP 1, 53 % identical to Drosophila PP 2 A and 63 % identical to Saccharomyces cerevisiae SIT 4. Complementation studies demonstrated that PPV can functionally rescue a temperature sensitive mutant of SIT 4, a protein phosphatase {{required for the}} G 1 to S transition of the cell cycle. When placed under the SIT 4 promoter, PPV cDNA is able to replace the <b>SIT</b> 4 gene <b>in</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae. The amino-terminal domain of PPV fused to another phosphatase catalytic region (PP 1) also rescues the temperature sensitive SIT 4 mutant and the SIT 4 deletion mutant, implicating this region in binding to regulatory subunits and/or altering specificity. In Drosophila, a substantial transient increase in both PPV mRNA and protein occurs in late syncytial and early cellular blastoderm embryos. At the latter stage PPV is localized to the cytoplasm of cells at the cortex. This increase in PPV correlates with introduction of the G 2 phase of the cell cycle, elevated zygotic transcription and cellularization, indicating that PPV {{may play a role}} in one or more of these processes...|$|R
