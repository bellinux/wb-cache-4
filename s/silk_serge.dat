5|$|The {{first of}} the Navy uniforms were made in dark blue, but with the Southern style of rank {{insignia}} for the officers. The 1862 Confederate regulations ordered the uniform to be steel gray and lined with a dark black <b>silk</b> <b>serge.</b> They were also made in medium gray and cadet gray. They were made of wool, and these uniforms were not fit for {{the heat of the}} lower decks of a ship. Non-commissioned officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing.|$|E
50|$|The fabric {{went out}} of fashion when {{completely}} smooth-surfaced materials became popular. Piqu√©, coachman's whipcord, diagonal serge, and surah are similar to bengaline silk. Surah was once known in France as <b>silk</b> <b>serge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The name {{is derived}} from Old French , itself from Latin , from Greek [...] (serikos), meaning [...] "silken". The early {{association}} of <b>silk</b> <b>serge,</b> Greece, and France is shown by the discovery in Charlemagne's tomb {{of a piece of}} <b>silk</b> <b>serge</b> dyed with Byzantine motifs, evidently a gift from the Byzantine Imperial Court in the 8th or 9th century AD. It also appears to refer to a form of silk twill produced in the early renaissance in or around Florence, used for clerical cassocks. A reference can be found in Don Quixote: [...] "I am more pleased to have found it than anyone had given me a Cassock of the best Florentine serge" [...] (The Curate, Book I, Chapter VI).|$|E

60|$|But to proceed; I observ'd several kind of hairs {{that had}} been Dyed, and {{found them to be}} a kind of horny Cylinder, being of much about the {{transparency}} of a pretty cleer piece of Oxe horn; these appear'd quite throughout ting'd with the colours they exhibited. And 'tis likely, that those hairs being boyl'd or steep'd in those very hot ting'd liquors in the Dye-fat, And the substance of the hair being much like that of an Oxes Horn, the penetrant liquor does so far mollifie and soften the substance, that it sinks into the very center of it, and so the ting'd parts come to be mix'd and united with the very body of the hair, and do not (as some have thought) only stick on upon the outward surface. And this, the boiling of Horn will make more probable; for we shall find by that action, that the water will insinuate it self to a pretty depth within the surface of it, especially if this penetrancy of the water be much helped by the Salts that are usually mix'd with the Dying liquors. Now, whereas Silk may be dyed or ting'd into all kind of colours without boiling or dipping into hot liquors, I ghess the reason to be two-fold: First, because the filaments, or small cylinders of Silk, are abundantly smaller and finer, and so have a much less depth to be penetrated then most kind of hairs; and next, because the substance or matter of Silk, is much more like a Glew then the substance of Hair is. And that I have reason to suppose: First, because when it is spun or drawn out of the Worm, it is a perfect glutinous substance, and very easily sticks and cleaves to any adjacent body, as I have several times observed, both in Silk-worms and Spiders. Next, because that I find that water does easily dissolve and mollifie the substance again, which is evident from their manner of ordering those bottoms or pods of the Silk-worm before they are able to unwind them. It is no great wonder therefore, if those Dyes or ting'd liquors do very quickly mollifie and tinge the surfaces of so small and so glutinous a body. And we need not wonder that the colours appear so lovely in the one, and so dull in the other, if we view but the ting'd cylinders of both kinds with a good Microscope; for whereas the substance of Hair, at best, is but a dirty duskish white somewhat transparent, the filaments of Silk have a most lovely transparency and cleerness, the difference between those two being not much less then that between a piece of Horn, and a piece of Crystal; the one yielding a bright and vivid reflection from the concave side of the cylinder, that is, from the concave surface of the Air that incompasses the back-part of the cylinder; the other yielding a dull and perturb'd reflection from the several Heterogeneous parts that compose it. And this difference will be manifest enough to the eye, if you get a couple of small Cylinders, the smaller of Crystal Glass, the other of Horn, and then varnishing them over very thinly with some transparent colour, which will represent to the naked eye much the same kind of object which is represented to it from the filaments of Silk and Hair by the help of the Microscope. Now, since the threads of <b>Silk</b> and <b>Serge</b> are made up of a great number of these filaments, we may henceforth cease to wonder at the difference. From much the same reason proceeds the vivid and lovely colours of Feathers, wherein they very farr exceed the natural as well as Artificial colours of hair, of which I shall say more in its proper place.|$|R
50|$|Serge {{is a type}} of {{twill fabric}} that has {{diagonal}} lines or ridges on both sides, made with a two-up, two-down weave. The worsted variety is used in making military uniforms, suits, great coats and trench coats. Its counterpart, <b>silk</b> <b>serge,</b> is used for linings. French serge is a softer, finer variety. The word is also used for a high quality woolen woven fabric.|$|E

50|$|The {{midshipman}} uniforms {{followed the}} CS Navy uniform regulations issued after 1862, requiring the uniform to be steel grey in color, lined with dark black <b>silk</b> <b>serge.</b> The jackets were coarse gray cloth material, {{and made of}} wool. The sleeves of midshipmen, like all officers, had three sleeve buttons mounted vertically. In lieu of stripe, mishipman had three small buttons with fouled anchors, and passed midshipmen had three large buttons with fouled anchors mounted horizontally. A midshipman had no shoulder strap, while a passed midshipman had a strip of gold lace four inches long and half an inch wide. The covers of both ranks of midshipman were also steel gray and contained only a horizontal gold officers band with a fouled anchor, and a black leather visor.|$|E
5000|$|Handsome suits of fine foulard, pongee, and <b>silk</b> <b>serge,</b> {{are simply}} trimmed with plain bias bands, closely fitting sleeves, and basque waist, or Polonaise; over this a linen Polonaise is worn as a protection, closely buttoned, and trimmed simply with side plaitings, and a Gabrielle front, {{with three or}} four deep box-plaits at the back. This style of linen Polonaise can be looped up and worn over a {{corresponding}} linen skirt also. ... Overskirts to the dress, or the Polonaise skirt, must be very long and only looped up at the sides....Cretonne costumes are the novelty of the season: they were introduced last year at French watering places, and a few have been imported here this season. They are intended for country wear only, and are made of the chintz figured cretonnes used for upholstering furniture; the grounds are black, brown, green, blue, buff, with large brilliant colored flowers and figures. They are made with a ruffled skirt and Polonaise, caught up by large bows of black velvet. These costumes certainly carry us {{back to the days of}} our grandmothers, and will, we fear, meet with but little favor for a season; but if fashion decrees, there will always be some to follow her mandate.|$|E
