We describe the geomorphological character and sediment transport processes along IRES within the context of four geomorphological zones—upland, piedmont, lowland, and floodout—to illustrate the underpinning longitudinal trends of sediment production, transfer, and deposition that exist at the landscape scale. Many geomorphological features of IRES tend to be spatially discontinuous as a result of extended no or low-flow conditions that are punctuated by high-magnitude flood events.

40|$|Connectivity {{describes}} the transport between sediment {{sources and sinks}} in fluvial networks, defining source-sink relations in the domains of sediment flux, delivery times, and supplied grain sizes. Connectivity embalms both sediment deliveries to individual reaches and <b>sediment</b> transport <b>regimes</b> on the network scale, and is a central driver behind fluvial biotic and abiotic processes, and related ecosystem services. Yet, river basin management is missing quantitative tools for studying connectivity in larger fluvial networks. With the CASCADE (Catchment Sediment Connectivity and Delivery) model we recently introduced a framework that quantifies sediment deliveries from each sediment source to all the connected sinks as individual cascading processes. This allows quantifying all domains of sediment connectivity at the reach scale as well as analyzing the resulting network-scale <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes.</b> CASCADE is applicable also for very large and poorly monitored river networks. We implement CASCADE for a large river network (7500 km) in SE Asia and quantify all domains of connectivity for all reaches in the network. We derive some relevant river morphological features for a subset of reaches in the network from high resolution satellite imagery and find significant links between observed forms and sediment connectivity information derived from CASCADE. CASCADE opens up novel opportunities to clarify the link between network scale <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes</b> and local morphologic processes and forms.

In reservoir management schedules this requirement should be integrated with sedimentation control and human water supply. However, traditional eco-friendly reservoir operating methods have usually only considered the natural flow regime. This paper seeks to develop a reservoir operating method that accounts for both the natural flow and <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes</b> as well as optimizing the water supply allocations. Herein, reservoir water level (RWL), sediment-occupied ratio of reservoir volume (SOR) and rate of change of SOR (RCSOR) are adopted as three triggers of a drawdown-flushing-based sediment management policy. Two different groups of reservoir operating rule curves (RORCs) are designed for sediment-flushing and non-sediment-flushing years, and the three triggers, RWL, SOR and RCSOR, are used to change the “static” RORCs to “dynamic” ones.

Observations are based on 31 sites distributed over the Alps and their piedmont, that cover 129 km of river length, {{that is to say}} about 20 % of the present-day alpine braided network. For each site, the merging of the present-day long profile (obtained from 2009 terrestrial topographic surveys) with the historical long profile of the "Grandes Forces Hydrauliques" (surveyed between 1894 and 1931 depending on sites) allows reconstructing elevation changes of the water surface at low-flow during the period. Results show that 56 % of the river length is in degradation, 20 % in aggradation, and 24 % stable. The spatial variability of channel responses shows that the most active braided channels are preferentially conserved in the Southern Alps. Statistical links are clearly established between historical elevation changes and forcings of the sediment budget (gravel mining, sediment supply from torrents and lateral shiftening of river channels).

Temperature increased and precipitation decreased with {{the reduction in}} rainfall being relatively higher during the rainy season. A shift towards an earlier onset of first rains during summer was also found with cascading effects on hydrology (hydrological regimes, vegetation, etc.) and thus on erosion and sediment yield. During the 1980 s, the flow regime shifted from perennial to intermittent with an amplification of the variations of discharge and a modification of the <b>sediment</b> <b>regime</b> with higher and more irregular suspended particulate flux. Sediment flux was shown to almost double every decade from the 1970 s to the 2000 s.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{protection}} of water quality {{and the maintenance of}} productive anadromous fisheries is a primary concern in the Pacific Northwest. Excessive suspended sediment loads is a principle water quality problem on small wildland watersheds in this region (Anderson, 1971; Brown, 1972). Man's activities have been shown to increase sedimentation rates in some cases (Burns, 1970; Megahan, 1972). However, {{more research is needed to}} define the basic sedimentation processes and factors before adequate assessments of man's impacts can be determined on a broad basis. This paper presents the results of a study of the suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes</b> for two small mountain watersheds located in Oregon's Coast Range. Suspended sediment concentrations in these kinds of watersheds are typically variable over short time spans. In- channel sources of fine sediment, particularly sediment stored in the bed gravels of armored stream segments, may be a major factor influencing the <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes</b> of these watersheds. A The primary objective of the study was to characterize the temporal variability in suspended sediment concentration on the two watersheds. In addition, nephelometric and gravimetric sampling procedures and the potential contributions of in-channel sources of suspended sediment were evaluated on the Oak Creek watershed. The temporal variability in suspended sediment concentration during storm events and on a seasonal basis was determined using intensive automatic and manual sampling procedures. Sieve analysis of bed material composition and channel profile measurements were utilized to define the potential availability of suspendable material within the channel systems. It was found that : (1) Stream bed gravels are a significant potential source area of suspendable material. (2) A decline in the suspended sediment concentration in the stream channel at a given flow occurs during the falling stage of individual runoff events and with successive events over the winter runoff season. This phenomenon can best be described as a flushing process, where the depletion of suspendable sediments may be associated with the successive release and capture of fine material by the bed armor layer. (3) Sampling of sediment concentration did not appear to be significantly influenced by horizontal concentration gradients. However, vertical concentration gradients, particularly in the transition zone between suspended load and bed load, did prove to be significant. (4) Basic soils and geomorphic parameters provided useful indexes for comparing the <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes</b> of these watersheds...|$|R
40|$|Predicting the {{evolution}} of gravel bed river morphology and in-channel habitat over decadal to centennial timescales is integral to making informed stream management and restoration decisions. Due to these longer timescales of change, fieldbased studies are often unable to fully capture morphologic shifts. Scenario-based morphodynamic modeling {{has emerged as a}} viable means of quantifying gravel bed river evolution, yet current models fall short with regard to their ability to predict changes in stream morphology over the timescales in question and with adequate spatial resolution, a problem due largely to the computational overhead they require. While the computing power required to quantify sediment transport has hindered previous modeling efforts, field-based research suggests a potential improvement: sediment is often mobilized downstream with characteristic step-lengths. Here we introduce a morphodynamic model which drives sediment transport using a steplength based approach, negating the need for frequent recalculation of sediment dynamics in the flow, and correspondingly reducing computational overhead. Upon application of this model to a study reach along the River Feshie (UK), we observe that it accurately reproduces many bed morphologies observed over an eight-year study involving annual RTK-GPS and terrestrial lidar surveys. Subsequently, we utilize this new model to quantify morphologic outcomes under various discharge and <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes.</b> By utilizing simple step-length based sediment transport distributions, {{the evolution}} of bed topography can be accurately modeled with less computational overhead than previously possible. The knowledge gained from such scenario-based modeling may aid in the management and restoration of gravel bed streams under shifting discharge and <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Inshore turbid reefs on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) {{are exposed}} to high and {{fluctuating}} sediment loads normally associated with poor reef growth, but many have high coral cover (> 30 %) and diversity (> 50 species). Previous assessments of <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes</b> on these reefs have largely relied on sediment trap data, which overestimate sedimentation rates and may not accurately reflect sedimentary conditions. A new approach, based on paired sediment trays, is described here that allows the sedimentation rate, sediment resuspension, and total mass of mobile sediments transported on to and off of a site per unit time and area (termed the two-way total sediment flux) to be measured or calculated. The sediment trays were deployed on Middle Reef and Paluma Shoals, two inshore turbid reefs on the GBR where the two-way total sediment flux ranged from 34 g/m²/d in protected reef habitats to more than 640 g/m²/d in higher-energy settings. Mean sedimentation rates, calculated using data from four sites across these reefs, of less than 122 g/m²/d are considerably lower than published rates estimated for nearby coral reefs, largely because sediment traps limit sediment resuspension. At each tray installation, sediments were collected every 4 to 6 weeks to measure variations in net sedimentation through the year, and resuspension rates were calculated by comparing 100 g of preanalysed sediments placed on trays at deployment to sediments recovered 2 weeks later. These data demonstrate that despite high sediment delivery rates, net sedimentation may still be relatively low and potentially less {{of a threat to}} benthic communities on turbid reefs than previously assumed.

40|$|Sediment plays {{a pivotal}} role in {{determining}} the physical, chemical and biological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. A range of factors influences the impacts of sediment pressures on aquatic biota, including concentration, duration of exposure, composition and particle size. In recognition of the need to assess environmental status for sediment and mitigate excessive sediment pressures on aquatic habitats, both water column and river substrate metrics have been proposed as river sediment targets. Water column metrics include light penetration, turbidity, sediment concentration summary statistics and <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes.</b> Substrate metrics include embeddedness, the fredle index and riffle stability. Identification of meaningful numeric targets along these lines has, however, been undermined by various issues including the uncertainty associated with toxicological dose-response profiles and the impracticalities of deploying statistically robust sampling strategies capable of supporting catchment-scale targets. Many of the thresholds reported are based on correlative relationships that fail to capture the specific mechanisms controlling sediment impacts on aquatic habitats and are stationary in nature. Temporal windows represented by the key life stages of specific species must be given greater emphasis. Given such issues and the need to support the revision of sediment targets for river catchment management, it is proposed that greater emphasis should be placed on developing generic modelling toolkits with the functionality for coupling current or future projected <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes</b> with biological response for a range of biota. Such tools should permit the identification of river catchment-specific targets within a national context, based on biological effect and incorporate sufficient flexibility for utilizing updated physical, chemical, biological and catchment attribute data.

40|$|Sedimentation is an {{important}} stressor on coral reefs subjected to run-off, dredging and resuspension events. Reefs {{with a history of}} high-sediment loads tend to be dominated by a few tolerant coral species. A key question is whether such species live close to their tolerance thresholds or near their niche optima. Here, we analyse experimentally the sediment tolerance of a spatially dominant coral, Turbinaria mesenterina (Dendrophylliidae), at nearshore reefs in the central Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Testing was conducted in a 5 -week tank experiment under manipulated sediment loading and flow conditions. Physiological stress was assessed based on the behaviour of three key response variables: skeletal growth rate, energy reserves (lipid content) and photosynthetic performance. Because sediment effects are likely to vary between flow <b>regimes,</b> <b>sediment</b> and flow responses were tested using a full factorial design. Sediment loads greater than 110 mg cm− 2 had no effect on any of the physiological variables, regardless of flow (0. 7 – 24 cm s− 1). Turbinaria mesenterina is thus tolerant to sediment loads an order of magnitude higher than most severe sediment conditions in situ. Likely mechanisms for such tolerance are that: (1) colonies covered in sediment (60 – 120 μm) in low-flow were able to clear themselves rapidly (within 4 – 5 h); and (2) sediment provides a source of food. These results suggest that intensified <b>sediment</b> <b>regimes</b> on coastal reefs may shift coral communities towards dominance by a few well-adapted species...|$|R
