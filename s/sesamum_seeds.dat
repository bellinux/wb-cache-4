40|$|Sesamin is a furofuran lignan biosynthesized {{from the}} {{precursor}} lignan pinoresinol specifically in sesame seeds. This lignan {{is shown to}} exhibit anti-hypertensive activity, protect the liver from damages by ethanol and lipid oxidation, and reduce lung tumor growth. Despite rapidly elevating demand, plant sources of lignans are frequently limited {{because of the high}} cost of locating and collecting plants. Indeed, the acquisition of sesamin exclusively depends on the conventional extraction of particular <b>Sesamum</b> <b>seeds.</b> In this study, we have created the efficient, stable and sustainable sesamin production system using triple-transgenic Forsythia koreana cell suspension cultures, U 18 i-CPi-Fk. These transgenic cell cultures were generated by stably introducing an RNAi sequence against the pinoresinol-glucosylating enzyme, UGT 71 A 18, into existing CPi-Fk cells, which had been created by introducing Sesamum indicum sesamin synthase (CYP 81 Q 1) and an RNA interference (RNAi) sequence against pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase (PLR) into F. koreanna cells. Compared to its transgenic prototype, U 18 i-CPi-Fk displayed 5 -fold higher production of pinoresinol aglycone and 1. 4 -fold higher production of sesamin, respectively, while the wildtype cannot produce sesamin {{due to a lack of}} any intrinsic sesamin synthase. Moreover, red LED irradiation of U 18 i-CPi-Fk specifically resulted in 3. 0 -fold greater production in both pinoresinol aglycone and sesamin than production of these lignans under the dark condition, whereas pinoresinol production was decreased in the wildtype under red LED. Moreover, we developed a procedure for sodium alginate-based long-term storage of U 18 i-CPi-Fk in liquid nitrogen. Production of sesamin in U 18 i-CPi-Fk re-thawed after six-month cryopreservation was equivalent to that of non-cryopreserved U 18 i-CPi-Fk. These data warrant on-demand production of sesamin anytime and anywhere. Collectively, the present study provides evidence that U 18 i-CP-Fk is an unprecedented platform for efficient, stable, and sustainable production of sesamin, and shows that a transgenic and specific light-regulated Forsythia cell-based metabolic engineering is a promising strategy for the acquisition of rare and beneficial lignans...|$|E

40|$|Sesamin is {{the major}} active {{ingredient}} is <b>Sesamum</b> indicum <b>seeds.</b> Several studies revealed that sesamin possesses potent anti-cancer properties. The anti-cancer effects of sesamin have been mainly attributed to its anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-metastatic, anti- and pro-angiogenic, and pro-autophagocytic activities. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the reported anti-cancer effects of sesamin, both in vitro and in vivo. Experimental findings related to the potential of sesamin to attenuate oxidative stress, inflammation, proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis in various cancer cells and tumors are analyzed. Studies focusing {{on the ability of}} sesamin to induce apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells are also underscored. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of sesamin are highlighted, and the major signaling pathways targeted by sesamin are identified. Although the exact signaling events triggered by sesamin in cancer cells are not fully revealed, our analysis indicates that NF-κB, STAT 3, JNK, ERK 1 / 2, p 38 MAPK, PI 3 K/AKT, caspase- 3, and p 53 signaling pathways are critically involved in mediating the anti-cancer effects of sesamin. In sum, the experimental evidence suggesting that sesamin could exert potent anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo is compelling. Hence, sesamin can potentially be employed as an effective adjuvant therapeutic agent in ameliorating tumor development and progression, and therefore, it could be used in the prevention and/or treatment of various types of cancer...|$|R

Morphology and dimensional distribution of nanostructured lipid carriers have been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and photon correlation spectroscopy, respectively. The release pattern of sesamol from nanostructured lipid carriers was evaluated in vitro determining drug percutaneous absorption through excised human skin. Furthermore, an oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay was used to determine their antioxidant activity.

The amino acid compositions of these deduced storage proteins revealed that the richness in methionine is attributed mainly to two 2 S albumin isoforms and partly to one 11 S globulin isoform. The presence of four 11 S globulin and three 2 S albumin isoforms resolved in SDS-PAGE was confirmed by MALDI-MS analyses. The abundance of these isoforms was {{in accord with the}} occurrence frequency of their EST sequences in the database. A comprehensive understanding of these storage proteins at the molecular level may also facilitate the identification of allergens in crude sesame products that have caused severe allergic reactions increasingly reported in the past decade...|$|R
40|$|Sesame <b>seed</b> (<b>Sesamum</b> indicum Linn) is a {{tropical}} economic crop with high oil yield. A study {{was carried out}} to establish the degree of influence of moisture content, duration and temperature of roasting on oil expression from this crop using an oil expeller. Effects of these parameters were used to develop model equations, optimize oil yield and quality. 4 levels each of moisture content, roasting duration and temperature {{were used for the}} experiment, giving a total of 64 samples. Expressed oil was recorded as yield while free fatty acid, oil impurity and color were the criteria used in determining oil quality. Data were analyzed, employing multiple regression technique to generate mathematical models. Oil yield was maximized while oil free fatty acid; color and impurities were kept at acceptable levels. Mean oil yield, free fatty acid, impurity and color were 34. 78 %, 2. 57 %, 0. 22 % and 6. 7 respectively. The optimum moisture content, roasting duration and roasting temperature were 4. 6 % wet basis (wb), 13. 0 min. and 124. 2 o C. These combinations gave 50. 4 % oil yield, 1. 1 % free fatty acid, 0. 1 % oil impurity and 6. 2 LUY. Error in prediction is not significance at P> 0. 05.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the absorption rates of two purified major allergen 2 S albumins, Ber e 1 from Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa Humb. & Bonpl.) and Ses i 1 from white sesame <b>seeds</b> (<b>Sesamum</b> indicum L.), across human intestinal epithelial Caco- 2 cell monolayers following gastrointestinal digestion in vitro. The transport from apical to basolateral side in cell monolayers was evaluated by RP-HPLC-UV and indirect competitive ELISA methods, being confirmed by western-blotting analysis. Significant amounts (∼ 15 - 25 nmol μmol- 1 initial amount/h) of intact Ber e 1 and Ses i 1 {{were found in the}} basolateral side. The absorption rates of both plant allergens through the cell monolayer were shown to be constant during the whole incubation period (4 h at 37 °C), verifying that the permeability of the membrane was not altered by the allergen digests. Our findings revealed that both purified 2 S albumin allergens may be able to survive in immunologically reactive forms to the simulated harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract to be transported across the Caco- 2 cell monolayers, so that {{they would be able to}} sensitize the mucosal immune system and/or elicit an allergic response.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the isolated compounds and asses the phytochemical {{properties of the}} possible functional molecules for therapeutic uses by screening the ethyl acetate and acetone fractions of water extract derived from sesame <b>seeds</b> (<b>Sesamum</b> indicum) in vitro. Methods: Fractions of ethyl acetate and acetone were extracted from the aqueous extract of S. indicum seed by liquid-liquid solvent extraction method and was screened for possible phytochemical, antibacterial and biomedical activities using specific standard in vitro methods. Results: The ethyl acetate and acetone fractions were subjected to various identification tests to {{identify the}} presence of possible flavonoid compound. The ethyl acetate fraction showed characteristic bands of flavonoids in the thin layer chromatography and ultra-violet spectroscopy. The ethyl acetate fraction was also potent antioxidant as it scavenged DPPH radical up to 70 % at the concentration of 100 µg/ml whereas the acetone fraction exhibited less activity. The ethyl acetate fraction showed moderate to good antimicrobial activities. In minimum bactericidal concentration test it exhibited better results in case of S. aureus than E. coli. The acetone fraction showed mild antimicrobial effect against some strains of microbes. The lethality index of the two fractions in brine shrimp indicated possible anticancer properties. The ethyl acetate fraction also showed s tronger hemagglutination inhibition activity than the acetone fraction. Conclusion: The low activity of acetone fraction {{can be explained by}} the extraction procedure inefficiency. Since acetone is much soluble in water than ethyl acetate there was difficulty in separating the two layers that may had caused inadequate amount of polyphenols isolated by the procedure.

40|$|Nanoemulsions have {{attracted}} attention in delivery of therapeutically active agents {{since most of}} the new chemical entities are hydrophobic in nature and the delivery of poor water soluble drugs is a challenge. This study was carried out to adopt nanoemulsion as a means of entrapping Ciprofloxacin in the oil phase of the emulsion for transdermal drug delivery. Nanoemulsions were formulated as oil in water (O/W) type and prepared by self-mild mechanical nanoemulsification method. The formulation consisted of Sandbox (Hura crepitan) and Sesame <b>seed</b> (<b>Sesamum</b> indicum) as the organic phase of the emulsion, Polyethylene (20) sorbitanmonooleate (Tween 80) and Polyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) as the surfactants and Polyehtylene glycol (PEG 400) as co-surfactant. The formulations were tested and characterized. Ciprofloxacin (0. 075 g) was incorporated into the oil phase of the most stable nanoemulsion formulation prior emulsification and tested on Escherichia Coli. Transdermal application was done on white albino rats (R). The result showed the zones of inhibition of HCa 3 +Ciprofloxacin and SSA 3 +Ciprofloxacinn to be 26. 00 and 25. 00 mm respectively. The HPLC results showed, out of 75000 μg of Ciprofloxacin loaded in the oil phases of HCa 3 and SSA 3 formulations, 6. 0076 (R 2), 0. 4112 (R 3) and 6. 7241 μg (R 6) were absorbed in HCa 3 while 1. 9519 (R 1), 1. 2631 (R 4) and 2. 1801 μg (R 5) were absorbed in SSA 3. The SEM images revealed an encapsulation with globule size diameter of 94 and 63 nm respectively.
