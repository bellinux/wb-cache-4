50|$|Interleukin-2 is an {{important}} immune <b>system</b> <b>regulator</b> necessary for the clone expansion and survival of activated lymphocytes T. Its effects are mediated by the trimer cell surface receptor IL-2a, consisting of the α, β, and γ chains. The IL-2a (CD25, T-cell activation antigen, TAC) is expressed only by the already-activated T lymphocytes. Therefore, it is of special significance to the selective immunosuppressive treatment, and research {{has been focused on}} the development of effective and safe anti-IL-2 antibodies. By the use of recombinant gene technology, the mouse anti-Tac antibodies have been modified, leading to the presentation of two chimeric mouse/human anti-Tac antibodies in the year 1998: basiliximab (Simulect) and daclizumab (Zenapax). These drugs act by binding the IL-2a receptor's α chain, preventing the IL-2 induced clonal expansion of activated lymphocytes and shortening their survival. They are used in the prophylaxis of the acute organ rejection after bilateral kidney transplantation, both being similarly effective and with only few side-effects.|$|E
50|$|Another major {{criticism}} of the M60 was the inseparability of the barrel from the gas <b>system</b> <b>regulator</b> and the bipod. The sole advantage of the fixed regulator was preventing the operator from inadvertently damaging the weapon by setting the gas pressure too high, though this actually {{proved to be a}} major disadvantage in combat; the lack of an adjustable regulator also prevented the gunner from combating progressive fouling of the gas system by increasing the pressure to compensate. The result was insufficient gas power to operate the action after lengthy periods of fire, a situation only remedied by a full field strip of the weapon and cleaning the gas system with solvent and pipe cleaners, a virtually impossible procedure in a combat environment. The non-adjustable front sight is welded to the barrel, causing the weapon's sight calibration ("zero") to be ruined every time a barrel was changed. This design error was recognized early in the weapon's service, but was ignored due to financial reasons; every barrel in service would have needed to be replaced, and given the cost involved, the Department of Defense decided the loss in accuracy was comparatively unimportant, given the weapon's role.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – A {{pricing model}} {{considering}} the simultaneous interaction of pool, bilateral and reserve markets {{in a power}} system is presented. The model is able to work under the classical marginal pricing (MP) or under the ‘Pay-as-Bid’ (PAB) pricing. In the PAB pricing approach, an integration process involves an AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) for ob-taining awarded bids in the pool and reserve market {{with the presence of}} long term firm bilateral contracts. As a result, the obtained prices of energy and reserve services incorpo-rate the influences of the topology, voltage levels, losses, and capacity limits of generators and transmission lines. Results show that agents can plan their portfolios based on reason-able stable prices that reflect the impact of supplying several electricity services and associated costs of resources in sev-eral operation scenarios and bid strategies. From the per-spective of the <b>system</b> <b>regulator,</b> the minimization of pay-ments by PAB ensures the supply of energy, transmission losses and reserve requirements besides enforcing financial adequacy and price stability.

In a model with three decision points and stochastic resolution of uncertainty, we study interactions between expected losses due to regulation and information availability when a regulator is deciding on an early reversible ban and on a later reversible ban. Adjustment costs create inertia concerning intermediate signals such that earlier decisions are not overturned, and also a bias against imposing an early ban. The prospect of more later-stage information can increase or decrease the incentive to ban early, but research decreases the incentive to ban early. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Gas fueled {{power plants}} have been exten-sively built {{all around the world}} while they are a high efficiency, {{low-emission}} technology with short building time. During some years they were also very interesting from an economic point of view. Nevertheless, prices are currently increasing and besides gas {{is becoming more and more}} a strategic element, what may suggest the need to constraint the dependence on this fuel. This paper presents a method for analyzing the impact of the measures that the <b>system</b> <b>regulator</b> could use in order to constraint the number of gas-fueled plants to be built. This may include mandatory reference planning, taxes on gas, or the promotion of substitutive technologies. The analysis uses a system-dynamics-based model that represents in detail the process of generation expansion. It consists of four major modules: market representation, price forecasting, investment decision and plant building. The results in a particular system show that subsidizing renewable technologies, is a very interesting alternative, both from the cost point of view, and because it requires less additional measures to maintain reserve margin and reasonable prices...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop an infection, diarrhogenic Escherichia coli has {{to pass through the}} stomach, where the pH can be as low as 1. Mechanisms that enable E. coli to survive in low pH are thus {{potentially}} relevant for pathogenicity. Four acid response systems involved in reducing the concentration of intracellular protons have been identified so far. However, it is still unclear to what extent the regulation of other important cellular functions may be required for survival in acid conditions. Here, we have combined molecular and phenotypic analysis of wild-type and mutant strains with computational network inference to identify molecular pathways underlying E. coli response to mild and strong acid conditions. The interpretative model we have developed led to the hypothesis that a complex transcriptional programme, dependent on the two-component <b>system</b> <b>regulator</b> OmpR and involving a switch between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, may be key for survival. Experimental validation has shown that the OmpR is responsible for controlling a sizeable component of the transcriptional programme to acid exposure. Moreover, we found that a ΔompR strain was unable to mount any transcriptional response to acid exposure and had one of the strongest acid sensitive phenotype observed...|$|E
