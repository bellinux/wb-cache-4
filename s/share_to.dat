5|$|At {{the time}} of Rivens development, {{publisher}} Brøderbund was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Two years into the project, Cyan still had nothing they could show them. Brøderbund's stock dropped from $60 a <b>share</b> <b>to</b> $22 in 1996, because of a delay in the publishing of Riven. The plan had been to ship the game {{in time for the}} 1996 holiday season; Riven was finally published on October 29, 1997. Even though Rivens sales were expected to be higher than any other game that holiday season, Brøderbund launched a $10million marketing campaign and developed a retail marketing partnership with Toshiba America. Anticipation for the game was high even among non-gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} kingdom period, the palace {{controlled}} the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention. The economic system was redistributive; the palace distributed food to its permanent and seasonal workers. It {{is estimated that}} around 40,000 persons contributed to this system, but in general, and unlike in Mesopotamia, land stayed {{in the hands of}} villages, which paid an annual <b>share</b> <b>to</b> the palace. Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace. The city's inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of sheep and goats, and 9,000 cattle.|$|E
5|$|However, KPE's first-day {{performance}} was lackluster, trading down 1.7% and trading volume was limited.

KPE's stock declined from an IPO price of €25 per <b>share</b> <b>to</b> €18.16 (a 27% decline) at the end of 2007 and a low of €11.45 (a 54.2% decline) per share in Q1 2008.|$|E

Michael Wansey resigned from the board {{at the end of}} the year as a result. In 1984, plans for a second independent station in Newcastle had failed. During that time, NBN and ABC Newcastle were asked to leave the VHF band to accommodate FM radio. NBN would have been on UHF channel 51, and ABC on UHF channel 48, however this did not eventuate. A proposal to launch a radiated subscription television service with community broadcasting during the daytime hours had also failed that year.|$|E

5|$|The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane {{was run by}} {{the holders}} {{of one of the}} two {{official}} licenses, or letters patent, established by Charles II in 1660. It was operated by Christopher Rich from 1693 until 1714. He was replaced after his death by three actors, Colley Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Robert Wilks. After Doggett died, Barton Booth took over his share. In 1730, a notice in the Daily Journal stated that a patent would be issued to Booth, Cibber, and Wilks authorising the official government license to run the Theatre Royal. After bureaucratic delays, the official patent was given to the three managers only in 1732 that was to last for 21 years. On 13 July 1732, Booth, in poor health, decided to sell half of his <b>share</b> <b>to</b> Highmore, a fellow actor and a socialite. On 27 September, Wilks died and his share was inherited by his widow, who then authorised Ellys, a painter, to serve in her place. In reaction to the changing partners, Colley Cibber rented his <b>share</b> <b>to</b> his son Theophilus, an actor.|$|E

A total of 17,074 units were registered, consisting of 7,678 all-electric cars and 9,396 plug-in hybrids. The plug-in segment achieved a market share of 0.7% of new car sales. The top selling models during the first eight months of 2016 were the Renault Zoe (1,836), BMW i3 (1,237), Tesla Model S (978), Audi A3 e-tron (908), and Volkswagen Golf GTE (852). The introduction of the federal government purchase e-bonus, in effect since May 2016, did not produce immediate effect on plug-in car sales until September 2016, when registrations peaked to 3,061 units, consisting of 1,641 all-electric cars, up 76.6% year-on-year, and 1,420 plug-in hybrids, up 36.8% year-on-year.

5|$|Following the Manchester United board's {{search for}} new investors, the Glazers {{purchased}} their first tranche of Manchester United shares on 2 March 2003, spending around £9million on a 2.9% stake, which they purchased through a holding company called Red Football. On 26 September 2003, {{it was reported that}} they had increased their <b>share</b> <b>to</b> 3.17%, taking their shareholding above the 3% threshold that required them to inform the club's management. There had already been considerable speculation {{about the possibility of a}} takeover of the club, either by the Glazers or by one of several other interested parties. By 20 October, they had increased their shareholding to 8.93%, and on 29 November it was reported that they owned around 15% of the club and had met David Gill, its chief executive, to discuss their intentions. On 12 February 2004, the Glazers increased their stake in the club to 16.31% and the following day's Financial Times reported that they had instructed Commerzbank to explore a takeover bid. The club's share price increased by 5% that day, valuing the club at a total of £741million. The Glazers increased their shareholding to over 19% the following June, although they were still not the largest shareholders. Their shareholding continued to increase, nearing 30% by October 2004. Upon reaching 30%, they would have to launch a formal takeover bid.|$|E
5|$|For {{more than}} eight decades, the Toronto Argonauts Football Club was the sole {{property}} of its namesake rowing club. By the 1950s, the team's complex management structure made the arrangement increasingly awkward. Facing overdraft and with wealthy suitors knocking, the Argonaut rowers finally sold the team to a consortium led by John Bassett, Eric Cradock, and Charlie Burns in 1957. Each held about 20% share in the company, with the balance made up by small investors who had some affinity with the club; the initial agreement called for a long-term debenture of $400,000 {{to be set up}} that would sustain the rowing club in the absence of its football income. Bassett was the operating head of the franchise and is often given sole credit for the initial purchase of the Argos, but Cradock was also instrumental in spearheading the drive. He would sell his <b>share</b> <b>to</b> Len Lumbers just two years into his tenure in part because of Bassett's controlling nature. Bassett arranged a complete buyout of the other shareholders for $2.31 million in 1971 through his holdings in Baton Broadcasting.|$|E
