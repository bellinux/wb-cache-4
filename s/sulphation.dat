The non-reducing terminal of Fibromodulin KS is more similar in structure to the non-reducing terminal of a KSII type keratan sulphate rather than to corneal KSI.

40|$|Available online 19 May 2011 Sulphur capture by calcium-based sorbents is {{a process}} highly {{dependent}} on the temperature and CO 2 concentration. In oxy-fuel combustion in fluidised beds (FB), CO 2 concentration in the flue gas may be enriched up to 95 %. Under so high CO 2 concentration, different from that in conventional coal combustion with air, the calcination and <b>sulphation</b> behaviour of the sorbent must be defined to determine the optimum operating temperature in the FB combustors. In this work, the SO 2 retention capacity of two different limestones was tested by thermogravimetric analysis at typical oxy-fuel conditions in FB combustors. The effect of the main operating variables affecting calcination and <b>sulphation</b> reactions, like CO 2 and SO 2 concentrations, temperature, and sorbent particle size, was analysed. It was observed a clear difference in the <b>sulphation</b> conversion reached by the sorbent whether the <b>sulphation</b> takes place under indirect or direct <b>sulphation,</b> being much higher under indirect <b>sulphation.</b> But, {{in spite of this}} difference, for a given condition and temperature, the CO 2 concentration did not affect to the <b>sulphation</b> conversion, being its major effect to delay the CaCO 3 decomposition to a higher temperature. For the typical operating conditions and sorbent particle sizes used in oxy-fuel FB combustors, the maximum sorbent <b>sulphation</b> conversions were reached at temperatures of about 900 °C.

These additives convert KCl to an alkali sulphate and a more efficient <b>sulphation</b> is normally achieved for ammonium sulphate compared to sulphur. The presence of SO 3 is thus of greater importance than that of SO 2. Oxygen and volatile combustibles could also {{have an effect on the}} <b>sulphation</b> of gaseous KCl. This paper is based on results obtained during co-combustion of wood chips and straw pellets in a 12 MW circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. Ammonium sulphate was injected at three positions in the boiler i. e. in the upper part of the combustion chamber, in the cyclone inlet, and in the cyclone. The <b>sulphation</b> of KCl was investigated at three air excess ratios (lambda = 1. 1, 1. 2 and 1. 4). Several measurement tools were applied including IACM (on-line measurements of gaseous alkali chlorides), deposit probes (chemical composition in deposits collected) and gas analysis. The position for injection of ammonium sulphate had a great impact on the <b>sulphation</b> efficiency for gaseous KCl at the different air excess ratios. There was also an effect of oxygen on the <b>sulphation</b> efficiency when injecting ammonium sulphate in the cyclone. Less gaseous KCl was reduced during air excess ratio lambda = 1. 1 compared to the higher air excess ratios. The optimal position and conditions for injection of ammonium sulphate were identified by measuring KCl with IACM.

40|$|Combustion of a biomass with an {{enhanced}} content of alkali and chlorine (Cl) {{can result in}} operational problems including deposit formation and superheater corrosion. The strategies applied to reduce such problems include co-combustion {{and the use of}} additives. In this work, measures were investigated in order to decrease the risk of superheater corrosion by reducing gaseous KCl and the content of chlorine in deposits. The strategies applied were <b>sulphation</b> of KCl by sulphur/sulphate containing additives (i. e. elemental sulphur (S) and ammonium sulphate (AS)) and co-combustion with peat. Both <b>sulphation</b> of KCl and capture of potassium (K) in ash components can be of importance when peat is used. The experiments were mainly performed in a 12 MW circulation fluidised bed (CFB) boiler equipped for research purposes but also in a full-scale CFB boiler. The results were evaluated by means of IACM (on-line measurements of gaseous KCl), conventional gas analysis, deposit and corrosion probe measurements and ash analysis. Ammonium sulphate performed significantly better than elemental sulphur. Thus the presence of SO 3 (i. e. AS) is of greater importance than that of SO 2 (i. e. S) for <b>sulphation</b> of gaseous KCl and reduction of chlorine in deposits. Only a minor reduction of gaseous KCl was obtained during co-combustion with peat although chlorine in the deposits was greatly reduced. This reduction was supposedly due to capture of K by reactive components from the peat ash in parallel to <b>sulphation</b> of KCl. These compounds remained unidentified. The effect of volatile combustibles on the <b>sulphation</b> of gaseous KCl was investigated. The poorest <b>sulphation</b> was attained during injection of ammonium sulphate in {{the upper part of the}} combustion chamber during the lowest air excess ratio.

40|$|Copper {{smelting}} {{with the}} Outokumpu flash smelting process generates {{significant amounts of}} SO 2 -rich off-gas and flue dust. From the smelting unit, gases with a dust load are directed into a heat recovery boiler (also known as a waste heat boiler). In the radiation section temperature decreases, sulphates become thermodynamically stable, and the <b>sulphation</b> of oxidic dust particles commences. Releasing heat may {{lead to an increase}} in particle temperatures, softening of the sulphated particles, and the formation of dust accretions on the heat transfer surfaces. Decreased heat transfer efficiency and blockages of the gas flow paths may cause severe operational problems. To maintain stable boiler operation, <b>sulphation</b> behaviour has to be well understood, but only scant published data concerning dust <b>sulphation</b> reactions is available. The objective of this work was to gain basic knowledge of the <b>sulphation</b> behaviour of dust components to ascertain that boiler design and operation can be carried out so that sulphate formation takes place in a controlled manner. The reactions of synthetic Cu 2 O and CuO (mainly 37 - 53  µm) and a partially oxidised copper matte were studied experimentally with the aim of arriving at a better understanding of dust <b>sulphation</b> in industrial heat recovery boilers. The parameters in the laboratory-scale experiments were gas composition (20 - 60  vol-% SO 2, 2. 5 - 10  vol-% O 2), temperature (560 - 660  °C), reaction time, and particle size. Standard chemical analysis and scanning electron microscopy with EDS were utilised when examining the samples. Sulphate formation was found to be sensitive to gas composition and temperature. Also particle size and surface morphology have significant effects on the <b>sulphation</b> rate. On the basis of the experimental results the temperature range for effective <b>sulphation</b> of pure cuprous oxide is narrow; the optimal sulphate formation temperature lies between 580 - 640  °C, depending on the gas composition. An increase in oxygen concentration expands the favourable temperature range and lowers the most optimal sulphate formation temperature; on the contrary an increase in sulphur dioxide concentration raises the favourable <b>sulphation</b> temperature. On the basis of the present experiments pure cupric oxide behaves like cuprous oxide, but the conversion degrees are slightly lower and there is not such a clear enhance in the <b>sulphation</b> rate at a certain temperature. Fine, heterogeneous partially oxidised matte reacts significantly faster compared to synthetic oxides. The reason for more effective <b>sulphation</b> is suggested to be the smaller particle size and more detailed morphology (larger specific surface area). In the heat recovery boiler dust particles must have a sufficient residence time in the gas phase at a correct temperature range to allow the dust particles to reach complete conversion in the radiation section before they enter the boiler convection section and come into contact with the convection tube banks. Enough oxygen has to be supplied to the appropriate zone to ensure effective <b>sulphation</b> at the right place. Also, mixing of the oxygen must be efficient. reviewe...|$|E

This paper describes the effects of monosulphation on the oestrogen agonist properties of these three phytoestrogens in MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells in terms of their relative ability to compete with [H- 3]oestradiol for binding to oestrogen receptor (ER), to induce a stably transfected oestrogen-responsive reporter gene (ERE-CAT) and to stimulate cell growth. In no case did <b>sulphation</b> abolish activity. The 4 '-sulphadon of genistein reduced oestrogen agonist activity to a small extent in whole-cell assays but increased the relative binding affinity to ER.

40|$|Development of {{the visual}} system {{involves}} the precise orchestration of neural connections between the retina of the eye, the thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; dLGN) and the superior colliculus (SC). During early development, receptor molecules on the growth cones of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons sense molecular guidance cues in the extra cellular matrix (ECM) that define their route and branching behaviour within the visual system. Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are ECM molecules composed of a core protein and a variable number of disaccharide residues that have been implicated in mediating axon guidance. HSPGs are modified {{by a number of}} enzymes that contribute to their structural diversity. Based on this structural diversity; the “heparan sulphate code” hypothesis of Bulow and Hobert (2004) postulated that different HSPG modifications confer different axon navigation responses as the growth cones traverse the local environment. To investigate the roles played by specific modifications of HSPG molecules in the guidance of axons, we examined two lines of mutant mice harbouring mutations in the genes encoding HSPG modifying enzymes, Heparan sulphate- 6 -O-sulphotransferase- 1 (Hs 6 st 1) and Heparan sulphate- 2 -O-sulphotransferase (Hs 2 st). These two mutant lines were generated through the use of gene trapping. Previous observations of RGC axon development in the two mutant lines revealed distinct axon guidance errors at the optic chiasm. Loss of Hs 6 st 1 <b>sulphation</b> resulted in RGC axons navigating ectopically into the contralateral eye. Loss of Hs 2 st <b>sulphation</b> resulted in RGC axons navigating outside the normal boundary of the optic chiasm. Early observations suggested that both Hs 2 st <b>sulphation</b> and Hs 6 st 1 <b>sulphation</b> have distinct, non-overlapping actions and thus, influence different axon guidance signalling pathways at the optic chiasm. Based on our findings and previous work describing the expression patterns and functions of the chemo-repellent axon guidance molecules, Slit 1 and Slit 2 at the optic chiasm and their Robo 2 in the retina, we formulated the hypothesis of an HSPG <b>sulphation</b> code where Hs 2 st <b>sulphation</b> is specifically required for Slit 1 -Robo 2 signalling and Hs 6 st 1 <b>sulphation</b> is specifically required for Slit 2 -Robo 2 signalling at the optic chiasm. To further our understanding of the roles Hs 2 st <b>sulphation</b> and Hs 6 st 1 <b>sulphation</b> have on axon guidance, we looked at a number of key choice points that navigating axons encounter and are known to be influenced by Slit signalling. Further observations of RGC axons at the optic chiasm of Hs 2 st-/- mutants and Hs 6 st 1 -/- mutants showed distinct axon guidance phenotypes, both resulting in statistically significant increases in the width of the optic chiasm at the midline. While Hs 6 st 1 <b>sulphation</b> had no effect on RGC axon navigation within the eye (possibly due to 6 -O-sulphation compensation by Hs 6 st 3); the loss of Hs 6 st 1 <b>sulphation</b> at the dLGN resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} defasciculation of the optic tract. Observations of other axonal tracts influenced by Slit signalling revealed the importance of Hs 2 st and Hs 6 st 1 <b>sulphation</b> in aiding callosal axons to successfully traverse the midline in corpus callosum development. Observations of the thalamocortical (TCA) /corticothalamic (CTA) tracts revealed that neither Hs 2 st <b>sulphation</b> nor Hs 6 st 1 <b>sulphation</b> was required for the development of the mouse TCA tract (the latter may be explained by 6 -O-sulphation compensation by Hs 6 st 2). To test whether Hs 2 st and Hs 6 st 1 enzymes have redundant functions in optic chiasm development, we attempted to create Hs 2 st-/-/Hs 6 st 1 -/- double mutants. A PCR genotyping strategy was developed for the identification of Hs 6 st 1 animals and showed that Hs 6 st 1 -/- mutants had high postnatal lethality with only 3 % of the offspring surviving to weaning while Hs 2 st-/-/Hs 6 st 1 -/- double mutants all died very early during embryonic development. Observations of Hs 2 st-/-/Hs 6 st 1 +/- mutants and Hs 2 st+/-/Hs 6 st 1 -/- mutants that lacked three of the four Hst alleles showed no differences when compared to single Hst knockouts. Finally, we showed that altered Slit expression at the optic chiasm and Robo expression in the retina could not explain the mutant phenotypes observed in Hs 2 st-/- mutants and Hs 6 st 1 -/- mutants, and therefore we hypothesized that Hs 2 st <b>sulphation</b> and Hs 6 st 1 <b>sulphation</b> regulate distinct aspects of Slit-Robo signalling at the surface of the navigating axon growth cone.

The structural context in which this residue occurs was demonstrated to be: high <b>sulphation</b> domain [...] > 4) -beta-D-GlcAp-(1 [...] > 4) -alpha-D-GlcNp-(1 [...] > 4) -beta-D-GlcAp-(1 [...] > low <b>sulphation</b> domain (where GlcNp is 2 -amino- 2 -deoxyglucopyranose, and GlcAp is glucopyranosyluronic acid), based on the isolation and characterization of a novel, heparin lyase III-derived, GlcNp containing tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide. The results presented suggest that structural differences may play a role in important biological events controlled by heparan sulphate in different tissues...|$|E

40|$|The <b>sulphation</b> {{pattern of}} {{glycosaminoglycan}} (GAG) plays {{a critical role}} in biological functions of proteoglycans. In this study, we showed that decorins from different bovine tissues present specific <b>sulphation</b> pattern coupled with peculiar biological activity. In order to elucidate chemical structure of decorin glycosaminoglycan chains, we improved an electrophoretic method to analyse fluorescent disaccharides from dermatan/chondroitin sulphate GAG chains. The disaccharide separation is based on minigels, and this technique was able to define the polysaccharide chain composition in terms of sulphated and not sulphated disaccharides. This approach allowed not only the measurement of few picomoles of material, but it also permits a rapid qualitative analysis of the GAG chains. Data obtained by PAGEFS indicate that the <b>sulphation</b> pattern of GAG is tissue specific and this finding may explain the different binding properties to von Willebrand factor of decorins...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 132 - 137. An overall {{process model}} is {{presented}} for {{the capture of}} sulphur dioxide by calcareous sorbents in a fluidised bed combustor for a feed of arbitrary size distribution. The description of sorbent <b>sulphation</b> kinetics, particle attrition and elutriation effects incorporated in this model is supported by experimental data {{for a wide range}} of South African sorbents. The <b>sulphation</b> of sorbent particles is described by a simple, two-parameter, kinetic model. No loss in physical relevance is incurred when the decrease in reaction rate with time is given by a negative exponential term. Both <b>sulphation</b> rate and capacity are shown to be functions of sorbent type. The <b>sulphation</b> propensity of the 16 South African samples is correlated against their geologic description. Sorbent properties such as porosity, crystallinity and topography, which affect <b>sulphation</b> capacity directly, are functions of geologic age. It is possible to make a first order assessment of sorbent potential simply from this geologic data. Sorbent attrition, caused by the continuous movement of particles within the combustor, is greatest for deep beds of soft friable material. Most of the attrition takes place in the distributor region where jetting action is important. The attrition model reflects an explicit dependence on fluidising velocity, bed depth, particle diameter, topography and structural strength. Measured values of attrition rate decrease with time to a steady state value, which, under normal FBC operating conditions, is attained after a time in the bed of 6 - 10 hours. The elutriation model considers the effect of fines, generated by attrition, on the carry-over of coarse particles from the bed. The overall process model confirms that choice of <b>sulphation</b> kinetics exerts the greatest influence on attainable sulphur capture,. although bed fluid dynamics, sorbent attrition and feed size distribution all play a role. The model is substantiated by extensive data from the performance of three dissimilar sorbents in a 10 MWth FBC. The contribution of sorbent attrition to the solids loading of downstream gas cleaning equipment is highlighted...|$|E

30|$|In {{contrast}} to CCK 8, where tyrosine <b>sulphation</b> or phosphorylation increased the stoichiometry {{of ferric ion}} binding from 1 to 2 without greatly affecting the affinity (Baldwin et al. 2008), tyrosine <b>sulphation</b> or phosphorylation of gastrin 17 {{had no effect on}} the stoichiometry of ferric ion binding, but enhanced the affinity of gastrin 17 for the first ferric ion, and reduced the affinity for the second ferric ion. This difference is not unexpected as the gastrin binding site consists of three of the five glutamate residues, while the CCK 8 SO 4 binding site involves the two aspartate residues, and the CCK 8 PO 4 binding site the phosphate group itself (Baldwin et al. 2008). In terms of receptor binding, tyrosine <b>sulphation</b> enhanced the affinity, while phosphorylation reduced the affinity, of CCK 8 for both the CCK 1 and CCK 2 receptors (Baldwin et al. 2008). In contrast, while tyrosine <b>sulphation</b> enhanced the affinity of gastrin 17 for the CCK 2 receptor, phosphorylation had no effect. Although the generalization that modification of tyrosine profoundly affects the binding of ferric ions is valid, the differences between two such closely related peptides as gastrin 17 and CCK 8 indicate that the exact binding details will have to be determined for each peptide individually.|$|E
40|$|CO 2 capture in a calcium looping (CaL) {{system is}} one of the most {{promising}} technologies for climate change mitigation. The main reactors in these systems (carbonator and calciner) operate in conditions where the reaction of CaO with the SO 2 resulting from the combustion of coal is inevitable. This work reports on the <b>sulphation</b> of CaO under a range of variables that are typical of reactors in CaL systems. Furthermore it is demonstrated that the number of calcination carbonation cycles changes the <b>sulphation</b> patterns of the CaO from heterogeneous to homogeneous in all the limestones tested. For 50 carbonation calcination cycles and for particle sizes below 200 µm, the <b>sulphation</b> pattern is in all cases homogeneous. The <b>sulphation</b> rates were found to be first order with respect to SO 2, and zero with respect to CO 2. Steam was observed to have a positive effect only in the diffusion through the product layer controlled regime, as it leads to an improvement in the sulfation rates and effectiveness of the sorbent. Most of the experimental results of sulfation of highly cycled sorbents under all conditions can be fitted by means of the Random Pore Model (RPM) assuming that the kinetics and diffusion through the product layer of the CaSO 4 are the controlling regimes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studies the}} {{consequences}} on high temperature corrosion when biomass is co-fired with coal in oxy-fuel combustion, {{a concept that}} would enable negative CO 2 emissions by combining renewable fuels with CO 2 capture. The particular focus {{of the work is}} the <b>sulphation</b> of alkali chlorides which is studied by means of experiments and modelling. The melting point of alkali sulphates is higher than for alkali chlorides and a high degree of alkali <b>sulphation</b> is hence a measure to reduce issues related to high-temperature corrosion. In the experiments a propane flame was doped with SO 2 and KCl (in solution) in air and oxy-fuel atmospheres. Two alternative measurement principles were applied to quantify potassium <b>sulphation</b> and the paper thereby contributes with a novel experimental approach as well as unique experimental data for turbulent diffusion air and oxy-fuel flames. The degree of <b>sulphation</b> of the injected KCl increases substantially in oxy compared to air combustion conditions, a fact which favours the use of biomass in oxy-combustion. This is mainly due to the increased concentration of SO 2 due to flue gas recycling in oxy-combustion, but also chemical effects introduced by the CO 2 as well as a small effect resulting from an increased residence time in the combustor...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to confirm <b>sulphation</b> of phenols by isolated colonocytes from man and to evaluate mucosal <b>sulphation</b> in inflammatory bowel disease using the phenol, paracetamol, in rectal dialysis bags. The incubation of paracetamol with colonocytes isolated from resected colon specimens (n = 7) yielded a mean (SE) value of 7. 0 (0. 9) mumols/g dry weight of paracetamol sulphate after 60 minutes but virtually undetectable values of paracetamol glucuronide. Paracetamol sulphate was detected in rectal dialysates from all control subjects, with a mean (SE) value of 4. 2 (0. 8) nmol/hour. <b>Sulphation</b> was significantly impaired (p less than 0. 01) in 19 patients with active ulcerative colitis (0. 6 (0. 2) nmol/hour) and in 17 patients with ulcerative colitis in remission (1. 1 (0. 4) nmol/hour). <b>Sulphation</b> in eight patients with Crohn's colitis (4. 3 (2. 1) nmol/hour) was similar to that in control subjects.

The pattern of mucus production in 12 South Asian and 16 European colitics and a control group of 19 South Asians was studied. Three types of mucin were identified after organ culture of colonic biopsy specimens with a dual label of [3 H]-glucosamine and sodium [35 S]-sulphate: type A had a high [35 S]:[3 H] ratio and high incorporation ([3 H] dpm/micrograms DNA > 500); type B had a low ratio and high incorporation; and type C had low incorporation but with either high (C 1) or low (C 2) ratios. European colitic mucins show a significant reduction in the level of <b>sulphation</b> detected by mucin histochemistry with high iron diamine/Alcian blue staining, together with predominantly type B or C 2 mucins (low <b>sulphation).</b> South Asian colitics showed histochemically normal patterns of high <b>sulphation</b> and largely type A and C 1 mucins (high <b>sulphation).</b> There was no correlation of mucin type with disease activity index in either ethnic group.

40|$|The {{amount of}} lithocholate input {{and the size}} of the total lithocholate {{exchangeable}} pool were measured using isotope dilution in three patients ingesting chenodeoxycholic acid for gallstone dissolution and two healthy control subjects. Because the specific activity decay curve was biexponential in appearance, input was calculated using a stochastic analysis employing the Stewart-Hamilton equation. By this method, the lithocholate input {{and the size of}} the exchangeable pool in gallstone patients during chenic acid ingestion was four to five times that observed in the healthy control subjects. It was calculated that about one-fifth of the newly formed lithocholate was absorbed in both gallstone patients and healthy control subjects. The extent of <b>sulphation</b> of absorbed lithocholate was then measured in seven gallstone patients whto had been ingesting chenodeoxycholic acid for gallstone dissolution by defining the chemical form of radioactivity in bile after intravenous administration of labelled lithocholate. Similar studies were carried out in eight healthy control subjects, but, in addition the extent of <b>sulphation</b> of injected lithocholylglycine and lithocholyltaurine was also defined. When lithocholate was injected, the majority of radioactivity in bile (50 - 60 %) was present as sulphated conjugates, both in gallstone patients and healthy control subjects. The degree of <b>sulphation</b> was greater for glycine than taurine conjugates, and these findings, which suggested preferential <b>sulphation</b> of the glycine conjugates of lithocholate, were confirmed by showing that injected lithocholylglycine was sulphated to a much greater extent than injected lithocholyltaurine. These findings indicate that in patients receiving chenic acid there is effective <b>sulphation</b> of lithocholate, especially its glycine conjugates, despite a considerable increase in lithocholate absorption; they may provide an explanation for the lack of hepatotoxicity of chenic acid in man...|$|E
30|$|<b>Sulphation</b> of CCK 8 on {{the sole}} {{tyrosine}} residue greatly increases receptor binding and biological potency (Jensen et al. 1981). Tyrosine <b>sulphation</b> or phosphorylation of CCK 8 increased the stoichiometry {{of ferric ion}} binding from 1 to 2, without greatly affecting the affinity (Baldwin et al. 2008). Gastrins also occur in sulphated and unsulphated forms (Dockray et al. 2001), and the sulphated form predominates in the fetal pancreas (Brand et al. 1984). Gastrin can also be phosphorylated by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase in vitro (Baldwin et al. 1983), but phosphorylated gastrins have not been reported to occur naturally. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether or not <b>sulphation</b> or phosphorylation of gastrin 17 altered ferric ion binding or affinity for the CCK 1 or CCK 2 receptor. Since non-amidated forms of gastrin require ferric ions for activity, a change in affinity for ferric ions on modification of the tyrosine residue of gastrins might have profound effects on their biological activity.|$|E
