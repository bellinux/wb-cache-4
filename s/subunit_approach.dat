Safety issues related to administering these complex mixtures, however, prevent their universal application. Through identification of the microbial components responsible for protective immunity, vaccine formulations can be simplified, enabling molecular-level vaccine characterization, improved safety profiles, prospects to develop new high-priority vaccines (e. g. for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria), and the opportunity for extensive vaccine component optimization. This <b>subunit</b> <b>approach,</b> however, comes at the expense of decreased immunity, requiring the addition of immunostimulatory agents (adjuvants). As few adjuvants are currently used in licensed vaccines, adjuvant development represents an exciting area for medicinal chemists {{to play a role in}} the future of vaccine development. In addition, immune responses can be further customized though optimization of delivery systems, tuning the size of particulate vaccines, targeting specific cells of the immune system (e. g. dendritic cells), and adding components to aid vaccine efficacy in whole immunized populations (e. g. promiscuous T-helper epitopes). Herein we review the current state of the art and future direction in subunit vaccine development, with a focus on the described components and their potential to steer the immune response toward a desired response. The subunit approach: Despite their excellent track record, traditional vaccine approaches have failed for several high priority diseases. Subunit vaccines offer hope for new, safer, highly characterized vaccines. Herein we discuss key components for next-generation subunit vaccine development...|$|E

Still, the true impact on child and traveler health is likely underestimated. There are currently no licensed vaccines for ETEC, but studies indicate high public health impact, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of immune protection through vaccination. ETEC vaccine development remains a World Health Organization priority. Traditionally, ETEC vaccine development efforts have focused on inducing antitoxin and anticolonization antigen immunity, as studies indicate that antibodies against both antigen types can contribute to protection and thus have potential for vaccines. Leading cellular vaccine candidates are ETVAX (a mixture of four inactivated strains) and ACE 527 (a mixture of three live attenuated strains), both of which have been found to be safe and immunogenic in Phase 1 / 2 trials. ETVAX is the furthest along in development with descending-age studies already underway in Bangladesh. Other ETEC vaccine candidates based on protein subunits, toxoids (both LT and ST), or novel, more broadly conserved ETEC antigens are also under development. Of these, a protein adhesin-based <b>subunit</b> <b>approach</b> is the most advanced. Impact and economic models suggest favorable vaccine cost-effectiveness, which may help expand market interest in ETEC vaccines. Combination vaccine formulations may help improve the economic case for development and use, and better point-of-care diagnostics will help to raise awareness of the true health burden of ETEC and highlight the potential public health benefit of ETEC vaccine introduction. Better diagnostics and vaccine demand forecasting will also improve vaccine development financing and support accelerated uptake once a licensed vaccine becomes available...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA <b>subunit</b> <b>approach</b> to the {{development}} of a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine was investigated. It involved the production, inEscherichia coli,of an RSV (Long) G protein fragment (G 2 Na) as a C-terminal fusion partner to an albumin binding region (BB) of streptococcal protein G. G 2 Na incorporated amino acid residues 130 – 230 and was specifically recognized by murine anti-RSV-A polyclonal serum. In mice, intraperitoneal immunization with BBG 2 Na induced high anti-RSV-A serum ELISA titers and low to moderate neutralization activity. The immune response induced by BBG 2 Na demonstrated a potent protective efficacy against upper and lower respiratory tract RSV-A infection. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of BBG 2 Na was maintained for at least 47 and 48 weeks, respectively, and was as potent and durable as live RSV-A administered in a similar fashion. Intramuscular immunization of cotton rats with BBG 2 Na protected lungs from both homologous and heterologous virus challenge. In contrast to mice, however, cotton rat nasal tracts were not protected after BBG 2 Na immunization. Consistent with antibody-mediated protection, virus was cleared within 24 hr from the lungs of BBG 2 Na-immunized mice. The anti-RSV-A antibodies induced in mice were exclusively of the IgG 1 isotype and were detected in the serum, lungs, and nasal tracts. Passive transfer of these antibodies prevented acute, and eliminated chronic, RSV-A lung infection in normal and immunodeficient mice, respectively, confirming that such antibodies are important and sufficient for BBG 2 Na-induced pulmonary protection. Our results clearly demonstrate that BBG 2 Na contains an important immunogenic domain of the RSV G protein. The prokaryotic origin of this protein indicates that glycosylation of the RSV G protein is not necessary for protective efficacy. Thus, BBG 2 Na has potential as an RSV subunit vaccine...|$|E
40|$|The present PhD thesis {{entitled}} “Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Chromofluorogenic Probes for Contaminating Species” {{is focused}} on the development of new chromo-fluorogenic sensors based on the principles of molecular recognition. The first part of this thesis {{is focused on}} the design and synthesis of suitable organic compounds as sensors for metal cations. The selected sensing paradigm was the binding site-signalling <b>subunit</b> <b>approach.</b> The synthetized receptors employs a chromophore (fluorescein or BODIPY) skeleton as signalling subunit and it is functionalized with aminoethoxy moieties as binging site; the metal coordination reduces the electron-donating ability of the nitrogen atom conjugated to the chromophore resulting in optical changes noticeable to the naked-eye. The sensing behavior is highly selective to trivalent cations (Fe 3 +, Al 3 + and Cr 3 +) with remarkable limits of detection. The receptors based on BODIPYdyes retain the sensing abilities in mixed aqueous solutions. The remaining chapters of the thesis are centered in the detection and removal of nerve agents surrogates. The design, synthesis, characterization and application of new BODIPY chemosensors were studied. These chemosensors were designed containing different reactive sites in order to avoid interferences produced by acids or hydrolysis products, and also be able to distinguish between the different G-nerve agent mimics (DCNP and DFP). The BODIPY-probes allows screening of nerve agent surrogates with remarkable limits of detection and optical changes noticeable to the naked-eye. The sensing abilities are retained in solid support, allowing practical application in real-time monitoring by simple colorimetric tests. The displacement assay approach has been used to develop a selective sensor for V-nerve agent surrogates versus G-type. For this purpose, two Eu 3 + and Au 3 + BODIPY-complexes were prepared. In this case, V-surrogate is capable of coordinate the metallic center, releasing the BODIPY ligand. This causes a change in the optical properties visible to the naked-eye. Finally, the use of supramolecular-based organocatalyst for destruction of OP nerve agent surrogates was studied. Hydrolysis studies were performed in presence of 1, 3 -diindolylureas and thioureas, amines, aminoalcohol and glycols. Addition of catalyst enhances the electrophilic character of the P atom, and the final nucleophilic attack of water that results {{in the formation of the}} corresponding less toxic organophosphate derivatives, thus higher hydrolysis rates are obtained.

40|$|History {{shows that}} {{vaccines}} are most easily developed for those organisms that induce natural immunity after a single infection. For malaria, partial antiparasite immunity develops only {{after several years}} of endemic exposure. Evidence suggests that this inefficient induction of immunity is partly a result of antigenic polymorphism, poor immunogenicity of individual antigens, the ability of the parasite to interfere with the development of immune responses and to cause apoptosis of effector and memory T and B cells, and the interaction of maternal and neonatal immunity. Vaccine strategies that are likely to be ultimately successful are those that combine many antigens to induce a maximal response to protective determinants that might not be normally recognized following normal infection of naive individuals. Whole organismal approaches and the use of ultra-low doses of antigens have shown success in human and animal studies by inducing enhanced immune responses to multiple antigens.

40|$|Traditional {{vaccines}} {{derived from}} attenuated or inactivated pathogens are effective at inducing antibody-based protective immune responses, but {{tend to be}} highly reactogenic, causing notable adverse effects. Vaccines with superior safety profiles can be produced by <b>subunit</b> <b>approaches,</b> utilizing molecularly defined antigens (e. g. proteins and polysaccharides). These antigens, however, often elicit poor immunological responses, necessitating the use of adjuvants. Immunostimulatory adjuvants {{have the capacity to}} activate antigen presenting cells directly through specific receptors (e. g. Toll-like receptors (TLRs)), resulting in enhanced presentation of antigens as well as secretion of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Consequently, innate immune responses are amplified and adaptive immunity is generated. Recently, site-specific conjugation of such immunostimulatory adjuvants (e. g. TLR ligands) onto defined antigens has shown superior efficacy over unconjugated mixtures, suggesting that the development of chemically-characterized immunostimulatory adjuvants and optimized approaches for their conjugation with antigens may provide a better opportunity for the development of potent, novel vaccines. This review briefly summarizes various TLR agonists utilized as immunostimulatory adjuvants and focuses on the development of techniques (e. g. recombinant; synthetic, and semisynthetic) for generating adjuvant-antigen fusion vaccines incorporating peptide or protein antigens...|$|R

The mechanism of eukaryotic fork arrest remains unknown. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the promiscuous DNA binding protein Sap 1 not only causes polar fork arrest at the rDNA fork barrier Ter 1 but also regulates mat 1 imprinting at SAS 1 without fork pausing. Towards an understanding of eukaryotic fork arrest, we probed the interactions of Sap 1 with Ter 1 as contrasted with SAS 1. The Sap 1 dimer bound Ter 1 with high affinity at one face of the DNA, contacting successive major grooves. The complex displayed translational symmetry. In contrast, Sap 1 <b>subunits</b> <b>approached</b> SAS 1 from opposite helical faces, forming a low-affinity complex with mirror image rotational symmetry. The alternate symmetries were reflected in distinct Sap 1 -induced helical distortions. Importantly, modulating protein-DNA interactions of the fork-proximal Sap 1 subunit with the nonnatural binding site DR 2 affected blocking efficiency without changes in binding affinity or binding mode but with alterations in Sap 1 -induced DNA distortion. The results reveal that Sap 1 -DNA affinity alone is insufficient to account for fork arrest and suggest that Sap 1 binding-induced structural changes may result in formation of a competent fork-blocking complex...|$|R

The V 3 regions of HIV- 2 and SIV isolates, minimally related to the HIV- 1 homolog, share significant sequence homology and are immunogenic in monkeys {{as well as in}} humans. Whereas the crown of the V 3 loop is cross-reactive among HIV- 1 isolates and elicits neutralizing antibodies of broad specificity, the SIV and especially HIV- 2 crown peptides were not well recognized by cross-neutralizing antisera. V 3 loop peptides of HIV- 2 isolates did not elicit neutralizing antibodies in mice, guinea pigs, or a goat and together with SIV V 3 peptides did not inhibit serum neutralization of HIV- 2 and SIV. Thus, the V 3 loops of HIV- 2 and SIV do not appear to constitute simple linear neutralizing epitopes. In view of the immunogenicity of V 3 peptides, the failure of conserved crown peptides to react with natural sera implies a significant role of loop conformation in antibody recognition.

The dual role of lipoproteins in the immunity to and pathogenicity of mycobacteria is discussed here...|$|R
40|$|Two {{decades after}} a {{worldwide}} vaccination campaign {{was used to}} successfully eradicate naturally occurring smallpox, the threat of bioterrorism has led to renewed vaccination programs. In addition, sporadic outbreaks of human monkeypox in Africa and a recent outbreak of human monkeypox in the U. S. {{have made it clear}} that naturally occurring zoonotic orthopoxvirus diseases remain a public health concern. Much of the threat posed by orthopoxviruses could be eliminated by vaccination; however, because the smallpox vaccine is a live orthopoxvirus vaccine (vaccinia virus) administered to the skin, the vaccine itself can pose a serious health risk. Here, we demonstrate that rhesus macaques vaccinated with a DNA vaccine consisting of four vaccinia virus genes (L 1 R, A 27 L, A 33 R, and B 5 R) were protected from severe disease after an otherwise lethal challenge with monkeypox virus. Animals vaccinated with a single gene (L 1 R) which encodes a target of neutralizing antibodies developed severe disease but survived. This is the first demonstration that a <b>subunit</b> vaccine <b>approach</b> to smallpox-monkeypox immunization is feasible...|$|R
40|$|Retinal photoreceptors use the heterotrimeric G protein {{transducin}} {{to couple}} rhodopsin to a biochemical cascade that underlies the electrical photoresponse. Several isoforms of each transducin subunit {{are present in}} the retina. Although rods and cones seem to contain distinct transducin subunits, it is not known whether phototransduction in a given cell type depends strictly on a single form of each <b>subunit.</b> To <b>approach</b> this question, we have deleted the gene for the rod transducin alpha-subunit in mice. In hemizygous knockout mice, there was a small reduction in retinal transducin alpha-subunit content but retinal morphology and the physiology of single rods were largely normal. In homozygous knockout mice, a mild retinal degeneration occurred with age. Rod-driven components were absent from the electroretinogram, whereas cone-driven components were retained. Every photoreceptor examined by single-cell recording failed to respond to flashes, with one exception. The solitary responsive cell was insensitive, as expected for a cone, but had a rod-like spectral sensitivity and flash response kinetics that were slow, even for rods. These results indicate that most if not all rods use a single transducin type in phototransduction...|$|R
40|$|Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is {{the leading}} cause of bronchiolitis and viral death in infants. Despite decades of {{research}} with traditional or <b>subunit</b> vaccine <b>approaches,</b> there are no approved RSV vaccines. New approaches are therefore urgently needed to develop effective RSV vaccines. Methods. We developed viruslike particles (VLPs) consisting of an influenza virus matrix (M 1) protein core and RSV-F or-G on the surface. We tested the immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of these VLPs (RSV-F, RSV-G) in a mouse model. Results. Intramuscular vaccination with RSV-F or RSV-G VLPs elicited IgG 2 a dominant RSV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses against RSV-A 2 viruses in both serum and lung extract. Mice immunized with VLPs (RSV-F or RSV-G) showed higher viral neutralizing antibodies in vitro and significantly decreased lung virus loads in vivo after live RSV-A 2 challenge. RSV-G VLPs showed better protective efficacy than RSV-F VLPs as determined by the levels of lung virus loads and morbidity postchallenge. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that VLP vaccination provides effective protection against RSV infection. VLPs containing RSV-F and/or RSV-G are potential vaccine candidates against RSV. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) {{is the leading}} cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants and childre...|$|R
40|$|Tetrameric haemoglobins {{display a}} {{cooperative}} ligand binding behaviour, {{which has been}} attributed to the functional interrelationship between multiple ligand binding sites. The quantitative description of this feature was initially carried out with a phenomenological approach, which was limited to the functional effect of the occupancy by a ligand molecule of a binding site on further binding steps. However, subsequent development of structural-functional models for the description of the cooperativity in haemoglobin brought about a much deeper information on the interrelationships between ligand binding at the heme and structural variations occurring in the surrounding free <b>subunits.</b> This <b>approach</b> opened the way to the evolution of the concept of allostery, which is intended as the structural-functional effect exerted by the presence of a ligand in a binding site on other binding sites present in the same molecule. This concept can be applied to either sites for the same ligand (homotropic allostery) and for sites of different ligands (heterotropic allostery). Several models trying {{to take into account the}} continuous building up of structural and functional information on the physicochemical properties of haemoglobin have been developed along this line.

40|$|The rate {{of protein}} {{evolution}} is generally thought to reflect, {{at least in}} part, the proportion of amino acids within the protein that are needed for proper function. In the case of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), this premise led to the hypothesis that, because the AGPase small subunit is more conserved compared with the large subunit, {{a higher proportion of}} the amino acids of the small subunit are required for enzyme activity compared with the large subunit. Evolutionary analysis indicates that the AGPase small subunit has been subject to more intense purifying selection than the large subunit in the angiosperms. However, random mutagenesis and expression of the maize (Zea mays) endosperm AGPase in bacteria show that the two AGPase subunits are equally predisposed to enzyme activity-altering amino acid changes when expressed in one environment with a single complementary subunit. As an alternative hypothesis, we suggest that the small subunit exhibits more evolutionary constraints in planta than does the large subunit because it is less tissue specific and thus must form functional enzyme complexes with different large <b>subunits.</b> Independent <b>approaches</b> provide data consistent with this alternative hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of complex kinetic mechanisms is proposed {{that consists of}} two steps, (i) building of an kinetic scheme from experimental data other than steady-state kinetics and (ii) numerical simulation and {{analysis of}} the kinetics of the proposed scheme in relation to the experimental kinetics. Procedures are introduced to deal with large numbers of enzymatic states and rate constants, and numerical tools are defined to support the analysis of the scheme. The approach is explored by taking the mannitol permease of Escherichia coli as an example. This enzyme catalyzes both the transport of mannitol across the cytoplasmic membrane and the phosphorylation of mannitol. The challenge is to deduce the transport properties of this dimeric enzyme from the phosphorylation kinetics. It is concluded that (i) the steady-state kinetic behavior is largely consistent with the proposed catalytic cycle of the monomeric subunit, (ii) the kinetics provide no direct support but also do not disprove a coupled translocation of the binding sites on the two monomeric <b>subunits.</b> The <b>approach</b> reveals the need for further experimentation where the implementation of experimental results in the scheme conflict with the experimental kinetics and where specific experimental characteristics do not show up in the simulations of the proposed kinetic scheme. ...|$|R
40|$|The major isoforms of the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) {{receptor}} {{are composed}} of two alpha, two beta and one gamma subunit. Thus alpha and beta subunits occur twice in the receptor pentamer. As it is well documented that different isoforms of alpha and beta subunits can co-exist in the same pentamer, the question is raised whether the relative position of a subunit isoform affects the functional properties of the receptor. We have used subunit concatenation to engineer receptors of well-defined subunit arrangement to study this question. Although all five subunits may be concatenated, we {{have focused on the}} combination of triple and dual subunit constructs. We review here what is known so far on receptors containing simultaneously alpha 1 and alpha 6 subunits and receptors containing beta 1 and beta 2 subunits. Subunit concatenation may not only be used to study receptors containing two different subunit isoforms, but also to introduce a point mutation into a defined position in receptors containing either two alpha or beta subunits, or to study the receptor architecture of receptors containing unconventional GABAA receptor <b>subunits.</b> Similar <b>approaches</b> may be used to characterize other members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, glycine receptors and 5 -HT 3 (5 -hydroxytryptamine) receptors...|$|R
