The use of its fibre as an admixture with jute and also in paper and cardboard manufacture is already documented. The present investigation highlights the effect of plant growth regulators like gibberelic acid (GA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) on the quality of bast fibres in A. esculentus. The fibre quality was best in GA 100 + NAA 50 g mL– 1 treatment. Fibre macerate studies showed an increase in fibre length and the slenderness ratio was also high. The Runkel ratio for the above treated fibre was between 1 and 2 rendering it suitable for the textile industry. Proximate analysis of retted fibres revealed a lower moisture and ash content and an increase in wax content. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis registered a high crystallinity index. The physico- -mechanical properties showed considerable improvement of fibre quality. Considering the above criteria, GA 100 + NAA 50 g mL– 1 treatment brought about advantageous changes for improving the quality of fibres.

40|$|During {{the recent}} years the {{radiation}} of walking noise ("drum sound") of laminate floor coverings has become an important product property for marketing. Producers of floors are optimizing their products using attached underlays to attenuate drum sound, and the EPLF developed a measurement and evaluation procedure in cooperation with research institutes: A modified tapping machine is operating on the sample area laid in a test room with concrete floor and sufficient sound absorption. The stationary sound signal is recorded and post-processed using the Zwicker loudness analysis. The result is an overall loudness value (in Sone) and a diagram of specific loudness where the frequency components of the sound can be assessed. Today, very different types of underlay attachements for drum sound attenuation are in use. The range of materials comprises duroplastic or thermoplastic coatings, more or less stiff thermoplastic mats, recycled plastics, rubber mats, and <b>soft</b> <b>fibre</b> boards. Experiences from measurements for many floor and underlay products carried out at WKI show that the materials can perform very differently. But {{this is not only}} due to the type of underlay of floor material. Drum sound attenuation is a combined effect of laminate properties, thickness and stiffness of the underlay and the laying method. The difference of overall loudness values between "silent" and "loud" products can be up to 25 Sone. Typical for laminate floorings are a lower frequency peak (400 [...] . 1000 Hz) - probably caused by resonance effects between the areas mass of the laminate flooring and the stiffness and thickness of the underlay - and another peak at 2000 [...] . 3000 Hz corresponding to a "rattling" sound from the hard covering. Some products with underlays show a good attenuation of "rattling" sound components, others a shift of the low-frequency components in the spectra. The technical development of material combinations with improved performance is going on. There is still a need for modelling the process of drum sound generation and radiation so that further improvements can be expected...|$|E

Samples {{of these and other}} rare animal fibres from different origins of production and processors were objectively measured for fibre diameter, fibre curvature (FC, crimp) and resistance to compression (softness). While there were curvilinear responses of resistance to compression to FC and to mean fibre diameter, FC accounted for much more of the variance in resistance to compression. Fibre type was an important determinant of resistance to compression.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{processing}} {{and evaluation of}} chemically retted kenaf bast (Hibiscus cannabinus) was carried out using sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphite. The bast of the kenaf plant was retted with 5 % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 5 % sodium sulphite (Na 2 SO 3) at 100 o C for 10 mins. The extracted fibres were subjected to bleaching with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Mercerization process was carried out on the bleached fibres {{in order to improve}} the quality of the fibres. The kenaf bast was converted into clean, lustrous, smooth and <b>soft</b> <b>fibres</b> using the retting, bleaching and mercerization processes. The effects of these treatments were further evaluated using a tensile strength machine and a viscometer. It was observed that the samples retted with Na 2 SO 3 and its corresponding bleached fibre had relatively high tensile strength and low viscosity values while those retted with NaOH and its corresponding bleached samples gave lower tensile strength and high viscosity values. The implication of this is that the samples retted with Na 2 SO 3 were slightly affected while those retted with NaOH were affected most. This was attributed to the inefficiency of NaOH in removing the impurities of the fibre completely and as such lead to lower tensile strength and high viscosity while the reverse is the case for Na 2 SO 3 retted and bleached fibres. The corresponding viscosity of mercerized fibre of NaOH retted samples was low whereas that of Na 2 SO 3 was high. From the results obtained, it indicates that Na 2 SO 3 is a better retting agent than NaOH...|$|R

The clutch consists of two eggs which are generally oval, pale greenish and white with spots and streaks, becoming more dense at the broad end. Sometimes, eggs may be plain grey without markings as well. When collecting cobwebs they are often seen at windows of homes, a time when they also sometimes end up tapping the window, possibly at their own reflection. The eggs are usually laid in the morning. The eggs are incubated by both the male and female. The incubation period varies from 14 to 16 days. The chicks fledge in about 17 days and continue to be fed by the male for a few days. Helpers, females or possibly juveniles from the previous brood may sometimes assist the parents in feeding the young. Old nests are sometimes reused.

It presents novel techniques for the fabrication of <b>soft</b> glass optical <b>fibre</b> based devices, novel techniques for the direct measurement of glass melt properties and the optical characterization of all fabricated devices, including a novel technique for measuring the evolution of ultra-short pulses along sub-wavelength tapered optical fibre. New photonic devices fabricated from <b>soft</b> glass optical <b>fibres</b> are of scientific interest due to the high non-linearity and high refractive index. However for the increased understanding and controlled fabrication of such devices, measured values of the physical properties of the glass melts are required, and for many new materials this information is either unavailable or must be obtained for the exact conditions that the devices are produced. This thesis presents new methods for the measurement of surface tension and viscosity at the same conditions as the fabrication of the optical devices presented, {{through the use of a}} scanning CO₂ laser. It also reports previously unpublished surface tension values for several glass compositions and investigates the effect the glass making environment had on the resulting surface tensions. Novel fabrication techniques for new soft glass optical devices are also presented, including the pressurised tapering of Bismuth MOF using an elliptical CO₂ laser beam control the rate of microstructure collapse or expansion such as to produce a photonic crystal device whereby the zero dispersion wavelength varies as a function of displacement along the taper length.

40|$|This thesis investigates new fibre {{technologies}} and their application in nonlinear optical systems, designed mainly for telecommunications. The thesis includes {{a study of}} two different directions in achieving a high nonlinearity in a fibre system, namely holey fibres filled with nonlinear liquids and soft glass, small core microstructured fibres. The challenges arising from the development of liquid-filled structures have made <b>soft</b> glass microstructured <b>fibres</b> the technology of choice for the realisation of highly nonlinear systems Amongst the various soft glasses, commercially available lead-silicate glasses are identified as the material {{for the development of}} highly nonlinear fibres. Small-core, leadsilicate fibres with different designs are considered within this thesis. A solid core holey fibre design as well as two all-solid designs, a multi-ring cladding and a simpler W-index profile, are characterised. The measurements confirm the advantages of the all-solid designs over the holey structures and reveal the possibility to achieve simultaneously a high nonlinear coefficient and a novel dispersion profile in such fibres. Some of the presented fibres are employed in all-optical wavelength conversion schemes based on fourwave-mixing. Numerical simulations and experimental results are combined to study the performance of the fibres and demonstrate their use in wavelength conversion devices. In particular, a lead-silicate W-index profile fibre, showing a high nonlinear coefficient of 820 W− 1 km− 1 with a near zero dispersion profile at telecoms wavelengths, is employed to demonstrate a flat conversion gain in the whole C-band. The same fibre is then employed in FWM-based systems to demonstrate multi-channel wavelength conversion, generation of high repetition rate pulses and all-optical demultiplexing. The experiments presented in this thesis clearly reveal the potential of small-core soft-glass fibres for nonlinear applications. The use of <b>soft</b> glass microstructured <b>fibres</b> in the mid-IR is also investigated.

6000|$|It {{is after}} the {{marriage}} of Julie to Wolmar that {{the action of the}} story takes the turn which sensible men like Voltaire found laughable. Saint Preux is absent with Admiral Anson for some years. On his return to Europe he is speedily invited by the sage Wolmar, who knows his past history perfectly well, to pay them a visit. They all meet with leapings on the neck and hearty kisses, the unprejudiced Wolmar preserving an open, serene, and smiling air. He takes his young friend to a chamber, which is to be reserved for him and for him only. In a few days he takes an opportunity of visiting some distant property, leaving his wife and Saint Preux together, with the sublime of magnanimity. At the same time he confides to Claire his intention of entrusting to Saint Preux the education of his children. All goes perfectly well, and the household presents a picture of contentment, prosperity, moderation, affection, and evenly diffused happiness, which in spite of the disagreeableness of the situation is even now extremely charming. There is only one cloud. Julie is devoured by a source of hidden chagrin. Her husband, [...] "so sage, so reasonable, so far from every kind of vice, so little under the influence of human passions, is without the only belief that makes virtue precious, and in the innocence of an irreproachable life he carries at the bottom of his heart the frightful peace of the wicked."[51] He is an atheist. Julie is now a pietest, locking herself for hours in her chambers, spending days in self-examination and prayer, constantly reading the pages of the good Fénelon.[52] [...] "I fear," [...] she writes to Saint Preux, [...] "that you do not gain all you might from religion in the conduct of your life, and that philosophic pride disdains the simplicity of the Christian. You believe prayers to be of scanty service. That is not, you know, the doctrine of Saint Paul, nor what our Church professes. We are free, it is true, but we are ignorant, feeble, prone to ill. And whence should light and force come, if not from him who is their very well-spring?... Let us be humble, to be sage; let us see our weakness, and we shall be strong."[53] This was the opening of the deistical reaction; it was thus, associated with everything that struck imagination and moved the sentiment of his readers, that Rousseau brought back those sophistical conclusions which Pascal had drawn from premisses of dark profound truth, and that enervating displacement of reason by celestial contemplation, which Fénelon had once made beautiful by the persuasion of virtuous example. He was justified in saying, as he afterwards did, that {{there was nothing in the}} Savoyard Vicar's Profession of Faith which was not to be found in the letters of Julie. These were the effective preparations for that more famous manifesto; they surrounded belief with all the attractions of an interesting and sympathetic preacher, and set it to a harmony of circumstance that touched <b>softer</b> <b>fibres.</b>|$|R

40|$|As the {{appetite}} for data use across telecommunications networks {{is predicted to}} continue to grow rapidly in the coming years, there is an increasing need to address the bandwidth gap that exists between the optical links that underpin high speed networks and the electronic layer typically used for processing signals at the endpoints. Nonlinear fibre optics is a potential avenue to addressing this bandwidth bottleneck, where nonlinear optical phenomena can be exploited to perform signal processing tasks, thereby allowing the broad bandwidth of optical media to be used for signal processing as well as transmission. Indeed the development of such optical signal processing devices is crucial to moving towards the next generation of communications technology - where ultra fast telecommunication networks with speeds approaching 1 Tb/s are required. This work explored the use of the enhanced optical nonlinearity and dispersion engineering possible in <b>soft</b> glass microstructured <b>fibres</b> as a basis for developing devices for broadband telecommunications applications at 1. 55 μm. Two applications were considered in this research, namely multicasting and phase sensitive amplification - both of which are signal processing applications that are important to the realisation of all optical networks. A number of soft glass materials were studied in this research, primarily those with high nonlinear refractive indices such as chalcogenides, tellurites, bismuth oxide based glasses and germanates. During the course of this work a novel lead germanate glass was also developed. This glass was shown to have a high nonlinear index and relatively high mechanical strength when compared to tellurite glasses of similar refractive indices. Dispersion tailored, <b>soft</b> glass <b>fibre</b> designs were developed for both multicasting and phase sensitive amplification. The design geometry, referred to as a ‘hexagonal wagon wheel design’, was a hybrid model combining a hexagonal array geometry for dispersion engineering with a suspended core or ‘wagon wheel’ geometry for high nonlinearity. The fibre designs were optimised for each application by using a genetic algorithm based optimisation technique to achieve high and broad gain suitable for efficient signal processing at extremely high bit rates. Each fibre design was modelled for its intended application to demonstrate, numerically, that the designs were indeed capable of performing their intended application over a broad band. The modelling work used a numerical beam propagation model and demonstrated that the designs were capable of operating at the extremely high bit rate of 640 Gb/s. Advances were made to fabrication techniques during the fabrication trials of these novel designs due to the complex nature of the designs and, in some cases, the use of novel materials. A first generation, simplified hexagonal wagon wheel fibre was fabricated in the novel germanate glass developed earlier. A number of characterisation experiments were also performed on fabricated microstructured fibres, including a measurement of the dispersion profile for a tellurite fibre (that was shown to be in good agreement with modelling results) and the measurement of the nonlinear index for a fibre fabricated with the novel germanate glass - one of the few such measurements in the literature for this family of glasses. In addition to these fabrication advances and characterisation experiments, a study of dispersive waves was performed on previously fabricated hexagonal wagon wheel fibres in collaboration with colleagues at the University of California, Merced. These experiments were used to study soliton propagation in these fibres at near infrared wavelengths. Comparison of experimental data to theoretical models is shown to have good agreement - an important validation of the modelling technique. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Design The questionnaire was developed based on the literature, past experiences and feedback from a small pilot study (n 10). Test and retest (2 weeks later) of the questionnaire was done to investigate test–retest reliability. Data of four non-consecutive 24 h recalls were collected to investigate the predictive validity with food (fruit, vegetables, milk, snacks, <b>soft</b> drinks), nutrient (<b>fibre,</b> ascorbic acid, Ca, percentage energy from fat) and energy intakes. Setting At home, {{in the presence of a}} student. Subjects Convenience sample of fifty-five Belgian-Flemish adolescents approached by university students for course credits. Results Test–retest correlations of the constructs ranged between 0 · 51 and 0 · 78. Eleven of the eighteen final constructs were significantly associated with one or more of the five selected food items, all in the expected direction. Most significant associations with the food items were found for taste, perceived peers’ behaviour and availability of soft drinks at home. Fresh fruit and soft drinks were correlated with most constructs (seven) followed by snacks (five). Concerning energy and the selected nutrient variables, the findings were less clear. Conclusions The results are promising: the test–retest stability was moderate to good; most of the psychosocial constructs were significantly associated with one or more of the selected dietary variables. Future work in a larger sample of European adolescents is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Mira Sanders FDC Satellite, Brussels, Belgium Visual {{analysis}} and anecdotal descriptions converge in ‘Silent Letters’ (2009), the six video {{works at the}} centre of Belgian artist Mira Sanders’ exhibition ‘Invisible Lines’. A series of diaristic observations subtitling everyday scenes – cats darting over cobblestone paths and around beach volleyball games – spin travelogue commentary and light philosophy into epistolary entries that always refer back to ‘the line’. The lines in Sander’s work are both everywhere and nowhere: nondescript scenes provide an occasion to talk about boundaries and borders, from the volleyball net bisecting the frame of Silent Letter 22012009 (2009) to a reference to hopscotch. Likewise, the choppy flow of pedestrians walking past policemen regulating traffic in Silent Letter 27042008 (2009) speaks to guidelines and boundaries of an invisible order. A rolling progression of texts – set against a black background in Silent Letter, # Quotations (2009) – further emphasize the elusiveness of subdivisions, shifting the focus from boundaries to the line as {{it is used to}} create perspective. In one quote appearing in the video, excerpted from ‘The Horizon: A See – change’, Johann Wolfgang van Goethe credits the ‘simple noble line’ of the horizon as gifting him with not only inspiration, but the capability of drawing himself into relation with his surroundings. Relationships of scale are further explored in two black and white photographs of the hatched-line incisions on a cutting board in the artist’s studio next to crumpled bits of paper, <b>soft</b> balls of <b>fibre</b> and a spare cutting blade (Scale 1 : 2500 [Studio # 1 and # 2], 2009). In contrast, a selection of punchy and playful drawings from ‘Le dialogue de sourds’ (Dialogue of the Deaf, 2005 –ongoing) maps a conversation between images supplied by Sanders and accompanying texts added by art historian Marie-Pascale Gildemyn. There is no clear narrative in this humorous and sketchy series of vignettes that clarifies the purpose of the exchange, but it has lasted for six years. The drawing Paradis Artificiel. Paradis Perdu. Paradou (ill. 3) (Artificial Paradise, Paradise Lost, Paradou [ill. 3], 2005), for example, pairs an isolated palm tree with a brief note taken from a Wikipedia entry on an oasis. Sanders takes an ambling approach towards thinking about lines, but she is right in the sense that most are imagined or invisible. In its best moments, Sanders’ epistolary mode of address approaches competent poetry – but a series of contour line drawings of overlapping and continuously touching workplace tools on view in a back room overextend the trope of the line in a bit of thematic overkill. These works refer to the edges and borders of objects in a far too literal sense, missing at least two key elements that makes Sander’s otherwise promising work so strong: the artist addressing the landscape and viewer as a foreign observer and the weaving of critical observations into imaginative fictions through correspondence.
