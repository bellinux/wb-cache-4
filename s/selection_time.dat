5|$|Three Egyptian swimmers, {{one female}} and two males, {{qualified}} for the Olympics. American-born Farida Osman, the woman, was {{the youngest member of}} the 2012 national delegation and {{qualified for the}} Games based on having made the Olympic Standard Time in the 50-metre freestyle. In the lead up to the Olympics, she won seven gold medals at the 2011 Pan Arab Games, as well as the 50-metre butterfly title at that year's All-Africa Games and World Junior Championships. In London she was sixth in her heat in the 50-metre freestyle and was eliminated from the tournament, ranking 42nd overall. On the men's side, Shehab Younis qualified for the 50-metre freestyle by meeting the Olympic <b>Selection</b> <b>Time</b> of 22.88 at an international meet in Eindhoven, Netherlands, with a result of 22.85. Prior to the Olympics he had won a bronze medal in the event at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London he was third in his heat and 34th overall, failing to advance to the semifinals. Mazen Metwaly, a Saudi-born Egyptian training and studying at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, made the team at an Olympic qualifier in Setúbal, Portugal in June 2012, the second of his two opportunities (his first having been the 2011 World Championships). At the Games, in the marathon 10 kilometre, he was 24th out of 25 competitors.|$|E

In addition, as Algorithms  4 – 6 in this paper reduce the <b>selection</b> <b>times</b> of UMTS and increase the <b>selection</b> <b>times</b> of LTE when considering the preferences, the number of handovers are reduced to some extent compared with Algorithms  1 – 3, respectively.|$|R

However, it is not readily apparent whether or not GUI users could realize the advantages of impenetrable borders without instruction. The purpose of this experiment was to assess whether or not users would discover the benefits of impenetrable borders spontaneously. Results suggest that only 50 % of participants who were unaware of the presence of the impenetrable border actually detected it. Additionally, with practice participants who were successful at detecting the impenetrable border selected the targets as quickly as participants who received full instruction concerning the benefits of impenetrable borders...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} how people {{search for a}} known target item in an unordered pull-down menu, this research presents cognitive models that vary serial versus parallel processing of menu items, random versus systematic search, and different numbers of menu items fitting into the fovea simultaneously. Varying these conditions, models were constructed and run using the EPIC cognitive architecture. The <b>selection</b> <b>times</b> predicted by the models are compared with <b>selection</b> <b>times</b> of human subjects performing the same menu task. Comparing the predicted and observed times, the models reveal that 1) people process more than one menu item at a time, and 2) people search menus using both random and systematic search strategies.

30|$|The <b>selection</b> of <b>time</b> {{interval}} (t_st and t_fi in Figure  3) used {{to estimate}} Teq also causes uncertainties. Sometimes, there are step changes or other variations due to movement of the tool or the surrounding sediment/water. Some operations in Hole C 0008 A showed multiple temperature spikes, suggesting multiple penetrations (Expedition 316 Scientists, 2009). Upon processing, they are excluded from the data regression, but such disturbances can remain in the subsequent data, affecting the estimation. Besides, the <b>selection</b> of <b>time</b> intervals by eye can result in somewhat arbitrary time intervals, depending on the operation. If the penetration is made ideally, we empirically know that Teq {{does not depend on}} the selected time interval, but there are cases where Teq varies with the <b>selection</b> of <b>time</b> interval.|$|R
