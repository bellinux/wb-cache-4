GMRP consists in reassigning a set of services into a set of machines for which {{the aim is to}} improve the machine usage while satisfying numerous constraints. This paper proposes an evolutionary <b>simulating</b> <b>annealing</b> (ESA) algorithm for solving this problem. <b>Simulating</b> <b>annealing</b> (<b>SA)</b> is a single solution based heuristic, which has been successfully used in various optimisation problems. The proposed ESA uses a population of solutions instead of a single solution. Each solution has its own SA algorithm and all SAs work in parallel manner. Each SA starts with different initial solution which can lead to a different search path with distinct local optima. In addition, mutation operators are applied once the solution cannot be improved for a certain number of iterations. This will not only help the search avoid being trapped in a local optima, but also reduce computation time. Because new solutions are not generated from scratch but based on existing ones.

40|$|ISBN: 978 - 1 - 4244 - 2824 - 6 International audienceDesign of Software Defined Radio (SDR) {{systems is}} very {{challenging}} {{because it is}} very difficult to design a system that preserves most of the properties of the ideal software radio while being realizable with current day technology. The complexity of such systems is the bottleneck and without a careful design approach, no feasible realization may appear. This article introduces a new methodology for selecting the common operators to design SDR. It aims at minimizing the resources use. An SDR consists of software components whose behavior can be changed by reconfiguration procedure. In a common operator design this change requires only an adjustment of certain parameters. In order to optimize the choice of these operators we first make an oriented graph that shows the interrelationship between various components of the system. Then, an architectural exploration extracts the common operators of a given multi-standard system. The need for optimization in software defined radios is underlined and the two selected techniques for the optimization are thoroughly described. The benefits of <b>simulating</b> <b>annealing</b> (<b>SA)</b> technique are exemplified by a comparison with exhaustive search strategies for optimization...|$|R
