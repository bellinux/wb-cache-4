50|$|The inescutcheon - {{the smaller}} shield within the bigger one - which already {{appeared}} on Brakel's coins in 1227, is {{the arms of}} the Lords of Brakel, who were the town's overlords until their male line died out in 1268. On {{the south side of the}} Town Hall is found an armorial stone, believed to be from the 16th century, that only shows the Lords' arms. Even written records from Paderborn in the 18th century contain only this inner shield as Brakel's coat of arms. From the late 13th century, the town of Brakel used a seal whose composition matches the blazon given above. A <b>seal</b> <b>stamp</b> used beginning in 1316 is still kept in the town archive today. When the coat of arms was newly adopted in 1907, the town chose to have the 1316 <b>seal</b> <b>stamp</b> composition in its arms. The colours seen in the inescutcheon are simply the town's colours, as the old Lords' armorial colours are unknown. In this form, the coat of arms was given Royal approval on 18 March 1908.|$|E

50|$|Two main {{types of}} seals {{were used in}} the Ancient Near East, the stamp seal and the {{cylinder}} <b>seal.</b> <b>Stamp</b> seals first appeared in ‘administrative’ contexts in central and northern Mesopotamia in the seventh millennium and were used exclusively until the fifth millennium. Cylinder seals appeared first around 3600 bc in southern Mesopotamia and south-western Iran (Middle Uruk Period). They gradually replaced stamp seals, becoming the tool of a rising class of bureaucrats {{in the early stages of}} state formation. Even though stamp seals were still produced in the third and second millennia, cylinder seals predominated. In the first millennium, stamp seals made a strong comeback and eventually replaced cylinder seals entirely.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{was granted}} by the Freiburg Government Presidium on 2 November 1981. It is a melding of Waldshut's and Tiengen's two former coats of arms.

From his outfit, the man is taken to be a ranger (Waldhüter), and is {{therefore}} also deemed to be a [...] "canting" [...] coat of arms, being somewhat suggestive of the former town's name. The Madonna and Child on the right side come from Tiengen's old town seal, and are also known to date back quite a long way. They are, however, emblazoned a bit differently compared to the originals.|$|E

50|$|In 2001 {{the castle}} site {{attracted}} strong interest from archaeologists {{due to the}} well-preserved state of its ruins. Since then a comprehensive investigation has been carried out. This included physical inspections of the site, a magnetic survey, ground resistance measurements and aerial photography. The {{results showed that the}} earth mound of the motte conceals a layer of rubble. Wooden stakes found in the wet soil underground were submitted for dendrochronological dating and found to date from around 1370-1380. Other finds during the ground inspections were shards of pottery and pieces of roof tile. One exceptional find was the discovery of a <b>seal</b> <b>stamp</b> made of a lead-tin alloy which portrayed the coat of arms of the lords of Hademstorf as the former lords of the castle. In spite of intensive surveying, a more recent excavation has not been carried out and is not planned. The historic monument can be reserved for future research as the conditions in the wet valley of the Aller are ideal for its preservation.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages, Hackenheim {{belonged to}} the “Further” County of Sponheim, and then passed after that house had died out into joint rule by the Margraviate of Baden and Electoral Palatinate. From 1707 until the late 18th century, the latter was the only lord. The inescutcheon, or small shield within the arms, is partly canting (the two hoes, which are called Hacken in German) and partly drawn from the arms once borne by the Counts of Sponheim (the “chequy” pattern). The inescutcheon is {{inspired}} by an old court seal {{known to have been}} used in 1584 and 1604 (an original <b>seal</b> <b>stamp</b> is kept at the Darmstadt State Archive, with a plaster copy at the Mainz State Archive). Saint Michael is the local church patron, whom the municipality wanted to combine with the historical composition in the inescutcheon. The inescutcheon is also about {{the only part of the}} arms for which the German blazon names tinctures. The arms have been borne since 1953 when they were approved by the Rhineland-Palatinate Ministry of the Interior.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of etched carnelian beads and non-etched barrel beads in Kish and Ur (modern Iraq), Jalalabad (Afghanistan) and Susa (Iran) {{attest to the}} popularity of the Indus bead industry across West Asia. The lapidaries select stones of variegated colours, producing beads of different shapes and sizes. The methods of Lothal bead-makers were so advanced that no improvements have been noted over 4,000 years—modern makers in the Khambhat area follow the same technique. Double-eye beads of agate and collared or gold-capped beads of jasper and carnelian beads are among those attributed as uniquely from Lothal. It was very famous for micro-cylindrical beads of steatite (chlorite).The Lothal excavation yielded 213 seals, third in volume amongst all Indus sites. Seal-cutters preferred short-horned bulls, mountain goats, tigers and composite animals like the elephant-bull for engravings. There is a short inscription of intaglio in almost every <b>seal.</b> <b>Stamp</b> seals with copper rings inserted in a perforated button were used to sealing cargo, with impressions of packing materials like mats, twisted cloth and cords, a fact verified only at Lothal. Quantitative descriptions, seals of rulers and owners were stamped on goods. A unique seal found here is from Bahrain—circular, with motif of a dragon flanked by jumping gazelles.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that ancient Egyptian <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> dated between the late Old Kingdom {{and the early}} Middle Kingdom are associated with burials of women and children, although the actual women-children ratio of the pertinent tombs has not been sufficiently substantiated. In order to test the hypothesis, this study will statistically examine the distribution of <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> in burials at the cemeteries of Qāw and Balāṭ. It will be argued that <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> were significantly more frequently found in tombs of women, as opposed to tombs of both men and children. Modern Western European classification {{may have led to}} some burials being classified as those of ‘children’, while they could have been defined differently in their own society. A good part of the‘child burials’ with <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> therefore probably belong to persons that were considered ‘full-grown’ in ancient Egypt or that imitated adult behaviour. Consequently, it is argued that a considerable number of ‘children’ with <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> had a female sex. As a result, <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> in tombs are likely to have been typically female attributes and should mainly be related to female concerns, such as fertility and protection during child delivery. The few <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> found in male tombs could have had an administrative function or also a protective usage,because these objects were sometimes found in combination with amulets and beads. status: publishe...|$|R
