5|$|Since {{it would}} {{eventually}} merge with the NFL, {{the history of}} the AFL's playoff system merits some explanation. For the 1960–68 seasons, the AFL used the two-divisional format identical to the NFL to determine its champion. There was no tie-breaker <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> so ties atop the Eastern Division final standings in 1963 and Western Division in 1968 necessitated playoff games to determine each division's representative in the championship.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{there was}} no <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> to allow prisoners to send letters; {{censorship}} arrangements were made through the Dominion Police in Ottawa, and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner welfare. As the war progressed, groups of detainees were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk {{and the number of}} inmates per institution. After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst, Nova Scotia. One of the prisoners transferred may have been Leon Trotsky, although this is disputed.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in China, MacMurray fell into disagreement with Washington over U.S. policy towards the ruling Kuomintang (Nationalist) government, which had been demanding immediate revisions to or a cessation of the treaty <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> between the two countries. Whereas Washington wished to make concessions to the Nationalist government, MacMurray favored the enforcement of existing treaties. These differences of opinion led him to resign in November 1929, whereupon he became a professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University.|$|E

However, {{just a few weeks}} following its release in North America to strong critical reception, Capcom announced the closure of Clover Studio.|$|E
5|$|From 1921–22, {{the third}} tier of The Football League {{consisted}} of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling {{to hold on to}} their league status. There was a re-election <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> which meant the bottom two teams in each of the two divisions had to apply for re-election to the league. Watford finished outside the top six league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kent's departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in 1926–27, but were unanimously re-elected to the league after a ballot of clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League. By contrast, under Neil McBain and subsequently Bill Findlay, the team recorded five consecutive top six finishes between 1934–35 and 1938–39, and won the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1937. The Football League was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Labor {{conducted}} an extensive campaign in marginal LCL {{seats at the}} 1965 election, resulting in 21 of 39 seats, with Frank Walsh and the Labor Party taking power. As Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, the youthful and charismatic Dunstan made his older peers look lethargic as television became increasingly ubiquitous. The LCL opposition changed leaders and installed the young Steele Hall, worrying Labor as the elderly Walsh appeared bumbling in contrast. This resulted in Labor replacing Walsh with Dunstan. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the LCL, Labor lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander {{and was able to}} convincingly sustain Playmander attacks with the effect of convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. Again with little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 seats at the 1970 election. With a fairer seat and boundary <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> Dunstan won three more elections, in 1973, 1975 and 1977.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, the SPC {{issued a}} high risk of severe weather for Central Kansas and central Nebraska, while {{moderate}} and slight risks for severe weather extended for areas far beyond. The low pressure <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> moved northward, but the extending front had barely moved. The storms were quick to develop. Severe weather reports were already coming in by late morning, and the first tornado reports came in during the early afternoon hours. The most intense activity took place during the late afternoon and evening hours as supercells developed along a long line from South Dakota to North Texas. Over 80 tornadoes were confirmed that day, along with hail as large as softballs and straightline winds as strong as 90mph (145km/h). The activity weakened in the late evening, but not before the last tornadoes were reported in Iowa in the overnight hours.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E

5|$|With even a {{few hundred}} missiles, the Soviets could afford to target every US bomber base. With no warning <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> a sneak attack could destroy a {{significant}} amount of the US bomber fleet on the ground. The US would still have the airborne alert force and its own small ICBM fleet, but the USSR would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch, leaving them with a massive strategic advantage. To ensure this could not happen, the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases, Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period, along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit. Even Zeus would come too late to cover this period, and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy's RIM-8 Talos as an interim ABM.|$|E
5|$|Hockey Canada and the Soviet Hockey Federation met in Prague in April 1972 {{during the}} IIHF World Ice Hockey Championships. The two sides {{agreed on the}} terms: four games in Canada, {{to be held in}} Montreal (Montreal Forum), Toronto (Maple Leaf Gardens), Winnipeg (Winnipeg Arena), and Vancouver (Pacific Coliseum) and four games in the Soviet Union, all of them to be held in Moscow at the Luzhniki Ice Palace. The Canadians agreed to hold the series in September and play the games under {{international}} rules. The Canadians agreed to IIHF amateur referees in the Canada part of the series, and European referees in the Moscow games. The refereeing would use the international two referee system, not the one referee, two linemen <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in the NHL, and, at the time, being introduced into international play. The Canadian side agreed to the terms under the belief that the Canadians would have no difficulty winning under any set of conditions. Joe Kryczka, president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), who was present at the negotiations, felt however, that the Soviets had demanded the concessions for their own benefit, believing that their team was already equal to any NHL team. The NHL later requested dates in October or November but the idea was abandoned.|$|E
