40|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{and important}} developments in trial practice and procedure during this survey period came {{as the result}} of legislation. Headlining these new laws is a measure designed to combat frivolous lawsuits by empowering judges to award reasonable attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees and court costs against any party, plaintiff or defendant, who asserts a claim or defense that lacks substantial justification, or who otherwise abuses the process of adjudication. The adoption of this legislation spurred the supreme court to create a new tort of abusive litigation in Yost v. Torok. For the second consecutive year, the legislature shortened the time in which a plaintiff can voluntarily dismiss a civil action by notice; written notice to dismiss now must be given before the plaintiff rests. The legislature substantially revised Official Code of Georgia Annotated section 9 - 11 - 60, concerning relief from judgments, to abolish the use of the complaint in equity as <b>a</b> method of <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment.</b> Unfortunately, the new law seems inadvertently to have omitted lack of jurisdiction over the person as <b>a</b> basis for <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment.</b> This oversight will cause serious problems in challenging default judgments until corrected. Finally, the legislature enacted the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. The adoption of this uniform law, already on the statute books in twenty-eight other states, will greatly facilitate and simplify the enforcement of foreign judgments against debtors and property in this state by allowing, in substance, the practice used in federal courts of registering the authenticated judgment in lieu of bringing an action to enforce it. The authors will discuss these developments, along with some other significant state appellate court decisions, in the sections that follow...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the common}} law courts (e.g. Court of Common Pleas) a party to a civil action had a right of {{withdraw}} their claim/counterclaim by nonsuit up until verdict or judgment without prejudice to the launch of a fresh action. There was an equivalent right in the Court of Chancery to dismiss one’s own bill (as actions in that court were known as).When the courts were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 provision was made for the procedure to governed by rules of court. The 1875 rules provided for non suiting but also made provision for <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> of nonsuit. In 1883 the nonsuit provisions were repealed and replaced by discontinuance of an action.Thereafter it was subsequently ruled that nonsuiting ceased {{to exist in the}} High Court of Justice having been wholly displaced by the provisions relating to discontinuance.In the County Court the County Court rules continued to provide for nonsuiting until the Rules of the Supreme Court and the County Court Rules were repealed and replaced by the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 [...] which only provided for discontinuance. This brought nonsuiting to an end in mainstream England & Wales (although one cannot comment for e.g. actions in the High Court of Chivalry).|$|R

Also, the Court noted that separation of powers did not prevent Congress from changing applicable law and then imposing {{the consequences of the}} court's application of the new legal standard. Finally, the Court {{held that the}} stay provision did not interfere with core judicial functions, as it could not be determined whether the time limitations interfered with judicial functions by its relative brevity.|$|R

50|$|In law, <b>a</b> {{motion to}} <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>judgment</b> is <b>an</b> {{application}} to overturn or <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>a</b> court's <b>judgment,</b> verdict or other final ruling in a case. Such a motion is proposed by a party who is {{dissatisfied with the}} end result of a case. Motions may be made at any time after entry of judgment, and in some circumstances years after the case has been closed by the courts. Generally the motion cannot be based on grounds which were previously considered when deciding a motion for new trial or on an appeal of the judgment, thus the motion can only be granted in unusual circumstances, such as when the judgment was procured by fraud which could not have been discovered {{at the time of the}} trial, or if the court entering the judgment lacked the jurisdiction to do so.|$|R
5000|$|After {{rejecting the}} defendant’s {{argument}} that judgment had been irregularly entered, her Honour discussed {{the circumstances in}} which the court will <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>a</b> regularly obtained <b>judgment,</b> reiterating that the defendant providing a satisfactory explanation for the failure to appear and the length of delay for making the application are both factors that the court will consider. However, citing the Australian Capital Territory case of Sue Oclee Pty Ltd v Bak (1979) 29 ACTR 8, her Honour went on to emphasise the requirement for the defendant to have a prima facie defence on the merits::The decision whether or not to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>a</b> default <b>judgment</b> is discretionary. An affidavit in support of <b>an</b> application to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>judgment</b> entered into in default of appearance to a writ of summons must set out all the defences on which the defendant intends to rely and briefly set out the facts by which the defendant seeks to establish such defences. A mere statement by the defendant that he or she has a good defence is not sufficient to justify a review of the exercise of judicial discretion. The defendant must demonstrate [...] "a very compelling reason" [...] for the failure to appear and that it has a plausible defence either in law or in fact. Before allowing a defendant to come in and defend, the court should have before it material which enables it to say how it came about that the defendant found itself bound by <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> regularly entered; that the defendant genuinely desires to be allowed to come in and present its case; and that issues are raised in such a form as to require serious consideration of the defence put forward.|$|R

[...] Immediately after the ruling was issued, the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department announced that it would request that the case be depublished so it could not be used as a precedent by other men in Mr. Navarro's situation. That request was later denied by the California Supreme Court.|$|R
50|$|In the United States the law {{relating}} to <b>a</b> default <b>judgment</b> {{depends upon the}} jurisdiction within which the civil action was filed. State courts, United States Federal Courts, Tribal Courts and many Administrative Agencies have their own laws and local procedural rules {{relating to}} the granting and <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> of <b>a</b> default <b>judgment.</b> The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rules 55 and 60) are the basis for many procedures in default. Federal Rule 37(b)(iii) states that a balky plaintiff {{can be found in}} default and have his case dismissed if the plaintiff repeatedly fails to comply with things like court orders and discovery requests.|$|R
50|$|Whatever {{the grounds}} {{on which the}} {{rescission}} of <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> may be sought at common law, it is abundantly clear, the court found, that at common law any cause of action relied on as <b>a</b> ground for <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> <b>a</b> final <b>judgment,</b> must have existed at {{the date of the}} final judgment. There must be some causal connection between the circumstances which give rise to the claim for rescission and the <b>judgment.</b> If <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> is obtained in respect of a disposition not for value, no ground exists for <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> such judgment merely because the disposition was not made for value and it is proved that, immediately after such disposition, the judgment debtor's liabilities exceeded his assets. It is only if insolvency or liquidation supervenes that such a disposition acquires legal significance by reason of the provisions of section 26 of the Insolvency Act, read with, {{in the case of a}} company, section 181 of the Companies Act But it does not follow that <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> in respect of such a disposition can on that account be <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> under common law, for, when the judgment was granted, no grounds existed for <b>setting</b> it <b>aside.</b> The court was fully entitled to grant the judgment on all the facts, and the causa which existed at the date of the judgment.|$|R
40|$|The {{rationale}} {{underlying the}} court 2 ̆ 7 s discretionary power to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>a</b> default <b>judgment</b> {{is easy to}} state. Where a claim is determined {{as a consequence of}} a party 2 ̆ 7 s failure to comply with procedural rules, that determination ought not necessarily be determinative. It ought not because the court 2 ̆ 7 s primary function is to determine claims on their substantive merits. To ensure that the court has power to comply with that primary purpose it ought therefore have the power to revoke, in appropriate circumstances, judgments entered in default, i. e. judgments entered on grounds other than substantive ones. The application of this power, particularly its translation into concrete rules that can be applied consistently, has not however been straightforward. Embedded in the myriad rules developed to guide the courts in exercising this jurisdiction lie distinctions between the following: (a) regular and irregular judgments; (b) arguable and triable issues; and (c) the 2 ̆ 2 real prospect of success 2 ̆ 2 test, the ex debito justitiae rule and the 2 ̆ 2 bound to lose 2 ̆ 2 test. This has led to a degree of confusion in the application of the associated tests which in turn may have obscured the true rationale behind the discretionary power to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> default judgments. Inasmuch as Singapore derived its rules of civil procedure from England, it has been no less spared from these difficulties...|$|R
