30|$|There {{are various}} types of wheels used in wheeled mobile robots including: standard, castor and {{omnidirectional}} wheels. The proposed design in this paper uses two <b>standard</b> <b>wheels</b> powered by two motors. The advantages of the used <b>standard</b> <b>wheels</b> include the simplicity in design and manufacturing and the relatively good reliability. The small size of used wheels (10  cm diameter) helps in providing better stability and stronger grip with the floor. This adds to the stability and rigidity of the entire system while carrying out material handling tasks. The simple manufacturing process of <b>standard</b> <b>wheels</b> assures minimum positioning errors while movement.|$|R

40|$|Train <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> must be {{periodically}} inspected {{for possible}} or actual premature failures {{and it is}} very significant to record the wear history for the full life of utilization of <b>wheel</b> <b>sets.</b> This means that an online measuring system could be of great benefit to overall process control. An online non-contact method for measuring a <b>wheel</b> <b>set’s</b> geometric parameters based on the opto-electronic measuring technique is presented in this paper. A charge coupled device (CCD) camera with a selected optical lens and a frame grabber was used to capture the image of the light profile of the <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> illuminated by a linear laser. The analogue signals of the image were transformed into corresponding digital grey level values. The ‘mapping function method’ is used to transform an image pixel coordinate to a space coordinate. The images of <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> were captured when the train passed through the measuring system. The rim inside thickness and flange thickness were measured and analyzed. The spatial resolution of the whole image capturing system is about 0. 33 mm.

High-speed acquisition and processing method for high resolution image of <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> based on the hardware platform of DSP (digital signal processor) and PC was proposed. High-speed acquisition and processing was completed by PC and DSP unit separately. PC and DSP unit worked in parallel operational mode. Ethernet transport program based on TCP was designed for data exchange. Asynchronous reset pulse generation circuits were designed. High resolution images of <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> were captured in 500 fps and asynchronous reset mode. Resolution of images was 1280 * 1024.

40|$|As a {{means of}} transport, the railway is gaining in importance, and this has {{inspired}} {{a large number of}} innovations. International rail traffic, for example, and logistics solutions need to be improved, but technical safety must also be guaranteed, especially for high-speed trains. Reliability and availability of high-speed trains depends significantly on the quality of <b>wheels,</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> axles. There are, indeed, already a large number of national and international rules and regulations, for example on the inspection of <b>wheels,</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> and tracks, which take this into account. European and – not least – Fraunhofer research together with industrial partners have assumed a leading role in this process, resulting in international demand for inspection systems developed in Europe.
