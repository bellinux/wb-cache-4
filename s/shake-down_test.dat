50|$|In February 2008, aged 18, Hartley got {{his first}} taste of Formula One. He was invited to perform a show run for Red Bull Racing in Riyadh. From here he {{performed}} the initial three-day <b>shake-down</b> <b>test</b> for Scuderia Toro Rosso's 2008 spec car, the STR3.|$|E
50|$|Guthrie {{qualified}} for and {{competed in the}} 1977 Indianapolis 500, but finished 29th with engine troubles. She would compete in two more Indy 500s, finishing ninth in the 1978 race. Overall, she competed in 11 Indy car events with a best finish of fifth. During her unsuccessful bid {{to qualify for the}} 1976 race, many of the drivers in the male-dominated sport stated that the reason she did not qualify was mainly due to her gender. These comments angered then three-time champion A. J. Foyt to the point he lent Guthrie a back-up car to conduct a <b>shake-down</b> <b>test.</b> Her top practice lap in Foyt's car would have been adequate to qualify for the field. Largely because of her gender, she was unable to obtain funding through corporate sponsorship, and was forced into retirement.|$|E
50|$|After {{leaving the}} factory, the first vehicle was only trialed by doing some {{circuits}} {{of the company}} campus and trundling over a few rocks and beams {{set up by the}} designer to provide a degree of <b>shake-down</b> <b>testing</b> as well as a demonstration course. Urgent operational requirements dictated that the first unit be shipped to theater as fast as possible and those involved in the project decided that the risk of doing so was outweighed by the advantages of having the vehicle available. The Cougar was fully trialed when it became part of the MRAP program.|$|R
40|$|Direct Chemical Oxidation is an {{emerging}} ``omnivorous`` waste destruction technique which uses {{one of the}} strongest known oxidants (ammonium peroxydisulfate) to convert organic solids or liquids to carbon dioxide and their mineral constituents. The process operates at ambient pressure and at moderate temperatures (80 [...] 100 C) where organic destruction is rapid without catalysts. The byproduct (ammonium sulfate) is benign and may be recycled using commercial electrolysis equipment. The authors have constructed and initially tested a bench-scale facility (batch prereactor and plug-flow reactor) which allows treatability tests on any solid or liquid organic waste surrogate, with off-gas analysis by mass spectroscopy. <b>Shake-down</b> <b>tests</b> of the plug flow reactor on model chemical ethylene glycol confirmed earlier predictive models. Pre-reactor tests on water-immiscible substances confirmed destruction of cotton rags (cellulose), kerosene, tributyl phosphate and triethylamine. The process is intended to provide an all-aqueous, ambient pressure destruction technique for difficult materials not suitable or fully accepted for conventional incineration. Such wastes include solid and liquid mixed wastes containing incinerator chars, halogenated and nitrogenated wastes, oils and greases, and chemical or biological warfare agents...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Single Heater Test (SHT), {{the design of the}} test, and the {{borehole}} layout were reported by OCRWM M&O (1996 a). Briefly, the main {{purpose of the}} SHT is to study the thermal- mechanical behavior of the densely welded non-lithophysal Topopah Spring tuff at the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF). The SHT is also used as a <b>shake-down</b> for the <b>test</b> of the coupled thermal- mechanical- hydrological-chemical (TMHC) processes...|$|R
40|$|Melter {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the retention of technetium and other volatiles in glass while processing simulated Low Activity Waste (LAW) streams through a DM 10 melter equipped with a prototypical off-gas system that concentrates and recycles fluid effiuents back to the melter feed. To support these tests, an existing DM 10 system installed at Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL) was modified to add the required recycle loop. Based on the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) LAW off-gas system design, suitably scaled versions of the Submerged Bed Scrubber (SBS), Wet Electrostatic Precipitator (WESP), and TLP vacuum evaporator were designed, built, and installed into the DM 10 system. Process modeling was used to support this design effort {{and to ensure that}} issues associated with the short half life of the {sup 99 m}Tc radioisotope that was used in this work were properly addressed and that the system would be capable of meeting the test objectives. In particular, this required that the overall time constant for the system was sufficiently short that a reasonable approach to steady state could be achieved before the {sup 99 m}Tc activity dropped below the analytical limits of detection. The conceptual design, detailed design, flow sheet development, process model development, Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) development, control system design, software design and development, system fabrication, installation, procedure development, operator training, and Test Plan development for the new system were all conducted during this project. The new system was commissioned and subjected to a series of <b>shake-down</b> <b>tests</b> before embarking on the planned test program. Various system performance issues that arose during testing were addressed through a series of modifications in order to improve the performance and reliability of the system. The resulting system provided a robust and reliable platform to address the test objectives...|$|R
40|$|The Single-Heater Test (SHT) was one {{phase of}} the {{field-scale}} thermal testing program of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project. The {{primary purpose of the}} SHT was to study the thermomechanical (TM) behavior of the densely welded, non-lithophysal Topopah Spring tuff at the Exploratory Studies Facility. The SHT was also used as a <b>shake-down</b> for <b>testing</b> thermal-hydrologic-chemical-mechanical processes in situ, testing that will be conducted in the Drift-Scale Test. In the SHT, a line-heat source 5 -m long was emplaced in a pillar and used to heat the pillar for approximately nine months. The thermal field was relatively cylindrical about the line-heat source. The heater was turned off after nine months of heating, and the rock mass was monitored during the cool-down for another nine months, until May 28, 1997, when the test was terminated...|$|R
40|$|A lab-scale biomass fast {{pyrolysis}} system {{was designed and}} constructed based on an auger reactor concept. The design features two intermeshing augers that mix biomass with a heated bulk solid material {{that serves as a}} heat transfer medium. A literature review, engineering design process, and <b>shake-down</b> <b>testing</b> procedure was included as part of the system development. A response surface methodology was carried out by performing 30 experiments based on a four factor, five level central composite design to evaluate and optimize the system. The factors investigated were: (1) heat carrier inlet temperature, (2) heat carrier mass feed rate, (3) rotational speed of the reactor augers, and (4) volumetric flow rate of nitrogen used as a carrier gas. Red oak (Quercus Rubra L.) was used as the biomass feedstock, and S- 280 cast steel shot was used as a heat carrier. Gravimetric methods were used to determine the mass yields of the {{fast pyrolysis}} products. Linear regression methods were used to develop statistically significant quadratic models to estimate and investigate the bio-oil and biochar yield. The optimal conditions that were found to maximize bio-oil yield and minimize biochar yield are high nitrogen flow rates (3. 5 sL/min), high heat carrier temperatures (625 yC), high auger speeds (63 RPM) and high heat carrier feed rates (18 kg/hr). The produced bio-oil, biochar and gas samples were subjected to multiple analytical tests to characterize the physical properties and chemical composition. These included determination of bio-oil moisture content, solid particulate matter, water insoluble content, higher heating value, viscosity, total acid number, proximate and ultimate analyses and GC/MS characterization. Statistically significant linear regression models were developed to predict the yield of gaseous carbon monoxide, the hydrogen content, moisture content and water-insoluble content of the bio-oil, and the vapor reaction temperature at the reactor outlet. A significant result is that with increasing bio-oil yield, the oxygen to carbon ratio and the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the wet bio-oil both decrease, largely due to a reduction in water content. The auger type reactor is currently less researched than other systems, and the results from this study suggest the design is well suited for fast pyrolysis processing. The reactor as designed and operated is able to achieve high liquid yields (greater than 70 %-wt.), and produces bio-oil and biochar products that are physically and chemically similar to products from other fast pyrolysis reactors...|$|R
40|$|This DOE {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop and}} test an instrumented data-acquisition sub that is mounted in a drill string below the top drive and used to detect downhole events. Data recorded at the surface during drilling operations would then be processed and presented to the driller to discern undesirable drilling conditions and help optimize drilling rates and maximize the life of components in the BHA. This instrumented sub was originally conceived and developed solely as a single-point collection center for rig data {{that would be used}} in a number of Noble's products. The sub was designed to collect hook load, rotary torque, rotary speed, rotary position, drill pipe pressure, mud temperature, triaxial vibration, and triaxial magnetometer data. The original design and fabrication was by Sandia National Labs under Noble's direction, which was then tested with Sandia's diagnostics-while-drilling downhole package. After initial results were analyzed, the team surmised that important information describing performance and condition of the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was embedded in the data recorded by the instrumented sub, and began investigating the potential of using surface measurements from the sub to highlight problems occurring downhole before they could be discerned by the driller. Later, a proposal was submitted to DOE for funding to more broadly investigate use of the system for detecting downhole problems while drilling. Soon after DOE awarded this contract, the Noble team responsible for the previous developments was disbanded and their work terminated (due to factors unrelated to the sub development). This change halted the complementary work that Noble had planned to conduct during the DOE project, and necessitated that all the development work be completed by the DOE project. More effort was expended on the project to develop a field-ready prototype than was originally foreseen. The sub's design had to be significantly modified during the project based on results of field tests. The original slip ring for communication was replaced with a radio link, which makes the sub easier to move to different rigs and simplifies the set-up process. In addition, the sub's previous design would prevent it being used on oil and gas rigs due to potential explosion hazard. The sub was redesigned so that during operation all electrical components on the sub are under a blanket of nitrogen. A pressure switch is used so that, should a leak develop, the sub will shut itself down until any problems are repaired. A total of four series of field tests were conducted. The first (mentioned above) was part of the original Noble-sponsored program and in conjunction with Sandia's diagnostics-while-drilling system. Although these tests highlighted important problems, they showed significant promise for the concept, and the sub was returned to Sandia for early repairs and modifications. After the DOE project took possession of the sub, it was tested three more times in the field. The first two DOE tests had the same objective, which was to establish that the sub could function correctly on the rig and deliver usable data, and to develop procedures for setting up and operating the sub and support computer on a rig. During the first test most of the time was spent troubleshooting the sub. Several significant problems were revealed, demonstrating that the current design was not robust enough to survive typical oil field operations. The sub was then redesigned to increase its robustness and allow it to run safely in areas where explosive gases might be present. Once these changes were implemented, the sub was sent to a second <b>shake-down</b> field <b>test.</b> The new design was found to be greatly improved. The sub operated throughout the test, and quality of the data was significantly higher. Near the end of this project, a final field test was conducted with the objective of creating (or simulating) specific problem conditions and recording data to determine if signatures could be recorded and identified that, after analysis, might signify particular types of drilling activities or conditions. Tests included normal rig operations as well as dropping the string, bit stick/slip, bit bounce, and rough drilling. The sub worked very well throughout these tests, and signatures were obtained for each of the conditions. Some events, most notably stick/slip and rough drilling, exhibited unique signatures that were recorded by the instrumented sub. The final field tests were conducted in a relatively shallow well, and further testing is needed to determine the range of depths from which usable signals can be detected. However, these tests clearly demonstrated that useful data can be gathered in this manner and that much of this data, typically collected by several sensors in various locations, can be collected at a single point and that the data are of higher quality than is often the case...|$|R
