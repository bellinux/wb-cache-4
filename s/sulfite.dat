5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of <b>sulfite</b> and urate, {{in much the same way}} as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Many calcium {{compounds}} {{are used}} in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids. Calcium lactobionate is a white powder that {{is used as a}} suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium <b>sulfite</b> is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5000|$|Many wines {{contain a}} warning label about <b>sulfites,</b> {{and some people}} believe that <b>sulfites</b> are the cause of RWH and other {{allergic}} and pseudoallergic reactions. However, {{this may not be}} the case. Dried fruit and processed foods like lunchmeat have more <b>sulfites</b> than red wine. Reactions to <b>sulfites</b> are not considered a [...] "true allergy" [...] and reactions more commonly occur in persons with asthma and may manifest themselves in difficulty breathing or skin reactions, rather than headache. It is unclear if consuming alcohol in combination with <b>sulfites</b> may have a different effect.|$|R
50|$|Most beers {{no longer}} contain <b>sulfites,</b> {{although}} some alcoholic ciders contain them.

5|$|Sprigg {{relocated}} to Cumberland in 1890. He {{was one of}} three incorporators of the Allegany County Bar Association, and in 1899 he was elected by the association as one of its directors. He unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Cumberland city council in 1905 and a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates in 1907. In response to pollution of the North Branch Potomac River, Sprigg became chairman of the Pure Water League and waged a successful campaign to require the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company to abandon the <b>sulfite</b> process of pulping in favor of a cleaner soda pulping method. While chairman of the Allegany County Democratic Convention in 1907, a resolution supporting an eight-hour workday was formally adopted by the convention. In 1908, he was appointed city attorney for Cumberland. Following a prolonged illness, he died in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Though {{molybdenum}} forms compounds {{with various}} organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout {{the human body}} as MoO42−. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and the number is increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, <b>sulfite</b> oxidase and xanthine oxidase. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} molybdenum in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum concentration also affects protein synthesis, metabolism, and growth.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sulfites</b> occur {{naturally}} in all wines to some extent. <b>Sulfites</b> are commonly introduced to arrest fermentation at a desired time, {{and may also}} be added to wine as preservatives to prevent spoilage and oxidation at several stages of the winemaking. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) protects wine from not only oxidation, but also from bacteria. Without <b>sulfites,</b> grape juice would quickly turn to vinegar.|$|R

30|$|Only one peer-reviewed paper {{addresses}} consumers’ {{willingness to}} pay for wine labeled with “no <b>sulfites</b> added” (Costanigro et al. 2014). They find a price premium of $ 0.64 per 0.75  L bottle for no sulfite-added wine in the U.S. market. Respondents who report experiencing headaches after consuming wine drive this result. When the sample is separated into headache sufferers and non-headache sufferers, their respective {{willingness to pay}} for no <b>sulfites</b> added are $ 1.23 and $ 0.33. These results would suggest that consumers would pay less for bottles of wine with added SO 2 and that regulations preventing organic growers from adding SO 2 are not resulting in lowered prices. However, this survey asked respondents about their experiences with headaches after drinking wine, and then proceeded to give them choice experiments with bottles labeled with organic, no <b>sulfites</b> added, and/or no special label. Such an ordering may have led respondents to attach a larger negative association to <b>sulfites</b> than they may attach to <b>sulfites</b> when actually purchasing wine.|$|R

25|$|With new {{regulations}} {{in place in}} 1975, Saugbrugsforeningen initiated a process to reduce its emissions. NOK212 million were invested between 1975 and 1978, involving a collection system for <b>sulfite</b> waste, a new chemical treatment plant, two external sedimentation pools and two electric boilers. By 1980 the situation in Iddefjorden had improved, but by 1985 the improvements had stagnated and further measures were required.|$|E
25|$|Established as Saugbrugsforeningen in 1859, {{the company}} {{consolidated}} the sawmill operations along Tista, demolishing them {{and building a}} new sawmill.

25|$|After {{the first}} half of the 1970s gave high prices, the company {{experienced}} low prices during the latter part of the decade. Meanwhile, it was a severely unmodern mill, oftentimes employing archaic and inefficient production processes. Per Ethold was hired as chief executive officer in 1977 and started the process of modernizing the mill. By 1981 all auxiliary production mills were closed, including fine-grade paper, <b>sulfite</b> pulp and sawed wood. This led to major layoffs and demonstrations by the labor unions.|$|E
25|$|A TMP mill was {{installed}} 1977, {{but not until}} a series of upgrades were completed in 1992 could the former grindstone production be scrapped {{and the need to}} buy <b>sulfite</b> cellulose could be dropped. PM3 became operational on 23 June 1981. The machines have been through several major upgrades, the most extensive in the late 1980s and early 2000s. A deinking mill became operational in June 2000. Proposals for PM4, which would have produced magazine paper, were abandoned after the plans to build a gas-powered on-site thermal power plant were scrapped by Industrikraft Midt-Norge.|$|E
25|$|Norske Skog's board {{decided in}} December 1990 {{to close the}} <b>sulfite</b> pulp mill and build a new {{magazine}} paper machine, PM6. The decision to terminate cellulose production was both caused by the environmental impact {{as well as by}} a steady diminishing demand for chemical pulp. The recession following the dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that exports to Eastern Europe were decimated. Meanwhile, new production technologies for paper had less demand for cellulose. The closing resulted in a loss of 210 jobs, of which 25 were transferred to PM6 and 50 were retired early. Construction of the new mill took place at Skakkestad, to the northeast of the main facility. Originally PM6 was proposed to produce light weight coated paper, but after Stora bought the technological partner Feldmühle, PM6 had to revert to supercalender.|$|E
