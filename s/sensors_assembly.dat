40|$|International audienceThe {{land vehicle}} {{navigation}} using very few GPS updates is studied {{in this paper}} using a low-cost MEMS <b>sensors</b> <b>assembly</b> integrated with a conventional GPS receiver. The <b>sensors</b> <b>assembly</b> is composed of triad of accelerometers, gyrometers, magnetometers {{as well as a}} pressure sensor, and can easily be taken in or off the car. Since in most of cities, downtown areas block GPS signals, conventional receivers {{may not be able to}} compute 3 D or even 2 D fixes. Therefore, to augment the availability of the position solution in harsh environments, pseudorange and pseudorange rate measurements are fused in a Kalman Filter (KF) with the Dead Reckoning (DR) solution provided by the <b>sensors</b> <b>assembly</b> following a tight integration scheme. In the developed vehicular navigation algorithm, the MEMS sensors are used to provide reliable attitude information of the vehicle. It also propagates the position of the vehicle in three dimensions. A conventional GPS receiver gives pseudorange and pseudorange rate measurements for the tight integration. External ephemeredes are used to estimate the satellite Doppler contribution in the user-to-satellite Line Of Sight (LOS). Results show that as soon as two satellites are tracked, the overall accuracy of the integrated positioning system increases. Moreover, the availability of the position solutions is also augmented. Depending on the type of harsh environments, namely classical or deep urban canyons, heavy map-matching algorithms are not required with such low-cost sensors integration. However, the integration scheme is dependent on the satellite geometry with respect to the user's heading. When a bad satellite configuration is detected, the Integrated Navigation System (INS) relies exclusively on the IMU data. As a consequence, the INS may experience systematic drift for long periods (> 1 min) without any GPS updates...|$|E

40|$|Close {{inspection}} and grasping of space objects and local adhesion to spacecraft external surfaces represent key technologies for several on-orbit servicing operations, such as components repair or refurbishment, tanks refuelling and automatic assembly. Furthermore, {{the capability of}} capturing and controlling the motion of non-cooperative targets having irregular shape is becoming a crucial issue for active debris removal. This paper presents the conceptual development and numerical evaluation of an innovative system for attaching to non-cooperative objects, based on (1) a simple and compact infrared <b>sensors</b> <b>assembly</b> for target location and (2) an adhesive hand grip that conforms {{to the shape of}} the target interface. On one hand, the location assembly is based on infrared lasers which send impulses towards the target and an array of infrared sensitive elements to detect the back-scattered radiation. By taking differential measurements of the detector outputs generated by the reflected impulses with high accuracy, it is possible to determine the target object distance and the target surface orientation in the grasping system reference frame. The instrument is compact, made of low-cost components and requires lower computational capabilities than camera-type sensors. To assess the sensors system performance, a numerical model has been realized for the instrument and the environmental noise. Simulation results are finally presented to evaluate the uncertainty of the target orientation and distance estimates. On the other hand, the hand grip employs a flexible electro-adhesive layer mounted on a tripod mechanism, which provides the requested interface rigidity and is capable of adapting to different target shapes. Moreover, it benefits from the presence of a damping joint that manages the relative motion between target and grasping system, reducing the reactions transmitted to the base. The passive joint dissipates part of the total kinetic energy possibly reducing the power budget requirements for the active control.

This thesis activity {{was carried out in}} the Advanced System Technology (AST) division, Remote Monitoring group of STMicroelectronics, which is involved in the study and development of wearable devices for the collection of physiological parameters. The main objective of this tesis is the development of an EEG wireless sensor, to be integrated in a wireless sensor network for sleep monitoring, with the minimum channels number required to characterize the microstructure of sleep, by using a chip developed at STMicroelectronics, HM 121, not yet available on the market. The chip HM 121 is an integrated bio-potential acquisition system originally designed for the ECG and body-impedance signal acquisition. A preliminary feasibility study is conduced to define the minimum number of channels necessary for the sleep classification purpose and from this analysis the choise of using one EEG channel and one EOG channel is proposed and the electrodes positioning is defined. Thus the design of a low-noise pre-amplifier stage to adapt the input dynamic range of EEG and EOG signals to that of HM 121 is developed. Design, simulations and noise analysis of the pre-amplifier stage are developed. The prototyping stage consists in the assembly of the pre-amplifier on a matrix board and in its connection to a PCB board developed at STMicroelectronics which embeds HM 121 and other <b>sensors.</b> <b>Assembly</b> strategies and bench tests to validate the system functioning are completely conduced.

The developed prototype is a wearable and unobtrusive device, easily self-applicable by untrained people on the forehead and the essential aspect is that it may substitute the classical and extremely cumbersome polysomnography exam for sleep monitoring...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA microelectromechanical direction-finding sensor {{has been developed}} based on the mechanically coupled ears of the Ormia ochracea fly. Previous designs determined the direction of sound relative to the normal of the sensor by using the sound pressure level at the sensor. However, these designs suffered from a left-right ambiguity. To overcome these shortcomings, a dual <b>sensor</b> <b>assembly</b> was created. Two sensors co-located at an offset angle allow direction finding across 120 °. This eliminated ambiguous angles and the requirement for a sound pressure level. For this study, the dual <b>sensor</b> <b>assembly</b> was fabricated using two custom circuit boards powered by a 9 V battery and arranged on a 3 D-printed mount. The resonant frequency of the sensors produced a 260 V/Pa output at 1. 690 kHz ± 20 Hz. Experimental work was done in an anechoic chamber, and outputs were captured using lock-in amplifiers. The angle error ranged from less than 0. 3 ° close to the normal axis (0 °) to 3. 4 ° at the limits of coverage, ± 60 °.
