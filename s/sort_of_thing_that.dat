According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E

Anyone who buries their head in the sand is a bit naïve. And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life." ...|$|E

He {{described}} Saturday as the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> a committee directed to produce a 'novel of our time' would write, the politics were [...] "banal"; the tone arrogant, self-satisfied and incompetent; the characters cardboard cut-outs. He felt McEwan strove too hard to display technical knowledge [...] "and his ability to put that knowledge into good, clean prose".|$|E

500|$|Brownlee {{wanted to}} call an {{election}} in 1929 after his government won control of Alberta's natural resources, but could not convince his cabinet or his caucus. [...] Taking advantage of a period of increased popularity to call an early election was considered immoral {{by many in the}} UFA, the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the old-style parties might try but which the UFA had been elected to hold itself above. [...] As such, an election was not held until June 19, 1930, four years less nine days after the previous one.|$|E
500|$|Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone {{called the}} track a [...] "striking departure" [...] in sound for Del Rey, and said its groove {{transformed}} her [...] "from chanteuse into frontwoman {{for a few}} glorious moments". In a review of Ultraviolence, Mike Diver of Clash {{said that in the}} context of the album, [...] "West Coast" [...] took on greater significance by serving as a fulcrum which balances the record into [...] "leaving a better impression than it otherwise might". Consequence of Sound's Sasha Geffen described the song as [...] "a counterintuitive gem" [...] and [...] "the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> rings beautifully from old car windows on hot summer evenings," [...] while Marissa G. Muller of Vice called the track [...] "one of the Golden State's best-ever anthems".|$|E
500|$|The game's use of supernatural and cave-exploring {{elements}} received criticism, {{and several}} reviewers opined that more realistic, mansion-robbing missions {{should have been}} used instead. Presley believed that the game's undead enemies caused the game to [...] "degenerate into the standard hack 'n' slash, sub-Conan <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> Heretic, [...] and a million others gave us," [...] and that [...] "it amounts to [...] an erosion of the storytelling skills that Looking Glass once had." [...] Gillen decried certain levels for [...] "infring on Tomb Raider territory, and then [...] quite pull it off". Larka found certain levels too difficult. Next Generation noted that while [...] "sneaking can get repetitive", Thief is [...] "still a fun game to play" [...] and [...] "a worthy addition to the genre." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} of the Ninja Gaiden series, Eurogamer said that Ninja GaidenIII {{was the only}} game in the NES trilogy not to make it to Europe. They made similar criticisms about the difficulty level, saying that the North American version was made more difficult than the Japanese version by utilizing limited continues, making the enemies much more powerful, and removing the password system present in the Japanese version. They said the story was too outlandish, calling the plot, of which a short-lived anime Ninja Gaiden series would loosely be based, [...] "a glorious load of old bollocks". While the version from Ninja Gaiden Trilogy for the Super NES remedied most of their criticisms, they said that the game added new frustrations which included slower framerates, lower-quality controls, and the omission and shuffling around of several tracks, which they said [...] "is precisely the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> makes die-hard videogame fans apoplectic with rage".|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic. Sara Scribner from Los Angeles Times said that A Thousand Leaves was a {{monotonous}} [...] "experimental, psychedelic record" [...] that felt [...] "like a passionless, less thoughtful shadow of [...] former self". J.D. Considine of Entertainment Weekly stated similar cons, calling the record [...] "the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> gives art rock a bad name." [...] Ben Ratliff of Rolling Stone found the songs to be unnecessarily long and sluggish, commenting that the album [...] "really does {{sound like a}} demo — eleven songs waiting for better organization and cliché removal". Similarly, Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club felt that the album rarely contained fully formed songs and that the band should start [...] "completing its ideas before recording them for posterity." [...] Orlando Weekly criticized Gordon's [...] "contrived and annoying" [...] vocal delivery, saying that many songs are [...] "merely lengthy feedback collages with pasted-on vocals and gobs of art-school pretension", but also admitted that the album contains some [...] "hidden gems" [...] like [...] "Sunday" [...] and [...] "Wildflower Soul".|$|E
500|$|Walla claimed on October 18, 2007, that a {{new album}} was [...] "in full swing" [...] {{and that they had}} six songs completed. He went on to call the new music [...] "weird," [...] "spectacular," [...] and [...] "creepy," [...] saying that it {{contained}} [...] "lots of blood." [...] He noted that the album had a [...] "Can jam" [...] that lasted 10 minutes, which Walla said that he would have never imagined doing in 1998. In a Billboard piece in January 2008, the band promised the album to be a [...] "curve ball" [...] and said that although it would have slower songs, there would be some surprises. Walla said, [...] "I'm really excited about it. It's really got some teeth. The landscape of the thing is way, way more lunar than the urban meadow <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has been happening {{for the last couple of}} records." [...] Walla added that the album was [...] "louder and more dissonant and ... abrasive." [...] They claimed that they were influenced by [...] "synth-punk band Brainiac." ...|$|E

500|$|Although it {{enjoyed a}} degree of {{commercial}} success, the album received mixed reviews. Melody Maker deemed it [...] "a milestone {{in the history of}} awfulness", and the NMEs Richard Cook wrote: [...] "Like the poor damned Tommies that haunt his mind, Roger Waters' writing has been blown to hell... Waters stopped with The Wall, and The Final Cut isolates and juggles the identical themes of that elephantine concept with no fresh momentum to drive them." [...] Robert Christgau opined: [...] "it's a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it", and awarded the album a C+ grade. [...] More impressed, Rolling Stones Kurt Loder viewed it as [...] "essentially a Roger Waters solo album... a superlative achievement on several levels". [...] Dan Hedges of Record also approved, writing: [...] "On paper it sounds hackneyed and contrived – the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> was worked into the ground by everyone from P. F. Sloan to Paul Kantner. In Pink Floyd's case, it still works, partially through the understatement and ingenuity of the music and the special effects... but mostly through the care Waters has taken in plotting out the imagery of his bleak visions." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Imogen {{had visited}} Dartington Hall, a {{progressive}} school and crafts community near Totnes in Devon, {{which had been}} founded in 1925 by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst. [...] In 1941–42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942, while recuperating there, she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, [...] "the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> your father did {{in the old days}} at Morley College". Beginning in 1943, Imogen established [...] a one-year [...] course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Imogen's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: [...] "Hardly any of us could play... However bad we were, we went on". Imogen's teaching methods, heavily based on [...] "learning by doing" [...] and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Imogen at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: [...] "She knew exactly how, and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't be long before... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank".|$|E
500|$|Due to the band's lack of {{creative}} {{control on the}} first album, Smith exerted a greater influence on the recording of the Cure's second album Seventeen Seconds, which he co-produced with Mike Hedges. The album was released in 1980 and reached number 20 on the UK charts. A single from the album, [...] "A Forest", became the band's first UK hit single, reaching number 31 on the singles chart. The album was {{a departure from the}} Cure's sound up to that point, with Hedges describing it as [...] "morose, atmospheric, very different to Three Imaginary Boys." [...] In its review of Seventeen Seconds the NME said, [...] "For a group as young as the Cure, it seems amazing that they have covered so much territory in such a brief time." [...] At the same time, Smith was pressed concerning the concept of an alleged [...] "anti-image". Smith told the press he was fed up with the anti-image association that some considered to be [...] "elaborately disguising their plainness", stating, [...] "We had to get away from that anti-image thing, which we didn't even create in the first place. And it seemed like we were trying to be more obscure. We just didn't like the standard rock thing. The whole thing really got out of hand." [...] That same year Three Imaginary Boys was repackaged for the American market as Boys Don't Cry, with new artwork and a modified track list. The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases. At the end of the tour, Matthieu Hartley left the band. Hartley said, [...] "I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal, sombre music—the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> didn't interest me at all." ...|$|E

5000|$|Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} album 2.5 stars out of 5, {{and said that}} it [...] "may not be quite self-parody, but it's also not the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that's</b> going to make band hip again anytime soon. Not that they would even care".|$|R

2500|$|For this reason, Pasternak {{regularly}} avoided literary cafes {{where young}} poets regularly {{invited them to}} read their verse.

[...] They continued to call her voice [...] "an unabashedly loud and sexual fuck-you New York honk—that translates perfectly to rap." [...] In a 2017 Complex article about her, the editor wrote [...] "unapologetic does not begin to describe the totally unfiltered and sheer Cardi B-ness of Cardi B's personality. She's a hood chick who's not afraid to be hood no matter the setting. Cardi B is Cardi B 24/7, 365, this is why she resonates with people, and that same energy comes out in her music." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Russell, a {{denoting}} {{phrase is}} a singular noun phrase, {{preceded by a}} quantifier, whose predicate term is satisfied by some particular. Such phrases do not contribute objects as the constituents of the singular propositions in which they occur. Denotation, in other words, is a semantically inert property, in this view. Whereas Frege held {{that there were two}} distinct parts (or aspects) of the meaning of every term, phrase, or sentence (its Sinn and Bedeutung), Russell explicitly rejects the notion of sense (Sinn) and replaces it {{with the idea of a}} propositional function (i.e., a function from objects to abstract propositions that are the contents of sentences). This is so because, for Russell, propositions must have concrete, really existing entities as their constituents. Russell provides several clear examples of the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he had in mind: [...] "a man, any man, every man, the present King of France... the centre of mass of the Solar System, ...." [...] So, for Russell, a denoting phrase can be either a definite description (i.e., a singular noun phrase with the determinative article [...] "the" [...] at the beginning), which [...] "does not denote anything" [...] (meaning designate any specific object) or a definite description that does denote a specific object or, finally, an indefinite description that denotes [...] "ambiguously". Russell, as will be shown later, believes that definite descriptions are not referring expressions but rather, to borrow a term later coined by Keith Donnellan, they have [...] "attributive" [...] uses only. They are to be interpreted as strictly logical quantificational formulas that are [...] "general" [...] in nature. At least this has been the general interpretation of Russell among philosophical logicians for nearly a century.|$|E
