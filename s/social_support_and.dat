40|$|Background:Coronary {{heart disease}} is a major {{contributor}} to women's health problems. Design:Self-perceived <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> well-being <b>and</b> health-related quality of life (HRQL) were documented in the cross-sectional HeartQoL survey of European women one and six months after a myocardial infarction. Methods:European women were recruited in 18 European countries and grouped into four geographical regions (Southern Europe, Northern Europe, Western Europe and Eastern Europe). Continuous socio-demographic variables and categorical variables were compared by age and region with ANOVA and χ(2), respectively; multiple regression models were used to identify predictors of <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> well-being <b>and</b> HRQL. Results:Women living in the Eastern European region rated <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> well-being <b>and</b> HRQL significantly lower than women in the other regions. Older women had lower physical HRQL scores than younger women. Eastern European women rated <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> well-being <b>and</b> HRQL significantly lower than women in the other regions.

Individuals in different wings in the same retirement home have demonstrated a lower risk of mortality and higher alertness and self-rated health in the wing where residents had greater control over their environment, though personal control may have less impact on specific measures of health. Social control, perceptions of how much influence one has over one's social relationships, shows support as a moderator variable for the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> perceived health in the elderly and may positively influence coping in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{giving rise}} to modernist reforms, {{up to a certain}} degree the state-sponsored faculties were able to retain their {{independence}} from government control. However, as Pierret has pointed out in detail for Syria, in some countries the orthodox madrasa system remained largely intact, its decentralised organisation protecting it from state control. In fact, the government's attempt at controlling the religious education focussed largely on the academic institutions and neglected the traditional madrasas. By their continuing ability to provide <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> access to an educational alternative which was propagated as being more orthodox according to Islamic faith, the traditional ulama not only maintained their influence on large parts of the population, but actually increased their political influence and power.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to change}} sexual {{orientation}} {{are unlikely to}} be successful and involve some risk of harm, contrary to the claims of SOCE practitioners and advocates. Even though the research and clinical literature demonstrate that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality, regardless of sexual orientation identity, the task force concluded that the population that undergoes SOCE tends to have strongly conservative religious views that lead them to seek to change their sexual orientation. Thus, the appropriate application of affirmative therapeutic interventions for those who seek SOCE involves therapist acceptance, support, and understanding of clients and the facilitation of clients' active coping, <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> <b>and</b> identity exploration and development, without imposing a specific sexual orientation identity outcome.|$|E

However, the specific nature of the mediation effect (i. e., full versus partial) varied somewhat across the RIASEC types.

Indeed, numerous scientific studies have shown that minority individuals experience a high degree of prejudice, which causes stress responses (e.g., high blood pressure, anxiety) that accrue over time, eventually leading to poor mental and physical health. Minority stress theory summarizes these scientific studies to explain how difficult social situations lead to chronic stress and poor health among minority individuals.
