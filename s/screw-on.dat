25|$|In home canning, food {{is packed}} into a jar, and the steel lid {{is placed on}} top of the jar with the {{integral}} rubber seal resting {{on the rim of the}} jar. The band is screwed loosely over the lid, which will allow air and steam to escape. By far, though, the most popular form of seal was the <b>screw-on</b> zinc cap, the precursor to today's <b>screw-on</b> lids. The earliest glass jars were called wax sealers, because they used sealing wax, which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin lid. The earliest successful application of this was discovered by John Landis Mason and patented on November 30, 1858, a date embossed on millions of jars for food preservation and pickling.|$|E
25|$|Salt {{and pepper}} shakers are {{typically}} placed on tabletops in restaurants and in home kitchens. Used as condiment holders in Western culture, {{salt and pepper}} shakers are designed to store and dispense edible salt and ground peppercorns. The first pepper shaker with <b>screw-on</b> cap was invented by John Landis Mason who received a patent on November 30, 1858.|$|E
25|$|This {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a left crank arm with a spider and chainring, and a right crank arm without a spider, the opposite of a normal configuration. If used with a <b>screw-on</b> freewheel, a special hub with a left hand thread for a special freewheel must be used , which is also threaded left hand and ratchets {{the opposite direction of}} a normal freewheel. If the freewheel and hub were threaded with right hand threads, the torque applied by pedaling would loosen and unthread the freewheel from the hub.|$|E

2500|$|For {{many years}} the Weatherby Mark V rifles {{chambered}} in [...]460 Weatherby were {{equipped with a}} Pendleton muzzle brake to help alleviate the effects of recoil. The Pendleton muzzle brake is an integral braking system installed by porting the rifle barrel and once cut into the barrel cannot be reversed. All current Weatherby Mark V rifles chambered for the [...]378 Weatherby Magnum and its derivatives are provided with the Accubrake as a standard accessory with the rifle package. The Accubrake reduces felt recoil by about 53%. Unlike the earlier Pendleton muzzle brake, the Accubrake is a removable, <b>screw-on</b> type brake. The use of muzzle brakes is frowned on by the hunting community in particularly in guided hunting situations involving dangerous game. Since the Accubrake is a removable accessory, it can be reserved for sighting in. According to Weatherby, {{the removal of the}} Accubrake will not change the point of impact.|$|E
2500|$|The No. 73 grenade had {{a roughly}} {{cylindrical}} shape and plastic <b>screw-on</b> cap, {{similar to that}} of a Thermos flask, from which the 'Thermos bomb' nickname was derived. It was approximately [...] in diameter and [...] in length, and weighed [...] Its explosive content consisted of [...] of polar ammonal gelatine dynamite or nitrogelatine â€“ both of which were easily flammable and could be detonated by the impact of small-arms fire. When thrown at a tank or other vehicle, a weighted tape held in the users hand unravelled and pulled free a safety pin, which was attached to a Type 247 [...] "All-ways" [...] fuze (the same type used in the Gammon bomb and No 69 grenade); this armed and then detonated the grenade. Its weight meant that it could only be thrown short distances, limiting its range to between , and its detonation could injure the user if they did not find cover before it detonated. It was able to penetrate [...] of armour, and [...] "damage severely any light tank." [...] It was best used against the tracks of a tank, which it could easily blow off and force its crew to waste time by stopping and repairing it.|$|E
2500|$|Voltage {{standing}} wave ratio (VSWR) measurements may be taken {{to ensure that a}} waveguide is contiguous and has no leaks or sharp bends. If such bends or holes in the waveguide surface are present, this may diminish the performance of both transmitter and receiver equipment connected at either end. Poor transmission through the waveguide may also occur as a result of moisture build up which corrodes and degrades conductivity of the inner surfaces, which is crucial for low loss propagation. For this reason, waveguides are nominally fitted with microwave windows at the outer end that will not interfere with propagation but keep the elements out. Moisture can also cause fungus build up or arcing in high power systems such as radio or radar transmitters. Moisture in waveguides can typically be prevented with silica gel, a desiccant, or slight pressurization of the waveguide cavities with dry nitrogen or argon. Desiccant silica gel canisters may be attached with <b>screw-on</b> nibs and higher power systems will have pressurized tanks for maintaining pressure including leakage monitors. Arcing may also occur if there is a hole, tear or bump in the conducting walls, if transmitting at high power (usually 200 watts or more). Waveguide plumbing [...] is crucial for proper waveguide performance. Voltage {{standing wave}}s occur when impedance mismatches in the waveguide cause energy to reflect back in the opposite direction of propagation. In addition to limiting the effective transfer of energy, these reflections can cause higher voltages in the waveguide and damage equipment.|$|E

50|$|The Amazing <b>Screw-On</b> Head is a {{one-shot}} comic book written and drawn by Mike Mignola {{and published by}} Dark Horse Comics in 2002, starring {{the character of the}} same name. Similar in tone and theme to Mignola's better known Hellboy, The Amazing <b>Screw-On</b> Head is a black comedy that stars a robot living during the Lincoln administration whose head can be attached to different bodies with different tactical abilities, and who functions as an agent of the U.S. government.|$|E

5000|$|The 22-minute pilot {{differs from}} the comic mainly in that the {{characters}} are fleshed out with backstories. Rather than a master of languages, Emperor Zombie (David Hyde Pierce) {{is the first of}} <b>Screw-On</b> Head's (Paul Giamatti) manservants, who has turned to evil despite <b>Screw-On</b> Head's advice. Out of revenge for his first defeat, Zombie developed what he refers to as a [...] "petty vengeance fetish", killing the seven replacement servants after him, and before Mr. Groin (Patton Oswalt), in gruesome ways. On July 12, 2006, The Amazing <b>Screw-On</b> Head TV pilot was aired online at scifi.com with a survey {{to decide whether or not}} the show went to series. According to Mike Mignola on the November 29, 2006 Fanboy Radio podcast, the series was not picked up by the Sci-Fi Channel. The pilot was released on DVD on February 6, 2007.|$|E
