40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} find out the effect of planting geometry and number of plants hill‾ 1 on the yield and quality of groundnut seeds. The experiment consisted of two planting geometry, viz., <b>square</b> <b>planting</b> (22. 4 x 22. 4 cm 2) and rectangular planting (30. 0 x 16. 7 cm 2) and three levels of number of plants hill‾ 1 viz., one, two and three plants hill‾ 1. Results showed that planting geometry affected the yield and yield components significantly. Rectangular planting gave significantly higher yield than did <b>square</b> <b>planting</b> system. But square-planting system gave significantly higher percentage of both protein and oil in seed. Two plants hill‾ 1 gave significantly higher yield than that of one plant and three plants hill‾ 1. Protein content was significantly affected due to the number of plants hill‾ 1 where two plants hill‾ 1 gave the maximum result (25. 58 %) which was insignificantly followed by that of three plants hill‾ 1 while oil content remained unaffected. The crops planted in rectangular system (30 x 16. 7 cm 2) with two plants hill‾ 1 showed maximum pod yield (2. 49 t ha‾ 1). Both protein (26. 05 %) and oil (50. 06 %) content was found higher with the crops of <b>square</b> <b>planting</b> system with two plants hill‾ 1. Therefore, the crops planted in rectangular system (30 x 16. 7 cm 2) with two plants hill‾ 1 emerged out as the promising practice for the improvement of yield in groundnut...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} planting date and spatial pattern on common bean yield under weed-free and weed-infested conditions, an experiment was conducted in Kelachay, Northern Iran, in 2013. The experimental design was a randomized complete block in a factorial arrangement with three replicates. Factors were planting date (10 August and 20 August), spatial pattern (square and rectangular planting pattern, with a planting distance of 30 x 30 cm and 45 x 20 cm, respectively), and weed management regime (weed-free and weedy conditions, weeded and not weeded throughout the growing season, respectively). Results showed that {{the main effect of}} planting date was significant only for pod number per plant and seed number per pod. At the same time, pod number per plant, seed number per pod, pod length, and grain yield were influenced significantly by spatial pattern. Results of ANOVA have also indicated that all traits, except pod length, were influenced significantly by weed-management regimes. Moreover, effect of planting date and spatial pattern were nonsignificant for weed dry weight. Mean comparison has expressed a significant increment in seed yield for <b>square</b> <b>planting</b> arrangement (1, 055 kg ha- 1) over rectangular (971 kg ha- 1). Weeding has also presented an overall 12 % and 8 % improvement in grain and pod yield over control (weedy check), respectively. Based on the results of this study, weed control, as well as <b>square</b> <b>planting</b> pattern, are recommended for obtaining the highest seed yield in common bean...|$|E

40|$|Different assays on {{climbing}} {{beans in}} relay cropping or associated with maize, N fixation and Rhizobium inoculation, and bush beans in monoculture are reported. These {{were conducted in}} La Selva, Antioquia (Colombia), through a collaborative project between the Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA) and CIAT. A total of 56 materials were selected from 723 from Spain, Portugal, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia for productivity and disease- resistance, especially to anthracnose (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum). In a previous study, 9 large-grained var. were selected (greater than 40 g/ 100 seeds) with higher yields in relay cropping (greater than 1937 kg/ha) than Cargamanto, and among these, var. E 1056 (No. CIAT G 12488) is specially recommended for Colombia. Best planting densities for maize and beans in association are 30 - 40, 000 maize plants/ha and 20 - 40, 000 bean plants/ha pocket drilled in a 90 - 100 cm x 90 - 100 cm <b>square</b> <b>planting.</b> In trials with advanced lines up to F 4 and F 6, 12 were selected from an original lot of 32, 680 plants yielding greater than 1631 kg/ha, the majority with black- or brown-colored seed. Four red-seeded var. (V 7916, V 7918, V 79115, and V 79116) were selected for productivity, early maturation, and resistance to major diseases. In trials of N fixation 3 strains of Rhizobium, that allowed yields similar to those obtained when treated with N fertilizer, were identified. The soil application of PCNB reduced root rot and the toxicity of Rhizobium by the fungicide decreased when the inoculum was applied in granules below the seed. (AS-CIAT...|$|E
40|$|Indonesia as an {{archipelagic}} country {{more than}} 17, 504 islands with {{the length of}} coastline estimated at 95, 181 km bears mangroves from several meters to several kilometers. They grow extensively in the five big islands (Jawa, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Papua). At the year of 2009, Agency of Survey Coordination and National Mapping (Bakosurtanal) of Indonesia reported the existing mangrove forest area in Indonesia of about 3, 244, 018 ha, however Directorate General of Land Rehabilitation and Social Forestry, Ministry of Forestry (Ditjen RLPS MoF) of Indonesia at 2007 reported about 7, 758, 411 ha of mangrove area in Indonesia (including existing vegetated mangrove area). It was further reported that those mangroves were 30. 7 % in good condition, 27. 4 % moderate-destroyed, and 41. 9 % heavy-destroyed. In order to rehabilitate destroyed mangrove ecosystems, Indonesia applies at least three type of planting designs (<b>square</b> <b>planting</b> design, zig zag planting design, and cluster planting design) and eight planting techniques (“banjar harian” technique, bamboo pole technique, guludan technique, water break technique, huge polybag technique, ditch muddy technique, huge mole technique, cluster technique). Generally, in Indonesia Rhizophora spp. are used for mangrove rehabilitation and/or restoration with the spacing of 1 x 1 m spending varied planting cost based on the site local condition and planting technique used. The mangrove planting ranged from about Rp. 14. 2 million using propagules to Rp. 18. 5 million using cultured seedlings.

40|$|Since 1987 cassava {{agronomy}} {{research has}} been conducted by scientists from national cassava programs in Asia in collaboration and with small financial assistance from the CIAT cassava program. This paper summarizes and pulls together the results obtained, mainly corresponding to the period of 1490 to 1993. Research on cultural practices concentrated on determining the best time of planting and harvest, optimum planting methods and plant spacing as well as intercropping systems that increase farmers' financial returns. Planting cassava stakes in a vertical or inclined position generally increased yields compared with horizontal planting, but differences were not large and depended to some extent on the variety and on soil moisture conditions during planting. Vertical planting always resulted in quicker sprouting and canopy formation, which helps to reduce weed competition and erosion. Among various intercropping systems used in Asia, the interplanting of cassava with peanuts usually produced highest net incomes. A normal <b>square</b> <b>planting</b> arrangement often produced higher total net incomes than the wide-row or double-row arrangements. Long-term fertility trials have now been conducted for 3 - 5 years in nine locations in four countries. Significant responses to N were observed in seven locations and to P and K in four locations each. Responses to fertilizer application, especially to that of K, have been increasing over time. Only in Hung Loc Centre in south Vietnam no significant responses to fertilizer application were observed even after three years of continuous cropping. In most other locations the combined application of N, P and K more than doubled cassava yields. Erosion control trials have been conducted in 12 locations in six countries. The most effective practices to reduce erosion varied somewhat among locations, but generally in cluded contour ridging, closer plant spacing, fertilizer application, mulching and reduced tillage. Other practices, such as the planting of leguminous tree hedgerows, grass contour barriers or intercropping, will have long-term benefits in terms of erosion control, soil fertility maintenance and improving soil moisture conditions. Since the effect of these practices are rather site-specific and depend to a great extent on the socio-economic conditions of farmers,the choice of the best components of the technology, aimed at increasing farmers' income while preventing soil degradation, will need to be done on farmers' fields and through more active farmer participation in the research...|$|E
