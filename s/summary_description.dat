40|$|Situation {{assessment}} is the discrimination of concise <b>summary</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{of the state}} of uncertain parametric models. This paper considers the problem of providing <b>summary</b> <b>descriptions</b> of dynamic state histories of multitarget models. It shows that under the product-ofmarginals approximation of the posterior distribution of these models it is possible to evaluate the likelihood of asynchronous multistage situations involving multiple interacting elements. Such situations include individual and multiple target manoeuvres. A dynamic programming algorithm is described that solves the problem of associating the stages of multiple situation elements with discrete time instants. The search space is much reduced by reparameterising the problem as an optimisation of the interaction times. The problem of associating tracks with situation elements is solved by selective enumeration. Methods are provided for eliminating a priori the vast preponderance of uninteresting possibilities, so that the [...] ...|$|R
