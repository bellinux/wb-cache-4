40|$|Failure {{modes of}} bipolar <b>Schottky</b> <b>logic</b> devices due to {{metallurgical}} degradation of PtSi/Ti-W/Al contacts were studied. Both {{to the purpose}} prepared wafers and commercial 74 LSOO TTL Low-Power Schottky devices were used. Metallurgical failures are primarily due to Al diffusion through the Ti-W barrier layer. As a consequence, thermal treatments induce electrical failures which begin {{with a loss of}} fan-out followed by longer rise and fall switching times. Finally complete device failure is observed when the output stays always at the high logic level. Emitter-base leakages and short-circuits, due to Si dissolution in the overlaying metal system, can explain the observed electrical degradations which are markedly delayed by a thin oxygen layer present at the Al/Ti-W interface...|$|E

50|$|First {{delivery}} in 1972. New <b>Schottky</b> STTL <b>logic</b> used, giving a 30% performance increase. 500ns semiconductor store.|$|R
50|$|Storage {{time can}} be {{eliminated}} and propagation delay can be reduced by keeping the switching transistors from saturating. Schottky transistors prevent saturation and the stored base charge. A Schottky transistor places a Schottky diode between the base and collector of the transistor. As the transistor comes close to saturating, the Schottky diode conducts and shunts any excess base drive to the collector. (This saturation avoidance technique {{is used in the}} 1956 Baker clamp.) The resulting transistors, which do not saturate, are Schottky transistors. The <b>Schottky</b> TTL <b>logic</b> families (such as S and LS) use Schottky transistors in critical places.|$|R
40|$|A {{selection}} switch {{with high}} isolation between RF signal input terminals is achieved with a gated Schmitt trigger circuit feeding into a control NAND gate in each signal switching channel. The control NAND {{gates of the}} separate signal channels are coupled to an output terminal by a single NAND gate. The schmitt trigger circuits and all gates are implemented with <b>Schottky</b> transistor-transistor <b>logic</b> circuits having input clamping diodes. Each Schmitt trigger circuit includes two cascaded NAND gates and a feedback isolation Schottky diode between one input terminal connected to receive an RF input and another input terminal connected to receive a feedback signal from {{the second of the}} two cascaded NAND gates. Both NAND gates of the Schmitt trigger circuits are enabled by the same switch control signal which enables the control gates...|$|R
