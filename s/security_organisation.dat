5|$|Fleming {{retained}} {{an interest}} in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of The Sunday Times, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want to write a story on the International Diamond <b>Security</b> <b>Organisation,</b> Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he {{played a major role in}} the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond <b>Security</b> <b>Organisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fleming's first work of non-fiction, The Diamond Smugglers, was {{published}} in 1957 and was partly based on background research for his fourth Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever. Much of the material had appeared in The Sunday Times and was based on Fleming's interviews with John Collard, {{a member of the}} International Diamond <b>Security</b> <b>Organisation</b> who had previously worked in MI5. The book received mixed reviews in the UK and US.|$|E
5|$|The Diamond Smugglers is a non-fiction work by Ian Fleming {{that was}} first {{published}} in 1957 in the United Kingdom and in 1958 in the United States. The book is based on two weeks of interviews Fleming undertook with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond <b>Security</b> <b>Organisation</b> (IDSO), which was headed by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-chief of MI5 who worked exclusively for the diamond company De Beers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Security</b> <b>organisations</b> in the European Union face {{threats to}} citizens, {{infrastructure}} and national borders every day. In order {{to cope with}} these various threats these organisations need to monitor, evaluate, select, adapt and implement new technologies, training methods and means of organisation. To {{be able to do}} this, an effective innovation management strategy is of major importance. The INNOSEC project (INNOvation Management Models for <b>SECurity</b> <b>Organisations)</b> supports this effort by developing and helping to deploy an innovation management system adapted to European <b>security</b> <b>organisations.</b> This article describes the methodology, results and first version of the InnoSec model of innovation management. This model will next be tested in workshops in which various <b>security</b> <b>organisations</b> will take part. Results of these workshops will be used to refine and finalise the model...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the lead <b>security</b> <b>organisations</b> (NATO, EU, OSCE and UN) react to {{specific}} types of security threat, contribute to a range of security governance functions, coordinate their activities within the system of European security governance, and collectively contribute to purposive security governance. It seeks to explore the strengths and weaknesses of these four <b>security</b> <b>organisations</b> in carrying out security functions, such as conflict prevention, peace-enforcement, peace-keeping and peace building. A further aim will be to examine the areas where coordination between <b>security</b> <b>organisations</b> has either failed or taken place, and investigate the factors which either promote or inhibit cooperation among the <b>security</b> <b>organisations.</b> The article suggests that the concept of security governance, although complex in its application, offers certain advantages for the study of security that are not evident in other international relations approaches; significantly the ability to identify security threats more clearly, and to assess more effectively how security threats are managed in a multi-level and multi-actor setting...|$|R
5|$|During the deployment, {{the battle}} group participated in passage {{exercises}} with the navies {{of the countries}} visited. The 'Passage Exercises' focussed on maritime security cooperation, which included humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HADR) operations and 'Visit, Board, Search and Seizure' (VBSS) drills for anti-piracy operations. These exercises aimed to increase naval inter-operability, enabling the two navies to function with enhanced coordination during possible HADR operations. In addition, during the port visits, the Fleet Commander along with the Commanding Officers of the ships met high-ranking officials of the navy, state administration, port management, coastal <b>security</b> <b>organisation,</b> police, and other stakeholders of maritime security in the countries visited, to share professional experiences and exchange best practices in areas of mutual interest.|$|E
5|$|Fleming became {{interested}} in diamond smuggling after reading an article in The Sunday Times in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished. In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for De Beers and investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond <b>Security</b> <b>Organisation.</b> Fleming met Sillitoe and used {{much of the research}} as background material for his fictional Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ widely on {{the number}} of {{children}} Amin fathered; most say that he had 30 to 45. Until 2003, Taban Amin (born 1955), Idi Amin's eldest son, was the leader of West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), a rebel group opposed to the government of Yoweri Museveni. In 2005, he was offered amnesty by Museveni, and in 2006, he was appointed Deputy Director General of the Internal <b>Security</b> <b>Organisation.</b> Another of Amin's sons, Haji Ali Amin, ran for election as Chairman (i.e. mayor) of Njeru Town Council in 2002 but was not elected. In early 2007, the award-winning film The Last King of Scotland prompted one of his sons, Jaffar Amin (born in 1967), to speak out in his father's defence. Jaffar Amin said he was writing a book to rehabilitate his father's reputation. Jaffar is the tenth of Amin's 40 official children by seven official wives.|$|E

Before the events of the pilot episode, Captain Black held a senior officer rank in Spectrum, an international <b>security</b> <b>organisation</b> inaugurated in 2067 that mobilises all its personnel, vehicles, and other resources in response to the threat posed by the Mysterons. The Spectrum Organisation is directed from Cloudbase, an airborne headquarters stationed at a height of 40,000feet above the Earth's surface, and has a presence in all major cities. The organisation employs operatives of many nationalities, of whom the most senior hold military ranks and colour-based codenames, are posted to Cloudbase, and answer directly to the commander-in-chief of Spectrum, Colonel White. Cloudbase is defended by the Angels, a squadron of five female pilots code-named Destiny (squadron leader), Harmony, Melody, Rhapsody, and Symphony, who fly the Angel Interceptor fighter aircraft. In addition, the organisation incorporates a fleet of Spectrum Pursuit Vehicles (SPV) hidden in secret locations around the world as well as Spectrum Patrol Saloon Cars, hovercraft, transport jets and machine-gun equipped helicopters.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the cancellation, Anderson was {{required}} {{to come up with an}} idea for another Supermarionation series. He had once been inspired by the thought of creating a live-action police drama in which the hero would have unexpectedly been murdered halfway through the series and replaced by a new lead character. Now giving fresh consideration to this idea, Anderson resolved that a selling point for his new series could be a character that can be killed at the end of each episode and resurrected by the beginning of the next. This, coupled with contemporary theories about the possibility of life on Mars, led to the idea of an interplanetary war raging between Earth and its neighbour and a worldwide <b>security</b> <b>organisation</b> being called on to defend human civilisation. After further thought, Anderson decided that [...] "Scarlet" [...] would make an unusual codename for this organisation's [...] "indestructible" [...] agent who can come back to life, while [...] "Blue" [...] could be his partner's designation. From this, Anderson reasoned that all the personnel should have colours for names so as to form the whole [...] "Spectrum" [...] of colours, and decided that someone called [...] "White" [...] should be the leader of the Spectrum Organisation, much in the same way that white light is composed of, and can be broken down into, the colours of the spectrum.|$|E
