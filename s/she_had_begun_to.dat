5|$|Ballard's {{release from}} Motown was made final on February 22, 1968, when she {{received}} a one-time payment of US$139,804.94 in royalties and earnings. She attempted a solo career with ABC Records, {{and was forced to}} formally reject a solo contract offered by Motown as part of her settlement. Ballard's two 1968 singles failed to chart and her solo album was shelved. In 1971, Ballard sued Motown for $8.7million, claiming that Gordy and Diana Ross had conspired to force her out of the group; the judge ruled in favor of Motown. Ballard eventually sank into poverty and died abruptly on February 22, 1976 from coronary thrombosis at the age of 32. At the time of her death, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> make financial and personal strides and was planning to reinvigorate her solo career.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between their Manhattan apartment and an eighteenth-century farmhouse that they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut; they spent the summer in Amagansett, Long Island. She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was ectopic {{and had to be}} terminated. She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her gynecological problems were largely caused by endometriosis, a disease from which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a barbiturate overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of the company as they could not settle their disagreements and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.|$|E

They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying with the teacher.|$|E

Throughout this time, Gordimer continued to demand through both her writing and her activism that South Africa re-examine and replace its long held policy of apartheid.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Boulanger won the Conservatoire's {{first prize}} in harmony; she {{continued}} to study for years, although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> earn money through organ and piano performances. She studied composition with Gabriel Faur√© and, in the 1904 competitions, she came first in three categories: organ, accompagnement au piano and fugue (composition).

25|$|Criswell's decomposing {{body was}} {{located on the}} side of Interstate 10 on November 25, 1987 in Marana, Pima County, Arizona by a {{homeless}} man. She was estimated to have been between seventeen and twenty-one, at a height of around five feet, three inches and a weight of 138 pounds. It was believed that the victim was white or possibly a Hispanic or Native American female with fair skin. The victim's brown hair was determined to be short and curly. Her eye color could not be determined, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> decompose after exposure to the hot environment for several days or weeks.|$|E

25|$|Marie Antoinette had {{a marked}} {{influence}} on French fashion {{beginning in the}} 1780s. Around this time, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> rebel against the structure of court life. She abolished her morning toilette and often escaped to the Petit Trianon with increasing frequency, leading to criticism of her exclusivity by cutting off the traditional right of the aristocracy to their monarch. Marie Antoinette found refuge from the stresses of the rigidity of court life and the scrutiny of the public eye, the ailing health of her children, and her sense of powerlessness in her marriage by carrying out a pseudo-country life in her newly constructed hameau. She and an elite circle of friends would dress in peasant clothing and straw hats and retreat to the hameau. It was out of this practice that her style of dress evolved.|$|E
25|$|Frances's sisters Esther and Susanna were favoured over Frances {{by their}} father, {{for what he}} {{perceived}} as their superior attractiveness and intelligence. At the age of eight, Frances had not yet learned the alphabet, and some scholars suggest that Burney suffered from a form of dyslexia. By the age of ten, however, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> write for her own amusement. Esther and Susanna were sent by their father to be educated in Paris, while at home Frances educated herself by reading from the family collection, including Plutarch's Lives, works by Shakespeare, histories, sermons, poetry, plays, novels and courtesy books. She drew on this material, along with her journals, when writing her first novels. Scholars who have looked into the extent of Burney's reading and self-education find a child who was unusually precocious and ambitious, working hard to overcome a childhood disability.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1974 Genie {{produced}} a few utterances with internal negatives, although she had specifically practiced {{all but two of}} these early sentences and one of the spontaneous occurrences was a partial imitation, and these sentences grew more common until she completely mastered their use by early 1975. Curtiss did not view this as linguistic movement, believing that Genie's grammar simply changed to place negations {{in the middle of a}} sentence. By {{the fall of}} 1974 Genie began differentiating between third-person pronouns such as he and she, but still had a high rate of error and did not use these, relative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns. She had used locatives after subject noun phrases for a long time, but only did so after an object phrase in late 1974. At around the same time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> use more than one prepositional phrase in some sentences, and in the spring of 1975 she fully comprehended the preposition between on tests.|$|E

500|$|Ranaut's next {{role was}} in the Mohit Suri-directed drama Woh Lamhe (2006), a semi-biographical film based on the {{schizophrenic}} actress Parveen Babi and her relationship with the director Mahesh Bhatt. She said that portraying Babi had left her emotionally drained, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> [...] "feel her desolation and loneliness." [...] Film critic Subhash K. Jha wrote that Ranaut [...] "is the first female performer of Bollywood since Smita and Shabana who isn't scared to strip her soul naked for the camera", adding {{that she is a}} [...] "hugely expressive actress with a phenomenal ability to convey torment, hurt and incredulity through the eyes".

[...] Most reviewers agreed that the book was made up of a series of vignettes. [...] By the time Song was written in 2002, sixteen years after her previous autobiography, Angelou had experienced great fame and recognition as an author and poet. [...] She recited her poem On the Pulse of Morning at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F.

[...] She further said [...] "I'm embracing many different things, but it's all feel-good, super-expressive [...] super-vulnerable." [...] Aguilera continued to say that the album would be about [...] "self‚Äìexpression and freedom" [...] because of the personal struggles she had overcome during the last couple of years. Speaking about her new material during an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2012, Aguilera said that the recording process for Lotus was taking a while because [...] "I don't like to just get songs from producers. I like them to come from a personal place... I'm very excited. It's fun, exciting, introspective, it's going to be great". [...] "Sing for Me" [...] was initially written by Blackmore about her experience with the music industry; upon hearing the song Aguilera had trouble identifying with some of its lyrics, so she and Blackmore met up and rewrote parts of the song.|$|E
