The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the fellside.|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} was to {{describe}} the diversity of small terrestrial mammals on selected habitats of Velka podkrusnohorska <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> and surrounded areas. Between years 2013 2015 there was realized seven catching on the twenty seven study sites. In every year we repeated a catches in spring and autumn period. The selected habitats were: wetlands, meadows, pine forests, oak forests and successional forests. As a capture method was chose standard line method with usage of snap traps. The obtained data were statically analysed by the R program and the diversity was compared based on the Shannon-Wiener index of diversity. We compared abundance and diversity between <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> study sites and surrounding study sites, which were situated out of the Velka podkrusnohorska <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> and was sign as control sites. We chose three study sites of every habitat situated on <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> and another three sites of every habitat situated out of the <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> (control sites). In total we caught 720 small terrestrial mammals of ted species: Crocidura leucodon, Crocidura suaveolens, Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis, Mus domesticus, Apodemus sylvaticus, Apodemus flavicollis, Myodes glareolus, Sorex araneus and Sorex minutus. The highest diversity was on the four wetlands sites which three of them were situated on the <b>spoil</b> <b>heap.</b> The highest abundance was at the meadow site Matyas which was situated on the <b>spoil</b> <b>heap.</b> In the overall assessment of the abundance and diversity of communities of small terrestrial mammals was confirmed equality of <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> sites and control sites. In the assessment of abundance and diversity of individual habitats was confirmed equality of spoil heal sites and control sites. Exception was abundance between forests <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> sites and control sites, where the equality of abundance was rejected because of higher abundance of control sites. We decide to compare technically restored sites and sites using managed successions on the <b>spoil</b> <b>heap.</b> The diversity of technically restored pine forests and successional forest was confirmed but the equality of abundance of these sites was rejected because of the higher abundance of successional forests. The equality of diversity and abundance of technically restored oak forests and successional forests was rejected because successional forests had higher both of these values...|$|R

5|$|The 47th Division {{planned to}} attack with two brigades, each {{reinforced}} by a battalion from the reserve brigade, along {{either side of}} the Ypres–Comines Canal. Large numbers of machine-guns were organised to fire offensive and defensive barrages and signal detachments were organised to advance with the infantry. An observation balloon was reserved for messages by signal lamp from the front line, as insurance against the failure of telephone lines and message-runners. The divisional trench mortar batteries were to bombard the German front line opposite the 142nd Brigade, where it was too close for the artillery to shell without endangering British troops. Wire-cutting began in mid-May, against considerable local retaliation by German artillery. At the end of May the two attacking brigades began training at Steenvoorde, on practice courses built to resemble the German positions to be attacked, using air reconnaissance photographs to mark the positions of machine-gun posts and hidden barbed wire. Divisional intelligence summaries were used to plan the capture of German company and battalion headquarters. The 140th Brigade with four tanks attached, was to occupy White Château and the adjacent part of , while the 142nd Brigade attacked the <b>spoil</b> <b>heaps</b> and the canal bank to the left. On 1 June, the British artillery began the intense stage of preparatory bombardment for trench-destruction and wire cutting and the two attacking brigades assembled for the attack from 4 to 6 June.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Cornish mining {{industry}} went into decline, public opposition to the use of female and child labour in mines was rising. The Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act 1872 brought the mines of Cornwall under the provisions of the Mines Act 1842, which had previously applied only to coal mines, limiting the use of child labour in the mines and thus increasing costs. The Act prohibited women from working underground, which the bal maidens did not do, but it also forbade any child under ten from working in any mine, even on the surface. The passing of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878 drastically limited the use of female and child labour. The employment of children under 10 was banned outright, the maximum working hours for children aged 10–14 were drastically restricted, and women were banned from working over 56 hours per week. The sudden loss of cheap child labourers made the already weakened mining industries of Cornwall and West Devon even less profitable, and more than half the mines in the area went out of business in the following decade. Some bal maidens continued to work in surviving mines and in tin-streaming, but instability in the metal markets made what remained of the mining industries increasingly unviable. In the 1880s William Ewart Gladstone's Liberal government tried to ban female labour from mines altogether; although the Bill was defeated, the number of bal maidens continued to fall. At the 1891 census the number of working bal maidens had fallen to around half its 1850s–60s peak. By 1895 only 23 mines remained operational compared to 307 in 1873, and in 1901 Devon Great Consols, the last significant copper mine in Devon and Cornwall, closed. Electrification and the introduction of Frue Vanners at the surviving mines replaced most of the jobs still done by women, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few bal maidens remained in employment. With wartime shortages of raw materials and many younger men in the armed forces, some bal maidens were temporarily rehired to dress potash ore at a re-opened mine at St Austell, and to re-dress the existing <b>spoil</b> <b>heaps</b> of defunct mines for wolfram and arsenic.|$|E
25|$|The <b>spoil</b> <b>heaps</b> {{continue}} to be of concern. A collapse of part of the one {{to the west of}} Swart Beck, above the old Low Mill site, in 2002 resulted in a £750,000 engineering project to stabilise the area. A further detailed topographical survey of the three <b>spoil</b> <b>heaps</b> was undertaken in July 2014, in advance of further engineering works to maintain their stability. Also in 2014 Eden District Council began a twelve-month environmental investigation of the site involving testing the metal content of soil, grass and water samples.|$|E

40|$|<b>Spoil</b> <b>heap</b> {{represents}} a biotop which provides conditions and space for survival of numerous {{plant and animal}} species which were displaced by human's activities from managed landscape. Aside of species typical for the territory of the Czech Republic, even species belonging to remote areas can found on the Velka podkrusnohorska vysypka. Therefore, a <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> cannot be considered as locality of low value either in terms of biodiversity or as an area inconvenient for revitalisation by animals and plant species. Occurrence of common and rare species on a <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> is given namely by the following factors 1) large areas in initial stage of succession 2) steppe or even semidesert character of climate 3) chemical composition of <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> waters 4) strong limits for use of water bodies for fish production 5) limited human impact on localities in which natural succession occurs. The main aim of work was to test whether the water from <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> could be used for formation and development of functioning aquatic and wetland communities which are inevitable for harmonic landscape. In this way the work contributes to further understanding of processes of biotop restoration {{which is one of the}} main purposes of recultivation activities.

25|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Geological Society of London on 18 December 1912, Charles Dawson claimed that a workman at the Piltdown gravel pit had given him a {{fragment}} of the skull four years earlier. According to Dawson, workmen at the site discovered the skull shortly before his visit and broke it up in the belief that it was a fossilised coconut. Revisiting the site on several occasions, Dawson found further fragments of the skull and took them to Arthur Smith Woodward, keeper of the geological department at the British Museum. Greatly interested by the finds, Woodward accompanied Dawson to the site. Though the two worked together between June and September 1912, Dawson alone recovered more skull fragments and half of the lower jaw bone. The skull unearthed in 1908 was the only find discovered in situ, with most of the other pieces found in the gravel pit's <b>spoil</b> <b>heaps.</b>|$|E
25|$|The contractor's {{locomotive}} {{was a small}} tank locomotive specially {{adapted for}} use by civil engineering contractor firms engaged {{in the building of}} railways. The locomotives would be used for hauling men, equipment and building materials over temporary railway networks built at the worksite that were frequently re-laid or taken up and moved elsewhere as building work progressed. Contractor's locomotives were usually saddle or well tank types (see above) but required several adaptations to make them suitable for their task. They were built to be as light as possible so they could run over the lightly built temporary rails and had deeply flanged wheels so they did not de-rail on the tracks which were often very uneven. At the same time they had to be very powerful with good traction as they would often have to haul trains of wagons up very steep gradients, such as the sides of railway embankments or <b>spoil</b> <b>heaps.</b> Many were designed so that large iron ballast blocks could be fitted to the frames when extra weight and traction was required, then removed when it was not. Most had sanding gear fitted to all wheels for maximum traction. Some method of keeping mud and dust from clogging the wheels and brake shoes was also required – this either took the form of scraper bars fitted to {{the leading edge of the}} wheels or wheel washer jets supplied from the water tank. To handle long trains of loose-coupled (and often un-sprung) wagons, contractor's locomotives usually had very effective steam-powered brakes. Most lacked a full cab, often only having a front 'spectacle plate'. If a cab was provided it was usually removable along with the chimney, and sometimes the dome, so that the locomotive could be loaded onto a flatbed wagon for transport to new locations by rail whilst remaining within the loading gauge.|$|E
