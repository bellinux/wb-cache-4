There are four stages where sulphur can be removed: in the blast furnace (BF), during hot metal (HM) pretreatment, in the converter and during the secondary metallurgy (SM) treatment. For sulphur removal a low oxygen activity and a basic slag are required. In the BF typically 90 % of the sulphur is removed; still, the HM contains about 0. 03 % of sulphur. Different HM desulphurisation processes are used worldwide. With co-injection or the Kanbara reactor, <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentrations</b> below 0. 001 % are reached. Basic slag helps desulphurisation in the converter. However, sulphur increase is not uncommon in the converter due to high oxygen activity and sulphur input via scrap and additions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{climate in}} Iceland was drier and warmer during the Holocene thermal maximum {{than it is}} today and it has been {{suggested}} that ice caps disappeared entirely. Katla, a volcano covered by the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap in southern Iceland, has erupted rather steadily throughout the Holocene. Preand post-eruption <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentrations</b> in its products have been determined in previous studies, through melt inclusions trapped in phenocrysts (pre-eruption mean values of 2155 ± 165 ppm) and fully degassed magmatic tephra (post-eruption mean values of 445 ± 130 ppm). The phreatomagmatic tephra has much more variable S contents (550 - 1775 ppm) and spans the compositional gap between magmatic tephra and melt inclusions. These variable sulphur values are attributed to arresting of degassing as the magma is quenched upon contact with external water in the shallow levels of the volcano conduit. Sulphur in Katla tephra can thus be used to evaluate whether Mýrdalsjökull survived the warm spells of the Holocene. In this study, <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentrations</b> in tephra layers representing the last ∼ 8400 years of the volcano's eruption history were measured, revealing concentrations in the phreatomagmatic range (600 - 1600 ppm).

Reductions in protein concentration, <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentration,</b> Hageberg failing number and loaf volumes also occurred as the amount of fungicide applied increased. However, there were no deleterious effects of fungicide application on sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sedimentation volumes, N:S ratios or dough theology. Effects of fungicide application on bread-making quality were not product specific. Therefore, it appears that new mechanisms to explain strobilurin effects on bread-making quality {{do not need to be}} invoked. Where reductions in protein concentration did occur they could be compensated for by a late-season application of nitrogen either as granular ammonium nitrate at flag leaf emergence or foliar urea at anthesis. These applications, however, sometimes increased the N:S ratio of the extracted flour and failed to improve loaf volume. Multiple regression analysis revealed that main effects of year, flour protein concentration and N:S ratio could explain 93 % of the variance in loaf volume caused by season, fungicide and nitrogen treatments.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{response}} of lichens to sudden changes in the concentration and source of sulphur in the atmosphere despite an interest in lichens as tools in environmental monitoring. A transplant study was performed to determine this response in two species of pendulous epiphytic lichens by monitoring changes in their sulphur isotopic composition and <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentration.</b> [...] Branches covered with the lichens, Alectoria sarmentosa and Bryoria capillaris, were taken from the Bonavista Peninsula and transplanted into the Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) Botanical Garden, St. John's. Two separate transplant experiments were performed between June 1997 and September 1998. Experiment I involved monthly sampling from June 1997 to June 1998. Experiment II involved weekly sampling from June 1998 to September 1998. [...] The initial sulphur isotopic compositions and concentrations of the local lichens from the Bona vista Peninsula and St. John's were significantly different, providing an ideal opportunity to observe significant changes. The lichens in the Bonavista area had high isotopic compositions (~+ 15 ⁰/₀₀) from seaspray sulphur and lichens in St. John's exhibited low isotopic compositions (~+ 5 - 6 ⁰/₀₀) from anthropogenic sources. [...] The results from this study showed that the transplanted lichens, A. sarmentosa and B. capillaris, acquired sulphur isotopic compositions and concentrations approaching those of the atmosphere surrounding the MUN Botanical Garden over the one year study period. For all transplants at all sites, the sulphur isotopic composition decreased while the <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentration</b> increased. Experiment I determined that one year is an insufficient amount of time to allow the transplanted lichens to achieve exactly the same sulphur isotopic composition and <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentration</b> as the local lichens.

To reduce sulphur pollution, and its negative impact on health in Cape Town, air quality management has focussed on identifying local sources and reducing the local emissions of sulphur. Meanwhile, the transport of sulphur pollutants from areas outside Cape Town can contribute to ambient <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentrations.</b> This work studies the transport of sulphur pollutants over South Africa and examines whether Cape Town is a net source of or sink for the pollutant. It shows the link between sulphur emissions on the Mpumalanga Highveld (the most polluted area in South Africa) and sulphur pollution in Cape Town. Two atmosphere chemistry-transport models (RegCM-Chem and WRF-Chem) were used for this study. The models were applied to simulate the atmospheric flow and chemistry transport over South Africa for two years (2001 and 2002), {{and the results were}} validated with observations within Cape Town. The models reproduced observed seasonal variability in atmospheric wind flow and <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentrations</b> over Cape Town. Results from both models show a transport of sulphur pollutants from the Mpumalanga Highveld to Cape Town. While the sulphur pollutants from the Mpumalanga Highveld are transported eastward (toward the Indian Ocean) at middle atmospheric levels, the pollutants are transported south-westward (towards Cape Town) at lower atmospheric levels. In addition, the pollutants are transported from the Mpumalanga Highveld to Cape Town, following the south coast of South Africa, in April. During an extreme sulphur pollution event in Cape Town, there is formation of either a col or a converging flow over the city. These features encourage the accumulation of sulphur over Cape Town. The sulphur flux budget analysis shows that Cape Town can be a net source of or sink for sulphur during an extreme pollution event.

However, there were no deleterious effects of fungicide application on sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sedimentation volumes, N:S ratios or dough rheology. Effects of fungicide application on bread-making quality were not product specific. Therefore, it appears that new mechanisms to explain strobilurin effects on bread-making quality {{do not need to be}} invoked. Where reductions in protein concentration did occur they could be compensated for by a late-season application of nitrogen either as granular ammonium nitrate at flag leaf emergence or foliar urea at anthesis. These applications, however, sometimes increased the N:S ratio of the extracted flour and failed to improve loaf volume. Multiple regression analysis revealed that main effects of year, flour protein concentration and N:S ratio could explain 93 % of the variance in loaf volume caused by season, fungicide and nitrogen treatments. However, an equally good fit was achieved by just including <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentration</b> with yearPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Zinc {{sulphide}} doped with nickel {{has many}} practical {{applications in the}} field of materials sciences, electronics and industries. The chemical synthesis along with capping agent is most successful, but has disadvantages like purity and the yield. In this paper synthesis without any capping reagent with less <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentration</b> has been discussed. To confirm the synthesis, it was characterized by UV-visible spectrophotometry and DLS for particle size which is about 109  nm and was confirmed by TEM. The optical band gap was calculated to explain electrical properties. XRD was done to analyse the structure of the material, morphology and elemental analysis were studies by FE SEM and EDS.

40|$|This {{study with}} the Civil Aircraft for Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container (CARIBIC) {{platform}} investigates the aerosol elemental concentrations at 9 - 11 km altitude in the northern hemisphere. Measurements from 31 intercontinental flights over a 2 -year period between Germany and Sri Lanka/Maldives in the Indian Ocean are presented. Aerosol samples were collected with an impaction technique and were analyzed for the concentration of 18 elements using particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Additional measurements of particle number concentrations, ozone and carbon monoxide concentrations, and meteorological modeling {{were included in the}} interpretation of the aerosol elemental <b>concentrations.</b> Particulate <b>sulphur</b> was found to be by far the most abundant element. Its upper tropospheric concentration increased, on average, by a factor of 2 from the tropics to midlatitudes, with another factor 2 higher concentrations in the lowermost stratosphere over midlatitudes. Correlation patterns and source profiles suggest contributions from crustal sources and biomass burning, but not from meteor ablation. Coinciding latitudinal gradients in particulate <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentrations</b> and emissions suggest that fossil fuel combustion is an important source of the aerosol in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere. The measurements indicate aerosol transport along isentropic surfaces across the tropopause into the lowermost stratosphere. As a result of the prolonged residence time, ageing via oxidation of sulphur dioxide in the lowermost stratosphere was found to be a likely high-altitude, strong source that, along with downward transport of stratospheric air, could explain the vertical gradient of particulate <b>sulphur</b> mass <b>concentration</b> around the extratropical tropopause...|$|R
40|$|The Plinian Lower Pumice 2 (LP 2) {{eruption}} (172  ka) {{was one of}} {{the first}} major caldera-forming eruptions of the Santorini volcanic complex (Greece). The eruption shows some striking similarities to the caldera-forming Late Bronze Age (Minoan) eruption in terms of field, petrological and geochemical characteristics of its eruptive products, which are used to reveal the storage conditions of the LP 2 magmas, pre-eruptive magmatic processes and the behaviour and degassing of volatiles prior to and during eruption. The LP 2 eruption comprises four, predominantly rhyodacitic eruptive units (LP 2 -A, B, C, D). The lowermost unit of the Plinian LP 2 deposits (LP 2 -A) consists of a basal phreatomagmatic bed (LP 2 -A 1), which is overlain by three discrete pumice fall deposits (LP 2 -A 2 - 1, A 2 - 2, A 3), the most prominent of which (LP 2 -A 3) contains abundant, quench-textured scoriae that range in composition from basalt to basaltic andesite. The eruption proceeded with the deposition of pumice-rich pyroclastic flows (LP 2 -B) characterised by a lower, stratified and cross-bedded ignimbrite (LP 2 -B 1) that may grade into a massive, non-welded ignimbrite (LP 2 -B 2), a lithic-rich pumiceous breccia (LP 2 -C) and a co-ignimbrite lithic lag breccia (LP 2 -D). The main volume of rhyodacitic magma, which formed by fractionation of olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, amphibole, Fe–Ti oxides, pyrrhotite and apatite from basaltic parental magmas and assimilation of crustal rocks, was held at mid-crustal levels (≤  16  km depth), magmatic temperatures of 831  ±  12  °C and an oxygen fugacity slightly above the fayalite–magnetite–quartz (FMQ) oxygen buffer. Injection of ∼  200  °C hotter mafic magma into the rhyodacitic reservoir and subsequent mingling and minor hybridisation with the resident magma helped to remobilise the rhyodacitic host magma and determined the final compositional range of the erupted products. Melt inclusion data show that <b>sulphur</b> <b>concentrations</b> were reduced to <  270  ppm in the rhyodacite, primarily due to partitioning of sulphur into pyrrhotite or, depending on temperature, a FeS-rich melt during magmatic differentiation at oxygen fugacities around the FMQ oxygen buffer. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>concentrations</b> in groundmass glasses of the LP 2 pumices suggest that ∼  43...|$|R
