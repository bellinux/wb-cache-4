5|$|The 2008 <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> tornado {{outbreak}} was {{a deadly}} tornado outbreak which affected the Southern United States {{and the lower}} Ohio Valley on February 5 and 6, 2008. The event began on <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> while 24U.S. states were holding primary elections and caucuses to select the presidential candidates for the upcoming presidential election. Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Alabama, and Tennessee were among the affected regions in which primaries were being held. Some voting locations were forced to close early due to the approaching severe weather.|$|E

The electoral battle turned out to be more competitive than expected, with Sanders winning the New Hampshire primary while Clinton scored victories in the Nevada caucuses and South Carolina primary. On four different <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesdays,</b> Clinton secured numerous important wins in each of the nine most populous states including California, New York, Florida, and Texas, while Sanders scored various victories in between.|$|R

5|$|In January 1988, {{during an}} {{interview}} with United Press International, McGovern confirmed that he was considering entering the 1988 Democratic primaries {{in the event that}} a front-runner did not emerge in the race {{in the aftermath of the}} <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> primaries, though admitted he believed a candidate would take the lead.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, McCain won {{both the}} {{majority}} of states and delegates in the <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> Republican primaries, giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination.

5|$|On <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> Clinton won {{the largest}} states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states; they almost evenly split the total popular vote. But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for {{his share of}} the popular vote due to better {{exploitation}} of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.|$|E
40|$|It {{is through}} the {{material}} that is presented {{to us by the}} media, that we form our perception of the world and our opinions about it. Therefore the framing of news is important to study, especially in our globalized world where the economy, politics and communication has a strong connection. Earlier studies have shown that there is a general fascination in Sweden for the United States, which not only have influenced popular culture, but also other parts of the Swedish society like news coverage. Some even say that Sweden is the most americanized country in the world. The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to examine if Swedish news are being more americanized than news coverage in other parts of the world. Through a qualitative framing analysis this study examines which frames that occurs in news articles related to the american elections <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesdays</b> in newspapers from Sweden, Kenya and Singapore. The result of this study shows that the news coverage in many respects portrays the election in a similar, entertaining way, which can be assumed to be due to the americanization of news. However, there is no clear evidence that the Swedish news coverage would be more americanized than the Kenyan and Singaporean...|$|R

5|$|Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas {{and many}} of the Southern {{primaries}} on <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South. With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate. Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.|$|E
5|$|A win by McCain over Huckabee in South Carolina, and by Romney over McCain in childhood-home Michigan, set up {{a pivotal}} battle in the Florida primary. Romney campaigned intensively on {{economic}} issues and the burgeoning subprime mortgage crisis, while McCain attacked Romney regarding Iraq policy and benefited from endorsements from Florida officeholders. McCain won a 5percentage point victory on January 29. Although many Republican officials were now lining up behind McCain, Romney persisted through the nationwide <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> contests on February 5. There he won primaries or caucuses in several states, but McCain won in more and in larger-population ones. Trailing McCain in delegates by a more than two-to-one margin, Romney announced {{the end of his}} campaign on February 7.|$|E
5|$|With little {{mathematical}} hope {{of winning}} the nomination and polls showing another likely defeat in the New York primary, Kennedy prepared {{to withdraw from the}} race. However, partially due to Jewish voter unhappiness with a U.S. vote at the United Nations against Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Kennedy staged an upset and won the March 25 vote by a 59–41 percent margin. Carter responded with an advertising campaign that attacked Kennedy's character in general without explicitly mentioning Chappaquiddick, but Kennedy still managed a narrow win in the April 22 Pennsylvania primary. Carter won 11 of 12 primaries held in May, while on the June 3 <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> primaries, Kennedy won California, New Jersey, and three smaller states out of eight contests. Overall, Kennedy had won 10 presidential primaries against Carter, who won 24.|$|E
5000|$|On January 26, Obama {{won by a}} {{more than}} two-to-one margin over Clinton, gaining 55 {{percent of the vote}} to her 27 percent and Edwards' 18 percent. Bill Clinton had {{compared}} Obama's victory to Jesse Jackson's victory in the 1988 South Carolina primary, in which he said [...] "Jackson ran a good campaign. And Obama ran a good campaign here." [...] He would be criticized for these comments because they were widely seen as implying that Obama was [...] "the black candidate. [...] " [...] Hillary Clinton would later apologize for her husband's remarks in front of the State of the Black Union conference. Clinton had already left the state and gave her concession speech from Tennessee State University, where she said she was looking forward to the February 5 <b>Super</b> Duper <b>Tuesday</b> contests.|$|R

5000|$|The {{issues of}} race that came to the {{forefront}} had no greater effect than where campaigning began for the January 26 South Carolina primary, the first to feature large African American participation in the Democratic electorate. The January 22 CNN/Congressional Black Caucus debate in Myrtle Beach was according to CNN a [...] "debate punctuated by sharp exchanges." [...] Clinton criticized Obama for voting [...] "present" [...] on many occasions while in the Illinois Senate. [...] "It's hard to have a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote," [...] she said. Obama {{said that he was}} working to help unemployed workers in Chicago while Clinton was [...] "a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart." [...] He also took issue with statements made on the campaign trail by Bill Clinton, saying [...] "I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes." [...] It was the most-watched primary season debate in cable television news history. In the days after the debate, Hillary Clinton left to campaign in some <b>Super</b> Duper <b>Tuesday</b> states, while Bill Clinton stayed in South Carolina and engaged in a series of exchanges with Obama. Clinton's decision to leave the state was subject to criticism. Hillary aides responded by stating that criticism directed towards Clinton was created in order to [...] "undermine the former president". Edwards stayed clear of the fray in the debate and later said that he represented the [...] "grown-up wing" [...] of the party.|$|R
5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E
25|$|The Louisiana, Nebraska, Hawaii, Wisconsin, U.S. Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia {{primaries}} and the Washington and Maine caucuses all took place after <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> in February. Obama won all of them, giving him 10 consecutive victories after <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By mid-December 2007, Giuliani {{was keeping}} to his {{strategy}} of campaigning in big {{states such as}} New York, New Jersey, Florida, California, Illinois, Missouri, and other <b>Super</b> Duper <b>Tuesday</b> states, while the other contenders focused on the earlier states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. However, the strategy was now seen as at risk. [...] Not only were his poll numbers in the early states falling — despite an attempt {{for a while to}} boost his standing in New Hampshire with $3 million of radio and television advertising, which ended up not having any effect — but he had lost his national lead and had fallen into statistical ties with Mike Huckabee. [...] Most dangerously, his lead in Florida, the first state that he planned to heavily contest, was dwindling as well. [...] Furthermore, changes in Giuliani's campaign messaging went largely unnoticed by the press, given that they were focused on Iowa and New Hampshire developments. [...] Giuliani's woes were further symbolized when he got sick with flu-like symptoms during a campaign flight and was admitted overnight to Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri as a precaution. [...] Giuliani resumed limited campaigning in subsequent days; the campaign would not give precise details of tests done; Giuliani then stated it had been a [...] "terrible headache", not flu, and a full medical report would be given after Christmas; but the health question had become an ongoing campaign story. [...] Giuliani did indeed get {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor on the day after Christmas, but again a minor amount of political damage had been done.|$|R
40|$|As the 2008 presidential nominating process got underway, Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s coveted {{status as}} first-in-the-nation {{appeared}} increasingly in jeopardy, as states engaged in aggressive frontloading throughout 2006 and 2007. In the past, late March primaries in large states like Florida, New York, and California were {{irrelevant to the}} electoral outcome. To avoid a repeat in 2008, Florida moved its primary to January 29 and California moved {{to what is now}} being called 2 ̆ 2 <b>super</b> duper <b>Tuesday</b> 2 ̆ 2 on February 5 when nearly two dozen states will hold primaries. Under pressure from extra-early voting in Florida and other front-loading states, as we write this the Iowa caucuses are to be held on January 3, two days after New Year 2 ̆ 7 s. It seems possible {{that as a result of}} the nominating season becoming more condensed, there may be an increase in the importance of Iowa and New Hampshire, the opposite of what the states moving earlier wanted. If the first nominating events are now the starter 2 ̆ 7 s gun in a 50 -meter dash rather than a mile run, who gets off the starting blocks first may well matter even more. As Hull (2007, 66) argues, Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s impact on New Hampshire and the national nomination process is a 2 ̆ 2 wild, wired one. 2 ̆ 2 In this rapid sea of a changing nomination process we take a close look at the Iowa electorate, both statewide registered voters and a subset of likely caucus attendees, to shed light on the underpinnings of support for the presidential candidates in the early stages of the 2008 campaign, using unique rolling cross-sectional data to track opinion change over time...|$|R
25|$|<b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> {{occurred}} on February 5, 2008, {{during which the}} largest-ever number of simultaneous state primary elections was held. <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> ended up leaving the Democrats in a virtual tie, with Obama amassing 847 delegates to Clinton's 834 from the 23 states that held Democratic primaries.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} some {{speculation}} that Howard Dean would endorse John Edwards before the <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> nominating contests on March 2, as Edwards's political stances were {{more in line with}} Dean's.

25|$|<b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> 2012 {{took place}} March 6 when the most {{simultaneous}} state presidential primary elections {{was held in}} the United States. This election cycle's edition of <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> where 17.1 percent of all delegates was allocated, was considerably smaller than the 2008 edition, where 41.5 percent of all delegates was allocated (twenty-one states with 901 delegates). In 2012 delegates were allocated in primaries in seven states and their sixty five congressional districts together with binding caucuses in two states.|$|E

25|$|On <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> in West Virginia, McCain {{supporters}} threw {{their support}} to Huckabee, {{which resulted in}} a highly publicized Huckabee win early on Tuesday. Romney had been leading there in the polls prior to the primary. This strategy likely both increased the number of votes given to Huckabee and reduced the number that went to Romney of those voting Tuesday evening. The strategy appears to have been successful as Romney suspended his campaign two days later after a poor showing in <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday.</b>|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 2008, {{two days}} after McCain posted strong gains in the <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> primaries, Romney {{announced}} {{the end of his}} campaign. A week later he endorsed McCain.|$|E
25|$|McCain won {{his home}} state of Arizona, taking all 53 of the state's delegates and the largest of the <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> prizes, winning nearly all of California's 173 delegates. McCain also scored wins in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Oklahoma. Huckabee also made {{surprise}} wins in states he had polled behind in previously like Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. Huckabee also won the first contest of <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> in West Virginia. Romney won {{his home state}} of Massachusetts. He also won Utah, Colorado, and Minnesota.|$|E

25|$|On <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> March 2, Kucinich gained another {{strong showing}} with the Minnesota caucus, where 17% of the ballots went to him. In {{his home state}} of Ohio, he {{received}} 9% in the primary.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} week, {{it became clear}} that a tie on <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday</b> left Obama better positioned for the upcoming contests in February, where the demographics of several large states seemed to favor him. The day after <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> February 6, Clinton announced that she had personally lent her campaign $5 million in January. The news came as a surprise and set off another round of news stories about Clinton donors and supporters concerned about the campaign's strategy. It was particularly striking in contrast to Obama's announcement that he had raised a record-high $32 million in January, tapping 170,000 new contributors. It became clear that Obama's financial advantage had allowed him to organize and compete in a broader set of states on <b>Super</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> an advantage likely to continue in the coming weeks and months. Clinton's supporters responded by raising $6 million online in 36 hours, but Obama's campaign upped the ante, announcing their own total of $7.5 million in 36 hours and starting a new goal of reaching 500,000 new contributors in 2008 by the end of February.|$|E
