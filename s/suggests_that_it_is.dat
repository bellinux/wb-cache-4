5|$|Ecgric is a {{possible}} contender, as well as Rædwald, Eorpwald and Sigeberht, for being the East Anglian king who was buried within Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo. Rupert Bruce-Mitford <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> perhaps unlikely that Ecgric’s successor Anna, a devout Christian, would have given him a ship burial, {{but he does not}} dismiss the theory entirely.|$|E
5|$|His biographer, Brian Little, {{suggests}} that {{this might have been}} a way for the newcomers to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.|$|E

5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was {{a major factor in the}} slow economic development of the American southern states.|$|E
5|$|Pallas {{is thought}} to have {{undergone}} at least some degree of thermal alteration and partial differentiation, which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a remnant protoplanet. During the planetary formation stage of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately this size. Many of these objects were incorporated into larger bodies, which became the planets, whereas others were destroyed in collisions with other protoplanets. Pallas and Vesta are likely survivors from this early stage of planetary formation.|$|E
5|$|Plesiorycteropus, {{also known}} as the bibymalagasy or Malagasy aardvark, is a {{recently}} extinct eutherian mammalian genus from Madagascar. Upon its description in 1895, it was classified with the aardvark, but more recent studies have found little evidence to link it to aardvarks or any other order of mammals. Molecular evidence instead <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> related to the tenrecs. Two species are currently recognized, the larger P.madagascariensis and the smaller P.germainepetterae. They probably overlapped in distribution, as subfossil remains of both species have been found in the same site.|$|E
50|$|Henodus, however, {{differs from}} other placodonts in having {{developed}} unique baleen-like denticles, which alongside {{features of the}} hyoid and jaw musculature <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a filter feeder. Recent comparisons to Atopodentatus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a herbivore as well, bearing a similar broad jaw shape, albeit it obtained plant matter through filter-feeding it from the substrates.|$|R
50|$|The precise {{date and}} {{location}} of composition <b>is</b> disputed: some <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written in Salzburg, the boy's home town, in 1762 or 1763; others <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written in Paris in 1763 or 1764, during Mozart's first visit to <b>that</b> city. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> published in Paris in February 1764, along with another violin sonata, K. 7, as Mozart's “Opus 1”.|$|R

5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} is {{a hypothesis}} {{that attempts to}} explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a retrograde (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events {{that leads to a}} presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.|$|E
5|$|The Fortingall Yew is {{an ancient}} tree in the churchyard of the village of Fortingall in Perthshire. Various {{estimates}} have put its age at between 2,000 and 5,000 years; recent research into yew tree ages <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely to be nearer the lower limit of 2,000 years. This still makes it the oldest tree in Europe, although there is an older Norway Spruce root system in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{was first}} {{described}} in 1978, {{after having been}} discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees {{to show signs of}} disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that the spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread of disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A.luteobubalina is closely related to A.montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A.paulensis. The distribution of A.luteobubalina <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E

5|$|In total, {{there have}} been 61 {{occasions}} on which a batsman has been given out handled the ball in first-class cricket and 5 instances in List A cricket. The most recent dismissal of this fashion in first-class cricket occurred during a County Championship contest between Leicestershire and Kent in April 2016, when Kent batsman Sean Dickson was dismissed for the infraction. Brodribb <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely that {{there should have been}} a significant number more dismissals than {{there have been}} for handling the ball: in addition to the cases where batsman have returned the ball to the fielding side without permission, there are records of cases in which the umpires have been reticent to uphold an appeal. On one such instance, the umpire David Constant rejected an appeal against Younis Ahmed, saying that he thought the appeal was not serious.|$|E
5|$|Many {{elements}} can {{be considered}} as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the cinematic experience and not the subject which is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. Then in the end of the film, Andy passes through a movie poster to escape his cell and ultimately Shawshank.|$|E
5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation {{was likely to be}} challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E
5|$|The ancient font by {{the west}} door dates from the twelfth century, and has an arcaded basin. The plain pointed arch forms the only {{ornament}} on the font, which has an octagonal ashlar shaft now mounted on a platform, and supporting the octagonal basin. Unfortunately the font has been subject to extensive and clumsy repair. Unusually, it is made of Purbeck marble, which is normally found in churches in south and eastern England; the only other example in Wales is in St David's Cathedral. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} massive stem dates from at least the nineteenth century, and stylistic evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> probably a lot earlier; the font basin itself is undoubtedly ancient. Seddon's restoration work in the church commenced in 1869, and included dismantling the font. He carefully cleaned and stored the stonework, and re-erected it on new platform of Radyr conglomerate stone. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway. The font previously stood on a three step platform, in the same position as it now stands. The font cover is nineteenth century, in oak and wrought iron.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the bridge}} is a small island, after which an {{artificial}} cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards. The river now discharges over a weir {{at the site of}} the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream, and the junction is followed by another small island. Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end, and the tunnel mouth is within the site. The river continues in a large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the navigable channel, and a solid ramp to the east. Although its construction <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.|$|E
5000|$|The Psalter of Oswald {{also called}} the Ramsey Psalter (British Library, Harley MS 2904) is an Anglo-Saxon {{illuminated}} psalter of {{the last quarter of}} the tenth century. Its script and decoration <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made at Winchester, but certain liturgical features have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> intended for use at the Benedictine monastery of Ramsey Abbey, or for the personal use of Ramsey's founder St Oswald.|$|R

5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E
