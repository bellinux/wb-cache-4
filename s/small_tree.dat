5|$|Together with B.attenuata (candlestick banksia), B.menziesii is a {{dominant}} component {{in a number}} of widespread vegetation complexes of the Swan Coastal Plain, including Banksia low woodland and Jarrah-Banksia woodland. These complexes only occur on deep, well-draining sand; in shallower, seasonally wet soils, B.menziesii and B.attenuata give way to other Banksia species such as B.littoralis (swamp banksia) or B.telmatiaea (swamp fox banksia). On the Geraldton Sandplains to the north, B.menziesii usually occurs as a shrub or <b>small</b> <b>tree</b> emergent above low heath.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush {{between one and}} three metres (3–10ft) high, {{but it can also}} grow as an openly {{branched}} <b>small</b> <b>tree</b> to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that they}} are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E
5|$|Banksia brownii, {{commonly}} known as feather-leaved banksia or Brown's banksia, is a species of shrub that grows in southwest Western Australia. An attractive plant with fine feathery leaves and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres (7ft) high, but can also occur as a <b>small</b> <b>tree</b> or a low spreading shrub. First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. There are two genetically distinct forms.|$|E
40|$|Dry {{forests are}} {{particularly}} subject to wildfires, insect outbreaks, and droughts that likely will increase with climate change. Efforts to increase resilience of dry forests often focus on removing most <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> to reduce wildfire risk. However, <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> often survive other disturbances and could provide broader forest resilience, but <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> {{are thought to}} have been historically rare. We used direct records by land surveyors in the late- 1800 s along 22, 206 km of survey lines in 1. 7 million ha of dry forests in the western USA to test this idea. These systematic surveys (45, 171 trees) of historical forests reveal that <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> dominated (52 - 92 % of total trees) dry forests. Historical forests also included diverse tree sizes and species, which together provided resilience to several types of disturbances. Current risk to dry forests from insect outbreaks is 5. 6 times the risk of higher-severity wildfires, with <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> increasing forest resilience to insect outbreaks. Removal of most <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> to reduce wildfire risk may compromise the bet-hedging resilience, provided by <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> and diverse tree sizes and species, against a broad array of unpredictable future disturbances...|$|R
50|$|ID3 can overfit to the {{training}} data. To avoid overfitting, <b>smaller</b> decision <b>trees</b> should be preferred over larger ones. This algorithm usually produces <b>small</b> <b>trees,</b> {{but it does not}} always produce the <b>smallest</b> possible <b>tree.</b>|$|R
30|$|The drought-induced {{reallocation}} {{of growth}} in favour of <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> in case of spruce may result from its isohydric character. We hypothesize that as <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> are shaded, they can benefit from the reduced water consumption of their sun-exposed taller neighbours. In case of beech, as an anisohydric species, tall trees suffer less and <b>smaller</b> <b>trees</b> benefit less under drought. The discussion elaborates {{the consequences of the}} water dependent growth allocation for forest monitoring, growth modelling, and silviculture.|$|R
5|$|Banksia lemanniana, {{commonly}} known as the yellow lantern banksia or Lemann's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as an open shrub or <b>small</b> <b>tree</b> to five metres (15ft) high with stiff serrated leaves, and unusual hanging inflorescences. Flowering occurs over summer, the greenish buds developing into oval flower spikes before turning grey and developing the characteristic large woody follicles. It occurs within and just east of the Fitzgerald River National Park on the southern coast of the state. Banksia lemanniana is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{breeding}} biology of the black catbird. Its breeding season appears to run from spring through summer; nest building was observed in Belize in early May, and small young were found in a nest in Mexico in mid-August. The nest, an open cup of twigs lined with rootlets and other fine material, is placed low in a dense bush or <b>small</b> <b>tree.</b> The female lays two greenish-blue eggs. However, details of nest-building, incubation times, parental care, fledging periods and number of broods are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Telopea truncata, {{commonly}} known as the Tasmanian waratah, is a plant in the family Proteaceae. It is endemic to Tasmania where it is found on moist acidic soils at altitudes of 600 to 1200m (2000–4000ft). Telopea truncata is a component of alpine eucalypt forest, rainforest and scrub communities. It grows as a multistemmed shrub to a height of , or occasionally as a <b>small</b> <b>tree</b> to 10m (35ft) high, with red flower heads, known as inflorescences, appearing over the Tasmanian summer (November to February) and bearing 10 to 35 individual flowers. Yellow-flowered forms are occasionally seen, but do not form a population distinct {{from the rest of the}} species.|$|E
30|$|The {{fact that}} drought years reduce {{the growth of}} tall trees more {{strongly}} than the growth of <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> {{has an effect on}} the structure of forest stands. If <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> gain in relation to tall trees, they stay in the game and can widen the size distribution and vertical structuring. In both, monospecific and mixed-species stands, drought years promote the <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> in relation to the dominant trees and generate wider size differentiation and vertical heterogeneity. Without water limitation, trees are mainly competing for light. Tall trees can pre-empt the light, exert size-asymmetric competition and may suppress and outcompete their smaller neighbours. This strongly asymmetric competition turns into a more balanced competition in drought years, as <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> are more favoured than in normal years and may impede the recovery of their tall neighbours. The effect is of course not strong enough to completely change the hierarchy between <b>small</b> and tall <b>trees,</b> however, it can contribute to an increased persistence of <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> in the understorey with the above-mentioned effects on stand structure.|$|R

5|$|The aborigines signalled their {{surrender}} {{by sending}} {{a few of their}} best weapons to the Dutch, and then by bringing a <b>small</b> <b>tree</b> (often betel nut) planted in earth from their village as a token of the granting of sovereignty to the VOC. Over the next few months as word of the Dutch victory spread, more and more villages came to pay their respects at Fort Zeelandia and assure the VOC of their friendly intentions. However, the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies, with both Favorlang and Tirosen expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} trees are widely {{gathered}} as fodder for livestock and some can be eaten by humans but {{they tend to}} be high in tannins which makes them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (e.g., Thai food) and Ailanthus (e.g., in Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used for flavouring food. Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a <b>small</b> <b>tree</b> but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to make picking the leaves easier.|$|E
5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A person who was climbing a <b>small</b> <b>tree</b> was thrown away by the wind and drowned. Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along the tracks of the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners along the Mississippi coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was filled with water, while Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely torn apart. A boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E
30|$|In case of Norway spruce, dry {{years have}} an {{opposite}} {{effect on the}} relative shares which the <b>small</b> and tall <b>trees</b> have of the total stand volume growth (Fig.  7 a). While the share the 10 % <b>smallest</b> <b>trees</b> have at the total stand volume growth increases in dry years, {{the share of the}} 10 % tallest trees decreases. Drought obviously affects the volume growth share of tall trees in a stand stronger in terms of growth reduction than the <b>small</b> <b>trees.</b> In case of Norway spruce the series of dry years possibly triggers a continuous increase of the volume growth share of the <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> in the whole study period, while the share of the tall trees continuously decreases from 1998 to 2016. For European beech the trend of repartitioning in favour of the <b>small</b> <b>trees,</b> if any, is far less pronounced than for Norway spruce (Fig. 7 b).|$|R

5|$|The {{purposes}} of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise {{of effort and}} ingenuity (for the grower). Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping {{of one or more}} small trees growing in a container, beginning with a cutting, seedling, or <b>small</b> <b>tree</b> of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature deciduous forest can even be created using such species as Japanese maple, Japanese zelkova or hornbeam.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub to <b>small</b> <b>tree,</b> and {{can reach}} 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E

30|$|Many current {{silvicultural}} guidelines {{strive for}} more heterogeneous stands (Utschig et al. 2011; Pretzsch and Zenner 2017) {{as they may}} provide many ecosystem goods and services (Biber et al. 2015; Poorter et al. 2015; Mensah et al. 2016; Dieler et al. 2017) better than monocultures. The finding that <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> benefit in relation to tall trees from dry years and on dry sites (see also Pretzsch and Biber 2010) means that structural heterogeneity, as aimed at by many modern silvicultural guidelines, is easier to maintain on poor dry sites. A partitioning in favour of <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> may mean that <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> keep in the play and compensate growth losses of the tall ones, thus buffering stand productivity in unfavourable years. From {{this point of view}} removing the <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> would mean a reduction of both, structural heterogeneity and buffer capacity at stand level.|$|R
