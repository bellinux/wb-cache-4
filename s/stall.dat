5|$|Unlike many of {{the other}} British Orders, the <b>stall</b> plates (or hatchment plates) do not form a {{continuous}} record of the Knights of the Order. There are only 34 <b>stall</b> plates for the 80 or so knights appointed before 1871, (although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940), and 40 hatchments plates for the 60 knights appointed subsequently. In the case of the <b>stall</b> plates this was perhaps due to their size, 30x36 cm (12x14 in).|$|E
5|$|Above each <b>stall,</b> the occupant's heraldic {{devices are}} displayed. Perched on the {{pinnacle}} of a knight's <b>stall</b> is his helm, decorated with a mantling and topped by his crest. Under English heraldic law, women other than monarchs do not bear helms or crests; instead, the coronet appropriate to the dame's rank (if she is a peer or member of the Royal family) is used.|$|E
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the <b>stall.</b> The investigation reported that, even if the proper <b>stall</b> recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E

5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a <b>stall</b> in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's <b>stall</b> is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her <b>stall</b> {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on <b>stall</b> plates. These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of the <b>stall</b> and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E

5|$|Several {{experienced}} {{pilots who}} were at the airport {{at the time of the}} accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96lbs, which would have increased the <b>stall</b> speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would have further increased the <b>stall</b> speed by about 1.5%. A higher <b>stall</b> speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E

5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic <b>stall</b> (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic <b>stall</b> in every oscillation cycle.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Knight, the banner, helm, {{mantling}} and crest (or coronet or crown) are taken down. The <b>stall</b> plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain permanently affixed somewhere about the <b>stall,</b> so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Dames) throughout history.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Lai Ah Koon (黎亚坤) {{emigrated from}} Hainan to Singapore, {{where he worked}} as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own {{business}} with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and toast at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run the <b>stall</b> alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the toast with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin), the <b>stall</b> gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya toast and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage the <b>stall.</b>|$|E

Other refinements included a pressurized cockpit, additional fuel capacity and it was also the first prototype to be fitted with the definitive four 20mm Hispano Mark V cannon armament. Lt.

50|$|A small local {{foodstuffs}} {{market has}} operated in Inverness Street in Camden Town {{since the beginning}} of the 20th century.

The traditional Inverness Street market started losing <b>stalls</b> once local supermarkets opened; by mid-2013 all the original <b>stalls</b> had gone, being replaced by <b>stalls</b> similar to those of the other markets, including fast food but not produce.|$|R
