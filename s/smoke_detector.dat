5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical <b>smoke</b> <b>detector,</b> the ionization <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium accumulates in {{commercial}} household ionization-chamber smoke detectors from decay of the (typically) 0.2 microgram of americium-241 initially present {{as a source}} of ionizing radiation. With a half-life of 432 years, the americium-241 in an ionization <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> includes about 3% neptunium after 20 years, and about 15% after 100 years.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of May 31, 2001, Bill Hackert and his {{daughter}} Christine of Rotterdam, New York died when their house caught fire and a First Alert ionization <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> failed to sound. The cause of the fire was a frayed electrical cord behind a couch that smoldered for hours before engulfing the house with flames and smoke. The ionization <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> {{was found to be}} defectively designed, and in 2006 a jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York decided that First Alert and its parent company, BRK Brands, was liable for millions of dollars in damages.|$|E
25|$|An {{ionization}} <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> uses a radioisotope, typically americium-241, {{to ionize}} air; a difference due to smoke is detected and an alarm is generated.

50|$|Americium-241, {{an alpha}} emitter, {{is used in}} <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors.</b> The alpha {{particles}} ionize air in an open ion chamber and a small current flows through the ionized air.

25|$|A <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is {{a device}} that senses smoke, {{typically}} {{as an indicator of}} fire. Commercial security devices issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as part of a fire alarm system, while household smoke detectors, also known as smoke alarms, generally issue a local audible or visual alarm from the detector itself.|$|E
25|$|Batteries {{are used}} either as sole or as backup power for {{residential}} smoke detectors. Mains-operated detectors have disposable or rechargeable batteries; others run only on 9-volt disposable batteries. When the battery is exhausted a battery-only <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> becomes inactive; most smoke detectors chirp repeatedly if the battery is low. It {{has been found}} that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have dead or removed batteries. In response public information campaigns have been created to remind people to change <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on April Fools' Day every year. In regions using daylight saving time, campaigns may suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clocks or on a birthday.|$|E
25|$|The first single-station <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> {{was invented}} in 1970 and made public the next year. It was an {{ionization}} detector powered by a single 9-volt battery. They cost about US$125 and sold {{at a rate of}} a few hundred thousand per year. Several technological developments occurred between 1971 and 1976, including the replacement of cold-cathode tubes with solid-state electronics, which greatly reduced the detectors' sizes and made it possible to monitor battery life. The previous alarm horns, which required specialty batteries, were replaced with horns that were more energy-efficient, enabling the use of commonly available sizes of batteries. These detectors could also function with smaller amounts of radioactive source material, and the sensing chamber and <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> enclosure were redesigned for more effective operation. The rechargeable batteries were often replaced by a pair of AA batteries along with a plastic shell encasing the detector. The 10-year-lithium-battery-powered smoke alarm was introduced in 1995.|$|E

50|$|Laws {{regulating}} HHW in the U.S. {{are gradually}} becoming more strict. As of 2007, radioactive <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> {{are the only}} HHW that are managed nationally. While it is still legal in the United States to dispose of <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> in your trash in most places, manufacturers of <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> must accept returned units for disposal as mandated by the Nuclear Regulatory law 10 CFR 32.27. If you send your detector back to a manufacturer {{then it will be}} disposed in a nuclear waste facility.|$|R
25|$|The <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> has two {{ionization}} chambers, one {{open to the}} air, and {{a reference}} chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The radioactive source emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers {{should be the same}} as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm if and only if power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The current draw of an ionization <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is low enough for a small battery used as sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.|$|E
25|$|When a {{hardware}} device triggers an interrupt, the operating system's kernel decides {{how to deal}} with this event, generally by running some processing code. The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt (for example: a person usually responds to a <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> alarm before answering the phone). The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called a device driver, which may be part of the operating system's kernel, part of another program, or both. Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various means.|$|E
25|$|The americium-241 in {{ionizing}} {{smoke detectors}} poses a potential environmental hazard, albeit {{a very small}} one. Disposal regulations and recommendations for smoke detectors vary from region to region. The amount of radioactive material contained in ionizing smoke detectors is very small and thus doesn't represent a significant radiological hazard. If the americium is left in the ionization chamber of the alarm the radiological risk is insignificant because the chamber acts as a shield to the alpha radiation. A person would have to open the sealed chamber and ingest or inhale the americium for the risk to be significant. The radiation risk of exposure to an ionic <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is much smaller than natural background radiation under normal operation.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{most state}} and local laws {{regarding}} the required number and placement of smoke detectors are based upon standards established in NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. Laws governing the installation of smoke detectors {{vary depending on the}} locality. However, some rules and guidelines for existing homes are relatively consistent throughout the developed world. For example, Canada and Australia require a building to have a working <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> on every level. The United States NFPA code cited in the previous paragraph requires smoke detectors on every habitable level and within the vicinity of all bedrooms. Habitable levels include attics that are tall enough to allow access. Many other countries have comparable requirements.|$|E
25|$|A <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is {{a device}} that detects smoke and issues a signal. Most smoke {{detectors}} work either by optical detection or by physical process, {{but some of them}} use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the mains power fails. The first automatic electric fire alarm was co-invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961. Upton was an associate of Thomas Alva Edison, although {{there is no evidence that}} Edison contributed to this invention.|$|E
25|$|Americium-241 is {{an alpha}} emitter with a {{half-life}} of 432.6 years. Alpha particle radiation, {{as opposed to}} beta (electron) and gamma (electromagnetic) radiation, is used for two additional reasons: alpha particles have high ionization, so sufficient air particles will be ionized for the current to exist, and they have low penetrative power, meaning they will be stopped, safely, by the plastic of the <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> or the air. About {{one percent of the}} emitted radioactive energy of 241Am is gamma radiation. The amount of elemental americium-241 is small enough to be exempt from the regulations applied to larger sources. It includes about 37kBq or 1µCi of radioactive element americium-241 (241Am), corresponding to about 0.3µg of the isotope. This provides sufficient ion current to detect smoke, while producing a very low level of radiation outside the device.|$|E

25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern <b>smoke</b> <b>detector.</b> In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E
25|$|A photoelectric, or optical <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> {{contains}} {{a source of}} infrared, visible, or ultraviolet light (typically an incandescent light bulb or light-emitting diode), a lens, and a photoelectric receiver (typically a photodiode). In spot-type detectors all of these components are arranged inside a chamber where air, which may contain smoke from a nearby fire, flows. In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums, optical beam or projected-beam smoke detectors are used instead of a chamber within the unit: a wall-mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device, or reflected back to the receiver by a reflector. In some types, particularly optical beam types, the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the photosensor. The received light intensity will be reduced by absorption due to smoke, air-borne dust, or other substances; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold, potentially due to smoke. In other types, typically chamber types, the light is not directed at the sensor, which is not illuminated {{in the absence of}} particles. If the air in the chamber contains particles (smoke or dust), the light is scattered and some of it reaches the sensor, triggering the alarm.|$|E
