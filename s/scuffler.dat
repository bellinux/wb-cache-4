50|$|A <b>scuffler</b> {{is a word}} in Yorkshire dialect {{originating}} from the Castleford area meaning a large bread cake. This bread is always baked in a roughly triangular shape and {{is similar to the}} Northern stottie, but lighter.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{existing}} successful {{farms in the}} district, soldier settlers were encouraged to grow grapes and citrus trees. Each soldier was granted favourable terms to purchase land and equipment up {{to the value of}} £625 ($1,250). This covered the purchase of the land, a four roomed house, a horse and cart, a 6” hand plough, a hand <b>scuffler,</b> a single section harrow and citrus trees and grape cuttings.|$|E
5000|$|The concerto was {{commissioned}} by the Nashville Symphony in 2011. The uphill six-month long writing process {{became the subject of}} a documentary called How to Write a Banjo Concerto which Fleck co-directed with Sascha Paladino. One of the most challenging parts of the writing process Fleck had to overcome was that he had no experience in writing orchestral music. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Fleck described his ability to read music as [...] "rather primitive." [...] He overcame this by writing the orchestral parts in banjo tab, then used computer software to [...] "translate" [...] the tab into standard music notation.The concerto depicts a [...] "heroes' journey, with the banjo in the starring role." [...] The unusual naming of the movements, which he found after composition was completed, relates Fleck's feelings of being an outsider:A musician like myself can feel that way pretty regularly, even though the point of much of what I do is to attempt to find ways to fit naturally into many diverse environments. I often do feel like an impostor, and if anyone ever figured out the truth, I’m certain that I’d be ejected, immediately. So maybe the banjo player snuck into the orchestra with a disguise on (Infiltration), was pretty convincing that he belonged there (Integration), but at some point he let the cat out of the bag (Truth Revealed): He/I am a low-class banjo playing <b>scuffler</b> and should be tossed out forthwith! But that’s just one interpretation.” ...|$|E
50|$|Always {{baked in}} {{triangular}} shapes, <b>Scufflers</b> {{often have a}} small amount of flour on the top.|$|R
5000|$|Mentioned in the Magnificent <b>Scufflers</b> {{as common}} methods from the Collar-and-elbow grip are [...] "Arm Bars and Headlocks, Foot Pick-ups Foot Trips, Foot and leg plays, Heel blocks, Hip Rolls and Tackles".|$|R
5000|$|The {{beginning}} {{stance is}} the foundation of the style as well as the origin of its name. This very stance forced the <b>scufflers</b> to use technique rather than a sudden aggression or strength on their opponent. The beginning of the match was often a test of strategy and balance. The <b>scufflers</b> would often try to pull the other off balance or use [...] "toe taps" [...] to the opponent's foot, ankle or knee to knock them off balance as a set up for a takedown. This stage of the match could last a very long time, indeed, there are accounts where the standing portion of the match had lasted over an hour. Inevitably a take-down would occur. A flying mare was a common takedown.|$|R
5000|$|Mentioned in the Magnificent <b>Scufflers</b> for ground-wrestling and pinning {{techniques}} are [...] "Thigh and Body Holds, Double Leg Holds, Leg Grapevines, Elbow and Head Locks, Ankle Locks, head-and-elbow hold downs and Arm-and-neck holds." [...] It also states {{the majority of}} Collar-and-elbow's grappling techniques to be borrowed from catch-as-catch-can.|$|R
50|$|The Magnificent <b>Scufflers</b> by Charles Morrow Wilson in 1959 {{was seen}} as more a {{documentation}} on the history, evolution and characteristics of Collar-and-elbow more than an actual instructional manual but also mentioned that Collar-and-elbow had borrowed many techniques from way of catch-as-catch-can, showing that it had clearly become more well-rounded in its later days.|$|R
50|$|While Side-Hold wrestling {{was another}} semi-popular style of jacket-wrestling native to Ireland, Collar-and-Elbow {{was by far}} {{superior}} in popularity. Side-Hold wrestling contests largely ceased to be but many Collar-and-elbow wrestlers found the techniques useful and would often switch in mid-wrestling of a bout, from the collar-and-elbow grip to the side-hold grip. As such, all of Side-Hold's wrestling techniques were assimilated into Collar-and-Elbow, making it a diverse means of standing wrestling. In The Magnificent <b>Scufflers,</b> it was mentioned that Henry Dufur Sr., a Vermont champion of Collar-and-elbow wrestling, would often break the grip and grab his opponent by side-hold if he were too challenging {{to take in the}} collar-and-elbow grip.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} no {{evidence}} showing that the Irish style of collar-and-elbow wrestling in Ireland was a groundfighting game, the Irish who came to the United States in the late 18th and early 19th century had a style that included a fairly large amount of ground wrestling, which goes against the mold of other indigenous styles. Ground wrestling began after {{one or both of the}} <b>scufflers</b> hit the ground. Half-nelsons and various grapevines and other ground control techniques were then employed. A match was originally won only when all four points of the body (both shoulders and hips) were pinned to the ground for the count of five. In the late 19th century, the requirement to win was lessened to a three-point touch.|$|R
5000|$|In particular, the Kildare {{county of}} Ireland {{was known for}} {{excellent}} Collar-and-Elbow wrestlings of the jacket style. The rules then being to start in the namesake grip, with one hand gripping the opponent's collar firmly, the other gripping the opponent's sleeve by the elbow tightly. Once the wrestlers are informed to wrestle, it usually becomes a contest of pulling the other off balance, then employing various sweeping, tripping or throwing techniques. The focus being to put the opponent [...] "grass down" [...] on their back, with either both shoulders and one hip hitting the ground or two hips and one shoulder for [...] "3 points" [...] or both shoulders and hips hitting the ground for [...] "4 points". <b>Scufflers</b> of this method of Collar-and-elbow often rivaled in competitions with the Devon and Cornish Wrestlers.|$|R
