5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away.

25|$|In mid-1967, Seedman, then chief detective for {{southern}} Brooklyn, caught {{the case that}} made his reputation as an investigator who could solve baffling cases. While driving on the Belt Parkway one summer morning near Plum Beach, a young woman named Nancy McEwen suddenly drifted off the road onto the median strip. A police lieutenant in the car behind her pulled over {{to see what the}} problem was. He found her moaning, with her head slumped forward, and called for an ambulance. She died a short time later at Coney Island Hospital, where doctors found a small hole on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> that turned out to have been caused by a bullet.|$|E
500|$|The {{last bit}} of news {{yesterday}} morning is the King's anger against Eliza Wednesday (yesterday) night for being impudent to him. He threw a chair at her head and a spitoon also, which made a great cut on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> The nearest Doctor was sent for [...] both McGrew and McKibbin arrived. It seems the King told {{her to come to}} bed — she replied what right has a dog or a bitch there, which instantly gave vent to his ill temper that he had been brooding some days, and used a word of four letters belonging only to Waterclosets. She retorted, [...] "Oh, I suppose that is what you eat to exist on." [...] This brought the King's rage to an instant climax and [...] threw the articles at her head. I had intended to call yesterday to see how he continues to improve, but this domestic fracas of the Royal household puts it out of the question, till a few days more when the King will be settled and not so upset.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2012, she {{returned}} to the Young Vic to play the title role in After Miss Julie by Patrick Marber. Her performance received critical acclaim, with reviews describing her as [...] "little short of sensational", [...] "outstanding", and [...] "the perfect Miss Julie". The online theatre magazine Exeunt wrote that her portrayal of Miss Julie contained [...] "all the anger, desire, wit, loneliness, merriment, melancholy and desperation of the casts of several plays together... Dormer has still more presence and eerie beauty than is apparent from her appearances on-screen, and she shape-shifts almost supernaturally between seductress, child, and tormentor." [...] In March 2013, she played the Lady Door in the radio play of Neverwhere, based on the novel by Neil Gaiman. Later that year, she appeared in the car racing drama Rush and the thriller The Counselor. She also appeared in A Long Way From Home.

6000|$|For {{a longer}} time than usual she now bent over the doctor's manuscript, endeavoring to resolve a portion of it into comprehensible words.

50|$|As {{a member}} of the Mephitisoid race, Hepzibah's {{features}} are supposed to resemble that of a humanoid skunk, with a huge skunk-like tail and fur having the black-and-white coloring pattern of an Earth skunk. However, modern Marvel artists have given her a more cat-like appearance, often making her tail much smaller and making her fur all-white by removing the black markings <b>of</b> <b>her</b> coat altogether. Ironically, in her modern appearances, Hepzibah's ears are now actually closer to a skunk as they are now more rounded and on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> while in <b>her</b> classic appearances, Hepzibah's ears were closer to a cat as they were more pointed and on the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|She made {{no comment}} but walked on. He paid {{the man and}} {{followed}} her to the empty seat. Opposite, some illuminated advertisements blazed their unsightly message across the murky sky. Between the two curving rows of yellow lights the river flowed--black, turgid, hopeless. Even here, though they had escaped from its absolute thrall, the far-away roar of the city beat upon their ears. She listened to {{it for a moment}} and then pressed her hands to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|When the car {{was brought}} to a stop a {{policeman}} reached down and pulled her from under the wheels. Her dress was badly torn and soiled.

This a gentleman had already picked up, and when the policeman handed it to her and noticed the great hole in her head and the hollow place it disclosed, the poor fellow trembled so frightfully that his knees actually knocked together.|$|E
60|$|Good {{temper and}} urbanity alike {{suffered}} rudely when he beheld the wife they brought him. Catherine, {{who was in}} her twenty-fifth year, was of an absurdly low stature, so long {{in the body and}} short in the legs that, dressed as she was in an outlandish, full-skirted farthingale, she had the appearance of being on her knees when she stood before him. Her complexion was sallow, and though her eyes, like his own, were fine, they were not fine enough to redeem the dull plainness of her face. Her black hair was grotesquely dressed, with a long fore-top and two great ribbon bows standing out, one on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> like a pair of miniature wings.|$|E

60|$|Lady Mason, when Mrs. Orme {{returned}} to her, was sitting {{exactly in the}} position {{in which she had}} been left.
