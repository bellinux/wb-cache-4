While this test may indicate a more limited <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> under equity, by requiring information to be deemed confidential before falling under the scope, on another level equity may secure a broader temporal protection for confidential information. The duty under contract expires on termination of the legal retainer, whereas the duty under equity remains intact until the information is no longer confidential, which may occur long after the expiration of the contractual retainer.|$|E
40|$|In this article, I {{examine the}} reasons that {{confidentiality}} remains a bedrock fiduciary obligation for lawyers {{as well as the}} foundation for the attorney-client privilege. In Part II, I trace the history and purpose of this professional obligation, revealing two main moral justifications, efficient operation of the legal system and the promotion of trust and privacy in the client-lawyer relationship. In Part III, I examine these same rationales as the justification for exceptions to the fiduciary duty, focusing on the exceptions articulated by both the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers and the revised Model Rules of Professional Conduct. I conclude that the current <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> protection and most of the exceptions created by these two bodies of law accurately implement the central purposes of confidentiality. Each jurisdiction therefore should seriously consider revising its own lawyer codes and common law to recognize these exceptions and their underlying purposes...|$|E

Entrevistados: Chefias das Unidades Básicas de Saúde, Médicos, Enfermeiros e Agentes Comunitários de Saúde (ACS), em 2002, de unidades de saúde da cidade de São Paulo, Brasil. Os profissionais e chefias entendem que devam ser estabelecidos limites para o ACS com relação ao acesso a determinadas informações dos usuários, como as que se referem ao diagnóstico de doenças. A pesquisa mostra que o freqüente contato dos usuários com o ACS resulta na revelação de aspectos de suas condições de saúde antes de fazê-la a outros elementos da equipe de saúde. Isto gera uma questão ética a ser ainda debatida: há uma esfera própria de confidencialidade entre o ACS e os usuários, com informações que não deveriam ser divulgadas ao restante da equipe? This is an {{exploratory}} study on views of various social {{players in the}} Brazilian Family Health Program, concerning {{the right to privacy}} in the relationship between users of the program and community health agents (CHA). The following healthcare professionals were interviewed: heads of basic healthcare units, physicians, nurses and community health agents, working at health units in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, in 2002. Healthcare professionals and managers agreed that limits should be placed on access by CHAs to certain user information, including diagnosis. The study showed that frequent contact between users and CHAs results in users' disclosure of their health conditions to CHAs prior to consulting other professionals in the healthcare team. This generates the following ethical issue: Is there any specific <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> between the CHA and users over information that should not be disclosed to other team members...|$|E

5000|$|Legal {{professional}} rules {{have tended to}} adopt the broad view <b>of</b> the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> duty recognised in contract law. The obligation to retain information in confidence, according to the {{professional rules}} in Australian jurisdictions is premised on its connection with the legal retainer rather than {{the source of the}} information. Hence, the professional rules seem to imply that information gained in connection with the legal retainer is deemed confidential. However, though the rules emphasise the importance of the duty <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> this is not a hard rule. Not all information connected with the retainer meets the legal test <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> The duty <b>of</b> confidence applies to [...] "any information, which is confidential to a client and acquired by a practitioner or a practitioner's firm during the client's engagement."

40|$|Under Quebec law, {{the members}} of thirty-nine {{regulated}} professions are bound by statute to professional secrecy. This obligation is reinforced by section 9 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. It protects patients and clients against the extrajudicial disclosure of confidential information but it also operates as an evidentiary privilege which the courts must enforce ex officio in all proceedings of a non-criminal nature. According to the authors, this statutory equation <b>of</b> professional <b>confidentiality</b> with privilege necessarily leads to the overgrowth of privilege or to the atrophy <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> The rule interferes excessively with the administration of civil justice and compels the courts to adopt result-oriented interpretations detrimental to the coherence of the law. The article first describes {{the relationship between the}} applicable legislation and the several codes of professional ethics defining the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> professional secret. A second part explores the possible justifications for legal duties <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and evidentiary privileges ; most of these rationales are compatibles with a distinction between in-court and out-of-court requirements of secrecy. The authors then review in a third part various cases in which Quebec courts have dealt with objections based on professional secret. Three conflicting interpretations were adopted in these cases. All three interpretations restrict the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> professional privilege, sometimes at the expense of legitimate claims for out-of-court confidentiality. It therefore appears desirable to re-establish in the legislation a distinction between the judicial and extrajudicial aspects of professional secret. The conclusion contains suggestions for a reform of the law of professional secret in Quebec...|$|R

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the appropriateness of}} the use and reporting <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions in a sample of Australian Government contracts. Audit objective, criteria and scope This audit is the seventeenth in a series of audits and fulfils the Senate’s request for the Auditor‐General to provide an annual report on agencies’ compliance with the Senate Procedural Order of Continuing Effect: Departmental and Agency Contracts (the Senate Order/the Order). The objective of the audit was to assess {{the appropriateness of the}} use and reporting <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions in a sample of Australian Government contracts. To conclude on this objective the ANAO’s broad criteria included an assessment of whether relevant agencies adhered to the requirements of the Senate Order and whether the reported use <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions in a sample of contracts was appropriate. The <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the audit included an examination of the timeliness and content of all published contract listings relating to the 2013 calendar year as at 14 March 2014. In addition, the ANAO examined whether selected agencies accurately reported contract information, including the use <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions, in the contract listings and on AusTender. The four agencies included {{in this part of the}} audit were the: 	Australian Federal Police (AFP); 	Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC); 	Department of Communications (Communications/DoC); and 	Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP). Overall conclusion The unwarranted inclusion <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions in government contracts has the potential to impede scrutiny and accountability of government expenditure. The Senate Order aims to address these concerns by making details of significant contracts accessible and requiring that any use <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions is soundly based. Since the Senate Order’s introduction, the proportion of contracts reported as containing confidentiality provisions across all Government agencies (subject to the Order) has declined significantly from 24  per cent for the 2001 – 02 financial year to 4. 5  per cent for the 2013 calendar year. Although the proportion of contracts reported as containing confidentially provisions in 2013 was low (in keeping with 2012 levels), specific confidentiality provisions in contracts continued to be incorrectly applied and reported. To assess the appropriateness of the use <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions, the ANAO examined a sample of 95 contracts across four agencies. Consistent with the results of previous audits, fewer than 40  per cent of the contracts examined contained confidentiality provisions that had been correctly reported—with most of the issues primarily relating to misreporting of contract information rather than with the contracts themselves. Where there was inappropriate use <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions, it was generally due to a lack of understanding of how to distinguish between the various types <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions. The ANAO also examined the consistency and accuracy of the audited agencies’ procurement contract reporting in their 2013 calendar year Senate Order contract listings and on AusTender. There were some inconsistencies in the contract details reported between the two listings, partly reflecting the differences in Senate Order and AusTender reporting requirements. However, the ANAO’s examination of the sample of 95 contracts identified that fewer than 35  per cent had been accurately reported in either the Senate Order contract listings or on AusTender. The main focus of the ANAO audits of the Senate Order is the appropriateness of the use <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions. Overall, the results of this audit, consistent with previous audit findings, indicate that the intent of the Senate Order—to provide transparency in government contracting—is being addressed. However, as explained above, the application and reporting <b>of</b> specific <b>confidentiality</b> provisions remains problematic and agencies should take steps to improve staff understanding around when and how the provisions apply. The quality of data reported in the Senate Order listings and AusTender also requires attention. The recommendations from the Finance and Public Administration References Committee 2 ̆ 7 s recent inquiry into the Senate Order, if implemented, can be expected to assist in streamlining the reporting requirements for agencies. Nonetheless, agencies should take steps to implement stronger quality assurance processes to support accurate data capture and reporting of contract information. This should also include providing staff with practical support, such as decision flow charts and examples relevant to their agency’s work, and encouraging staff to apply them...|$|R
