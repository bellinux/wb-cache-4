Validated assessment metrics are lacking for many robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). As it is quickly becoming {{the gold standard for}} treatment of localized prostate cancer, the development and validation of a RARP assessment tool for training is timely. Materials and methods We recruited 13 expert RARP surgeons from the United States and Canada to serve as our Delphi panel. Using an initial inventory developed via a modified Delphi process with urology residents, fellows, and staff at our institution, panelists iteratively rated each <b>step</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-step</b> on a 5 -point Likert scale of agreement for inclusion in the final assessment tool. Qualitative feedback was elicited for each item to determine proper <b>step</b> placement, wording, <b>and</b> suggestions. Results Panelist’s responses were compiled and the inventory was edited through three iterations, after which 100 % consensus was achieved. The initial inventory steps were decreased by 13 % and a skip pattern was incorporated. The final RARP stepwise inventory was comprised of 13 critical steps with 52 sub-steps. There was no attrition throughout the Delphi process. Conclusions Our Delphi study resulted in a comprehensive inventory of intraoperative RARP steps with excellent consensus. This final inventory will be used to develop a valid and psychometrically sound intraoperative assessment tool for use during RARP training and evaluation, with the aim of increasing competency of all trainees...|$|R

In any case, we agree to name it instruction/user's manual and we treat it as a unit. This communication presents a research done with the purpose of establishing the rhetorical structure of instruction manuals for household appliances and to contrast the differences in two languages, Spanish and English. With this commitment we have complied a 52 -text bilingual corpus divided into two comparable subcorpora following Sinclair's (1991) and Leech's (1996) ideas on corpus linguistics as well as other scholars. The theoretical framework for this contrastive study is based on macro-linguistics. We have taken the notion of genre to approach the corpus and considered instruction manuals as one more of them. This macro-linguistic perspective is based on Swales (1993), Halliday and Hasan (1989), Werlich (1983) and Bhatia's (1993, 2004) notions. Then, as the communicative process (Shannon, 1948) and the pragmatic relations are similar in every case, {{we have been able to}} preform a rhetoric analysis from a twofold perspective: qualitative and quantitative. On the qualitative side of the analysis, we have determined the prototypical structure, following and adapting Swales model (1993) to the instructional genre, and according to it we have tagged the corpus into moves, <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-steps.</b> On the quantitative side of the analysis, we have looked for the significance of the different moves, <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-steps</b> in numerical terms and percentages.

40|$|A {{new method}} for pest risk {{assessment}} and {{the identification and}} evaluation of risk-reducing options is currently under development by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Plant Health Panel. The draft method has been tested on pests of concern to the European Union (EU). The method is adaptable and can focus either on all the <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-steps</b> of the assessment process or on specific parts if necessary. It is based on assessing changes in pest population abundance as the major driver of the impact on cultivated plants and on the environment. Like other pest risk assessment systems the method asks questions about the likelihood and magnitude of {{factors that contribute to}} risk. Responses can be based on data or expert judgment. Crucially, the approach is quantitative, and it captures uncertainty through the provision by risk assessors of quantile estimates of the probability distributions for the assessed variables and parameters. The assessment is based on comparisons between different scenarios, and the method integrates risk-reducing options where they apply to a scenario, for example current regulation against a scenario where risk-reducing options are not applied. A strategy has been developed to communicate the results of the risk assessment in a clear, comparable and transparent way, with the aim of providing the requestor of the risk assessment with a useful answer to the question(s) posed to the EFSA Plant Health Panel. The method has been applied to four case studies, two fungi, Ceratocystis platani and Cryphonectria parasitica, the nematode Ditylenchus destructor and the Grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma. Selected results from these case studies illustrate the types of output that the method can deliver. </p...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 47 - 50). This thesis {{presents a}} genre-based study of U. S. law school lectures attended by foreign lawyers. With {{the practice of}} law becoming more international, an increasing number of working professionals in the field of law are enrolling in U. S. law schools to gain knowledge of the U. S. legal system. Previous research within English for Academic Legal Purposes (EALP) has mainly been concerned with developing and improving reading and writing skills primarily of native speakers. Very few studies have focused on analyzing the spoken interactions in a law school classroom and addressing the needs of foreign lawyers that attend U. S. law schools. This study reports on an analysis of aural and oral needs of foreign lawyers enrolled in a certificate program at a U. S. law school by focusing on the rhetorical structure of lectures and students' role in classroom interaction. The analysis showed that law school lectures constitute a genre made up of moves, <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-steps</b> comprised within three larger units of organization: Content Introduction, Content Development, and Session Closing. Each of these rhetorical functions is signaled by particular lexical items and grammatical choices. The analysis revealed that not all moves and steps are obligatory. Furthermore, instead of following a linear structure, the moves are highly recursive, which is a notable feature of spoken discourse. In addition, the bulk of the lecture is composed of move cycles which resemble the structure of the analytical and organizational tool widely known in the field of law as IRAC (Issue, Rule, Analysis, Conclusion). The analysis of classroom interaction revealed variation in interactivity across larger units and moves. Turn-taking is most frequently initiated by students' questions fulfilling a number of functions, such as seeking information, confirming understanding, seeking clarification, and applying a legal concept to hypothetical situations. In addition to the functions, the forms of questions were also explored. The thesis concludes with suggestions for employing {{the results of this study}} in an EALP course. In particular, the use of lecture transcripts for developing students' aural and oral skills is advocated...|$|E

For example, {{a person with a}} valid dispute who cannot afford to have the dispute resolved in court, has limited access to justice, which is a constitutional right. The two methods that are most commonly used by attorneys engaged in litigation in South Africa to account to their clients are: Hourly billing, where clients are billed for the time spent on a matter or for the volume and number of documents created, and contingency fees, also known as “no win no fee” arrangements. Both these billing systems have disadvantages, including the incidence of risk during the litigation process and the incentive to the attorney to act in the client’s best interest. It is submitted that a fixed fee structure would resolve many of the problems experienced by the traditional billing methods. The challenge is to arrive at a fixed fee structure which is based on a proper analysis of the amount of work involved in the legal process. In order to calculate such a fixed fee structure, the legal process has to be broken into a number of <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-steps,</b> and each of these steps should then be analysed to ascertain how much work it entails. The aim {{of this study is to}} arrive at a model for a fixed fee structure which can be implemented at other law firms that are also engaged in litigation work. Primary billing data obtained from the author’s law firm was analysed to ascertain the various steps in the legal process, and to calculate the expected amount of work involved in each step. This data was then used to develop a fixed fee structure model which can be adopted by any litigation law firm, by merely multiplying its own current hourly billing fee structure with the values provided in the model. Certain practical problems which may be encountered during the implementation of the fixed fee structure are also discussed and possible alternative solutions are provided...|$|E

Los lectores son expertos en la temática de dicho trabajo así como en la utilización de procesos de lectura y escritura académica. Los objetivos específicos de la investigación fueron identificar y analizar: a) la representación de la tarea de los lectores; b) los objetivos planteados; c) las operaciones estratégicas que vinculan procesos de lectura y escritura; d) los tipos de problemas planteados y soluciones; y e) el Abordaje Estratégico Global (AEG) aplicado por los lectores. La investigación se llevó a cabo con una metodología cualitativa en la modalidad de estudio de caso. Las técnicas de obtención de información fueron: 1) el protocolo verbal o think-aloud que los lectores desarrollaron en las sesiones de lectura y que grabaron en vídeo; 2) las entrevistas semi-estructuradas; y 3) el registro de observación de los vídeos de los protocolos verbales. Las unidades de análisis fueron unidades estratégicas que se estructuraron con planteamientos de problemas, procesos de solución y producciones realizados por los lectores durante la revisión del trabajo de investigación. Posteriormente, la información obtenida se organizó y analizó mediante el programa para análisis cualitativo Atlas/ti versión 5. 1. Los resultados individuales indicaron que los lectores desarrollaron distintos abordajes estratégicos de la lectura: el caso A estuvo centrado en evaluar el escrito; el caso B en la búsqueda de información; el caso C en complementar los contenidos del texto; el caso D en prever la información que sería abordada en el escrito y determinar el tipo de lectura en función de ésta; y el caso E en obtener una comprensión profunda del contenido. Los resultados comparativos demostraron que se efectuaron un mayor número de procesos estratégico en el apartado 1 del texto revisado, así también que los lectores se centraron en problemas temáticos del contenido, que efectuaron más procesos inferenciales como procesos de solución y que las producciones realizadas con más frecuencia fueron las de obtención y corrección de información. A partir de los resultados obtenidos, en función de los objetivos específicos que planteamos, concluimos que: a) existió una congruencia entre los criterios de evaluación del trabajo de investigación de los revisores y el procesamiento del contenido del texto y que la toma de consciencia sobre criterios de evaluación de textos académicos {{puede ser}} una herramienta de ayuda para un mayor control de procesos de lectura académica en investigadores noveles; b) algunos lectores llevaron a cabo una lectura por etapas y esto, aplicado por investigadores noveles, puede ser de utilidad para lograr una mayor toma de consciencia sobre los pasos y sub-pasos, así como objetivos que forman parte de la tarea de la lectura, y con ello alcanzar un mayor control sobre el procesamiento del texto; c) la distinción entre planificaciones de tipo local y planificaciones globales puede aportar criterios de evaluación de estrategias de lectura; d) las anotaciones fueron llevadas a cabo de un manera multifuncional; e) los problemas planteados por los lectores pueden servir como criterios de evaluación de textos de investigación; f) las unidades estratégicas utilizadas en esta investigación pueden resultar una herramienta metodológica para el estudio de estrategias de lectura. The {{objective of this}} investigation was to analyze and describe the strategies of reading that five university and investigating professors applied, as committee court, during the reading of a work of investigation, in which also they elaborated a report on this text. The reviewers are expert in the development of processes of reading and academic writing, {{as well as in the}} thematic one tried in the work of investigation that read. The specific objectives of the investigation were to identify and to analyze: a) the representation of the task of the readers; b) the large-scale operations that they tie to processes of reading and writing; c) the objectives raised by the readers; d) the kind of posed problems and the type of found solutions; and e) the global strategic boarding applied by the readers. The investigation was carried out with a qualitative methodology in the modality of case study. The techniques of obtaining of information were: the 1) verbal protocol or think-aloud that the readers developed in the reading sessions and that recorded in video; the 2) semi-structured interviews; and 3) the observation log of the videos of the verbal protocols. The analysis units were strategic units that problems expositions of, process of solution and production realized by the readers were structured with during the revision of the work of investigation. Later, the obtained data were organized and analyzed by means of the program for qualitative analysis Atlas/ti version 5. 1. The individual results indicated that the readers developed different strategic boardings from the reading: the case to was focused in evaluating the text; case B in the information search; case C in complementing the contents of the text; case D in anticipating the information that would be boarded in the writing and determining the type of reading based on this one; and the case E in obtaining a deep understanding of the content. The comparative results demonstrated that a greater strategic number of processes took place in section 1 of the reviewed text, also that the readers concentrated in thematic problems of the content, that carried out more inferencial processes like solution processes and that the productions realized with more frequency were those of obtaining and correction of information. From the obtained results, based on the specific objectives that we raised, we concluded that: a) Existed a congruence between the criteria of evaluation of the text and the processing of the content of the text, and taking conscience on criteria of academic text evaluation can be a tool of aid for a greater process control of academic reading in beginner investigators. b) Some readers carried out a reading by stages and this, applied by beginner investigators, can be useful to obtain a greater taking of conscience on the <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-steps,</b> as well as objectives that comprise of the task of the reading, and in this way reach a greater control on the processing of the text. c) The distinction between global planning of local type can contribute like criteria of evaluation of reading strategies; d) the notes were carried out of a multifunctional way. e) The problems posed by the readers can serve like criteria of evaluation of investigation texts. f) The strategic units used in this investigation can be a methodological tool for the study of reading strategies...|$|E

40|$|Avoiding {{inappropriate}} polypharmacy {{has become}} increasingly recognised as a safety imperative for older patient care. Deprescribing is an active process of reviewing all medications being used by individual patients that prompts clinicians to consider which medications have unfavourable risk–benefit trade-offs {{in the context of}} illness severity, advanced age, multi-morbidity, physical and emotional capacity, life expectancy, care goals and personal preferences. Structured guides to deprescribing include algorithms, flow charts or tables which are patient-directed and aim to guide the clinician through sequential steps in deciding which medications should be targeted for discontinuation. In this narrative review, we describe seven structured deprescribing guides whose stated purpose included the reduction of polypharmacy, their use was not restricted to a single drug or drug class and they had undergone some form of efficacy testing. There was considerable heterogeneity in guide design and content, with some guides constituting little more than a set of principles while others entail detailed processes <b>and</b> <b>sub-steps</b> which addressed multiple determinants of drug appropriateness. Evidence of effectiveness for each guide was limited in that none have been evaluated in randomised controlled trials, that pilot or feasibility studies have involved relatively small patient samples, that intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities have not been determined and that most have been studied in hospital settings. Which is most useful to clinicians is unknown in the absence of head-to-head comparisons. While most guides have face validity, more research is needed for determining effectiveness and ease of use in routine clinical practice, especially in primary care settings...|$|R
