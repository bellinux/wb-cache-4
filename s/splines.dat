5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, <b>splines,</b> keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E

30|$|Recently, {{combining}} the block-oriented architecture with the <b>spline</b> function, several novel adaptive nonlinear <b>spline</b> adaptive filters (SAFs) {{have been introduced}} such as Wiener <b>spline</b> filter, Hammerstein <b>spline</b> filter, cascade <b>spline</b> filter and IIR <b>spline</b> adaptive filter (IIR-SAF). These <b>spline</b> adaptive models can be implemented by different connections of the <b>spline</b> function and linear time-invariant (LTI) model. The nonlinearity {{in this kind of}} structure is modeled by the <b>spline</b> function, which can be represented by the adaptive look-up table (LUT) interpolated by a local low-order <b>spline</b> curve. The SAFs achieve improved performance in modeling the nonlinearity. Furthermore, in each iteration, only a portion of the control points is tuned depending on the order of the <b>spline</b> function and the nonlinear shape is slightly changed. Consequently, this local behavior of the <b>spline</b> function results in the considerable saving in the computation complexity.|$|R

30|$|There are {{substantial}} interests on the numerical {{treatment of the}} problem (1.1). Noor and Khalifa [19] have used a collocation method with cubic B-splines as basis functions to solve (1.1), while the well-known Numerov method and finite difference schemes based on the central difference have been employed in [22]. Thereafter, Al-Said et al. [5] show that cubic <b>spline</b> method gives numerical solutions that are more accurate than that computed by quintic <b>spline</b> and finite difference techniques. The numerical results of [5, 19, 22] indicate first-order accuracy for these methods. In [4], a two-stage method is developed where a finite difference scheme is first employed to obtain the numerical solutions at mid-knots of a uniform mesh, then a second-order interpolation is used to obtain the numerical solutions at the knots. This method is of second-order accuracy. Other proven second-order accurate methods include polynomial <b>spline</b> methods that employ quadratic <b>spline</b> [1], cubic <b>spline</b> [2, 3] and quintic <b>spline</b> [6]. The numerical solutions are obtained at mid-knots of a uniform mesh in [1 – 3], while numerical solutions are obtained at the knots in [6]. These polynomial <b>spline</b> methods use ‘continuous’ <b>spline,</b> and derivatives of the <b>spline</b> {{are involved in the}} <b>spline</b> relations. On the other hand, discrete <b>spline</b> uses differences instead of derivatives in the <b>spline</b> relations. In [8], Chen and Wong have developed a deficient discrete cubic <b>spline</b> method for (1.1). It is proved that the accuracy of the method is two, and the numerical experiments demonstrate better accuracy over polynomial <b>spline</b> methods.|$|R
