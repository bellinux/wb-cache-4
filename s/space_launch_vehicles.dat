25|$|Private spaceflight is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} area: space flight {{that is not}} only paid for by corporations or even private individuals, but often provided by private spaceflight companies. These companies often assert that much of the previous high cost of access to space was caused by governmental inefficiencies they can avoid. This assertion can be supported by much lower published launch costs for private <b>space</b> <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as Falcon 9 developed with private financing. Lower launch costs and excellent safety will be required for the applications such as Space tourism and especially Space colonization to become successful.|$|E
500|$|The SpaceX {{reusable}} launch {{system development}} {{program is a}} privately funded program to develop a set of new technologies for an orbital launch system that may be reused many times {{in a manner similar}} to the reusability of aircraft. [...] The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of <b>space</b> <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours. [...] SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.|$|E
2500|$|By 1913 {{he had in}} {{his spare}} time, using calculus, {{developed}} the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. His first goal was to build a sounding rocket with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed in order to design efficient <b>space</b> <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles.</b> He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that [...] "n no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may." ...|$|E

The range of these first missiles was only [...] By 1959 Soviet {{scientists and engineers}} developed new technology, and as a result, the [...] "Southern" [...] design office (KBYu – as abbreviated in Russian) started a new machine-building project making ballistic missiles. [...] Under the leadership of Yangel, KBYu produced such powerful rocket engines that the range of these ballistic missiles was practically without limits. During the 1960s, these powerful rocket engines were used as launch vehicles for the first Soviet space ships. During Makarov’s directorship, Yuzhmash designed and manufactured four generations of missile complexes of different types. These included <b>space</b> <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> Kosmos, Tsyklon-2, Tsyklon-3 and Zenit. Under the leadership of Yangel’s successor, V. Utkin, the KBYu created a unique space-rocket system called Energia-Buran. Yuzhmash engineers manufactured 400 technical devices that were launched in artificial satellites (Sputniks). For {{the first time in}} the world space industry, the Dnipropetrovsk missile plant organised the serial production of space Sputniks. By the 1980s, this plant manufactured 67 different types of space ships, 12 space research complexes and 4 defense space rocket systems.|$|E

In the same vein, the IUS Operations Branch was placed under the <b>Space</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Systems Division when that branch was formed on 1 July 1977. Following the final Atlas-Agena launch on 6 April 1978, the <b>Space</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Systems Division and the Satellite Systems Division shifted their respective attentions from Atlas-Agena operations on Complex 13 to Atlas-Centaur boosters and payloads designated for Defense Department missions on Complex 36.|$|R
40|$|Market {{sensitivity}} and weight-based cost estimating relationships are key drivers {{in determining the}} financial viability of advanced <b>space</b> <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> designs.
