40|$|SummaryBackgroundSpontaneous “miniature” {{transmitter}} release {{takes place}} at low rates at all synapses. Long thought of as an unavoidable leak, spontaneous release has recently been suggested to be mediated by distinct pre- and postsynaptic molecular machineries {{and to have a}} specialized role in setting up and adjusting neuronal circuits. It remains unclear how spontaneous and evoked transmission are related at individual synapses, how they are distributed spatially when an axon makes multiple contacts with a target, and whether they are commonly regulated. ResultsElectrophysiological recordings in the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction, {{in the presence of the}} use-dependent glutamate receptor (GluR) blocker philanthotoxin, indicated that spontaneous and evoked transmission employ distinct sets of GluRs. In vivo imaging of transmission using synaptically targeted GCaMP 3 to detect Ca 2 + influx through the GluRs revealed little spatial overlap between synapses participating in spontaneous and evoked transmission. Spontaneous and evoked transmission were oppositely correlated with presynaptic levels of the protein Brp: synapses with high Brp favored evoked transmission, whereas synapses with low Brp were more active spontaneously. High-frequency stimulation did not increase the overlap between evoked and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmission,</b> and instead decreased the rate of spontaneous release from synapses that were highly active in evoked transmission. ConclusionsAlthough individual synapses can participate in both evoked and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmission,</b> highly active synapses show a preference for one mode of transmission. The presynaptic protein Brp promotes evoked transmission and suppresses spontaneous release. These findings suggest the existence of presynaptic mechanisms that promote synaptic specialization to either evoked or <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmission...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} reported that oxytocin produces an inward current at a holding potential of − 70 mV without {{a change in}} glutamatergic excitatory transmission in adult male rat spinal lamina II (substantia gelatinosa; SG) neurons that play {{a pivotal role in}} regulating nociceptive transmission. Oxytocin also enhanced GABAergic and glycinergic <b>spontaneous</b> inhibitory <b>transmissions</b> in a manner sensitive to a voltage-gated Na+-channel blocker tetrodotoxin. These actions were mediated by oxytocin-receptor activation. Such a result was different from that obtained by other investigators in young male rat superficial dorsal horn neurons in which an oxytocin-receptor agonist enhanced glutamatergic and GABAergic but not glycinergic <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In order to know a developmental change and also sexual difference in the actions of oxytocin, we examined its effect on <b>spontaneous</b> synaptic <b>transmission</b> in adult female and young male rat SG neurons by using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in spinal cord slices. In adult female rats, oxytocin produced an inward current at − 70 mV without a change in excitatory transmission. GABAergic and glycinergic transmissions were enhanced by oxytocin, the duration of which enhancement was much shorter than in adult male rats. In young (11 – 21 postnatal days) male rats, oxytocin produced not only an inward but also outward current at − 70 mV, and presynaptically inhibited or facilitated excitatory transmission, depending on the neurons tested; both GABAergic and glycinergic transmissions were enhanced by oxytocin. The inhibitory transmission enhancements in adult female and young male rats were sensitive to tetrodotoxin. Although the data {{may not be enough to}} be estimated, it is suggested that synaptic modulation by oxytocin in SG neurons, i. e., cellular mechanism for its antinociceptive action, exhibits a developmental change and sexual difference...|$|R

Our results show that transmission of the Amp(r) gene to E. coli by genetic transformation, caused by DNA released from the yeast, occurs at a very low frequency (about 50 transformants per mu g of DNA) under optimal conditions (a highly competent host strain and a highly efficient transformation procedure).

40|$|SummaryThe insulin-like growth factor- 1 {{receptor}} (IGF- 1 R) signaling {{is a key}} regulator of lifespan, growth, and development. While reduced IGF- 1 R signaling delays {{aging and}} Alzheimer’s disease progression, whether and how it regulates information processing at central synapses remains elusive. Here, we show that presynaptic IGF- 1 Rs are basally active, regulating synaptic vesicle release and short-term plasticity in excitatory hippocampal neurons. Acute IGF- 1 R blockade or transient knockdown suppresses spike-evoked synaptic transmission and presynaptic cytosolic Ca 2 + transients, while promoting <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmission</b> and resting Ca 2 + level. This dual effect on transmitter release is mediated by mitochondria that attenuate Ca 2 + buffering {{in the absence of}} spikes and decrease ATP production during spiking activity. We conclude that the mitochondria, activated by IGF- 1 R signaling, constitute a critical regulator of information processing in hippocampal neurons by maintaining evoked-to-spontaneous transmission ratio, while constraining synaptic facilitation at high frequencies. Excessive IGF- 1 R tone may contribute to hippocampal hyperactivity associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Video Abstrac...|$|E

The application of glycine (100 [*]µM) significantly increased the frequency of sEPSCs, without affecting the amplitude of sEPSCs. The glycine-induced increase in sEPSC frequency was blocked by 1 [*]µM strychnine, a specific glycine receptor antagonist. The results suggest that glycine acts on presynaptic glycine receptors to increase the probability of glutamate release from excitatory nerve terminals. The glycine-induced increase in sEPSC frequency completely disappeared either in the presence of tetrodotoxin or Cd 2 +, voltage-gated Na+, or Ca 2 + channel blockers, suggesting that the activation of presynaptic glycine receptors might depolarize excitatory nerve terminals.

40|$|We study two {{fundamental}} communication primitives: broadcasting and leader {{election in the}} classical model of multi-hop radio networks with unknown topology and without collision detection mechanisms. It {{has been known for}} almost 20 years that in undirected networks with n nodes and diameter D, randomized broadcasting requires Omega(D log n/D + log^ 2 n) rounds in expectation, assuming that uninformed nodes are not allowed to communicate (until they are informed). Only very recently, Haeupler and Wajc (PODC' 2016) showed that this bound can be slightly improved for the model with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmissions,</b> providing an O(D log n loglog n / log D + log^O(1) n) -time broadcasting algorithm. In this paper, we give a new and faster algorithm that completes broadcasting in O(D log n/log D + log^O(1) n) time, with high probability. This yields the first optimal O(D) -time broadcasting algorithm whenever D is polynomial in n. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to design a new leader election algorithm that matches the performance of our broadcasting algorithm. Previously, all fast randomized leader election algorithms have been using broadcasting as their subroutine and their complexity have been asymptotically strictly bigger than the complexity of broadcasting. In particular, the fastest previously known randomized leader election algorithm of Ghaffari and Haeupler (SODA' 2013) requires O(D log n/D min{loglog n, log n/D} + log^O(1) n) -time with high probability.

40|$|SummaryMutations in the {{transcriptional}} repressor, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP 2), {{result in}} a neurodevelopmental disorder called Rett Syndrome (RTT) [1 – 5]. Based on the neurological phenotypes observed in Rett patients, we examined the potential role of MeCP 2 in synaptic function. We compared elementary properties of synaptic transmission between cultured hippocampal neurons from MeCP 2 knockout and wild-type littermate control mice and found {{a decrease in the}} frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> excitatory synaptic <b>transmission</b> (mEPSCs) in neurons lacking MeCP 2. We also detected {{a significant increase in the}} rate of short-term synaptic depression. To explore whether these functional effects can be attributed to MeCP 2 's role as a transcriptional silencer, we treated cultures with a drug that impairs histone deacetylation and examined <b>spontaneous</b> synaptic <b>transmission.</b> Treatment with this compound induced a similar decrease in mEPSC frequency in wild-type control cultures, but this decrease was occluded in MeCP 2 -deficient neurons. Interestingly, neither the loss of MeCP 2 nor the drug treatment resulted in changes in mIPSC properties. Finally, by means of a lentivirus expressing Cre recombinase, we show that loss of MeCP 2 function after neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis was sufficient to mimic the decrease in mEPSC frequency seen in constitutive MeCP 2 KO neurons. Taken together, these results suggest a role for MeCP 2 in control of excitatory presynaptic function through regulation of gene expression...|$|R
40|$|SummaryNeurotransmitters are {{released}} at presynaptic active zones (AZs). In the fly Drosophila, monoclonal antibody (MAB) nc 82 specifically labels AZs. We employ nc 82 to identify Bruchpilot protein (BRP) as a previously unknown AZ component. BRP shows homology to human AZ protein ELKS/CAST/ERC, which binds RIM 1 {{in a complex}} with Bassoon and Munc 13 - 1. The C terminus of BRP displays structural similarities to multifunctional cytoskeletal proteins. During development, transcription of the bruchpilot locus (brp) coincides with neuronal differentiation. Panneural reduction of BRP expression by RNAi constructs permits a first functional characterization of this large AZ protein: larvae show reduced evoked but normal <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmission</b> at neuromuscular junctions. In adults, we observe loss of T bars at active zones, absence of synaptic components in electroretinogram, locomotor inactivity, and unstable flight (hence “bruchpilot”—crash pilot). We propose that BRP is critical for intact AZ structure and normal-evoked neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses of Drosophila...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{neurotransmitter}} {{released from a}} presynaptic terminal {{is the product of}} the quantal content (number of vesicles) and the presynaptic quantal size (QSpre, amount of transmitter per vesicle). QSpre varies with synaptic use, but its regulation is poorly understood. The motor nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) contain TGF-β receptors. We present evidence that TGF-β 2 regulates QSpre at the NMJ. Application of TGF-β 2 to the rat diaphragm NMJ increased the postsynaptic response to both spontaneous and evoked release of acetylcholine, whereas antibodies to TGF-β 2 or its receptor had the converse effect. L-vesamicol and bafilomycin blocked the actions of TGF-β 2, indicating that TGF-β 2 acts by altering the extent of vesicular filling. Recordings of the postsynaptic currents from the diaphragm were consistent with TGF-β 2 having this presynaptic action and a lesser postsynaptic effect on input resistance. TGF-β 2 also decreased quantal content by an atropine-sensitive pathway, indicating that this change is secondary to cholinergic feedback on vesicular release. Consequently, the net actions of TGF-β 2 at the NMJ were to amplify the postsynaptic effects of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmission</b> and to diminish the number of vesicles used per evoked stimulus, without diminishing the amount of acetylcholine released...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{hippocampus}} exhibits distinct {{patterns of}} network activity that {{are dependent on}} the interaction between inhibitory and excitatory transmission. Kainate receptors are ideally positioned to regulate this activity {{by virtue of their}} ability to regulate presynaptic function in GABAergic interneurones. Indeed, kainate receptors are highly expressed in neonatal hippocampal interneurones, yet the role and mechanisms by which they might regulate neonatal circuitry are unexplored. To address this we investigated the kainate receptor-dependent regulation of GABAergic transmission onto neonatal CA 1 pyramidal neurones. Kainate receptor activation produced two distinct opposing effects, a very large increase in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs, and a robust depression of evoked GABAergic transmission. The up-regulation of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmission</b> was due to activation of somatodendritic and axonal receptors while the depression of evoked transmission could be fully accounted for by a direct regulation of GABA release by kainate receptors located at the terminals. None of the effects of kainate receptor agonists were sensitive to GABAB receptor antagonists, nor was there any postsynaptic kainate receptor-dependent effects observed in CA 1 pyramidal cells that could account for our findings. Our data demonstrate that kainate receptors profoundly regulate neonatal CA 1 GABAergic circuitry by two distinct opposing mechanisms, and indicate that these two effects are mediated by functionally distinct populations of receptors. Thus kainate receptors are strategically located to {{play a critical role in}} shaping early hippocampal network activity and by virtue of this have a key role in hippocampal development...|$|E

40|$|Fear {{conditioning}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} powerful and widely used paradigm to investigate the mechanisms of associative learning in animals (LeDoux, 2000; Maren, 2001). Behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological evidence indicate that induction of long-term-potentiation (LTP), a form of associative, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala (LA), a brain structure tightly controlled by GABAergic inhibition, underlies the acquisition of fear conditioning (Lang and Pare, 1997; Pare et al., 2003). Dopamine (DA), the most abundant catecholemine in the brain, is released in the amygdala upon stress. DA receptor activation is required for the potentiation of sensory evoked neuronal activity in the LA during conditioning (Rosenkranz and Grace, 2002). Conversely, intra-amygdala injections of DA receptor antagonists prevents the acquisition of fear conditioning (Greba et al., 2001; Greba and Kokkinidis, 2000; Guarraci et al., 2000; Guarraci et al., 1999). The cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying the dopaminergic modulation of fear conditioning and synaptic plasticity are, however, still unknown. In the first part of my work, I showed that DA gates the induction of LTP in the mouse LA by supressing feed-forward inhibition mediated by local interneurons. The action of DA on synaptic plasticity depended on the activation of D 2 receptors and appeared to be twofold. First, it reduced the quantal content at inhibitory synapses, thereby decreasing inhibitory synaptic transmission and second, it facilitated inhibition onto interneurons by depolarizing interneurons involved in disinhibition. In the second part of my work I investigated the role of DA on spontaneous inhibitory network activity. Consistent with previous in vivo data showing that systemic administration of DA agonists in the LA increases the spontaneous firing of interneurons (Rosenkranz and Grace, 1999), we found that bath application of DA increased the frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> inhibitory <b>transmission</b> recorded from projection neurons. In contrast to the gating of LTP, this effect required the activation of D 1 and D 2 receptors in synergy. Preliminary data suggested that the D 1 receptor-mediated increase in <b>spontaneous</b> inhibitory <b>transmission</b> did not involve cAMP-mediated intracellular signaling mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Although {{conventional}} wisdom {{suggests that the}} effectiveness of phenytoin as an anticonvulsant is due to blockade of Na+-channels this {{is unlikely to be}} it's sole mechanism of action. In the present paper we examined the effects of phenytoin on evoked and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmission</b> at excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) synapses, in the rat entorhinal cortex in vitro. Evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials at glutamate synapses exhibited frequency-dependent enhancement, and phenytoin reduced this enhancement without altering responses evoked at low frequency. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents resulting from the spontaneous release of glutamate was reduced by phenytoin, with no change in amplitude, rise time or decay time. Similar effects were seen on miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at GABA synapses displayed a frequency-dependent decrease in amplitude. Phenytoin caused a reduction in this decrement without affecting the responses evoked at low frequency. The frequency of spontaneous GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents, recorded in whole-cell patch mode, was increased by phenytoin, and this was accompanied by the appearance of much larger amplitude events. The effect of phenytoin on the frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin, but the change in amplitude distribution largely disappeared. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} phenytoin can cause a simultaneous reduction in synaptic excitation and an increase in inhibition in cortical networks. The shift in balance in favour of inhibition could be a major factor in the anticonvulsant action of phenytoin...|$|E

The thesis highlights {{the meaning of a}} broader view of inclusion as integrating in society and describes in more detail the inclusion in the area of education. Awareness of diversity is a highly important factor in today’s politics of education worldwide. Among the factors having significant influence on the success of inclusion are teachers’ attitudes, beliefs and values. The success of inclusion depends mainly on the teachers – the curriculum, textbooks and workbooks form the basis for their work. These materials serve them to present also the contents regarding people with special needs and other groups that may have difficulties with social integration. By providing positive descriptions of all social groups, the education system stimulates equality in the society. The contents described in this thesis are defined as inclusive contents. The analysis of the curriculum, textbooks and workbooks inclusiveness for year one to three of primary education shows that the explicit inclusive contents prevail on the implicit ones. Participation, gender, the need for help and frequency of individual and group portraiture were also analyzed. The content analysis of the interviews with teachers who are successful at practical application of inclusion shows that they more frequently transmit the inclusive contents implicitly than explicitly. As a summary of the findings, key guidelines for dealing with inclusive contents in primary education were proposed. These guidelines have shown that systematic, as well as <b>spontaneous</b> <b>transmission</b> of inclusive contents are equally relevant.

40|$|SummaryMover, {{a member}} of the exquisitely small group of vertebrate-specific {{presynaptic}} proteins, has been discovered as an interaction partner of the scaffolding protein Bassoon, yet its function has not been elucidated. We used adeno-associated virus (AAV) -mediated shRNA expression to knock down Mover in the calyx of Held in vivo. Although <b>spontaneous</b> synaptic <b>transmission</b> remained unaffected, we found a strong increase of the evoked EPSC amplitude. The size of the readily releasable pool was unaltered, but short-term depression was accelerated and enhanced, consistent with an increase in release probability after Mover knockdown. This increase in release probability was not caused by alterations in Ca 2 + influx but rather by a higher Ca 2 + sensitivity of the release machinery, as demonstrated by presynaptic Ca 2 + uncaging. We therefore conclude that Mover expression in certain subsets of synapses negatively regulates synaptic release probability, constituting a novel mechanism to tune synaptic transmission...|$|R
40|$|AMPA receptor-mediated {{synaptic}} {{modifications in}} the amygdala {{have been reported}} to sustain cued fear conditioning. However, the hippocampal formation is also critically involved in fear learning. Therefore, we examined whether fear conditioning is also accompanied by changes in AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. We focused on spontaneous miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs). Young adult mice were trained using tone/footshock pairings and contextual/cued memories were tested 3 - 4 h and 1 day later. We found that the mEPSC frequency was significantly enhanced when recorded 3 h, but not 24 h, after fear conditioning training. Fear training induced a slight enhancement in the mEPSC amplitude at 3 h after training. The increased mEPSC frequency and amplitude were absent in animals that were only exposed to footshock or novelty or unpaired tone/footshock training. This implies that learning the association between context, tone and footshock transiently enhances hippocampal CA 1 <b>spontaneous</b> synaptic <b>transmission,</b> which may contribute to the encoding of the fearful event...|$|R

Here, the anxiolytic {{activity of the}} green tea polyphenol (-) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was investigated after acute administration in mice, using behavioral tests (elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance tests) and by electrophysiology on cultured hippocampal neurons. Patch-clamp experiments revealed that EGCG (1 - 10 muM) {{had no effect on}} GABA currents. However, EGCG reversed GABA(A) receptor negative modulator methyl beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (beta-CCM) inhibition on GABA currents in a concentration dependent manner. This was also observed at the level of synaptic GABA(A) receptors by recording <b>spontaneous</b> inhibitory synaptic <b>transmission.</b> In addition, EGCG consistently inhibited <b>spontaneous</b> excitatory synaptic <b>transmission.</b> Behavioral tests indicated that EGCG exerted both anxiolytic and amnesic effects just like the benzodiazepine drug, chlordiazepoxide. Indeed, EGCG in a dose-dependent manner both increased the time spent in open arms of the plus-maze and decreased the step-down latency in the passive avoidance test. GABA(A) negative modulator beta-CCM antagonized EGCG-induced amnesia. Finally, state-dependent learning was observable after chlordiazepoxide and EGCG administration using a modified passive avoidance procedure. Optimal retention was observed only when animals were trained and tested in the same state (veh-veh or drug-drug) and significant retrieval alteration was observed in different states (veh-drug or drug-veh).

Perfusion of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) to brainstem slices robustly facilitated both spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in a subgroup of MV neurons. That this enhancement effect of 5 -HT on sIPSCs and sEPSCs were both abolished with tetrodotoxin indicates that 5 -HT acts on its receptor that expressed in the presynaptic neurons. Using different receptor antagonists, we further identified that GABAA and glycine receptors {{took part in the}} enhancement effect on sIPSCs whereas AMPA receptor was involved in sEPSCs. This 5 -HT-induced effect on both sIPSCs and sEPSCs could be mimicked with application of 5 -HT 2 receptor agonist but was blocked with 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist. Our results therefore indicate that within the MV, 5 -HT 2 A receptors expressed on presynaptic neurons function to facilitate both inhibitory and excitatory transmission that allows the potentiation of targeted synapses. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Here, we used electrophysiology, neuroanatomy, and network simulations to probe {{the role of the}} endogenous, stress-related neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in modulating hippocampal function. We focused on neuronal excitability and the incidence of sharp waves (SPWs), a form of intrinsic network activity associated with memory consolidation. Specifically, we blocked endogenous CRH using 2 chemically distinct antagonists of the principal hippocampal CRH receptor, CRHR 1. The antagonists caused a modest reduction of <b>spontaneous</b> excitatory <b>transmission</b> onto CA 3 pyramidal cells, mediated, in part by effects on IAHP. This was accompanied by a decrease in the incidence but not amplitude of SPWs, indicating that the synaptic actions of CRH are sufficient to alter the output of a complex hippocampal network. A biophysical model of CA 3 described how local actions of CRH produce macroscopic consequences including the observed changes in SPWs. Collectively, the results provide a first demonstration of the manner in which subtle synaptic effects of an endogenously released neuropeptide influence hippocampal network level operations and, in the case of CRH, may contribute to the effects of acute stress on memory...|$|R
40|$|Background: During {{development}} both Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms regulate synaptic efficacy, usually {{working in}} opposite directions in response to neuronal activity. Homeostatic plasticity has often been investigated by assaying changes in <b>spontaneous</b> synaptic <b>transmission</b> resulting from chronic circuit inactivation. However, effects of inactivation on evoked transmission have been less frequently reported. Importantly, contributions {{from the effects of}} circuit inactivation and reactivation on synaptic efficacy have not been individuated. Results: Here we show for developing hippocampal neurons in primary culture that chronic inactivation with TTX results in increased mean amplitude of miniature synaptic currents (mEPSCs), but not evoked synaptic currents (eEPSCs). However, changes in quantal properties of transmission, partially reflected in mEPSCs, accurately predicted higher-order statistical properties of eEPSCs. The classical prediction of homeostasis - increased strength of evoked transmission - was realized after explicit circuit reactivation, in the form of cells' pairwise connection probability. In contrast, distributions of eEPSC amplitudes for control and inactivated-then- reactivated groups matched throughout. Conclusions: Homeostatic up-regulation of evoked synaptic tran smission in developing hippocampal neurons in primary culture requires both the inactivation and reactivation stages, leading to a net increase in functional circuit connectivity. © 2013 Gerkin et al...|$|R

Murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV- 4), a gammaherpesvirus of mice, is transmitted sexually.

Here, we use an shRNA-dependent quadruple knockdown of all four Ca 2 +-binding proteins of the Doc 2  family to confirm that Doc 2 -deficient synapses exhibit a marked decrease {{in the frequency of}} spontaneous release events. Knockdown of Doc 2 s in synaptotagmin- 1 -deficient synapses, however, failed to reduce either the increased spontaneous release or the decreased evoked release of these synapses, suggesting that Doc 2 s do not constitute Ca 2 + sensors for asynchronous release. Moreover, rescue experiments revealed that the decrease in spontaneous release induced by the Doc 2  knockdown in wild-type synapses is fully reversed by mutant Doc 2 B lacking Ca 2 +-binding sites.

In such a context, a connection between two PDAs may be broken at any time because of the short communication range and the unconstrained mobility of the users. Thus, such spontaneous data exchanges become a real challenge. To perform <b>spontaneous</b> and relevant <b>transmissions</b> compatible with these volatile connections, we propose a method that progressively downloads information according to its importance. Then, we show an implementation of such a mechanism in a Web context by extending the actual browsers capabilities...|$|R
40|$|GABAA receptor-mediated {{presynaptic}} depolarization {{is believed}} to induce presynaptic inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission. We report here the functional roles of presynaptic GABAA receptors in glycinergic transmission of the rat spinal cord. In mechanically dissociated rat sacral dorsal commissural nucleus (SDCN) neurons attached with native glycinergic and GABAergic nerve terminals, glycinergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were isolated from a mixture of both glycinergic and GABAergic sIPSCs by perfusing the SDCN nerve cell body with ATP-free internal solution. Under such experimental conditions, exogenously applied muscimol (0. 5 μM) depolarized glycinergic presynaptic nerve terminals and significantly increased glycinergic sIPSC frequency to 542. 7 ± 47. 3 % of the control without affecting the mean current amplitude. The facilitatory effect of muscimol on sIPSC frequency was completely blocked by bicuculline (10 μM) or SR 95531 (10 μM), selective GABAA receptor antagonists. This muscimol-induced presynaptic depolarization was due to a higher intraterminal Cl− concentration, which is maintained by a bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-Cl cotransporter. On the contrary, when electrically evoked, this muscimol-induced presynaptic depolarization was found to decrease the action potential-dependent glycine release evoked by focal stimulation of a single terminal. The results suggest that GABAA receptor-mediated presynaptic depolarization has two functional roles: (1) presynaptic inhibition of action potential-driven glycinergic transmission, and (2) presynaptic facilitation of <b>spontaneous</b> glycinergic <b>transmission...</b>|$|R
40|$|Atomically thin {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{transition metal}} dichalcogenides have also attracted immense interest because they exhibit appealing electronic, optical and mechanical properties. In this work, we prepared gold nanoparticle-decorated molybdenum sulfide (AuNP@MoS 2) through a simple <b>spontaneous</b> redox reaction. <b>Transmission</b> electron microscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy {{were used to}} characterize {{the properties of the}} AuNP@MoS 2 nanomaterials. Then we employed such nanocomposites as the cathode buffer layers of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) to trigger surface plasmonic resonance, leading to noticeable enhancements in overall device efficiencies. We attribute the primary origin of the improvement in device performance to local field enhancement induced by the effects of localized surface plasmonic resonance. Our results suggest that the metal nanoparticle-decorated two-dimensional materials appear to have great potential for use in high-performance OPVs...|$|R
40|$|Synaptic {{adhesion}} molecules regulate diverse {{aspects of}} neuronal synapse development, including synapse specificity, formation, and maturation. Neph 2, {{also known as}} Kirrel 3, is an immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecule implicated in intellectual disability, neurocognitive delay associated with Jacobsen syndrome, and autism spectrum disorders. We here report mice lacking Neph 2 (Neph 2 –/– mice) display moderate hyperactivity in a familiar but not novel environment and novel object recognition deficit with normal performances in Morris water maze spatial learning and memory, contextual fear conditioning and extinction, and pattern separation tests. These mice show normal levels of anxiety-like behaviors, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. At the synapse level, Neph 2 –/– dentate gyrus granule cells exhibit unaltered dendritic spine density and <b>spontaneous</b> excitatory synaptic <b>transmission.</b> These results suggest that Neph 2 is important for normal locomotor activity and object recognition memory...|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of hepatitis E virus occurred in an outdoor monkey breeding facility in Japan during 2004 – 2006. Phylogenetic {{analysis indicated that}} this virus was genotype 3. This virus was experimentally transmitted to a cynomolgus monkey. Precautions should be taken by facility personnel who work with monkeys to prevent infection. Wild or reared monkeys {{have been used as}} disease models in animal facilities worldwide. Because disease caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonosis (1 – 4), monkeys might be infected. We examined the prevalence of antibodies against HEV in serum and fecal samples collected from monkeys in animal facilities at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University in Japan for 6 years (2004 – 2009). We found that <b>spontaneous</b> infection and <b>transmission</b> of HEV occurred in a monkey facility. The Study There are 9 monkey colonies (A–I) at the Primate Researc...|$|R
40|$|Poster Session 430 - Serotonin Receptors: no. 430. 14 /B 50 To {{address the}} role of serotonergic {{projections}} to the medial vestibular nucleus (MV), whole-cell patch-clamp method was used to investigate serotonergic modulation of <b>spontaneous</b> synaptic <b>transmission</b> within the MV of young rats. Perfusion of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) to brainstem slices greatly facilitated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in a subgroup of MV neurons. That this enhancement effect of 5 -HT on sIPSCs was abolished with tetrodotoxin indicated that 5 -HT acted on its receptor that expressed in the presynaptic neurons. Using GABAA or glycine receptor antagonist, we further identified that both receptors {{took part in the}} enhancement effect of 5 -HT on sIPSCs. This facilitatory effect could be mimicked with the administration of 5 -HT 2 receptor agonist but was blocked with 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist. Similarly, 5 -HT significantly increased both the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in the MV circuitry. This 5 -HT-induced enhancement of sEPSCs also depended on action potential. Such an enhancement of sEPSCs was abolished in the presence of CNQX. Further, 5 -HT 2 receptor agonist could mimic the 5 -HT-induced facilitatory effect whereas 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist blocked the effect. Our results therefore indicate that within the MV, 5 -HT 2 A receptors expressed on presynaptic neurons function to facilitate both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{potentiation}} (LTP) {{is accompanied}} by increased spine density and dimensions triggered by signaling cascades involving activation of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cytoskeleton remodelling. Chemically-induced long-term potentiation (c-LTP) is a widely used cellular model of plasticity whose effects on spines have been poorly investigated. We induced c-LTP by bath-application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist glycine or by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) chloride in cultured hippocampal neurons and compared the changes in dendritic spines induced by the two models of c-LTP and determined if they depend on BDNF/TrkB signaling. We found that both TEA and glycine induced {{a significant increase in}} stubby spine density in primary and secondary apical dendrites, whereas a specific increase in mushroom spine density was observed upon TEA application only in primary dendrites. Both TEA and glycine increased BDNF levels and the blockade of tropomyosin-receptor-kinase receptors (TrkRs) by the non selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor K- 252 a or the selective allosteric TrkB receptor (TrkBR) inhibitor ANA- 12, abolished the c-LTP-induced increase in spine density. Surprisingly, a blockade of TrkBRs did not change basal <b>spontaneous</b> glutamatergic <b>transmission</b> but completely changed the synaptic plasticity induced by c-LTP, provoking a shift from a long-term increase to a long-term depression (LTD) in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency. In conclusion, these results suggest that BDNF/TrkB signaling is necessary for c-LTP-induced plasticity in hippocampal neurons and its blockade leads to a switch of c-LTP into chemical-LTD (c-LTD) ...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} global concern {{regarding}} {{the rise of}} antibiotic-resistant organisms. Many of these reports have focused on various Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, with {{little attention to the}} genus Ureaplasma. Ureaplasma spp. are associated with numerous infectious diseases affecting pregnant women, neonates and the immunocompromised. Treatment options are extremely limited due to high levels of intrinsic resistance resulting from the unique physiology of these organisms and further restricted in cases of the developing fetus or neonate, often limiting therapeutic options to predominantly macrolides or rarely fluoroquinolones. The increasing presence of macrolide- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains among neonatal infections may result in pan-drug resistance and potentially untreatable conditions. Here, we review the requirements for accurate measurement of antimicrobial susceptibility, provide a comprehensive review of the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) for Ureaplasma species in the literature and contextualize these results relative to some investigators' reliance on commercial kits that are not CLSI compliant when determining AMR. The dramatic variation in the resistance patterns and impact of high levels of AMR amongst neonatal populations suggests the need for continued surveillance. Commercial kits represent an excellent tool for initial antibiotic susceptibility determination and screening. However, AMR reporting must utilize internationally standardized methods, as high-titre samples, or Mycoplasma hominis-contaminated samples routinely give false AMR results. Furthermore, there is a requirement for future reports to determine the underlying AMR mechanisms and determine whether expanding AMR is due to <b>spontaneous</b> mutation, <b>transmission</b> of resistance genes on mobile elements or selection and expansion of resistant clones...|$|R
