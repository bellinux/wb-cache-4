A Company was sited in the {{buildings}} {{on either side of the}} ramp nearest the river, and on Monday 18 2 Platoon occupied a house on the east side. This sector came under increasing attack from tanks and infantry of the 10th SS Panzer Division, and the building was later burnt down.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. <b>So</b> <b>who</b> are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E

25|$|The other {{portion of}} the {{parallel}} studies featured women who were post hysterectomy <b>so</b> <b>who</b> consequently {{did not need to}} take a progestin when using estrogen. They were given either placebo or conjugated equine estrogen alone. This group did not show the risks demonstrated in the combination hormone study, and the estrogen-only study was not halted in 2002. However, in February 2004 it, too, was halted. While there was a 23% decreased incidence of breast cancer in the estrogen-only study participants, risks of stroke and pulmonary embolism were increased slightly, predominantly in patients who began HRT over the age of 60.|$|E
25|$|On 30 June 2005, a {{statutory}} inquiry {{was announced}} by the then Irish Minister for Justice Michael McDowell into Brian Rossiter's death, with the Minister apologising to the family for the way the case had been handled so far. The inquiry, led by Senior Counsel Hugh Hartnett was criticised by Rossiter's family for its limited scope. Pat Rossiter expressed his lack of confidence that the inquiry would be permitted to ask if his son had been killed at the garda station, and if <b>so,</b> <b>who</b> was responsible. The family threatened not to participate. There was a disagreement over legal fees. McDowell, though, insisted that the inquiry would have full powers.|$|E
25|$|Immediately, Horace states he is {{changing}} his will to leave Alexandra {{everything except the}} railroad bonds which, he will claim, he freely lent to Leo.

Alexandra is rescued from a larger misfortune, that of marrying the repugnant Leo, by Birdie, the only person able to do <b>so,</b> <b>who</b> wills herself the courage to tell the younger woman not to marry the wrong man (i.e. Leo), lest she bear the consequences {{for the rest of}} her life.

25|$|During a {{literary}} luncheon she is attending, Mrs Ariadne Oliver finds herself {{approached by a}} woman called Mrs Burton-Cox, whose son is engaged to Oliver's godchild, Celia Ravenscroft. During their conversation, Mrs Burton-Cox askes her an important question regarding the deaths of Celia's parents - {{was one of them}} murdered, and if <b>so,</b> <b>who</b> killed who? Ten years earlier, the bodies of Margaret Ravenscroft, a close school friend of Oliver, and General Alistair Ravenscroft, Margaret's husband, were found near their manor house in Overcliffe. The original investigation into their deaths revealed that both had bullet wounds, and that a revolver found between their bodies bore the fingerprints of the married couples, making it impossible to prove whether {{it was a case of}} double suicide or if it was a murder/suicide and who then was the victim and the other the murderer. The death of the Ravenscrofts left both Celia and another of their children orphaned.|$|E

50|$|<b>So,</b> <b>Who's</b> Paranoid is {{the tenth}} studio album from The Damned. Released in November 2008, {{it was their}} first album in seven years and to date is their last studio album. Musically, the album draws from the band's 80's Gothic rock sound.|$|R

500|$|Thomas Inskeep of Stylus {{magazine}} noted, [...] "...nearly {{the whole}} of 'Jump' sounds to these ears like a Pet Shop Boys homage." [...] Matt Zakosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "The stand-out tracks here are 'Jump' and 'Push', which sound {{as close to the}} 80s Madonna as we're probably ever going to get again. The lyrics of Jump' are joyous, recalling the fun, community-minded Madonna of True Blue and Like a Prayer." [...] Diego Costa of UWM Post wrote that [...] "Jump" [...] is a [...] "bossy, slightly sadistic spoken intro by Madonna, just like in 'Erotica', <b>so</b> <b>who</b> can resist? A knock-yourself-out, club-tailored take on the wasteful nature of inertia." [...] Margaret Moser of The Austin Chronicle called the song [...] "slinky and sexy".|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{published}} three {{reviews of}} the episode. Sam Wollaston gave the episode a positive review; {{he thought it was}} a [...] "wonderful episode" [...] that [...] "would be hard to top". Wollaston joked in his review about Richard Dawkins's cameo, and compared his anti-theological mannerisms to the Daleks. Gareth McLean described the end of the episode as a [...] "genuine, jaw-dropping, outta-nowhere cliffhanger". [...] He commended the production team for successfully suppressing information about the regeneration in an industry often stifled by leaks. Stephen Brook of The Guardians media blog Organgrinder, thought the episode was [...] "unbelievably good" [...] and [...] "genuinely scary and exciting". [...] He theorised about the questionable regeneration: whether it was genuine and, if <b>so,</b> <b>who</b> would portray the next incarnation of the Doctor; and which companion will die in [...] "Journey's End".|$|E
500|$|In the studio, the New York Dolls {{dressed in}} their usual flashy clothes. Rundgren, who did not approve of their raucous sound, at one point yelled at them during the {{sessions}} to [...] "get the glitter out of your asses and play". Sylvain recalled Rundgren inviting Buell and their Chihuahua to the studio and putting the latter atop an expensive mixing console, while Johansen acknowledged that his recollections of the sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them: [...] "It was like the 1920s, with palm tree décor and stuff. Well, that's how I remember it, anyway." [...] He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album. According to Scopa, the group's carefree lifestyle probably conflicted with Rundgren's professional work ethic and schedule: [...] "He doesn't put up with bullshit. I mean, [...] rarely started their live sets before midnight, <b>so</b> <b>who</b> knows? Todd {{was very much in}} charge in the studio, however, and I got the impression that everybody was looking to him." ...|$|E

500|$|The new Zimbabwean {{parliament}} {{opened on}} 15 May 1980, {{a month after}} formal independence from Britain, with Smith as the reconstituted country's first Leader of the Opposition. Continuing a long-standing tradition from the Rhodesian era, the government and opposition entered the House in pairs—Mugabe and Smith walked in {{side by side with}} their respective MPs following, [...] "aptly symbolis the mood of reconciliation", Martin Meredith comments. With around 1,000 whites leaving Zimbabwe each month, Smith took to the radio to urge them to stay and give Mugabe's new order a chance, but over half of the country's whites left within three years. As Meredith records, the 100,000 or <b>so</b> <b>who</b> remained [...] "retreated into their own world of clubs, sporting activities, and comfortable living". Mugabe made great efforts when he first took power to endear himself to the white farming community, which accounted for at least 75% of Zimbabwe's agricultural output. Amid booming Zimbabwean commodity prices in the years immediately following 1980, many white commercial farmers came to support Mugabe. The new Prime Minister continued cordially meeting Smith until the RF leader took him to task in 1981 for openly calling for a one-party state; Smith said this was putting off foreign investors. Mugabe was not impressed and, according to Smith, refused to ever meet him again.|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in early 1998. In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, {{he turned around and}} said he wanted to do his version of Superman. <b>So</b> <b>who</b> is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
