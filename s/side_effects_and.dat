An older agent, guanidine, causes many <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> is not recommended. 4-Aminopyridine (dalfampridine), an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more side effects than 3,4-DAP and is also not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>and</b> it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E

5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} {{are not always}} a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property. SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances {{have shown that the}} former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem to play an important role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>and</b> deserves further clinical testing.|$|E
5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E

5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>and</b> tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two. With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{lozenges}} {{have been}} used to treat symptoms, with some studies suggesting that they may reduce the duration of the common cold. Due to wide differences between the studies, further research may be needed to determine how and when zinc may be effective. Zinc lozenges may produce <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>and</b> there is only a weak rationale for physicians to recommend them as a treatment of the common cold. Some zinc remedies directly applied {{to the inside of the}} nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> potential for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{overdose}} and intoxication {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>and</b> drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents.

5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E
5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E
5|$|The Windows {{version of}} the game had a more mixed reception, with {{criticism}} aimed mostly at the technical issues present {{at the time of}} the game's release, ultimately leading to sales being suspended. On June 23, 2015, the launch day for Arkham Knight, thousands of users reported major technical flaws and performance problems with the Windows {{version of the}} game, with some saying it seemed like the optimization phase of the game's development was skipped. Steam users immediately wrote scathing reviews of the game's performance, including reports of frame rate being capped at 30 frames per second (which could be raised, though with potential <b>side</b> <b>effects)</b> <b>and</b> dropping as low as 10 frames per second while gliding or using the Batmobile.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} risk {{and severity of}} serotonergic <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> serotonin toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported in}} patients of all ages, including the elderly, children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure. The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy adults. Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together. Various drugs, other than SSRIs, also have clinically significant potency as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (e.g. tramadol, amphetamine, and MDMA) and are associated with severe cases of the syndrome.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>and</b> risks {{associated}} with the smallpox vaccine.
