40|$|We have {{generated}} human hepatocyte <b>spheroids</b> with uniform {{size and shape}} by co-culturing 1 : 1 mixtures of primary human hepatocytes (hHeps) from partial hepatectomy specimens and human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) in concave microwells. The hADSCs in <b>spheroids</b> could compensate for the low viability and improve the functional maintenance of hHeps. Co-cultured <b>spheroids</b> aggregated and formed compact spheroidal shapes more rapidly, and with a significantly higher viability than mono-cultured <b>spheroids.</b> The liver-specific functions of co-cultured <b>spheroids</b> were greater, although they contained half the number of hepatocytes as mono-cultured <b>spheroids.</b> Albumin secretion by co-cultured <b>spheroids</b> was 10 % higher on day 7, whereas urea secretion was similar, compared with mono-cultured <b>spheroids.</b> A quantitative cytochrome P 450 assay showed that the enzymatic activity of co-cultured <b>spheroids</b> cultured for 9 days was 28 % {{higher than that of}} mono-cultured <b>spheroids.</b> These effects {{may be due to the}} transdifferentiation potential and paracrine healing effects of hADSCs on hHeps.

5|$|Of {{the moons}} {{discovered}} by the Voyager2 imaging team, only Puck was discovered early enough that the probe could be programmed to image it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly prolate <b>spheroid</b> (ratio between axes is 0.97±0.04). Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color. There are three named craters {{on the surface of}} Puck, the largest being about 45km in diameter.

5|$|Jupiter is {{primarily}} composed of hydrogen with {{a quarter of}} its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate <b>spheroid</b> (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate <b>spheroid.</b> An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E
5|$|Other enemies {{were created}} to add more variety. Large, indestructible Hulks, {{inspired}} by an enemy in Berzerk, were added to kill the humans on the stage. Though they cannot be destroyed, the developers decided to have the protagonist's projectiles slow the Hulk's movement {{as a way to}} help the player. Levitating Enforcers were added as enemies that could shoot back at the main character; Jarvis and DeMar liked the idea of a floating robot and felt {{it would be easier to}} animate. A projectile algorithm was devised for Enforcers to simulate enemy artificial intelligence. The developers felt a simple algorithm of shooting directly at the protagonist would be ineffective because the character's constant motion would always result in a miss. Random elements were added to make the projectile more unpredictable; the Enforcer aims at a random location in a ten pixel radius around the character, and random acceleration curves the trajectory. To further differentiate Enforcers, Jarvis devised the <b>Spheroid</b> enemy as a robot that continually generated Enforcers, rather than have them already on the screen like other enemies. Brains were conceived as robots that could capture humans and brainwash them into enemies called Progs. DeMar devised the final enemies as a way to further increase the game's difficulty; Tanks that fire projectiles which bounce around the screen, and Quarks as a tank-producing robot.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional spherical {{aggregates}} of cells, {{grown from}} a permanent human malignant glioma cell line (multicellular GaMG <b>spheroids)</b> and from a human glioma biopsy (fragment <b>spheroids),</b> were investigated by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 1 H NMR spectra of biopsy specimens immediately after explantation and of cell monolayers from primary passage and passage 5 were acquired and compared to those of fragment <b>spheroids.</b> By allowing tumor cells to grow in a three-dimensional arrangement, many biological characteristics of the original tumor in vivo are preserved. A technical procedure was established, indicating that <b>spheroids</b> are particularly suited for NMR spectroscopic studies. Well-resolved proton NMR spectra were obtained from homogeneously reaggregated {{as well as from}} fragment <b>spheroids</b> which were immobilized in agar. We found that fragment <b>spheroids</b> closely resemble characteristic spectral patterns of the corresponding tumor tissue in vitro, thus making such tissue available for 1 H NMR spectroscopic measurements under easy to standardize tissue-culture conditions. Furthermore, the effect of altering glucose supply on metabolism and growth was studied with multicellular GaMG <b>spheroids.</b> The spectroscopic differences found between cell suspensions and multicellular <b>spheroids</b> indicate that GaMG <b>spheroids</b> produce large amounts of lactate and that they can adapt their metabolism depending on glucose supply similar to tumors in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{radiosensitivity}} of multicellular <b>spheroids</b> initiated directly from disaggregated surgical specimens of four human malignant melanomas were studied. The <b>spheroids</b> were grown in liquid-overlay culture {{for up to}} 6 passages. Cell survival following irradiation was measured by using the Courtenay soft agar colony assay. The four melanomas formed spherical, densely packed <b>spheroids.</b> The volumetric growth rate {{as well as the}} plating efficiency in soft agar usually increased with increasing passage number. The radiosensitivity differed significantly among the melanomas. The survival curves for single cells from disaggregated <b>spheroids</b> in the first passage were always similar to those for single cells isolated directly from the surgical specimens. Two of the melanomas showed a significant contact effect as <b>spheroids</b> whereas the other two did not. The <b>spheroids</b> of two of the melanomas showed lower D 0 in the third and the sixth passage than in the first passage, whereas the <b>spheroids</b> of the other two melanomas showed similar survival curves in the first and the third passage. There was no clear relationship between the changes in radiosensitivity and the changes in growth rate or plating efficiency.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the development of}} the trabecular meshwork of the eye, floating cellular aggregates (multicellular <b>spheroids)</b> were formed from human trabecular cells in a non-adherent environment of culture and incubated for up to one month.

40|$|Summary. -When thioguanine-resistant V 79 {{cells are}} {{introduced}} into spinner flasks containing V 79 multicell <b>spheroids,</b> the mutant cells {{attach to the}} surface of the <b>spheroids.</b> The composite <b>spheroids</b> thus formed consist of external, thioguanineresistant (TGr) and internal, thioguanine-sensitive cells. Cell sorting with a Becton Dickinson FACS II was used to determine the relative position of TGr cells and sensitivity to fluorescent drugs. After 2 - 4 days, the TGr cells are found internally as well as externally. The initial percentage of TGr cells varies from 1 to 50 %, depending on the size of the single-cell inoculum, size of <b>spheroids</b> and frequency of addition of cells during a 24 h period. Differential effects of drugs or radiation on external (cycling, oxic) vs internal (non-cycling, hypoxic) cells of composite <b>spheroids</b> can be assayed by simply plating cells trypsinized from <b>spheroids</b> into standard medium or medium with 2 1 ug/ml 6 -thioguanine, which allows growth of only TGr cells. For example, Adriamycin, which penetrates poorly into <b>spheroids,</b> is preferentially toxic to external cells, and causes a decrease in the percentage of TGr survivors. Irradiation of composite <b>spheroids</b> also causes preferential killing of external (oxic) TGr cells. However...|$|R

Previously, we demonstrated that hepatocyte <b>spheroids</b> exhibited various differentiated structures as {{observed in the}} liver tissue.
