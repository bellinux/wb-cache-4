40|$|Abstract Assessments of {{radiological}} {{impacts on}} humans and other biota from potential releases to the biosphere {{from a deep}} geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel are associated with several challenges. Releases, if any, will likely occur in a far future and to an environment that will have experienced <b>substantial</b> <b>transformations.</b> Such releases would occur over very long periods during which environmental conditions will vary continuously due to climate change and ecosystem succession. Assessments of radiological impacts must therefore be based on simu-lations using models that can describe the transport and accumulation of radionuclides for a large variety of envi-ronmental conditions. In this paper we describe such a model and show examples of its application in a safety assessment, taking into account results from sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the model predictions...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a general {{research}} project on the role that chemistry played in transforming experimental pharmacology during nineteenth-century Spain. Within this general framework, this paper deals with the main characteristics of chemistry textbooks written by Pedro Gutiérrez Bueno (1745 - 1822), a pharmacist who taught chemistry in several institutions during the late eighteenth century. In an earlier paper, we have analysed the intended public of the first edition of Gutiérrez Bueno`s textbook. This paper deals with the changing institutional context in which the second edition was published. This issue is closely connected with <b>substantial</b> <b>transformations</b> in the relationship between chemistry and pharmacy that took place during this period. Therefore, Gutiérrez Bueno`s ideas about this problem are examined as well as his major role in appropriating some of Antoine Fourcroy`s views on chemistry and pharmacy...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy of}} plasma waves {{can be moved}} {{up and down the}} {{spectrum}} using chirped modulations of plasma parameters, which can be driven by external fields. Depending on whether the wave spectrum is discrete (bounded plasma) or continuous (boundless plasma), this phenomenon is called ladder climbing (LC) or autoresonant acceleration of plasmons. It was first proposed by Barth et al. [PRL 115, 075001 (2015) ] based on a linear fluid model. In this paper, LC of electron plasma waves is investigated using fully nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson simulations of collisionless bounded plasma. It is shown that, in agreement with the basic theory, plasmons survive <b>substantial</b> <b>transformations</b> of the spectrum and are destroyed only when their wave numbers become large enough to trigger Landau damping. Since nonlinear effects decrease the damping rate, LC is even more efficient when practiced on structures like quasiperiodic Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) waves rather than on Langmuir waves per se...|$|R

40|$|The sociotechnical system {{approach}} induced {{a consistent}} system thinking into the Scandinavian working life research. Workers’ {{social and psychological}} needs and technical/systemic conditions were seen as deeply interdependent. However, a distinct field of working environment research, dominated by individual and psychological perspectives, has developed. Indeed, working life itself has undergone <b>substantial</b> <b>transformations.</b> In the shift from first to second modernity (sensu Ulrich Beck), new phenomena (risks) have emerged that challenge workers’ health. This paper discusses {{the potential of the}} sociotechnical approach to inspire the specific field of working environment research. Sociotechnical ideas are concerned about the organizational aspects of the working environment and this can challenge the dominance of individual and psychology-centred research. However, it is also necessary to renew the sociotechniocal tradition from within. We suggest a general process of a reflexive modernization of sociotechnical ideas and a stronger connection to the ‘double-hermeneutic’ as an epistemological outset...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European perspectives {{on the development of}} Alhambra scholarship. An Islamic palatine fortress built near the city of Granada during the Nasrid period (1232 - 1492), the monument has undergone <b>substantial</b> <b>transformations</b> under Christian occupation, and through its ‘rediscovery’ by foreign visitors in the nineteenth century. The fragmentation of its surfaces through a variety of Romantic and modernizing frameworks served to dislocate its decorative forms from their historical and architectural contexts, leading many historians to discuss its designs in relation to previous periods and traditions. The pervasive view of the Nasrid period and its art as ‘past-facing’ would postpone a critical consideration of the ornament of the Alhambra on its own formal and ideological terms. Only in recent decades has this position been challenged and the monument discussed in terms of its regional specificity and its multiple periods of production and reception...|$|R

40|$|<b>Substantial</b> <b>transformations</b> in Japanese {{patterns}} of consumption, retail activity, {{and the distribution}} of agricultural products in recent decades have significantly affected many agricultural production areas, also known as Sanchi. Radical structural modifications in the production areas prompt investigation as to whether existing theories explaining the dynamics of Sanchi remain valid. To re-examine the context of Japan's fruit-producing areas, this paper employs a multi-perspective approach considering agro-ecological, technical, socio-economic and political dynamics, and farm management and regional governance. Toward building a new theoretical framework that articulates the significance of the fruit-producing areas, the paper claims that Rokuji-sangyo-ka ventures, or coordinated efforts to combine farming with other economic activities including processing and marketing, would be a significant driving force to re-organize fruit-production areas. For this to happen, conventional actors in these areas, such as farmers and their associations, the public sector, and the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA), have to succeed in establishing and coordinating sound governance and management that will embrace diverse actors with varying entrepreneurial interests...|$|R
40|$|Over recent decades, {{increasing}} {{social and}} economic globalization, significant developments in information and communications technology and demographic, social and cultural changes in general have led to <b>substantial</b> <b>transformations</b> {{in the world of}} work, organizations and labour relations.

This author made an observation that still applies today: in spite of substantial achievements and developments in our discipline, the transformations in society, in organizations, in the nature of work itself and in employer-employee relations have given rise to a demand for new theoretical models, strategies and technologies for professional intervention. Given this situation, it is necessary for researchers and professionals to intensify their cooperation so as to identify relevant issues and client demands, generate new knowledge through research, and develop appropriate design and innovation activities (R+D+i) for bringing professional responses into line with the new demands...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{understanding}} the democratic anchorage of governance networks require carefully designed and contextually grounded empirical analysis that take into account contextual factors. The article uses a conjectural framework to study {{the impact of the}} national ‘democratic milieu’ on the relationship between network governance and representative institutions in four European countries - the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark. The article shows that the distinction between majoritarian and consensus democracy, as well as the varying strength of voluntary associations are important contextual factors that help understand cross-national differences in the relationship between governance networks and representative institutions. We conclude that a context of weak associationalism in majoritarian democracies facilitates the instrumentalization of networks by governmental actors (United Kingdom), whereas while in consensus democracies a more complementary role of governance networks prevails (Switzerland). However, in consensus democracies characterised by a context of strong associationalism (the Netherlands and Denmark), the spread of governance networks in public policy-making is likely to lead to more <b>substantial</b> <b>transformations</b> of the democratic processes...|$|R
