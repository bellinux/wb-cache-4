5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoroacetate.</b> Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoroacetate,</b> are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoroacetate</b> when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E
5|$|Tammars {{from these}} areas were {{introduced}} to Kawau Island in New Zealand by colonial administrator Sir George Grey in 1870. Since then, they have flourished {{to the point where}} their foraging has damaged indigenous plants. Pest control operators have used <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoroacetate,</b> a naturally occurring rodenticide, to control their populations, a practice which has been controversial because of its possible effect on organisms not targeted, including humans. Cyanide pellets have been used as an alternative. In 1985, tammars {{were introduced to}} the North Island of the Houtman Abrolhos and have made similar impacts on native vegetation. Their numbers grew to 450 individuals, but by 2008 culling efforts appeared to have reduced their numbers to 25 individuals. In 2003, the Monarto Zoo temporarily housed 85 tammars from New Zealand awaiting reintroduction to the Innes National Park on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Four releases have been made, and a stable wild population of 100–120 animals exists as of 2012. Tammars have also been successfully translocated to other areas, such as Nambung National Park and Avon Valley National Park in Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|The western grey {{kangaroo}} (Macropus fuliginosus) {{is slightly}} smaller again at about 54kg (119lb) for a large male. It {{is found in the}} southern part of Western Australia, South Australia near the coast, and the Darling River basin. The highest population densities occur in the western Riverina district of New South Wales and in western areas of the Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia. Populations may have declined, particularly in agricultural areas. The species has a high tolerance to the plant toxin <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoroacetate,</b> which indicates a possible origin from the south-west region of Australia.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{toxicological}} research involving fluorocitrate, {{the toxic}} metabolite of <b>sodium</b> monofluoroacetate (<b>fluoroacetate),</b> {{which is the}} active ingredient in the pesticide Compound 1080. Many toxicological {{studies have been done}} with fluoroacetate and the results obtained are actually due to the fluorocitrate because it has been definitely proved that, from a biochemical perspective, fluoroacetate is not toxic but fluorocitrate is. The classical explanation of the toxic action of fluorocitrate is that it inhibits the enzyme aconitase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Deactivation of aconitase results in decreased energy production by cells and ultimately death of the organism. However, the more recent explanation of fluorocitrate 2 ̆ 7 s mode of action is that it binds with mito-chondrial protein which prevents transport of citrate and its utilization by cells for energy production. Metabolism studies indicate that only small amounts, perhaps less than 3...|$|R
25|$|In plant feed, {{environmental}} factors influence {{the availability of}} crucial nutrients or micronutrients, a lack or excess of which can cause a great many ailments. In Australia, for instance, where the soil contains limited phosphate, cattle are being fed additional phosphate {{to increase the efficiency}} of beef production. Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was at length found to be a result of cobalt deficiency in the soil. Plant toxins are also a risk to grazing animals; for instance, <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoroacetate,</b> found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the cellular metabolism. Certain man-made pollutants such as methylmercury and some pesticide residues present a particular hazard due to their tendency to bioaccumulate in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>fluoroacetate,</b> {{commonly}} known as 1080, is used in New Zealand to control animal pests, specifically the possum which threatens biodiversity and carries tuberculosus.
