2500|$|In July 2015, Moritz {{said that}} Walker's character, Brian O'Conner, would {{not appear in}} the film, {{following}} the use of CGI in the previous film after Walker died in a <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> on November 30, 2013, with Moritz stating that his character had [...] "moved on". It had previously been reported that Paul's younger brother, Cody Walker, would either join the cast in a new role, or replace his older brother in the role of O'Conner; however, it was later announced that the character will not return to the franchise. Moritz also said that the film would shift the focus of the franchise from a series of heist films to a spy caper, following a similar change in focus from street racing in Fast Five (2011). In December 2016, the film was retitled The Fate of the Furious.|$|E

25|$|According to NHTSA data, early SUVs {{were at a}} {{disadvantage}} in <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> (such as when the driver falls asleep or loses control swerving around a deer), which involve 43% of fatal accidents, with {{more than double the}} chance of rolling over. This risk related closely to overall US motor vehicle fatality data, showing that SUVs and pickups generally had a higher fatality rate than cars of the same manufacturer.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the CARE data cannot be assumed to be complete. Underreporting is a {{significant}} and little-understood problem, especially for <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> of VRUs and injury accidents. Generally speaking, the issue is that the police do not record every injury accident, in addition to which the reporting rate is biased towards more severe accidents or those that cause traffic disruption. Actual reporting rates are not known for most EU countries. Therefore, these numbers should be treated with caution.|$|R
50|$|Frink died on May 6, 2012 in a <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> outside Tucson, Arizona. He was 67. He {{was buried}} near {{his mother and}} {{daughter}} at the family cemetery on his ranch.|$|E
50|$|He {{was seriously}} {{injured in a}} February 2013 <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> in Kankakee County when he crashed into a utility pole and rolled his Jeep Cherokee, {{fracturing}} eight ribs and lacerating an ear. He was hospitalized several days before being released.|$|E
50|$|He {{appeared}} in Furious 7 after his brother Paul died on November 30, 2013 in a <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident.</b> Cody and Caleb both {{stepped in to}} help finish their brother's scenes as Brian O'Conner in the movie, which was still filming {{at the time of}} Paul's death.|$|E
5000|$|Some suicides are {{the result}} of {{intended}} car crashes. This especially applies to single-occupant, <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents,</b> [...] "because of the frequency of its use, the generally accepted inherent hazards of driving, {{and the fact that it}} offers the individual an opportunity to imperil or end his life without consciously confronting himself with his suicidal intent." [...] There is always the risk that a car accident will affect other road users; for example, a car that brakes abruptly or swerves to avoid a suicidal pedestrian may collide with something else on the road.|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{more than}} 80 % of {{emergency}} calls were made within 5  min {{of the accident}} occurrence. However, in 13 % of cases the emergency call had been made 5 – 30  min after the accident occurrence, and in roughly 3 % of cases more than 30  min after the accident occurrence. Long delays seem especially typical of accidents involving occupant fatalities in motor vehicles not designed for eCall, with {{a high proportion of}} <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> and animal collisions, followed by those involving unprotected road-user fatalities and no four-wheel vehicle. Overall, the results suggest that eCall would decrease the notification delay in approximately 30 % of fatal accidents.|$|R

5000|$|A single-vehicle {{collision}} or [...] <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> {{is a type}} of {{road traffic}} collision in which only the one vehicle is involved. Included in this category are run-off-road collisions, collisions with fallen rocks or debris in the road, rollover crashes within the roadway, and collisions with animals.|$|E

25|$|The Chappaquiddick {{incident}} was a <b>single-vehicle</b> car <b>accident</b> on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, on Friday, July 18, 1969, {{that was the}} result of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's negligence and resulted in the death of his 28-year-old companion, Mary Jo Kopechne, who was trapped inside the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Ford Explorer - a {{dangerous}} tendency to blow a rear tire and flip over. Ford had constructed a vehicle {{with a high}} center of gravity; between 68 and 74 cm above ground (depending on model). The tendency to roll over on sharp changes in direction {{is built into the}} vehicle. Ford attempted to counteract the forces of nature by specifying lower than optimum pressures in the tires in order to induce them to lose traction and slide under sideways forces rather than to grip and force the vehicle to roll over. For reasons that were never entirely clear, tires from one factory tended to blow out when under inflated, these vehicles then rolled over, which led to a spate of well publicized <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents.</b>|$|R
40|$|Relations {{between the}} {{occurrence}} of road accidents, traffic and rainfall conditions are valuable in setting safety objectives for traffic management, and in assessing the safety impacts of new traffic management systems, prior to their implementation. Based on traffic, road accidents and rain data collected over one year, on a French urban motorway network, a set of safety performance functions were estimated; each of them provides the accident risk per vehicle-kilometer for {{a certain type of}} accident, according to {{the occurrence of}} rain, and {{to the level of a}} traffic variable (average speed, occupancy, percentage of tailgating [...] .). Analyses were carried out separately by lane and for two types of accidents: <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> and multiple-vehicle accidents. The relationships, although statistically significant, have yet to be validated by the treatment of another set of accidents...|$|R
50|$|Daniel Joseph Snyder (February 23, 1978 - October 5, 2003) was a Canadian {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} player. He played as a centre in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Atlanta Thrashers.

30|$|The {{main finding}} showed that eCall could very {{probably}} have prevented 3.6 % {{of the road}} fatalities investigated. The most substantial safety benefits could be gained in accidents in which there were occupant fatalities involving motor vehicles for which the system is designed (i.e. cars, vans, lorries and buses). Moreover, the results showed that—in relative terms—the system {{would have been even}} more effective in accidents involving vehicles for which the system is not designed (i.e. motorcycles and mopeds etc.). The proportion of <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> was high among those accidents. No very probable safety effect was found on the fatalities resulting from accidents involving unprotected road users. In addition, it was assessed that the total preventive effect of eCall on road fatalities would have been roughly 4 – 8 % if possibly preventable fatalities were taken into account.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the death}} of B. H. Roberts in 1933, Kimball became the senior President of the Seventy. He still held this {{position}} {{when he was killed}} in 1938, at the age of eighty-five, in a <b>single-vehicle</b> automobile <b>accident</b> in the Nevada desert 50 mi east of Reno. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.|$|R
30|$|For {{the safety}} evaluation, the {{accident}} data was classified {{by type of}} fatally injured person(s): (a) motor-vehicle occupant and (b) unprotected road user. (There were no accidents involving both types of fatalities.) Furthermore, both categories were divided in two sub-categories as follows: The first category involving motor-vehicle occupants was classified by type of vehicle involved: (1) one or more motor vehicles for which eCall has been designed (i.e. cars, vans, lorries and buses) and (2) one or more vehicles for which {{the current version of}} eCall has not been designed (i.e. <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> involving motorcycles, mopeds and snowmobiles, as well as accidents involving one of these vehicles and a train or tram). It was assessed that the inclusion of the latter category could provide useful information, even though the results could not be applied as soon as those relating to the first category. The second category involving unprotected road users was classified according to whether any motor vehicle was involved.|$|R
50|$|The Joigny coach {{crash was}} a <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> that {{occurred}} on the A6 autoroute in Joigny, Yonne, France, on 3 June 1990, when a British-registered double-decker coach crashed. In {{an attempt to make}} up for lost time, it was driving in excess of 78 mph when a tyre blew out and it crashed, killing 11 passengers. The subsequent court case was subjected to a 13-year delay, becoming one of the lengthiest legal cases in France.|$|E
50|$|On August 26, 2013, {{the band}} was {{involved}} in a severe <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> as they were headed home from the final show of their Western Canadian tour, leaving all members of the band with injuries. Two of the group members, drummer Chartwell Kerr and bassist Paul Engels, were both airlifted to hospital in critical condition. Kerr sustained extensive damage to his legs. Engels suffered a severe head injury, and was in a coma for five weeks after the accident. He was unable to continue with the band. After a 6-month hiatus, Chris Young replaced Engels on bass in February 2014.|$|E
50|$|In October 1981, Cochrane was {{involved}} in a <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> {{on his way home from}} his job at a manufacturing plant when the motorcycle he was riding veered off of an exit ramp. He suffered a traumatic brain injury. Upon arrival at a hospital, Cochrane was experiencing clonic epileptic seizures and was unconscious. Surgery to remove a left-side subdural hematoma was successful. After a few days in the hospital, Cochrane was able to respond to simple commands. After one week he was able to recognize his mother. A follow up CT scan revealed a chronic bilateral frontal subdural hematoma, enlarged ventricles and sulci, and left occipital lobe infarction.|$|E
30|$|The study {{aimed to}} provide an {{estimate}} based on local circumstances, such as accident profile, rescue operation procedures etc. Specifically, {{it is assumed that}} the profile of fatal road accidents in Finland might emphasise the benefits of the eCall system, because 71 % of the accidents that included one or more motor vehicles in the period 2001 – 2003 occurred in rural areas, while the proportion of <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> was 41 % [12]. An even more important motivation for the evaluation was the possibility of utilising in-depth accident reports collected by road accident investigation teams. While earlier studies were based on various statistical models and accident databases, {{this study was designed to}} conduct an in-depth evaluation of each fatal road accident that recently occurred in Finland. In addition to the evaluation of potential safety effects, we assessed the effects of the system on emergency response times and the effects of real-time information about the accident location.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, several {{countries}} enacted {{the reduction of the}} legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit, often alongside the administrative license revocation or suspension, to battle drinking-and-driving behavior. Several researchers investigated the effectiveness of these policies by applying different analysis procedures, while assuming population homogeneity in responding to these laws. The present analysis focuses on the evaluation of the impact of BAC limit reduction on different population segments. Poisson regression models, adapted to account for possible observation dependence over time and state specific effects, are estimated to measure the reduction of the number of alcohol-related accidents and fatalities for <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> in 22 U. S. jurisdictions over a period of 15 years starting in 1990. Model estimates demonstrate that, for alcohol-related single-vehicle crashes, (i) BAC laws are more effective in terms of reduction of number of casualties rather than number of accidents, (ii) women and elderly population exhibit higher law compliance with respect to men and to young adult and adult population, respectively, and (iii) the presence of passengers in the vehicle enhances the sense of responsibility of the driver...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2009, her {{marriage}} to Woods {{was the subject of}} extensive media coverage after Woods admitted to infidelity, which had been revealed following his <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> near the family's Florida home. Woods subsequently announced he would take an [...] "indefinite break" [...] from golf to work on his marriage. [...] These efforts were unsuccessful, however, as Nordegren and Woods finalised their divorce in the Bay County Circuit Court in Panama City, Florida, on August 23, 2010. Nordegren's legal team included her sister, Josefin (who is licensed to practice law in England and Sweden) and several of Josefin's U.S. colleagues at international law firm McGuireWoods.|$|E
50|$|Daulton {{was arrested}} several times on vehicle-related charges. He {{was arrested for}} driving under the {{influence}} (DUI) in Pinellas County, Florida, in 1988, and his driver's license was suspended for a year after he refused to take a breathalyzer test. His license was also suspended in the late 1990s due to unpaid speeding tickets; he received at least five during that time period, including one for traveling over 100 mph in a 65 mph zone. While under his license suspension, he was involved in a <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accident</b> on January 3, 2001, causing $20,000 worth of damage to his BMW sedan. He again refused to be tested, and was charged with DUI, driving with a suspended license, and failing to appear in court.|$|E

40|$|Vehicle {{rollover}} {{represents a}} significant percentage of <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> and accounts for over 9000 fatalities and over 200, 000 non-fatal injuries each year. Previous research has yielded rollover stability control systems that are effective in on-road conditions. Accident statistics show, however, that over 90 % of rollovers involve road departure, during which a vehicle may encounter sloped and rough terrain while travelling at high speed. A critical element of most rollover stability control systems is a metric that monitors a vehicle’s nearness to rollover. Most metrics, however, are designed for use on flat, level surfaces characteristic of on-road terrain. In this paper, a new stability metric, termed the stability moment, is proposed that is accurate on terrain surfaces with arbitrary geometry, which allows it to be used in road departure scenarios. The metric is based on an estimate of the distribution of wheel–terrain contact forces. The metric can be calculated on line in real time, using only practical, low-cost sensors. The metric is compared in simulations and experimental studies to existing stability metrics and is shown to exhibit superior performance, particularly in off-road conditions...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a broad picture of fatal traffic accidents in Israel to answer an increasing need of addressing compelling problems, designing preventive measures, and targeting specific population groups {{with the objective}} of reducing the number of traffic fatalities. The analysis focuses on 1, 793 fatal traffic accidents occurred during the period between 2003 and 2006 and applies Kohonen and feed-forward back-propagation neural networks {{with the objective of}} extracting from the data typical patterns and relevant factors. Kohonen neural networks reveal five compelling <b>accident</b> patterns: (1) <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> of young drivers, (2) multiple-vehicle accidents between young drivers, (3) accidents involving motorcyclists or cyclists, (4) accidents where elderly pedestrians crossed in urban areas, and (5) accidents where children and teenagers cross major roads in small urban areas. Feed-forward back-propagation neural networks indicate that sociodemographic characteristics of drivers and victims, accident location, and period of the day are extremely relevant factors. Accident patterns suggest that countermeasures are necessary for identified problems concerning mainly vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and young drivers. A "safe-system" integrating a system approach for the design of countermeasures and a monitoring process of performance indicators might address the priorities highlighted by the neural networks...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There is a {{gap that}} {{involves}} examining differences between patients in single-vehicle (SV) versus multi-vehicle (MV) accidents involving motorcycles in Shantou, China, regarding the injury patterns and mortality the patients sustained. This study aims {{to address this}} gap and provide a basis and reference for motorcycle injury prevention. Method: Medical record data was collected between October 2002 and June 2012 on all motorcycle injury patients admitted {{to a hospital in}} the city of Shantou of the east Guangdong province in China. Comparative analysis was conducted between patients in SV accidents and patients in MV accidents regarding demographic and clinic characteristics, mortality, and injury patterns. Results: Approximately 48 % (n = 1977) of patients were involved in SV accidents and 52 % (n = 2119) were involved in MV accidents. The average age was 34 years. Collision of a motorcycle with a heavy vehicle/bus (4 %) was associated with a 34 times greater risk of death (RR: 34. 32 | 95 % CI: 17. 43 – 67. 57). Compared to patients involved in MV accidents, those involved in SV accidents were more likely to sustain a skull fracture (RR: 1. 47 | 95 % CI: 1. 22 – 1. 77), an open head wound (RR: 1. 46 | 95 % CI: 1. 23 – 1. 74), an intracranial injury (RR: 1. 39 | 95 % CI: 1. 26 – 1. 53), a superficial head injury (RR: 1. 37 | 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 1. 86), an injury to an organ (RR: 2. 01 | 95 % CI: 1. 24 – 3. 26), and a crushing injury (RR: 1. 98 | 95 % CI: 1. 06 – 3. 70) to the thorax or abdomen. However, they were less likely to sustain a spinal fracture (RR: 0. 58 | 95 % CI: 0. 39 – 0. 85), a pelvic fracture (RR: 0. 22 | 95 % CI: 0. 11 – 0. 46), an upper extremity fracture (RR: 0. 75 | 95 % CI: 0. 59 – 0. 96), or injuries to their lower extremities, except for a dislocation, sprain, or injury to a joint or ligament (RR: 0. 82 | 95 % CI: 0. 49 – 1. 36). Conclusion: The relative risk of death is higher for patients involved in multi-vehicle accidents than patients in <b>single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents,</b> especially when a collision involves mass vehicle(s). Injury to the head dominated motorcycle injuries. <b>Single-vehicle</b> <b>accidents</b> have a higher correlation with head injury or internal injuries to the thorax or abdomen. Multi-vehicle accidents are more correlated with extremity injuries, especially to the lower extremities or external trauma to the thorax or abdomen...|$|R
