40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tool chain with which various geo {{data from the}} free available geo data base OpenStreetMap (OSM) {{can be used as}} input for modelling a railway line to be used in a railway driver’s <b>cab</b> <b>simulation.</b> Based on the Vires simulation software VirtualTestDrive and the so called SimWorld data base that has been developed by the Automotive department of the DLR Institute of Transportation Systems, this tool chain enables the fusion of heterogeneous data from different data sources. Further, it is analysed, which data are implicitly or explicitly described in the OSM data base. It is shown that elementary components of a railway simulation landscape including the railway track network as well as environment information can be extracted from these open data...|$|R
40|$|Simulator {{sickness}} {{results have}} been obtained in a novice driver training experiment with approximately 500 young drivers who have yet to receive their license to drive. Different participant groups were trained on three different PC based driving simulator configurations: 1) a single-monitor desktop unit, 2) a wide field-of-view three-monitor desktop unit, and 3) a wide field-of-view projected image with an instrumented <b>cab.</b> <b>Simulation</b> sickness ratings scores were obtained using a four-point rating scale provided to participants after each training trial. Between-subject effects were broken down according to the three simulator configuration types and gender across six training trial runs. Analysis for average vehicle velocity was also reported as {{it may have been}} related to simulator sickness. While the incidence of simulator sickness was quite small, participants using the single-monitor configuration unexpectedly reported the highest incidence of symptoms. Some gender differences were also found according to training trials. Possible explanations for the results are provided along with experience with high school driver education programs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that an excess in soft X-ray emission observed from many galaxy clusters {{can be explained by}} conversion into photons of axion-like particles (ALPs) in the cluster’s magnetic field. Previously {{it has been shown that}} conversion of this primordially-generated background of relativistic ALPs—a cosmic ALP background (CAB) —can explain the observed soft X-ray excess in both the centre and the outskirts of the Coma cluster. Here we extend this work to the three clusters A 665, A 2199 and A 2255. We use a stochastic model of the cluster magnetic field to numerically calculate ALP−photon conversion probabilities to predict the CAB-generated soft X-ray flux in these clusters. We compare this flux to ROSAT PSPC observations of the three clusters, and use these observations to constrain the CAB parameter space. We find the CAB can reproduce the magnitude of the observed excess in A 2199 and A 2255 for the same CAB parameters that match the observed soft excess in the Coma cluster. We also find good fit to the morphology of the excesses in these clusters. <b>Simulation</b> of <b>CAB</b> conversion in the cluster A 665 is in mild tension with the other clusters due to producing a small but observable excess at large radii where none is observed. This tension is alleviated considering the uncertainty on predicting the count rate in the ROSAT detector, and on the systematics affecting the magnetic field determination. Overall we find good agreement between the CAB parameters for the four clusters studied so far...|$|R
