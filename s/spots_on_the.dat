5|$|Instead of {{producing}} {{a new series of}} <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> television front, the chain reused the commercials originally produced by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky from the initial product run. These commercials were only played on Thursdays, specifically for the social media meme known as Throwback Thursday, events that feature historical personal stories or happenings that are routinely run on various sites such as Facebook or Instagram. The only major change to the advertisements was the addition of the hashtag TBT to the lower left-hand corner of the video.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy and {{his running}} mate, Lyndon B. Johnson, {{were close to}} {{securing}} their <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Democrats' ticket when they took a two-day swing through the Dallasâ€“Fort Worth area in September 1960. Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the pictures were developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-13 mm. The forewings are blackish-fuscous with orange-ochreous spots. There is a subbasal <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dorsum extending {{across the}} disc, {{as well as}} a large roundish <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mid-dorsum, a triangular <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> costa and a smaller <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tornus. The hindwings are dark-fuscous.|$|R

5|$|Mycena maculata bears some {{resemblance}} to M.inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and {{is found in}} eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gills that are not seen in M.inclinata. M.inclinata is often confused with the edible M.galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M.galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M.polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray.|$|E
5|$|On average {{within any}} one population, males {{tend to have}} fewer <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{underside}} and are paler in colour than females. The latter are also larger with a strong female T. alba of a large subspecies weighing over 550g (19.4oz), while males are typically about 10% lighter. Nestlings are covered in white down, but the heart-shaped facial disk becomes visible soon after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip blight). Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 7-8 mm. The forewings {{are bright}} shining golden-bronze with shining violet-bluish-silvery markings. There is a <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> costa at one-fifth, reaching half across the wing and a <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> discal fold before the middle, one beneath the costa beyond the middle, and one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tornus. There {{is also an}} elongate <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> costa about three-fourths. The hindwings are dark fuscous.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, Hall's {{reputation}} {{playing for}} Queensland {{earned him a}} reserve <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wallabies for Test matches against Ireland and New Zealand, and later a <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wallaby team to tour Argentina.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 9 mm. The forewings are grey suffusedly irrorated black with ochreous-white markings. There is a basal patch occupying {{one-fourth of the}} wing, enclosing a small black <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> base of the costa, as well a small semi-oval <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> middle of the costa and a large hemispherical tornal spot, and a small rounded <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> costa opposite its posterior portion. The hindwings are grey.|$|R
5|$|Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian {{consul-general}} in Egypt, {{was able}} to inspect a fragment of the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported {{that it had a}} pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There are reportedly a few white or yellow <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face of the Stone, and it is officially described as being white {{with the exception of the}} face.|$|E
5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. The <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E
5|$|Crested newts {{are dark}} brown, with black <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sides, and white {{stippling}} in some species. Their belly is yellow to orange with black blotches, forming a pattern characteristic for individuals. Females and juveniles of some species have a yellow line running down their back and tail. During breeding phase, crested newts change in appearance, most markedly the males. These develop a skin seam running along their back and tail; this crest is the namesake {{feature of the}} crested newts and can be up to 1.5cm high and very jagged in the northern crested newt. Another feature of males at breeding time is a silvery-white band {{along the sides of}} the tail.|$|E
50|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} {{only six months}} after her second album Lovebox. Lovebox managed to get <b>the</b> #1 weekly <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Oricon charts. This album however charted at <b>the</b> #11 <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Oricon Charts Weekly.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 20 mm. The forewings are pale fuscous, with large yellow-ochreous blotches {{and a small}} subcostal basal spot, {{as well as a}} large squarish blotch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> costa near the base, nearly touching a smaller <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> one-fourth of <b>the</b> dorsum. There is a second rounded <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> costa before the middle, nearly touching a large squarish blotch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mid-dorsum, as well as a <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> costa at two-thirds and a triangular <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> costa immediately before the apex. A dark fuscous terminal line does not extend to the tornus. The hindwings are dark fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 34-36 mm. The moth is rusty or yellowish brown, {{or sometimes}} pinkish in color. It has a darkened <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forewings and a disc-shaped <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hindwings. The moth flies from July to August depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> location.|$|R
5|$|Liukin {{competed in}} her first National Championships as a junior in 2002, {{at the age of}} 12 and a half. In {{contrast}} to her WOGA teammates Carly Patterson and Hollie Vise, who finished first and second, respectively, Liukin suffered a fall on the uneven bars that rendered her unable to finish the routine. She continued {{through the rest of the}} competition and, despite the incomplete bars set, finished 15th, which landed her one of the final <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S. National Team. She was chosen to compete with the U.S. team at the 2002 Junior Pan American Championships, where she contributed to the team gold medal and placed second on the uneven bars and balance beam and in the all-around.|$|E
5|$|Nereid is {{the third-largest}} moon of Neptune. It has a {{prograde}} but very eccentric orbit and {{is believed to}} be a former regular satellite that was scattered to its current orbit through gravitational interactions during Triton's capture. Water ice has been spectroscopically detected on its surface. Early measurements of Nereid showed large, irregular variations in its visible magnitude, which were speculated to be caused by forced precession or chaotic rotation combined with an elongated shape and bright or dark <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface. This was disproved in 2016, when observations from the Kepler space telescope showed only minor variations. Thermal modeling based on infrared observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes suggest that Nereid is only moderately elongated which disfavours forced precession of the rotation. The thermal model also indicates that the surface roughness of Nereid is very high, likely similar to the Saturnian moon Hyperion.|$|E
5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, dark brown palps with white hairs, and dark brown abdomens with white <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper side. Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are spindly and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E
50|$|In wheel truing, {{all these}} factors must be {{incrementally}} brought into balance against each other. A commonly recommended practice is to find <b>the</b> worst <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wheel, and bring it slightly more into true before moving <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> next worst <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wheel.|$|R
50|$|H. guttatopustulata is 7-9 mm in length, {{with the}} {{distinct}} rounded elytra or fore wings typical of ladybirds. Apart from their coloured spots, the elytra and pronotum are black, while the propleura, {{the sides of}} the prothorax, are yellow or yellowish brown. Each elytron bears three <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the midline is reddish brown, as is <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear of <b>the</b> elytron. Another <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower front part of the elytron also is yellow or yellowish brown.|$|R

5|$|Potential contestants of the {{original}} primetime version had {{to compete in a}} telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show using the same phone quiz method. Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.|$|E

5|$|The common {{blackbird}} of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29centimetres (9.25 to 11.4in) in length, {{has a long}} tail, {{and weighs}} 80â€“125grams (2.8 to 4.4oz). The adult male has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, but has pale <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of manta differ in color patterns, dermal denticles, and dentition. M. birostris has more angular {{shoulder}} markings, larger ventral dark <b>spots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abdominal region, charcoal-colored ventral outlines on the pectoral fins and a dark colored mouth. The shoulder markings of M. alfredi are more rounded, while its ventral spots are located near the posterior end and between the gill slits, and the mouth is white or pale colored. The denticles have multiple cusps and overlap in M. birostris, while those of M. alfredi are evenly spaced and lack cusps. Both species have small square shaped teeth on the lower jaw but M. birostris also has enlarged teeth on the upper jaw. Unlike M. alfredi, M. birostris has a caudal spine near its dorsal fin.|$|E
