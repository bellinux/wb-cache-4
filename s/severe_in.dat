5|$|Although Gordon was a {{tropical}} storm {{for most of its}} existence, it caused enormous damage and loss of life. The United Nations estimated death toll in Haiti was 1,122. Six deaths were reported in Costa Rica, five in the Dominican Republic, two in Jamaica, two in Cuba, and eight in Florida. Property damage to the United States was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD). Property damage statistics for the other affected areas are not available, but were reportedly <b>severe</b> <b>in</b> both Haiti and Cuba. The high death toll from Gordon made it the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane David in 1979, which killed thousands in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

Throughout Palau, 92homes were destroyed while 59others sustained severe damage. Total damage amounted to US$10.1million with repair costs estimated at US$15–20million. A state of emergency was declared on December5 while the Palau Red Cross Society assisted with recovery efforts. Palau's congress allocated US$10million for relief while international donors provided a collective US$235,000 in aid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Severe</b> malaria <b>in</b> {{pregnancy}} {{is a large}} con-tributor to maternal morbidity and mortality. Intravenous quinine has traditionally been the treatment drug of choice for <b>severe</b> malaria <b>in</b> pregnancy. However, recent ran-domized clinical trials (RCTs) indicate that intravenous artesunate is more efficacious for treating <b>severe</b> malaria, resulting <b>in</b> changes to the World Health Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines. Artemisinins, including ar-tesunate, are embryo-lethal in animal studies and there is limited experience with their use in the first trimester. This review summarizes the current literature supporting 2010 WHO treatment guidelines for <b>severe</b> malaria <b>in</b> pregnancy and the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and adverse event data for currently used antimalarials available for <b>severe</b> malaria <b>in</b> pregnancy. We identified ten studies on the treatment of <b>severe</b> malaria <b>in</b> pregnancy that reported clinical out-comes. In two studies comparing intravenous quinine with intravenous artesunate, intravenous artesunate was more efficacious and safe for use in pregnant women. No studies detected {{an increased risk of}} miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital anomalies associated with first trimester expo-sure to artesunate. Although the WHO recommends using either quinine or artesunate for the treatment of <b>severe</b> malaria <b>in</b> first trimester pregnancies, our findings suggest that artesunate should be the preferred treatment option for <b>severe</b> malaria <b>in</b> all trimesters. Key Points Intravenous artesunate is the most efficacious treatment for severe malaria, but data are limited on its use in pregnancy No associations have been reported between artemisinin use in humans and increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital anomalies The 2010 WHO guidelines recommend using either quinine or artesunate for the treatment of <b>severe</b> malaria <b>in</b> first trimester pregnancies Current data suggest that WHO treatment guidelines should be changed to recommend artesunate as the preferred treatment option for <b>severe</b> malaria <b>in</b> pregnancy during all three trimesters...|$|R

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} has an {{extremely}} large range and population, {{and is not}} seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as least concern for conservation on the IUCN Red List.

40|$|<b>Severe</b> asthma <b>in</b> {{children}} is a complicated disorder characterized by ongoing symptoms and persistent airway inflammation despite treatment with high doses of inhaled and oral corticosteroids. Although knowledge of asthma and its associated mechanisms has increased substantially over the past decade, significant gaps remain about the determinants of <b>severe</b> asthma <b>in</b> children and the progression of the disorder across the lifespan. This review highlights recent insights into <b>severe</b> asthma <b>in</b> children derived from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP), {{with an emphasis on}} age-specific findings and differences from <b>severe</b> asthma <b>in</b> adults. While the existence of a true <b>severe</b> asthma phenotype <b>in</b> {{children is}} subject to some debate, given the results of SARP and other investigators, we conclude that there is indeed a subgroup of children with severe asthma who have extreme morbidity and differentiating clinical features that are identifiable very early in life. However, unlike adults with severe asthma, children with severe asthma are more likely to fall in a more narrow cluster that is characterized by marked atopy and reversible airflow obstruction. While SARP has advanced knowledge of <b>severe</b> asthma <b>in</b> children, considerable gaps remain for which additional studies are needed...|$|R

According to police reports, five {{individuals}} drowned and six others were initially reported missing in Suzaka, because of flooding {{from the nearby}} Ayu River that crushed houses along the bank. In Akita, a fishing boat with nine people aboard was capsized by strong winds; all nine were rendered as missing by police. Elsewhere, one person {{was killed by a}} falling tree and a fisherman drowned when his boat overturned. In the Ibaraki Province, just north of Tokyo, officials ordered the evacuation of 5,000dwellings in the city of Ryugasaki, 2,500 of which were flooded. After the nearby Kogai River threatened to overflow their banks, over 1,000families were evacuated. Another 4,000families were evacuated in Fujishiro, though by August25, the majority of the evacuated had returned to their homes. In the island of Hokkaido, air service was suspended; damage was <b>severe</b> <b>in</b> the area. However, the capital city of Tokyo avoided the worst of the storm.
