5000|$|As {{the dive}} proceeds, gas is {{consumed}} from the diving cylinders of the breathing equipment. This represents a progressive loss of mass {{which makes the}} diver more buoyant; the diver’s overall buoyancy must be reduced by venting air from the BC. For this reason the diver needs to configure his equipment {{to be a little}} overweight {{at the beginning of the}} dive so that neutral buoyancy can be achieved after the loss of the weight of the breathing gas. Air or nitrox weighs about 1.3 grams for every litre at standard pressure. Thus, the magnitude of weight change from loss of air during a dive varies from roughly 4.3 kg (9.5 lbs) representing the total air content of a steel 15 litre cylinder at 230 bar/3500 psi (in practice, reserve requirements dictate that only about 8 lbs of this will be breathed), to about 5 lbs difference for the smaller 80 ft3 aluminum-80 (AL80) tank (11.1 litres internal capacity) pressurised to 200 bar/3000 psi, and again assuming that only 5/6ths of the air in the tank is used, leaving a typical <b>safety</b> <b>reserve.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The design {{featured}} a belt clutch and a transmission {{which could be}} engaged to spin the rotor blades to high speed before take-off to produce short takeoff runs. A lever on the rear cockpit wall would select the drive position for the transmission. A single [...] "spin-up lever" [...] on the cockpit left side would then be pressed downward, operating as a collective pitch control to put the blades into flat pitch while simultaneously tensioning the belt clutch. The rotor could be spun to over 500 rpm before takeoff, well above the normal flight range (typically 425 rpm). Release of the spin-up lever would disengage both the clutch and the transmission, while placing the blades into flight pitch. After a very brief takeoff run (typically 25 to 200 feet, depending upon load and winds) adequate flight airspeed would be attained, while the rotor speed decayed to the normal flight range. The rotor was not engine-driven in flight. A strong spring resisted accidental depressing of the spin-up lever while airborne. Dual controls were provided for all functions except the spin-up lever, which was accessible only from the left seat. The aircraft enjoyed nimble handling with light control forces, but suffered from a shallow climb gradient.Early versions were equipped with a two-bladed wooden Sensenich propeller. A later [...] "Super J-2" [...] variant employed a three-bladed Hartzell controllable-pitch propeller, accompanied {{by an increase in}} allowable gross weight. Baggage of up to 95 pounds, to the extent permitted by gross weight considerations, could be carried in a large bay under the seat. Fuel was carried in tanks in the stub wings. A total of 24 U.S. gallons could be carried, 12 on each side, but only 20 were usable through normal flight attitudes. At a typical fuel burn rate of about eight gallons per hour and economy cruise at about 85 mph, with a need for a <b>safety</b> <b>reserve,</b> this limited the aircraft's range.|$|E

40|$|An {{effort is}} made to compare seismic {{fragility}} and collapse resistance of three 12 -story reinforced concrete (RC) frames with a premise of equal construction cost. These frames, i. e. basic frame, frame with buckling restrained braces (BRBs) (called BRB frame) and frame with lead-rubber isolating bearings (LRB) (called isolated frame), are modeled with OpenSees. According to ATC- 63, seismic fragility analyses are conducted with incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) method to compute collapse margin ratios (CMR). Three performance levels prescribed by FEMA 356 are grounded on. This paper also considers the influence of possible price fluctuation of passive controls on the analytical outcome. The case study indicates that with a premise of the same construction cost, base isolation frame possesses better seismic performance and higher <b>safety</b> <b>reserve</b> than BRB frame and basic frame at all three performance levels. Besides, frame with relatively larger number of BRBs can presents a better collapse resistance even than base isolation frame, while its performance improvement and <b>safety</b> <b>reserve</b> improvement at level Immediate Occupancy (IO) and Life Safety (LS) are much smaller than that of base isolation frame...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Landslides {{are serious}} {{geological}} disasters in loess areas. In order {{to study the}} effect of the filling caves in the edge of loess tableland on loess slope stability, the slope stability of sliding from the caves was calculated in irrigation when caves were filled with compacted soil, lime soil, lime-ash soil and non-filled. The results show when caves are filled with lime soil the slope stability is the highest. The effects of variability of the physical and mechanical property indexes of caver filler on loess slope stability were researched further. The results show that (1) the variation coefficients of unit weigh and the shear strength indexes of cave filler “lime soil ” have small effect on the average value of <b>safety</b> <b>reserve,</b> but have big effect on the standard deviation of <b>safety</b> <b>reserve,</b> which explains that the design risks increase while the variation coefficient increasing. (2) with the increase of variation coefficients of unit weigh and the shear strength indexes of cave filler the failure probability increases. Especially when variation coefficient is bigger than 0. 3, the failure probability of loess slope is very sensitive to variation coefficient. (3) the effect of correlation coefficient among unit weight and the shear strength indexes of cave filler on failure probability increases with the variation coefficient increasing. It is very important to guarantee filling project. Good quality of filling construction will decrease the variability of cave filler, heighten the stability of loess slope, and decrease the occurrence of loess disasters...|$|E
