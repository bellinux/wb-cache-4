40|$|A {{family of}} credit risk models is {{proposed}} to capture three salient features of Latin American (LA) Sovereign Bond Markets: individual Long Range Dependence in volatility [...] -Long Memory (LM) [...] -, high fractional comovement and time varying risk premia. Evidence {{in favor of}} LM is uncovered {{and the extent of}} Default Risk Contagion in these markets during the nineties is measured. Among others, the results suggest that the response of bond spread changes to volatility shocks is not statistically different, indicating that a common source may be driving the market. Also, the extent of fractional comovement is high and the magnitude of the risk premia for investing in these bond markets is substantial. Our suggested family of bivariate Fractional Integrated GARCH-in-Mean models is preferred to Brunetti (2000) and Teyssière (1998) processes as indicated by <b>Schwartz</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Criteria</b> and Likelihood Ratio tests.

40|$|The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) has {{dominated}} finance theory for over 30 years; {{it suggests that}} the market beta alone is sufficient to explain security returns.

The paper allows choosing among the CAPM, the Fama&French asset-pricing model (TPFM), and the Four Factor Pricing Model (FFPM), which adds a third and fourth moment to estimate the cost of equity of firms listed on the Tunisian stock market. In addition to the classic, the selection of the best model is based on information criteria: the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and the <b>Schwartz</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Criteria</b> (SIC).

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{distinguishing}} density-independent (DI) from density-dependent (DD) demographic time series {{is important for}} understanding the mechanisms that regulate populations of animals and plants. We address this problem in a novel way by means of Statistical Learning Theory (SLT); noticeably, its findings are derived under very general assumptions, such as finite sample setting and nonlinear estimation. SLT is built around the idea of VC-dimension, a complexity index for classes of parameterized functions. Though VCdimensions of nonlinear models are generally unknown, in the linear case VC-dimension actually corresponds {{to the number of}} free parameters; this allows one to straightforwardly apply the model selection framework developed within SLT, and called Structural Risk Minimization (SRM). To test the effectiveness of SRM, we generate noisy artificial time series, both DI and DD, and use the method to recognize the model underlying the data, among a suite of both density-dependent and independent demographies. SRM performances are then compared with the more traditional <b>Schwartz</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Criterion</b> and Final Prediction Error approaches. We show that SRM significantly outperforms traditional approaches in recognizing both density-dependence and independence...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to avoid {{overfitting}} by seeking parsimonious neural network models and hence to provide better out-of-sample predictions. The resulting sparse networks are easier to interpret as simple rules which, in turn, could give greater insight into {{the structure of the}} data. Fully connected feedforward neural networks are pruned through optimization of an estimated Schwartz model selection criterion using differential evolution to produce a sparse network. A quantity,, which indicates how close a parameter is to zero is used to estimate the number of model parameters which are being pruned out. The value of is incorporated into a function of the <b>Schwartz</b> <b>information</b> <b>criterion</b> to form an objective function whose maxima, as tends to zero, define parsimonious neural network models for a given data set. Since there is a multiplicity of maxima, differential evolution, with its greater capacity for global optimization, is used to optimize this objective function.

This paper is intended to model and forecast Nigerian monthly crude oil exportation (in barrels) by applying seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) into the same data collected between January, 2002 and December, 2011. Result reveals an upward trend of the series which became stationary at 1 st difference, a sharp drop between 2007 and 2009 and autocorrelation function with significant spikes at lag 1, 7 and 12 suggesting the presence of seasonality in the series. Based on Akaike <b>Information</b> <b>Criterion</b> (AIC), <b>Schwartz</b> Bayesian <b>Information</b> <b>Criterion</b> (SBIC) and Hannan-Quinn <b>Information</b> <b>Criterion</b> (HQC), the best model was SARIMA (1, 1, 1) x (0, 1, 1) 12.

40|$|Abstract:- Radial Basis Function {{networks}} with linear output {{are often}} used in regression problems {{because they can be}} substantially faster to train than Multi-layer Perceptrons. We show how radial base Cauchy, multiquadric and Inverse multiquadric type functions can be used to approximate a rapidly changing continuous test function. In this paper, the performance of the reduced matrix design by QLP decomposition is compared with model selection criteria as the <b>Schwartz</b> Bayesian <b>Information</b> <b>Criterion</b> (BIC). We introduce the concept of linear basis function models and matrix design reduced by QLP decomposition, followed by an application of the QLP methodology to prune networks with different choices of radial basis function.

Findings from all performance measures suggest no evidence of statistically significant stock selection skills on average. Higher frequency weekly data are employed to improve statistical estimation – a difficulty {{with much of the}} extant work in Chinese securities investment funds. Based on the statistical significance of the individual parameters and the <b>Schwartz</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Criterion</b> (SIC), a single ‘best-fit’ model from each of the classes is selected This study also evaluates the performance of funds using a bootstrap methodology to distinguish skill from luck in performance. Unconditional, conditional beta and conditional alpha-beta performance models are considered. This study also examines the performance persistence of Chinese funds by applying the recursive portfolio formation methodology of Carhart (1997). The results from sorting funds either by past 4 -factor alphas or by t-statistics of past alphas suggest that the top ranked decile portfolio yields statistically and economically significant forwarding looking alphas. In addition, this study applies the recursive portfolio formation methodology for alternative ‘smaller’ portfolios of a fixed size and finds that almost all the smaller portfolios of past winning funds produce positive and statistically significant forward looking alphas. Hence an active portfolio strategy of selecting a small number of past outperforming funds may earn positive abnormal returns. This study also examines the market timing performance of Chinese funds using the parametric tests of Treynor-Mazuy and Henriksson-Merton as well as the Jiang (2003) non-parametric test. Based on the non-parametric approach, the study finds that most funds do not time the market. This conclusion is robust when controlling for publicly available information in evaluating ‘private’ timing ability...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{accuracy}} of GARCH and provide a comparison of GARCH-type and the other time series models in financial commodity markets. Design/methodology/approach – First, a model fitting is performed to choose suitable models with conditional volatility for principal-protected and path-dependent notes by means of Akaike <b>information</b> <b>criterion</b> (AIC) and <b>Schwartz</b> Bayesian <b>information</b> <b>criterion</b> (SBC). Second, this paper adopts the backtesting criteria and the Diebold and Mariano test to compare the performances of the selected time series models. Findings – The empirical results show that the performance of GARCH is significantly worse than EGARCH(1, 1) based on the Diebold and Mariano test criteria. By backtesting test criteria, the null hypothesis that a given confidence level is the true probability in ARCH(4) cannot be rejected. The interesting results are different from past studies. Originality/value – There is little literature of principal-protected notes that focuses on the downside risk for investors. But, managing downside risk is important for individual and institution investors. This paper offer new insight into the literature of principal-protected notes.

40|$|Groundwater {{contaminated}} with spent pot liner leachate (SPLL) {{was treated with}} calcite (CaCO₃) and CO₂ {{in a series of}} free drift batch reactor kinetic experiments with the aim of optimizing fluoride removal. In order to better understand the reaction kinetics for SPLL, the pseudo-second order (PSO), four and five parameter Hill (Hill 4 & Hill 5) models were applied to observed fluoride removal as a function of CO₂ partial pressure and stirring rate. To account for differences in the number of model parameters, model fitting was compared using the Akaike <b>information</b> <b>criterion</b> (AIC), the <b>Schwartz</b> Bayesian <b>information</b> <b>criterion</b> (BIC) and the statistical F-test. In every case, the best fitting model order was found to be Hill 5 > Hill 4 > PSO due to the ability of the Hill models to accommodate sigmoidal kinetics. Removal of fluoride from SPLL under atmospheric CO 2 conditions was found to be inhibited with no removal occurring for the first 3000 min with the inhibition times, based on the reaction half-life, reducing with increased CO₂ partial pressure and stirring rate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the residual solid filtrate consisted of trona (Na₃(CO₃) (HCO₃) · 2 H₂O) a potentially valuable mineral kogarkoite (Na₃SO₄F) and fluorite (CaF₂) accounting for fluoride removal, and unreacted calcite (CaCO₃) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} provides formulae (from [3]) {{on which}} the calculations by icomp are based. icomp calculates Akaike <b>information</b> <b>criteria</b> (AIC), <b>Schwartz</b> Bayesian <b>information</b> <b>criteria</b> (SBC, SBIC), and Bozdogan’s index of informational complexity (ICOMP). These criteria are used to select the “best ” model compromising an adequate goodness of fit and {{a small number of}} parameters by adding a penalty for overparametrization to the lack of fit measure (estimate of the maximum likelihood or the residual sum of squares). The best model minimizes the criterion. The three informational measures differ in the penalty term, SBIC penalizing more severely for larger samples, and ICOMP accounting for covariance structure of a model (and, thus, for collinearity between the factors and dependence among the parameter estimates).

40|$|In airline industry, the {{accurate}} and reliable prediction of passenger no-shows is of paramount interest as {{it affects the}} profitability of an airline. This research studies the feasibility of using the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) neural networks (NN), {{as an alternative to}} the current methods of Kalman Filter (KF) and the ARIMA models, to predict the passenger no-shows. The data used in this study are the actual no-shows statistics from two Malaysia Airlines' routes, Kuala Lumpur-London (MH 2) and London-Kuala Lumpur (MHl). In developing the Kalman Filter and the ARIMA models, the research uses the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), while the Dickey-Fuller test is employed to check on the stationarity of the time series. The final selection on the appropriate models is then made based on the Akaike's <b>Information</b> <b>Criterion</b> (AIC) and the <b>Schwartz</b> Bayesian <b>Information</b> <b>Criterion</b> (SBC). As for the FIR NN, the trainings were done over five runs, with each run consisting of ten epochs, using the Gradient Descent learning rule and the hyperbolic tangent (Ianh) transfer function. The competing models then performed a sixty-one days prediction using the recursive method, which are all done autonomously. The relative performance of the methods is then compared using the paired I-test. Furthermore, the ANOVA with control is utilised to see if the forecasting models are good predictors of the actual no-shows. Finally, to determine whether FIR NN's test results can be used to determine its future performance, the nonparametric statistic of Spearman rank correlation coefficient was employed. In all tests, the results are-reported at 95 % confidence level. The empirical results show that the FIR neural network models can perform as good as the classical methods of the Kalman Filter and ARIMA. Additionally, there is evidence to show that the FIR neural network models are not origin-destination (00) specific. Lastly, the test results of FIR neural network models are found not to be good indicators of their future performance...|$|R
40|$|Canine {{aggression}} {{is one of}} the most frequent problems in veterinary behavioral medicine, which in severe cases may result in relinquishment or euthanasia. As it is important to reveal underlying factors of aggression for both treatment and prevention, we recently developed a questionnaire on aggression and temperamental traits and found that "reactivity to stimuli" was associated with aggression toward owners, children, strangers, and other dogs of the Shiba Inu breed. In order to examine whether these associations were consistent in other breeds, we asked the owners of insured dogs of Anicom Insurance Inc. to complete our questionnaire. The top 17 contracted breeds were included. The questionnaire consisted of dogs' general information, four items related to aggression toward owners, children, strangers, and other dogs, and 20 other behavioral items. Aggression-related and behavioral items were rated on a five-point frequency scale. Valid responses (n =  5610) from owners of dogs aged 1 through 10 years were collected. Factor analyses on 18 behavioral items (response rate over 95 %) extracted five largely consistent factors in 14 breeds: "sociability with humans," "fear of sounds," "chase proneness," "reactivity to stimuli," and "avoidance of aversive events. " By stepwise multiple regression analyses, using the <b>Schwartz's</b> Bayesian <b>information</b> <b>criterion</b> (BIC) method with aggression points as objective variables and general information and temperamental factor points as explanatory variables, "reactivity to stimuli," i. e., physical reactivity to sudden movement or sound at home, was shown to be significantly associated with owner-directed aggression in 13 breeds, child-directed aggression in eight breeds, stranger-directed aggression in nine breeds, and dog-directed aggression in five breeds. These results suggest that "reactivity to stimuli" is simultaneously involved in several types of aggression. Therefore, it would be worth taking "reactivity to stimuli" into account in the treatment and prevention of canine aggression...|$|R

One purpose of HLM is to specify a model that includes appropriate random effects (Guo, 2005).
