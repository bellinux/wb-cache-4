5|$|Many {{anthozoans}} are {{colonial and}} consist of multiple polyps {{with a common}} origin joined together by living material. The simplest arrangement is where a <b>stolon</b> runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as in the soft corals.|$|E
25|$|In mycology, a <b>stolon</b> {{is defined}} as an {{occasionally}} septate hypha, which connects sporangiophores together. Root-like structures called rhizoids may appear on the <b>stolon</b> as well, anchoring the hyphae to the substrate. The <b>stolon</b> is commonly found in bread molds, and are seen as horizontally expanding across the mold.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stolon</b> based {{reproduction}} {{is thought to}} have been used by Rangeomorphs in the Ediacaran age.|$|E
25|$|In botany, <b>stolons</b> are stems which grow at {{the soil}} surface or just below ground that form {{adventitious}} roots at the nodes, and new plants from the buds. <b>Stolons</b> are often called runners. Rhizomes, in contrast, are root-like stems that may either grow horizontally at {{the soil surface}} or in other orientations underground. Thus, not all horizontal stems are called <b>stolons.</b> Plants with <b>stolons</b> are called stoloniferous.|$|R
25|$|Erythronium, {{commonly}} called Trout Lily, have white <b>stolons</b> growing from the bulb. Most run horizontally, either underground or along {{the surface of}} the ground under leaf litter. A number of bulbous species produce <b>stolons,</b> such as Erythronium propullans. Flowering plants often produce no <b>stolons.</b>|$|R
25|$|In some Cyperus species the <b>stolons</b> {{end with}} the growth of tubers; the tubers are swollen <b>stolons</b> that form new plants.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stolon</b> – a {{horizontal}} stem that produces rooted plantlets at its nodes and ends, forming {{near the surface}} of the ground.|$|E
25|$|Runner (plant part) – {{a type of}} <b>stolon,</b> {{horizontally}} {{growing on}} top of the ground and rooting at the nodes, aids in reproduction. e.g. garden strawberry, Chlorophytum comosum.|$|E
25|$|A <b>stolon</b> is a plant {{propagation}} strategy and the complex of individuals formed by a mother plant {{and all its}} clones produced from stolons form a single genetic individual, a genet.|$|E

2500|$|In biology, <b>stolons</b> (from Latin [...] "branch"), {{also known}} as runners, are {{horizontal}} connections between organisms. They {{may be part of}} the organism, or of its skeleton; typically, animal <b>stolons</b> are external skeletons.|$|R
2500|$|In potatoes, the <b>stolons</b> {{start to}} grow within 10 days of plants {{emerging}} above ground, with tubers usually beginning to {{form on the}} end of the <b>stolons.</b> The tubers are modified <b>stolons</b> that hold food reserves, with a few buds that grow into stems. Since it is not a rhizome it does not generate roots, but the new stem growth that grows to the surface produces roots. See also BBCH-scale (potato) ...|$|R
25|$|Stolons {{may or may}} {{not have}} long internodes. The leaves along the <b>stolon</b> are usually very small, but in a few cases such as Stachys sylvatica are normal in size.|$|E
25|$|Stolons {{arise from}} the base of the plant. In {{strawberries}} the base is above the soil surface; in many bulb-forming species and plants with rhizomes, the stolons remain underground and form shoots that rise to the surface at the ends or from the nodes. The nodes of the stolons produce roots, often all around the node and hormones produced by the roots cause the <b>stolon</b> to initiate shoots with normal leaves. Typically after the formation of the new plant the <b>stolon</b> dies away in a year or two, while rhizomes persist normally for many years or for the life of the plant, adding more length each year to the ends with active growth. The horizontal growth of stolons results from the interplay of different hormones produced at the growing point and hormones from the main plant, with some studies showing that <b>stolon</b> and rhizome growth are affected by the amount of shady light the plant receives with increased production and branching from plants exposed to mixed shade and sun, while plants in all day sun or all shade produce fewer stolons.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} {{crawling}} plants can also sprout adventitious roots, {{but are not}} considered stoloniferous: a <b>stolon</b> is sprouted from an existing stem and can produce a full individual. Examples of plants that extend through stolons include some species from the genera Argentina (silverweed), Cynodon, Fragaria, and Pilosella (Hawkweeds), Zoysia japonica, Ranunculus repens.|$|E
25|$|Hemerocallis fulva plus {{a number}} of Daylily hybrids have large root-tubers, H. fulva spreads by {{underground}} <b>stolons</b> that end with a new fan that grows roots that produce thick root tubers and then send out more <b>stolons.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{studies on}} grass species, with plants that produce <b>stolons</b> or {{rhizomes}} and plants that produce both <b>stolons</b> and rhizomes, morphological and physiological differences were noticed. <b>Stolons</b> have longer internodes and function as means of seeking out light {{and are used}} for propagation of the plant, while rhizomes are used as storage organs for carbohydrates {{and the maintenance of}} meristem tissue to keep the parent plant alive from one year to the next.|$|R

2500|$|The tuber is {{produced}} in one growing season and used to perennate the plant and {{as a means of}} propagation. [...] When fall comes, the above-ground structure of the plant dies, but the tubers survive over winter underground until spring, when they regenerate new shoots that use the stored food in the tuber to grow. [...] As the main shoot develops from the tuber, the base of the shoot close to the tuber produces adventitious roots and lateral buds on the shoot. The shoot also produces stolons that are long etiolated stems. [...] The <b>stolon</b> elongates during long days with the presence of high auxins levels that prevent root growth off of the <b>stolon.</b> [...] Before new tuber formation begins, the <b>stolon</b> must be a certain age. The enzyme lipoxygenase makes a hormone, jasmonic acid, which is involved in the control of potato tuber development.|$|E
2500|$|The tuber has all {{the parts}} of a normal stem, {{including}} nodes and internodes. [...] The nodes are the eyes and each has a leaf scar. [...] The nodes or eyes are arranged around the tuber in a spiral fashion beginning on the end opposite the attachment point to the <b>stolon.</b> The terminal bud is produced at the farthest point away from the <b>stolon</b> attachment and tubers thus show the same apical dominance as a normal stem. [...] Internally, a tuber is filled with starch stored in enlarged parenchyma like cells. The inside of a tuber has the typical cell structures of any stem, including a pith, vascular zones, and a cortex.|$|E
2500|$|It wasn't until 1998 {{that the}} species was re-described {{under the name}} P. orchidioides by Mexican Pinguicula {{specialist}} Sergio Zamudio. [...] He noted its distinction from other species based on leaf shape, <b>stolon</b> production, flower morphology and geographical isolation (from P. oblongiloba).|$|E
2500|$|In {{a feature}} unique among Mexican Pinguicula, P. orchidioides {{produces}} <b>stolons</b> {{throughout the summer}} growing period. [...] These start out as gemma-like buds in the winter rosette and elongate into whip-like <b>stolons</b> up to 8centimeters (3in) long during the summer. [...] These <b>stolons,</b> which have small non-glandular leaves interspersed along their length, can take root to form new plantlets upon contact with a suitable growing substrate. This trait allows the species to form clumps of plants, {{many of which are}} genetically identical.|$|R

2500|$|Potato {{growth has}} been divided into five phases. During the first phase, sprouts emerge from the seed {{potatoes}} and root growth begins. During the second, photosynthesis begins as the plant develops leaves and branches. In the third phase stolons develop from lower leaf axils on the stem and grow downwards {{into the ground and}} on these stolons new tubers develop as swellings of the <b>stolon.</b> This phase is often (but not always) associated with flowering. Tuber formation halts when soil temperatures reach hence potatoes are considered a cool-season crop. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this stage, several factors are critical to yield: optimal soil moisture and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to pest attacks. The final phase is maturation: The plant canopy dies back, the tuber skins harden, and their sugars convert to starches.|$|E
2500|$|Roots, in particular, display {{observable}} swarm behavior, {{growing in}} patterns that exceed the statistical threshold for random probability, and {{indicate the presence}} of communication between individual root apexes. The primary function of plant roots is the uptake of soil nutrients, {{and it is this}} purpose which drives swarm behavior. Plants growing in close proximity have adapted their growth to assure optimal nutrient availability. This is accomplished by growing in a direction that optimizes the distance between nearby roots, thereby increasing their chance of exploiting untapped nutrient reserves. The action of this behavior takes two forms: maximization of distance from, and repulsion by, neighboring root apexes. The transition zone of a root tip is largely responsible for monitoring for the presence of soil-borne hormones, signaling responsive growth patterns as appropriate. Plant responses are often complex, integrating multiple inputs to inform an autonomous response. Additional inputs that inform swarm growth includes light and gravity, both of which are also monitored in the transition zone of a root's apex. These forces act to inform any number of growing [...] "main" [...] roots, which exhibit their own independent releases of inhibitory chemicals to establish appropriate spacing, thereby contributing to a swarm behavior pattern. Horizontal growth of roots, whether in response to high mineral content in soil or due to <b>stolon</b> growth, produces branched growth that establish to also form their own, independent root swarms.|$|E

6000|$|Everybody is {{familiar}} with {{the way in which the}} [...] "suckers" [...] of a strawberry plant behave. A thin cylinder of living tissue keeps on growing at its free end, until it attains a considerable length. At [88] successive intervals, it develops buds which grow into strawberry plants; and these become independent by the death of the parts of the sucker which connect them. The rest of the sucker, however, may go on living and growing indefinitely, and, circumstances remaining favourable, there is no obvious reason why it should ever die. The living substance B, in a manner, answers to the sucker. If we could restore the continuity which was once possessed by the portions of B, contained in all the individuals of a direct line of descent, they would form a sucker, or <b>stolon,</b> on which these individuals would be strung, and which would never have wholly died.|$|E
