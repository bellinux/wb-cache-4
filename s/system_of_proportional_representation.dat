5|$|Dunstan saw {{reform of}} the Legislative Council as an {{important}} goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, {{as a matter of}} party policy, wanted to see the Legislative Council abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation.</b> The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would only accept them if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.|$|E
5|$|The House of Representatives of Japan (衆議院) is the Lower house, {{with the}} members of the house being elected once every four years, or when dissolved, for a {{four-year}} term. As of December 24, 2014, it has 475 members. Of these, 180 members are elected from 11 multi-member constituencies by a party-list <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation,</b> and 295 are elected from single-member constituencies. 238 seats are required for majority. The House of Representatives is the more powerful house out of the two, it is able to override vetoes on bills imposed by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority. It can, however, be dissolved by the Prime Minister at will. Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 25 years and older may run for office in the lower house.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, Scotland {{had three}} {{different}} electoral systems: plurality (first past the post) for Westminster {{and local government}} elections, and two different <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> (PR) for European Parliament and Scottish Parliament elections. The number <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> was due to rise to four in 2007, {{with the introduction of}} a third PR system for local government elections.|$|R

40|$|When {{collective}} {{choices are}} made {{in more than one}} round and with dif¬ferent groups of decision-makers, so-called election inversions may take place, where each group have different majority outcomes. We identify two ver¬sions of such compound majority paradoxes specifically, but not ex¬clu¬si¬ve¬ly, relevant for <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> with governing coalitions: The “Threshold Paradox” and the “Federal Paradox”. The empirical relevance of the two paradoxes is illustrated with examples from three Danish elections (1971, 1990, 2011), where a majority of the voters voted for one bloc of parties but where a majority of the seats fell to another. ...|$|R

50|$|In winner-take-all (or plurality-take-all), the {{candidate}} {{with the largest}} number of votes wins, even if the margin of victory is extremely narrow or the proportion of votes received is not a majority. Unlike in <b>proportional</b> <b>representation,</b> runners-up do not gain representation in a first-past-the-post system. In the United States, <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> are uncommon, especially above the local level, and are entirely absent at the national level. In Presidential elections, the majority requirement of the Electoral College, and the Constitutional provision for the House of Representatives to decide the election if no candidate receives a majority, serves as a further disincentive to third party candidacies.|$|R
25|$|The military's largest {{problem was}} the holding of {{elections}} for a legislature and {{the selection of a}} new president.

Membership is open to all Irish citizens over 21, but a senator cannot also be a member of Dáil Éireann. However, as stated above, nomination to vocational panel seats is restricted; nomination in the University constituencies requires signatures of 10 graduates.|$|E

He also joined the Israeli Labor Party, though holding no office on its behalf, and in the 1973 elections was {{among a group of}} prominent doves who called upon voters to vote for Labor, despite its faults, rather than for the more radical small left-wing parties (which, under Israel's <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> had a good chance of gaining some seats in the Knesset).|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom elected 72 Members of the European Parliament using <b>proportional</b> <b>representation.</b> The United Kingdom {{was divided}} into twelve multi-member constituencies.

25|$|Prodi {{had built}} his {{government}} around a coalition called The Union, {{which consisted of}} a large number of smaller parties. This situation was in turn the result of an electoral <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation,</b> due to legislation passed by Berlusconi three months before he lost power. It was when the leader of one of these lesser parties, Justice Minister Clemente Mastella of the Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR), came under investigation for corruption that the coalition started to break up. When the media reported an extensive corruption investigation involving Mastella and his wife – an UDEUR politician in Campania – Mastella resigned.|$|E
25|$|The first {{revision}} of the Belgian constitution came in 1893 under Leopold's reign. Universal male suffrage was introduced, though {{the effect of this}} was tempered by plural voting. The eligibility requirements for the senate were reduced, and elections would be based on a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation,</b> which continues to this day. Leopold pushed strongly to pass a royal referendum, whereby the king would have the power to consult the electorate directly on an issue, and use his veto according to the results of the referendum. The proposal was rejected, as it would have given the king the power to override the elected government; Leopold was so disappointed that he considered abdication.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impacts of {{increasing}} female representation in Bolivian municipal councils on public policy choices and welfare outcomes. By combining detailed administrative panel data on municipal expenditures and revenues together with electoral data, an innovative regression discontinuity design (RDD) is applied. As opposed to previous studies, the RDD approach proposed is unique since it is implemented to <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation.</b> Findings indicate that municipalities with women councilors devote more resources to social investments. In particular, women politicians prioritize education, health, and environmental protection expenditures giving less attention to infrastructure investments. The impacts of higher female representation appear only some years after the elections, highlighting the importance of training and experience. Despite changes in public policy choices there is weak evidence on the links with final welfare outcomes...|$|R

25|$|As {{originally}} {{constituted by}} the South Africa Act, the Senate consisted of forty Senators. Eight were nominated by the Governor-General, and thus effectively {{by the government}} of the day. For each province eight Senators were elected by an electoral college consisting {{of the members of the}} House of Assembly representing that province and the members of the provincial council. These elections were conducted by the single transferable vote (STV) <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation.</b> In 1936 the Representation of Natives Act added four Senators indirectly elected to represent black people. In 1949 another four were added to represent the territory of South-West Africa. In 1955, then, there were 26 Senators supporting the government and 21 supporting the opposition (and one vacant seat).|$|E
25|$|A Member of Parliament of the Rajya Sabha (abbreviated: MP) is the {{representative}} of the Indian states to the upper house of the Parliament of India (Rajya Sabha). Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by the electoral college of the elected members of the State Assembly with a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> by a single transferable vote. Parliament of India is bicameral with two houses; Rajya Sabha (Upper house i.e. Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (Lower house i.e. House of the People). Total number of members of Rajya Sabha are lesser than Member of Parliament of the Lok Sabha and have more restricted power than the lower house (Lok Sabha). Unlike membership to the Lok Sabha, membership to the Rajya Sabha is permanent for a term of six years cannot be dissolved at any time.|$|E
25|$|Coombe was {{president}} of the Barossa Political Reform League in the 1880s and an advocate of the Hare-Spence <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation.</b> He stood as Liberal candidate for the seat of Barossa in the South Australian House of Assembly in 1896 then again in 1899, both times unsuccessfully, but won as a Labor candidate in 1901 when Sir John Downer vacated the seat to enter the Federal arena. He was reelected as an independent in 1902 and again in 1905. He was appointed Opposition whip in 1904 and Chairman of Committees in 1905. He was Commissioner of Crown Lands in the Peake Government, and chairman of the Royal Commission to enquire into the handling and marketing of wheat. He contested the 1906 election for the Liberal and Democratic Union. He held the seat until 1912, resigned from the Liberal and Democratic Union and joined Labor. He re-entered Parliament in 1915 for Labor, again as member for Barossa.|$|E

40|$|Since 1989 six Central and East European {{countries}} have held competitive elections under 17 different electoral systems. After some experimentation, the new electoral systems, adopted on {{the initiative of}} noncommunist parties, provided for <b>proportional</b> <b>representation,</b> with legal thresholds {{designed to protect the}} new parties from smaller, more recent, and more extreme formations. These legal thresholds favored noncommunist parties initially but subsequently appeared to facilitate a return of postcommunist parties to power. A multivariate model of the effect <b>of</b> electoral <b>system</b> thresholds in 13 elections confirms that they contributed to disproportionality but fails to confirm that they consistently favored either former communist or noncommunist parties. Further analysis reveals that legal thresholds have exaggerated the effect of volatility in the electorates on the representation of parties in parliament, causing <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> to behave more like single-member plurality systems...|$|R
