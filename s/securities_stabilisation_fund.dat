40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} make a {{meaningful}} contribution to {{the literature on the}} use of <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> in resource-dependent countries, by proposing a new manner by which to measure their effectiveness. Since the 1950 s, over 30 countries have used these instruments to stabilise resource revenues into their budgets to avoid the resource curse and Dutch disease and/or to save income from non-renewables. As has been documented by case studies, these countries have had a mixed record in attaining their goals. This paper is novel in that it aggregates quantitative results of fund performance through the compilation of a new database of detailed fiscal indicators for, put together through the extraction of data from hundreds of IMF documents containing official government data. The cross-country analysis of fiscal performance provides a new direction for the measurement of the effectiveness of <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> and the underlying political economy reasons for their success or failure. Because these funds serve a purpose of both stabilisation and savings, it is argued that their effectiveness should be measured by a success variable which is an indicator of sustainable fiscal performance. This is defined by its impact along three dimensions: fiscal revenues, fiscal expenditures and savings. By looking at the underlying economic and political conditions, as well as the attributes of <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> which drive success, some interesting conclusions are reached. First, <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> matter. Although there is no a priori economic reason to create one, their presence leads to better fiscal outcomes. Second, the governance of <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> is {{the most important factor in}} determining their success. An independent civil service is positive for success, while open and regulated political systems are actually found to be detrimental, contrary to what the literature assumed. Finally, the rules of the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> are also crucial. Discretion over resources is negative for success, while earmarking is positive. This means that these funds work best when they are relatively rigid and less susceptible to capture by politicians...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of coffee booms on the money market, the real exchange rate, and the business cycle in Colombia. Chapter 2 presents {{an overview of the}} coffee sector in the country, including a brief description of its macroeconomic role, and unique institutional structure. Chapter 3 investigates, from a simulation perspective, two empirical difficulties that arise in econometric modelling when using quarterly data, as is done in chapters 4 and 5. The first practical concern is whether to conduct the econometric analysis on data that have been subjected to seasonal adjustment or in terms of unadjusted data. The simulation results provide a justification for using seasonally unadjusted data, as the use of filters reduces the power of the Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron cointegration tests. The second difficulty concerns an empirical regularity encountered when analysing the Colombian quarterly series of money supply and GDP, both of which exhibit a structural break (or change) in the seasonal pattern. We find that these structural breaks bias both unit root and seasonal root tests, so that new critical values must be tabulated allowing for a change in either the level and/or the seasonal pattern of the underlying series. Chapter 4 examines the monetary consequences of coffee booms. The theoretical work on this subject shows that under a regime of fixed exchange rates, export booms affect both the demand and the supply for money. Within this theoretical framework, we assess whether the coffee booms of {{the second half of the}} seventies and mid eighties led to excess money supply in Colombia. We find a direct association between coffee export booms and excess money supply, implying that external disturbances jeopardise the ability of the economic authorities to carry out successful monetary policy. Chapter 5 uses the Johansen procedure to estimate a real exchange rate determination model for Colombia. We find one cointegrating vector, which can be thought of as a long-run real exchange rate equation. The deviations of the real exchange rate from its long-run equilibrium relationship, after correcting for the short-run dynamics, are interpreted as a measure of real exchange rate misalignment. The simulation performance of the model, during the period of estimation and three years into the future, is particularly good, with the simulated real exchange rate reproducing the general long-run behaviour of the actual series. Chapter 6 develops an intertemporal disequilibrium model in order to analyse {{the effects of}} temporary, anticipated, and permanent coffee price shocks on a small open economy under Keynesian unemployment. Our results indicate that a coffee price boom (whether temporary, anticipated or permanent) increases nontradable output in the short and long run (a similar result is obtained when we discuss other disequilibrium regimes). The basic model is then extended by including a government sector that administers a coffee price <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund,</b> and by allowing capital market imperfections. Our results indicate that when the government is able to borrow on more favourable terms in international capital markets than households, the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> neutralises part of the short-term effect of a temporary coffee price boom. On the other hand, when the government and the private sector borrow on the same terms, the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> turns out to be redundant. ...|$|R
40|$|An intense {{discussion}} {{is taking place}} in international political economy on the influence of economic ideas on institutional change. Case studies so far have, however, mainly focused on the Western industrialised countries and research seems to be biased towards cases in which new ideas caused lasting institutional change. The present paper addresses these two shortcomings by analysing the case of the Russian <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Fund</b> (SF). This case is an example both of the impact of global ideas on a non-Western emerging country and of a ‘near miss’ in the sense that imported neoliberal ideas failed to assert themselves enduringly. Paradoxically, it can be shown how the neoliberally based idea of the SF even contributed to the return to Soviet patterns of industrial policy. The main reason for this, we argue, is that the Fund's implementation was not preceded by economic and political debates. Accordingly, the imported institution of the SF had to be filled with ideational content after its implementation...|$|R

It argues that the existing Future Fund is unnecessary and that greater use of a sovereign wealth fund would harm Australia’s future prosperity.

50|$|The {{finding of}} the {{commission}} was mostly against the demands of Patel. The idea of cooperative mill was rejected because the commission believed that the farmers could not manage it when could not even manage farms on their own.

Future levies to the Sugar price <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Fund</b> were abolished, although the fund remained in existence. Instead of a Sugar Board the commission recommended an Advisory Sugar Council. The commission agreed that the CSR had profited from molasses but did not recommend price increases demanded by growers. The commission supported the Company’s submission of production control by weight instead of area. On the question of sharing the proceeds {{from the sale of}} sugar, the growers ended up worse off, getting a basic share of 57.75%, much less than what had been obtained under the 1950-1959 contract (62.6%).

In April 1939, the deputy Soviet Foreign Commissar Vladimir Potemkin {{during a visit to}} Turkey told Massigli that the aim of Soviet foreign policy was to bring into line a [...] "peace front" [...] to oppose German expansionism comprising Britain, France, the Soviet Union and Turkey. In 1939, Massigli was heavily preoccupied with competition with the German Ambassador Franz von Papen in an effort to secure Turkish adherence to the Allied side in the event of war breaking out. As part of the effort to increase French influence on the Turkish government, Massigli arranged for the visit of General Maxime Weygand to Turkey in early May 1939, which was made into a state event. During Weygand's visit, the Turkish President İsmet İnönü told the French that he believed that the best way of stopping Germany was an alliance of Turkey, the Soviet Union, France and Britain; that if such an alliance came into being, the Turks would allow Soviet ground and air forces onto their soil; and that he wanted a major programme of French military aid to modernise the Turkish armed forces. Massigli was most disappointed when the British sent a mere brigadier instead of an admiral to offer military aid to the Turks, remarking sorely that [...] "The Turks respect the Royal Navy; they no longer believe in the British Army." [...] In July 1939 Massigli argued that if the British and French were able to offer a <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> for the Turkish pound, it would undercut German economic influence in Turkey and tie Turkey to the West. Later in July 1939, Massigli was able to play a major part in arranging for French arms shipments to Turkey and later in August to have an Anglo-French <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> created to help with Turkey's economic problems. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939 undid much of Massigli's effects as the Turks always believed that it was essential to have the Soviet Union as an ally to counter Germany, and the signing of the German-Soviet pact undercut completely the assumptions behind Turkish security policy. Through Massigli was often hampered by his poor relations with Bonnet, the efforts of the Les Syriens, and the stingily attitude of the French Treasury towards supporting Turkey, the British historian D.C. Watt argued that Massigli was an outstanding able ambassador who did much to successfully advance French interests in Turkey in 1939.|$|R

40|$|Future {{membership}} of CEE {{countries in the}} euro zone highlights the risk of external asymmetric demand shocks due to too strong a dependence on one sector or one customer country. The {{purpose of this article}} is to build two indicators of exposure to shocks—sector-based and geographical—taking into account the symmetry of the export structures of a future member with the EMU and the trade openness of the future member. This enables us to draw up a classification of the CEE countries according to fulfillment of the Kenen criterion, revised and then transposed to the geographical variety of exports. The results, compared with those of the two countries in the EMU which are most sensitive to sector-based and geographical shocks (Finland and Ireland), testify to a generally pronounced exposure to shocks. An inventory of the pairs 'country/branch' and 'country/destination' liable to be at the origin of shocks with strong macroeconomic impact shows that Bulgaria and Slovakia, and to an even greater extent Estonia and Latvia, are exposed to major risks. In so far as Bulgaria and Latvia's real convergence process with the euro zone seems scarcely to have started, these two economies might consider postponing EMU membership or creating a cyclical <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> on joining. This recommendation contradicts the endogenous OCA theory, which is put forward when intra-industry trade intensifies. However, an increase in the share of intra-industry trade between a CEE country and the EMU does not necessarily entail less exposure to the shocks studied. ...|$|R

40|$|Dutch disease {{occurs when}} {{government}} revenue from a booming non-renewable natural resource export sector {{is spent on}} recurrent domestic activities. Dutch disease amplifies the cyclical influence of commodity prices and inflicts adjustment costs on the economy through movements in the exchange rate. Revenue funds, such as revenue <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> or sovereign wealth funds, can help avoid this problem by either investing revenue abroad until downturns or holding revenue abroad indefinitely. Through an investigation of six open, natural resource exporting countries, revenue funds were found to delink exchange rate movements from the terms of trade. Although {{it is unlikely that}} revenue funds are the sole cause of this effect, revenue funds are considered a useful tool for, but not essential to, responsible fiscal management. Western Australia has been found to have Dutch disease. Recurrent government expenditure is vulnerable to decreases in royalty receipts. High levels of mineral exports are partly responsible for the high Australian dollar. Revenue funds are a potential policy tool if the Western Australian government decides to limit the impact of export prices on Australia’s exchange rate. As this is unlikely to be an objective for a state government, it should instead be seen as an added benefit to countercyclical or sustainable fiscal policies. In this case, only a sovereign wealth fund is considered appropriate at the state level and could be used to manage royalties sustainably, reduce movements in Australia’s exchange rate and gain greater fiscal autonomy for the states.

40|$|Cotton {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cash crops in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and has had an important role in job creation, poverty reduction and foreign exchange generation. SSA cotton exporters face particularly three interconnected challenges - how to increase yields and quality in the context of small holder farming; how to deal with volatile international prices; how to increase value addition through local processing. This paper analyses the cotton sectors in Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Tanzania along these challenges focusing on dynamics in global cotton commodity chains, different national market structures and related development outcomes. The aim of the paper is not to identify the best cotton sector organisation model but to point out issues that are important for positive development outcomes. The analysis shows that the more regulated systems in Burkina Faso and Mozambique generally outperform the liberalized system in Tanzania in terms of production levels, yields, input provision, and price stability. But there are also major differences among the more regulated systems with Burkina Faso faring substantially better in yields and farmers' price share. The state, however, also bears a greater risk in Burkina Faso through its involvement in the largest cotton company and the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund.</b> The system in Tanzania provides similar farmers' price shares as in Burkina Faso albeit with higher price instability and inequality. Tanzania has been further most successful in value addition which, however, cannot be attributed to the cotton sector market structure but primarily to a stronger manufacturing tradition. The institutional context in the cotton sector, particularly strong and independent farmers' associations, have a crucial role in all models to ensure that farmers' interests are respected...|$|R
