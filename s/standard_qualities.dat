ABSTRACT This {{research was}} intended to analyze the effectivity of  waste water treatment plan operated by industrial companies holding ISO 14001 certificates in Simongan Area of SemarangCity. The data were analyzed descriptively, comparatively and inferentially using t-tests. The analyses showed that prior to obtaining ISO 14001 certificate (1989 - 1998), the pharmaeutical company had its average concentrations of TSS, BOD, and COD of 92. 3229, 45. 5022 and 87. 3691 mg/l respectively, with an average pH of 7. 2388. These parameters of BOD and COD had already met the prevailing <b>standard</b> <b>qualities,</b> the TSS parameter was above the standard quality, and the pH was within the prevailing standard quality interval. After obtaining the ISO 14001 certificate (2005 - 2008), this pharmaeutical company was able to maintain all of the key parameters to meet the prevailing stadard qualities. In case of the galvanizing company prior to obtaining ISO 14001 certificate (1989 - 1998), its average concentrations of TSS and CN were 256. 3469 and 0. 25575 mg/l respectively (above the prevailing <b>standard</b> <b>qualities),</b> those for total Cr, C+ 6, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb were 0. 0510, 0. 0036, 0. 236060, 0. 7242, 0. 01790 and 0. 0286 mg/l respectively (still under the prevailing <b>standard</b> <b>qualities),</b> while the an average pH was within the standard quality interval. After obtaining ISO 14001 certificate (2006 - 2008), this galvanizing company was able to improve all of the key parameters to meet the prevailing stadard qualities. It was then inferred that the water treatments were operated effectively by the two ISO 14001 certificate achievers...|$|E

The average Pb concentration in the sediment of the River Ghaghara was recorded as 13.79  ±  4.32  mg/kg at Katerniaghat, 12.85  ±  4.04  mg/kg at Colonelganj, 14.26  ±  5.12  mg/kg at Ayodhya, 10.83  ±  5.23  mg/kg at Dohrighat, and 10.71  ±  6.21  mg/kg at Chhapra. The observed estimation of Pb in the present review was found below the permissible limit set up by USEPA, ASV, and TRV. CF indicates low level of Pb contamination in sediment of the river. The value of Pb was recorded highest at Ayodhya in the study area. This is presumably {{because of the presence}} of small-scale battery fabricating units at this site. Results indicate that the river sediment had not surpassed the danger level for Pb in the review territory. In our past reviews, (Singh et al. 2013 a), the average estimate of Pb was recorded as 19  mg/kg at Ghazipur, at Buxar it was recorded as 19  mg/kg, while at Ballia the average estimate of Pb was recorded as 21  mg/kg.

Using a three-dimensional magnetic flux distribution while maintaining low magnetic losses requires new approaches to magnetic core materials. Soft Magnetic Composites, SMC's, are compounds consisting of magnetic iron particles coated with a thin and electrically insulating layer. Compacting and shaping such particles without reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} electrical insulation layer, while maintaining the magnetic characteristics, presents a major challenge. Furthermore, new motor designs taking into account the new possibilities of SMC's have been investigated only sparingly. The state-of-the-art SMC material today does not meet current requirements. Additional efforts are needed in the following three areas: CVD powder coating processes (for electrical insulation), bulk material characterisation methods (evaluation of magnetic, structural and mechanical bulk properties) and compaction/tooling processes (for bulk material/application production). The goals for the research study included an extensive literature research, the task to design and build a fluidising bed reactor CVD (FBRCVD) system and an exploration of the possibilities to deposit <b>standard</b> <b>qualities</b> of iron powder with various metal oxide films. In the literature research, it was concluded that the amount of published work pertaining to FBRCVD was rather scarce. It was shown that an FBRCVD apparatus could be designed and built.

Atlantic salmon fed diets with <b>standard</b> <b>qualities</b> of soybean meal (SBM) show enteritis of the distal intestine as well as increased activity of trypsin in both luminal contents and wall tissue. Luminal trypsin activity may possibly be involved in immune related disorders of the intestine also in Atlantic salmon via activation of PAR 2. In the present study {{our aim was to}} investigate if PAR- 2 play a role in SBM induced enteritis. We performed multiple alignments based on nucleic acid sequences of PAR- 2 from various animals available from public databases, and designed primers for use in cloning of the Atlantic salmon PAR- 2 transcript. We further cloned and characterized the full length sequence of Atlantic salmon PAR- 2 and investigated the expression in both early and chronic stages of SBM induced enteropathy. Two full length versions of PAR- 2 cDNA were identified and termed PAR- 2 a and PAR- 2 b. Expression of the two PAR- 2 transcripts was detected in all 18 tissues examined, but most extensively in the intestine and gills. A significant up-regulation in the distal intestine was observed for the PAR- 2 a transcript after 1 day feeding diets containing SBM. After 3 weeks of feeding, PAR- 2 a was down-regulated compared to the fish fed control diets. These findings may indicate that PAR- 2 a participates in inflammatory responses in both the early and later stages of the SBM enteropathy. In the chronic stages of the enteropathy, down-regulation of PAR- 2 a may indicate a possible desensitization of the PAR- 2 a receptor. Expression of PAR- 2 b was not altered in the first 7 days of SBM feeding, but a significant up regulation was observed after 3 weeks, suggesting a putative role in chronic stages of SBM induced enteritis. The expression differences of the two PAR- 2 transcripts in the feed trials may indicate that they have different roles in the SBM induced enteritis...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{measure the}} {{attenuation}} effectiveness and minimize {{the weight of}} new non-Pb radiation shielding materials used for radiation protection by interventional radiology (IR) physicians, to compare {{the accuracy of the}} different standard measurement geometries of these materials, and to determine x-ray qualities that correspond to the scattered radiation that IR physicians typically encounter. Methods: Radiation attenuation capabilities of non-Pb materials were investigated. Typically, most studies of non-Pb materials have focused on the attenuating properties of metal powders. In this study, layers of materials incorporating non-Pb powdered compounds such as Bi 2 O 3, Gd 2 O 3, and BaSO 4 were measured individually, as bilayers, and as a Bi 2 O 3 -loaded hand cream. Attenuation measurements were performed in narrow-beam (fluorescence excluded) and broad beam (fluorescence included) geometries, demonstrating that these different geometries provided significantly different results. The Monte Carlo (MC) program EGSnrc was used to calculate the resulting spectra after attenuation by radiation shielding materials, and scattered x-ray spectra after 900 scattering of eight ASTM Standard primary x-ray beams. Surrogate x-ray qualities that corresponded to these scattered spectra were tabulated. Results: Radiation shielding materials incorporating Bi 2 O 3 were found to provide equivalent or superior attenuation compared with commercial Pb-based and non-Pb materials across the 60 - 130 kVp energy range. Measurements were made for single layers of the Bi 2 O 3 compound and for bilayers where the ordering was low atomic number (Z) layer closest to x-ray sourcehigh Z (Bi 2 O 3) layer farthest from the x-ray source. Narrow-beam Standard test methods which do not include the contribution from fluorescence overestimated the attenuating capabilities of Pb and non-Pb materials. Measurements of a newly developed, quick-drying, and easily removable Bi 2 O 3 -loaded hand cream demonstrated better attenuation capabilities than commercial Bi 2 O 3 -loaded gloves. Scattered radiation measurements and MC simulations illustrated that the spectra resulting from 900 scattering of primary x-ray beam qualities can be approximated by surrogate x-ray qualities which are more representative of the radiation actually encountered by IR physicians. A table of surrogate qualities of the eight ASTM F 2547 - 06 <b>Standard</b> <b>qualities</b> was compiled. Conclusions: New non-Pb compound materials, particularly single layers or bilayers incorporating Bi 2 O 3, can reduce the weight of radiation protection materials while providing equivalent or better protection compared to Pb-based materials. Attenuation measurements in geometries that exclude the contribution from fluorescence substantially underestimate the quantity of transmitted radiation. A new Bi 2 O 3 -loaded hand cream demonstrated a novel and effective approach for hand protection. Standard testing protocols for radiation protection materials used by IR physicians specify a wider kVp range than is necessary. A more realistic range would acknowledge the lower kVp resulting from scatter and allow IR physicians to confidently utilize lighter-weight materials while still receiving adequate protection. Standards protocols incorporating the adjustments described in this work would maintain the safety of IR personnel and lessen the physical repercussions of long hours wearing unnecessarily heavy radiation protection garments. 9 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.
