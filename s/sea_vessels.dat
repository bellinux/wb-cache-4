5|$|Prior to Debra's {{arrival in}} Texas, {{numerous}} hurricane warnings were issued {{and at least}} 8,600individuals evacuated. Torrential rains were produced in southeastern Texas, which led to widespread flooding on highways. <b>Sea</b> <b>vessels</b> took {{the brunt of the}} storm, with many having become stranded or damaged. Forms of transportation such as air, rail, and road were significantly interrupted or even shut down. High winds from the storm caused expansive damage to buildings, windows, signs, and roofs. The hurricane resulted in 11injuries but no deaths, and approximately 90cattle drowned. Damage in Texas' Brazoria, Galveston, and Harris counties surmounted $6.685million, and total damage from the storm reached $7million. In the aftermath, the Weather Bureau was criticized for the lack of warning; the bureau's chief, Stephen Lichtblau, maintained that it was fortunate that any warnings were issued, and those that were had been delivered in a timely manner.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>vessels</b> were {{required}} by law to register at the Castellania to operate in Maltese waters and each had to pay a minimum ten grani, {{depending on the size of}} the vessel and its purpose. With the Registri Patentarum, the Castellania issued legal patents for galleys to travel from the port of Valletta to other ports and vice versa. The patents gave details subject to health inspections which included the names of the merchants and the description of the belongings for trade. Those galleys coming from non-European ports or from places subjected to possible disease were withheld in quarantine for days and only given permission to mix with the rest of the people once a Pratica was issued by the Commission of Public Health. The Clean Bill of Health continued to be issued and gradually reformed during the British period, under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer. The Castellania imposed a charge for those not having health assurance and having to lodge at the Lazzaretto.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Arctic Fox had a {{significant}} impact on the course of the war in the east. Murmansk was a major base for the Soviet Northern Fleet and it was also together with Arkhangelsk the main destination for Allied aid shipped to the Soviet Union. British convoys had traveled to Murmansk since the summer at the onset of the war, but with the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, the influx of Western Allied aid increased massively. The United States enacted the Lend-Lease pact in which they vowed to supply the Soviet Union with large quantities amounts of food, oil, and war materiel. One quarter of this aid was delivered via Murmansk. This included large amounts of raw materials like aluminum as well as large quantities of military goods for the Soviet war effort, including 5,218 tanks, 7,411 aircraft, 4,932 anti-tank guns, 473 million rounds of ammunition and various <b>sea</b> <b>vessels.</b> Those supplies benefited the Soviets significantly and contributed to their continued resistance.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of private piers situated upon {{the western and}} northern ends of Galveston Bay were destroyed {{as a result of}} Debra's storm surge. Damage primarily constituted to roofs, glass, sign boards, antennas, and certain sea vessels; abundant damage was caused by rising waters due to torrential rains. Approximately 90cattle were killed on the western edge of Galveston Island. Furniture was thrown from the luxury Buccaneer Hotel into its swimming pool, shattering a large window. In Fort Worth, the entrance to the Tabernacle Baptist Church was completely destroyed, with its remnants littering the adjacent road. The largest quantity of damage to <b>sea</b> <b>vessels</b> was consolidated near the Kemah-Baytown area. Widespread damage from winds and tides was evident in the Hitchcock area, where three men were rescued after attempting to endure the hurricane at a fishing camp, although they were later rescued. In the Houston area, damage was limited to power lines and downed trees. At the former Houston International Airport, air transport was terminated, and water transportation was impeded as vast ships remained in ports. Onlookers were advised not to touch downed power lines, and electricity was knocked out at a hospital and roads were immersed in floodwaters. Most rail and road traffic in Houston was significantly interrupted.|$|E

25|$|Divers {{were also}} used in warfare. Defenses against <b>sea</b> <b>vessels</b> were often created, such as {{underwater}} barricades, and hence divers were often used to scout out the seabed when ships were approaching an enemy harbor. If barricades were found, it was divers who were used to disassemble them, if possible. During the Peloponnesian War, divers were used to get past enemy blockades to relay messages as well as supplies to allies or troops that were cut off, and in 332 BC, during Siege of Tyre, the city used divers to cut the anchor cables of Alexander's attacking ships.|$|E
25|$|The Commodore Perry, {{originally}} designed for short operating distances of the Great Lakes, was ill-fitted {{for her new}} duty in the open <b>sea.</b> <b>Vessels</b> on duty in Alaskan waters required ample food storage room, enough to hold six month's stores and provisions, and enough coal-bunker space to cruise actively {{for at least two}} weeks. The Perry was designed to carry only 90 tons. Making room for more coal required stores and provisions to be stored on the deck. Most often, her cruising radius was limited to about 1,500 miles, insufficient to meet the duties demanded of her.|$|E

In the epic poem, the Iliad, set in the 12th century BC, galleys with a single row of oarsmen were used primarily to transport soldiers to and from various land battles. The first recorded naval battle, the battle of the Delta between Egyptian forces under Ramesses III and the enigmatic alliance known as the Sea Peoples, occurred as early as 1175 BC. It is the first known engagement between organized armed forces, using <b>sea</b> <b>vessels</b> as weapons of war, though primarily as fighting platforms.

2500|$|Natural gas {{is mainly}} {{converted}} in to LNG to achieve [...] {{the natural gas}} transport over the seas where laying pipelines is not feasible technically and economically. LNG achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas (CNG) so that the (volumetric) energy density of LNG is 2.4times {{greater than that of}} CNG (at 250 bar) or 60 percent that of diesel fuel.

Specially designed cryogenic <b>sea</b> <b>vessels</b> (LNG carriers) or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport. LNG is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets, where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas. It can be used in natural gas vehicles, although it is more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas. Its relatively high cost of production and the need to store it in expensive cryogenic tanks have hindered widespread commercial use.
