5|$|The MAW {{has been}} criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second-class citizens. The <b>statutory</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> {{does not apply}} to them; {{although}} the MAW is HK$3,920, a local worker working a 48-hour week would earn HK$6,240 if paid at the minimum hourly wage of HK$30 (as of 30 March 2015). The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 percent during the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) may be willing to work for less than the MAW.|$|E

40|$|<b>Statutory</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> was {{effective}} in Hong Kong on 1 May 2011. It is not a newly invented concept and actually many European and Asian countries have adopted the <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy for long. Since {{the implementation of the}} <b>minimum</b> <b>wages,</b> it has been a controversial topic in our Hong Kong society. Being the one works in the property management field, this dissertation aims to examine the implementation of the <b>Statutory</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> among the property management companies in Hong Kong and to critically review and evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} this policy on the property management companies. Many scholars and economists have taken efforts to study the impacts of implementing the <b>Statutory</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages.</b> By reviewing those studies it helps to understand the possible costs and benefits that the <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy could bring. However, most of the studies are focused on the impacts of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy to the personal or society, very rare that they would have studied on the impacts of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> on a specific industry. There are also no scholars and economists did a research on the impacts of the <b>Statutory</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> on the property management industry. To understand the impacts of the <b>Statutory</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> on property management companies in Hong Kong, both primary and secondary data research has been conducted in order to find out the answer. For the secondary data research, data are collected via various channels including government’s report, Census and Statistics Department, journals, books and newspapers etc. For the primary data research, both qualitative and quantitative method has been used. The quantitative questionnaire interview aims to interview the people working in the property management companies and see how the implementation of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> could have impact on them. There is also a qualitative face to face interview to the property managers so as to understand the impacts of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy to the property management companies. By gathering the information and analysis the data, this paper suggests that at the current stage the implementation of the <b>Statutory</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> could bring more benefits than costs to the property management companies in Hong Kong. The overall living standard and living quality of the people working in the property management companies has been improved. Although the <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> would increase the company operation cost, it is suggested that the benefits generated could cover the cost increment in long run and it is worthy to continue the enactment of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy. Nevertheless, there is the recommendation that the future review of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> level should not be too aggressive. Prior any adjustment taken there should have a detail study on the market situation and the company affordability. Great changes at a time would be out of the affordability of the property management companies, which in turn would lead to the negative effect of close down of companies and trigger the layoff of employees. The policy should be review and adjust bit by bit so as to favor for the long term development of the property management companies in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R

In a widely criticised move, the government set the minimum wage at the low level of HK$28 per hour.
