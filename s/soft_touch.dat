500|$|Thomas Friedman has praised Reed in the New York Times for {{balancing}} the city's budget {{by limiting the}} pensions of city employees. This money was instead spent on the police force, {{as well as on}} community centers in poor neighborhoods (rather than on reversing the 42% increase in property taxes passed in 2009). He praises Reed as [...] "combining a <b>soft</b> <b>touch</b> with a hard head." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, Madsen {{planned to}} create a docudrama-style film but when he {{discovered}} Ketty was a Russian spy and had {{a love affair with}} Flammen he changed his mind. This finding [...] "forced me to make the film a much more stylish, more noirish piece of work." [...] "Even so, I tried to keep a <b>soft</b> <b>touch</b> style-wise out of respect for the film's subject," [...] said Madsen. He tried to make it feel real by [...] "eliminating the distance to 1944" [...] and directing the film as if it were set in the present.|$|E
500|$|The Sundays enjoyed {{dressing}} {{well and}} dressing their children well; the family sported expensive but tasteful coats, boots, and jewelry. Nell Sunday also bought land as an investment. In 1909, the Sundays bought an apple orchard in Hood River, Oregon, where they vacationed for several years. Although the property sported only a rustic cabin, reporters {{called it a}} [...] "ranch." [...] Sunday was a <b>soft</b> <b>touch</b> with money and gave away much of his earnings. Neither of the Sundays were extravagant spenders. Although Sunday enjoyed driving, the couple never owned a car. In 1911, the Sundays moved to Winona Lake, Indiana, and built an American Craftsman-style bungalow, which they called [...] "Mount Hood", probably {{as a reminder of}} their Oregon vacation cabin. The bungalow, furnished in the popular Arts and Crafts style, had two porches and a terraced garden but only nine rooms, [...] of living space, and no garage.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were over}} 30 home runs hit onto the right field roof over the years. It was a {{relatively}} <b>soft</b> <b>touch</b> compared to left field, with a [...] foul line and with a roof that was {{in line with the}} front of the lower deck. In left field, it was [...] farther down the line, and the roof was set back some distance. Only four of the game's most powerful right-handed sluggers (Harmon Killebrew, Frank Howard, Cecil Fielder and Mark McGwire) reached the left field rooftop. In his career, Norm Cash hit four home runs over the Tiger Stadium roof in right field and is the all-time leader.|$|E

Volleyballs are round and traditionally consist of eighteen nearly rectangular panels of synthetic or genuine leather, arranged in six identical sections of three panels each, wrapped around a bladder. However, in 2008, the FIVB adopted as its official indoor ball a new Mikasa with dimples and only eight panels for a <b>softer</b> <b>touch</b> and truer flight. A valve permits the internal air pressure to be adjusted.|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{probably}} the denim fabric {{employed in the}} present study was subjected during its production to a chemical treatment to confer it a <b>softer</b> <b>touch,</b> which at the same time increased its hydrophilicity and, possibly, its affinity to the indigo dye. As a hypothesis, the denim fabric may have been subjected to mercerization in the secondary stage of textile processing. The process of mercerizing consists in applying cold concentrated caustic soda (sodium hydroxide - NaOH) on the tensioned fabric. The caustic soda reacts with the cellulose fibers of the cotton causing a swelling, leaving them with a more rounded profile and decreasing the amorphous regions of the cellulose. The regain of mercerized cotton is approximately from 10 to 12 % (Saville, 2007; Kolpak et al. 1978).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} urban {{planning}} legacy left by Mrs Thatcher. To what extent has Mr Major continued with her approach? Has he developed new directions? This broad question provides the background for {{an examination of}} the changes to the planning system since Mrs Thatcher left office. The main themes covered are the new plan-led emphasis, the increase in the coverage of environmental issues, the question of whether a more people oriented perspective has developed with Major's <b>softer</b> <b>touch</b> and the Citizen's Charter and the property-led approach to urban regeneration. The paper concludes that although the contradictions of Thatcherism have led to the relaxation of certain ideological stances to planning, the central themes of Thatcherism - individualism and centralisation - continue unabated...|$|R
