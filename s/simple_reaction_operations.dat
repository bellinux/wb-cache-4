40|$|Theoretical {{investigation}} {{has shown a}} <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> water turbine would perform better when it spins faster. And for the <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> turbine water turbine to spin faster under constant water head, its diameter should be smaller. This paper reports on a performance analysis based on the experimental data collected from different performance tests car-ried on two <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> water turbine prototypes. Two new designs of <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> water turbines and their manufacturing methods are reported. The two turbines under investigation have different rotor diameters F 0. 243 m and F 0. 122 m. In case of the <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> water turbine the water enters into the turbine axially and exits tangentially through nozzles located on the outer periphery of the turbine. Further this paper will discuss the performance character-istics of stationary turbine i. e. zero power produced and performance characteristics of turbine producing power. It was found that rotor diameter affects the maximum rotational speed of the <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> turbine for constant supply head. It was also found that faster the turbine spins its performance improves. The two turbines were tested between supply head range of 1 m to 4 m...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objective: <b>Simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time is {{the time}} {{interval}} between stimulus and response. In this study the impact of handedness on auditory, visual and cutaneous <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time have been investigated. Methods: 100 healthy male volunteers of age group 18 - 25 yrs were participated as subjects. According to criteria of Cromwell and Rife the subjects were divided into 94 right handed and 6 left handed persons. The subjects were presented with auditory, visual and cutaneous stimuli by using an electronic response analyzer. Result: The paired ‘t’ test for comparison of all the parameters of <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time recordings between right and left hand values in right handed subjects show P 0. 05 for all the parameters of <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time.

40|$|Eucalyptus dieback disease, {{caused by}} Cylindrocladium scoparium, has {{occurred}} in last few years in large Eucalyptus planting areas in China and other countries. Rapid, simple, and reliable diagnostic techniques are desired for the early detection of Eucalyptus dieback of C. scoparium prior to formulation of efficient control plan. For this purpose, three PCR-based methods of nested PCR, multiplex PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were developed for detection of C. scoparium based on factor 1 -alpha (tef 1) and beta-tubulin gene in this study. All of the three methods showed highly specific to C. scoparium. The sensitivities of the nested PCR and LAMP were {{much higher than the}} multiplex PCR. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR was also higher than regular PCR. C. scoparium could be detected within 60 min from infected Eucalyptus plants by LAMP, while at least 2 h was needed by the rest two methods. Using different Eucalyptus tissues as samples for C. scoparium detection, all of the three PCR-based methods showed much better detection results than regular PCR. Base on the results from this study, we concluded that any of the three PCR-based methods could be used as diagnostic technology for the development of efficient strategies of Eucalyptus dieback disease control. Particularly, LAMP was the most practical method in field application because of its one-step and rapid <b>reaction,</b> <b>simple</b> <b>operation,</b> single-tube utilization, and simple visualization of amplification products...|$|R

These drugs have hazardous side effects such as habituation, tolerance, and addiction. Traditional medicines {{can be used}} as an alternative hypnotic sedative drugs which have less side effects, {{and one of them is}} celery seed (Apium graveolens L.). The aims of this research are to determine the hypnotic effect of celery seed  and its influence on <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time. The method used in this research was by testing the water extracted-celery seed with various dose on DDY strain male mice. These mice were inducted by Phenobarbital. The measured data were the onset and the duration of sleeping time compared with control. The measurements of <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time  was done with red, yellow, green, and blue light on 10 research subjects, before and after ingestion of water extracted- celery seed. These results suggest that the onset of mice sleeping time with 4 human dose (4 HD) of water extracted-celery seed doesn’t significantly different with Diazepam, but its duration is different (the same as control).

The presence of dysgenic fertility for IQ amongst Western nations, starting in the 19 th century, suggests that these trends {{might be related to}} declining IQ. This is because high-IQ people are more productive and more creative. We tested the hypothesis that the Victorians were cleverer than modern populations, using high-quality instruments, namely measures of <b>simple</b> visual <b>reaction</b> time in a meta-analytic study. <b>Simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time measures correlate substantially with measures of general intelligence (g) and are considered elementary measures of cognition. In this study we used the data on the secular slowing of <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time described in a meta-analysis of 14 age-matched studies from Western countries conducted between 1889 and 2004 to estimate the decline in g that may have resulted from the presence of dysgenic fertility. Using psychometric meta-analysis we computed the true correlation between <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time and g, yielding a decline of − 1. 16 IQ points per decade or − 13. 35 IQ points since Victorian times.

In one condition the subjects moved one of two fingers depending on the cue presented (choice reaction time), and in another they moved the same finger whatever the cue (<b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time).

A conjunction analysis was performed to reveal those areas which were more activated for the choice versus <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time, irrespective of whether the right or left hand was used. The activations were in prefrontal, premotor and intraparietal areas, {{and they were all}} in the left hemisphere. Thus, while there were activations in the right hemisphere for the choice versus <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time task when the subjects used their left (contralateral) hand, there were activations in left prefrontal, premotor and parietal areas whether the right (contralateral) or left (ipsilateral) hands were used.

Complicating matters further, their group of patients with lesions of the right hemisphere, although responding with their preferred hand, were more severely impaired than those with lesions of the left hemisphere who responded with their non-preferred hand.

(2) To determine if <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time is decreased by exposure to reduced ambient temperatures. (3) To describe {{the relationships between}} the cold exposure time, the performance level of a manual task, and the reaction time at reduced ambient temperatures.

This includes (1) identifying the effect of the reduced temperatures on work methods as well as MTM- 1 element motions, and (2) recommending a methodology that may yield predictive models for manual tasks under reduced temperatures. ^ The experiment was conducted in a controlled environmental chamber with the hand skin temperature continuously monitored. The manual dexterity performance was analyzed by evaluating a video tape of the assembly task performed. The <b>simple</b> <b>reaction</b> time task involved pushing several sequential lighted push buttons. The performance task scores were the completion time of these tasks.

Similarly, over 50 % of all fatalities occur at intersections. In light of this, research on human behavioral traits, kinetic visual acuity, kinetic visual fields and their aging effects is eagerly sought {{to uncover the}} causes of traffic accidents.
