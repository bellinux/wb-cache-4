5000|$|The Wiard rifle is a <b>semi-steel</b> light {{artillery}} piece invented by Norman Wiard. About 60 were manufactured between 1861 and 1862, at O'Donnell's Foundry, New York City: [...] "although apparently excellent weapons, {{they do not}} seem to have been very popular".|$|E
50|$|The Wiard rifle {{was cast}} in puddled wrought-iron (<b>semi-steel)</b> and was mounted in a special Wiard field {{carriage}} that was unique in its design. The rim base was spaced farther apart than any diameter of the tube, permitting unrestricted rotation on the trunnions without interference from the undercarriage. Wiard altered {{the shape of the}} carriage's cheeks, relocated the axle and provided a long elevating screw; this made firing at elevation of up to 35 degrees possible. It also meant that one carriage could slide beneath the next, allowing for more efficient storage and transportation.|$|E
5000|$|The 1st Regiment, New York Marine Artillery, also armed {{themselves}} with boat howitzers, using {{them for their}} designed use of amphibious expeditions. The unit participated in 16 raids along the North Carolina coast employing their boat howitzers. The New York Marine Artillery was issued twelve 12-pounder rifled boat howitzers made by Norman Wiard out of <b>semi-steel,</b> a low-carbon iron alloy. Other than the material used, the Wiard boat howitzers were identical to the Dahlgren 12-pounder rifled boat howitzers. The Wiard howitzers were not made in large numbers [...]|$|E
50|$|Squire {{also became}} an {{investor}} in the Cleveland steel industry. In October 1899, Squire {{invested in the}} Metal Sales Company, maker of steel for the manufacture of streetcars. In 1901, he helped finance and incorporate the <b>Semi-Steel</b> Co. of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, which manufactured streetcar equipment, brakes, and small steel castings. His involvement in the burgeoning Cleveland steel industry led the Jenks Ship Building Company to name a steel bulk freighter, launched in 1903, the F.B. Squire in honor of Squire. The M. A. Hanna Company purchased the F.B. Squire in December 1915. In 1892, Squire was appointed secretary of the Cleveland Steel Castings Co. He maintained his interest in steel manufacture into the 1920s, becoming secretary and treasurer of the Carroll Foundry and Machine Co. of Bucyrus, Ohio, in 1922.|$|E
5000|$|I {{applied a}} certain set of {{dynamics}} through the arrangement and the mixing {{and got a}} full musical extension of what I'd planned during the earliest stages of the theme. I think the chord changes are very special. I used a lot of musicians on the track; twelve violins, piano, four saxes, oboe, vibes, a guitar with a Coke bottle on the strings for a <b>semi-steel</b> guitar effect. Also, I used two basses and percussion. The total effect is 'Let's Go Away For Awhile', which is something {{everyone in the world}} must have said at some time or another. Nice thought; most of us don't go away, but it's still a nice thought. The track {{was supposed to be the}} backing for a vocal, but I decided to leave it alone. It stands up well alone.|$|E
5000|$|Metal screwpiles {{were used}} to form the {{foundation}} of many lighthouses built on sandy or muddy bottoms. The helicoidal or screw-like cast-iron flange {{at the end of}} the metal pile was augured into the bottom increasing the bearing power of the pile as well as its anchoring properties. Yet lighthouses built with these foundations were found to be vulnerable to ice floes. In areas such as the Florida Keys, where the bottom is soft coral rock, diskpile foundation lighthouses were built. Wrought iron piles were driven through a cast-iron or <b>semi-steel</b> disk which rested on the sea floor until a shoulder on the pile prevented further penetration. The disk diffuses the weight of the tower more evenly over the bottom. In coral reef areas where sand is also prevalent, a cast-steel screw was fitted to the end of the pile to give it more anchoring ability. Cofferdams were used generally in shallow waters where it was not necessary to deeply penetrate the natural bottom. The cofferdam enabled the water inside the dam to be pumped out and the foundation built [...] "in the dry." ...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out on the carburisation, {{desulphurisation}} and temperature rise of the <b>semi-steel</b> in a plasma induction furnace. Influences of many factors, such as power supply, structure and positioning of the plasma torch and bottom-blown-gas stirring, on heating efficiency and melt temperature distribution were studied. During carburisation of the <b>semi-steel,</b> plasma heating could effectively control the melt temperature, consequently, the carbon mass content of <b>semi-steel</b> increased from 1. 92 to 4. 58 % with the utilisation efficiency of carbon reached up to 61. 57 %, and the desulphurisation ratio could be beyond 66. 58 %.

40|$|Abstract. The {{performances}} of tires which {{are affected by}} improving the building way for semisteel radial tire have been researched. The testing results {{show that there is}} a great effect on the tire’s uniformity and dynamic balance because the pressing ways of <b>semi-steel</b> radial tire bis two steps with two rollers lamination make the variation of tread size greater. When the lamination process of two steps with two rollers was changed into three steps with three rollers, the tire’s uniformity and the dynamic balance have been improved effectively, which significantly reduces the possibility of the change when the tread size becomes larger during the lamination of tread...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Because of {{disadvantages}} of converter steelmaking with <b>semi-steel</b> in Panzhihua Steel, such as slow-footed slag forming, {{low rate of}} dephosphorization, high rate of rephosphorization after converter smelting, studies on increasing dephosphorization rate have been carried out. These studies comprise the optimization of slagging process, oxygen supply, bottom argon supply, end-point control of converter smelting, and so on. With these countermeasures, the rate of dephosphorization has been increased obviously. The {{results show that the}} average rate of dephosphorization is above 90 % with single-slag process during converter smelting. Otherwise, content of phosphorus at the end-point of converter smelting can be controlled below 0. 007 %, and rephosphorization rate after converter smelting can be controlled below 0. 003 %, which meets the requirement of [P]≤ 0. 010 % for steel products...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analysis conducted into {{the effect of}} CO 2 laser processing parameters on the surface modification and heat treatment of steels. The CO 2 laser and in house developed apparatus for movement of the samples allowed for high speed surface heat treatment. The operation of these components in conjunction allowed a wide variation in the heat treatments and sample properties to be obtained. In particular, the mechanism to pass the steel samples at high speeds (700 — 1200 mm/s), kept the focus spot exposure times below 1 x 10 - 3 s. Laser power from 825 to 1050 W and continuous beam mode were used. Both laser hardened and laser glazed samples were analysed using optical microscopy, Vickers and micro hardness testing, and XRD. The samples showed functionally graded surface morphologies and corresponding hardness and stiffness responses. For more rapidly process samples three layers of distinct hardness were noted. In all cases crystal and property modification to approximately 500 ttm was found. Results show how the laser treatment {{is directly related to}} the hardness profile through the surface and resultant microstructures. The results from all the samples show increased hardness due to (a) the formation of martensite and ferrite in the laser hardened samples and (b) a complete microstructural transformation to an amorphous state in the glazed samples. It is noted that the higher stiffness and hardness of the glazed samples can expect to result in a more wear resistant coating for the <b>semi-steel</b> forming process. The amorphous layer may also be expected to act as a thermal barrier to the higher temperatures encountered in semi-solid steel forming...|$|E
