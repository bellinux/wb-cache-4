50|$|On 19 July 2016, APOEL <b>sealed</b> their <b>passage</b> to {{the third}} {{qualifying}} round with a comfortable 3-0 win over The New Saints at the GSP Stadium. Despite dominating possession, APOEL remained goalless after the first 45 minutes, as TNS defended in numbers. However, Nektarios Alexandrou broke the deadlock nine minutes after the restart when his deflected shot from outside the area eluded goalkeeper Paul Harrison. Pieros Sotiriou doubled APOEL's advantage in the 73rd minute, firing home from close range to end any TNS hopes for a comeback. Tomás De Vincenti added the third goal deep into the injury time with a penalty which he won and converted himself.|$|R
50|$|On 31 January 2007, Logan {{was picked}} up on a free by {{neighbouring}} Conference side Exeter City. In the 2007-08 season, Logan was the top scorer for Exeter, scoring 18 league goals, including what {{proved to be the}} all important goal away to Torquay United, in the play-off semi-final second leg. This is the goal that effectively <b>sealed</b> their <b>passage</b> to Wembley for the second year running where they would go on to beat Cambridge United in front of over 45,000 fans.

25|$|Hart {{played in}} all the {{qualifying}} matches for the 2009 European Championships, In the finals, he started the first two group-stage matches and was rested for the last match as England had already <b>sealed</b> their <b>passage</b> to the knock-out stage. In the semi-final against Sweden, he conceded three goals {{in the second half}} as the match ended 3–3 after extra time, but made up for it by saving a penalty and scoring another as England won 5–4 in the shoot-out. However, he was yellow-carded for leaving his line to talk to Mikael Lustig as he prepared to take his penalty. England's appeal was rejected, so Hart was suspended for the final; Scott Loach kept goal as England lost 4–0 to Germany.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Black Gate" [...] {{was added}} to Newcastle Castle between 1247 and 1250, forming an {{additional}} barbican {{in front of the}} earlier north gate of the castle. It consisted of two towers with a passage running between them. On either side of the passage was a vaulted guardroom. There was a drawbridge at the front (facing west) and another at the rear. There was also a portcullis which could be raised and lowered to <b>seal</b> the entrance <b>passage.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{compliant}} {{metallic seal}} combines the noncontact {{feature of the}} labyrinth seal, the low leakage of a mechanical seal, and the compliant nature of the brush seal. It consists of several thin metallic elements or leaves mounted within a ring which is press fit into the housing, and in form, sort of resembles a lip seal sections wiping the shaft. A second set of overlapping cover leaves are placed {{on top of the}} shaft riding leaves which reduces leakage and provides stiffness. The leaves can be straight or angle cut. The shaft riding fingers are designed with mismatched curvature to provide lift off similar to the Rayleigh lift pads in mechanical seals with leading edge clearances nearly twice those of the trailing edge as as shown by Fleming to be optimal for gas flows in convergent <b>seal</b> <b>passages.</b> Leading edge clearances range from 300 to 500 microinches. Balance pockets beneath the leaves provide fluid film feed to the 'Rayleigh lift' surface and the proper balance ratio (mechanical seal) when combined with the static pressure and film pressure. The leaves flex in the radial direction and accommodate thermomechanical behavior as well as axial motion and angular misalignment. In the static mode, there is a net closing force on the leaves. The seals were tested to 70 psi at speeds to 16, 000 rpm or surface speeds to 330 fps and temperatures from ambient to 440 F. A slow cycle through the rig critical at 10, 000 rpm induced a radial vibration response of 0. 004 to 0. 005 inch were accommodated by the seal. Preliminary performance data are encouraging demonstrating hydrodynamic liftoff and noncontacting operation at pressure and speeds typical of gas turbine engines. The leakage performance data are significantly better than commercial labyrinth and brush seals which should be expected as this design incorporates the features of the low leakage face or mechanical seal along with the flexibility of the brush configuration...|$|R
500|$|Barton Aqueduct's {{fate was}} <b>sealed</b> with the <b>passage</b> of the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885, which {{allowed for the}} {{construction}} of a navigable waterway large enough to accommodate ocean-going vessels from the estuary of the River Mersey the [...] into Manchester, partly along the Irwell.

So solidly built was the old aqueduct that dynamite had to be used to expedite its demolition.|$|R
50|$|The {{statements}} about the sun and moon turning dark sound quite apocalyptic, as {{it appears to be}} a quote from the Book of Isaiah. The description of the sun, moon and stars going dark is also described in the Old Testament. Joel wrote that this would be a sign before the great and dreadful Day of the Lord. The Book of Revelation also mentions the sun and moon turning dark during the sixth seal of the seven <b>seals,</b> but the <b>passage</b> adds more detail than the previous verses mentioned.|$|R

I felt the spur above me shake beneath the shock of his impact, and as it did so I saw the huge rocking-stone, that had been violently depressed by him as he sprang, fly back when relieved of his weight till, for the first time during all these centuries, it got beyond its balance, fell with a most awful crash right into the rocky chamber which had once served the philosopher Noot for a hermitage, and, I have no doubt, for ever <b>sealed</b> the <b>passage</b> that leads to the Place of Life with some hundreds of tons of rock.|$|R
40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{investigation for}} a newly proposed microfabricated, normally-closed isolation valve was initiated. The micro-isolation valve is silicon based and {{relies on the}} principle of melting a silicon plug, opening an otherwise <b>sealed</b> flow <b>passage.</b> This valve may thus serve a similar role as a conventional pyrovalve and is intended for use in micropropulsion systems onboard future microspacecraft, having wet masses of no more than 10 - 20 kg, as well as in larger scale propulsion systems having only low flow rate requirements, such as ion propulsion or Hall thruster systems. Two key feasibility issues - melting of the plug and pressure handling capability - were addressed. Thermal finite element modeling showed that valves with plugs having widths between 10 and 50 gm have power requirements of only 10. 30 Watts to open over a duration of 0. 5 ms or less. Valve chips featuring 5 0 micron plugs were burst pressure tested and reached maximum pressure values o f 2900 psig (19. 7 Mpa) ...|$|R
50|$|On 6 August 2014, APOEL <b>sealed</b> their <b>passage</b> to the {{play-off}} {{round with}} a comfortable 2-0 win over HJK Helsinki at GSP Stadium. The game's opening goal came when Tomás De Vincenti won possession in midfield and quickly released Cillian Sheridan who showed great composure in slotting the ball past Michael Tørnes in the HJK goal. The dangerous Tomás De Vincenti doubled his side's {{lead in the}} 43rd minute, when he was caught by a high foot {{in the area and}} converted the penalty himself. APOEL continued to press in the second half and were unlucky not to add to their lead through Vinícius, the midfielder seeing his shots hitting the bar twice. The win guaranteed that APOEL would feature in the group stages of a European competition for the fourth time in six years, as even if they were to suffer defeat in the play-off round, they would go directly into the UEFA Europa League group stage.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the modeling of typical secondary air system {{elements such as}} rotating orifices, <b>seals,</b> and flow <b>passages</b> with heat and work transfer from the surrounding surfaces. The modeling is carried out in an object-oriented simulation environment that allows the creation of different configurations in a simple and flexible manner. This makes possible to compare the performance between different designs of individual components or complete secondary air systems as well as integrate them directly in whole engine performance models. The modeling is validated against published experimental data and computational results. An example of implementation in an engine model is also presented. © 2009 by ASME...|$|R
