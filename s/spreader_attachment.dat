40|$|Abstract â€” Organic manure plays {{important}} role to yield productivity of soil. It is good quality source of nitrogen phosphorus and excellent source of calcium and potash. The evenly spreading of manure on farm field is extremely important to achieve better effect. In India traditionally manure has distributed with help of fork and other mechanical device which is very tedious and slow process. The study of existing literature of manure spreader shows there are mainly two types of spreader viz. animal drawn spreader and tractor operated spreader. Performance of available spreader on different parameter has been studied which shows tractor operated spreader gives better result. Study also focus on their limitations of design and source of power supply. There is scope of develop tractor operated <b>spreader</b> <b>attachment</b> which will driven by rear wheel of trailer. By dismantling the attachment we can use trailer for transportation...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{advancement}} in high performance semiconductor packages {{has been driven}} by the need for higher pin count and superior heat dissipation. A one-piece cavity lid flip chip BGA package with high pin count and targeted reliability has recently been developed by UTAC. The flip chip technology can accommodate I/O count of more than five hundreds, and the die junction temperature can be reduced to a minimum level by a metal heat <b>spreader</b> <b>attachment.</b> Nonetheless, greater expectations on these high performance packages arose such as better substrate land estate utilization for multiple chips, ease in handling for thinner core substrates and improved board level solder joint reliability. A new design of the flip chip BGA package (patent pending) has been looked into for meeting such requirements. By encapsulating the flip chip with molding compound leaving the die top exposed, a planer top surface can be formed. And a flat lid can then be mounted on the planer mold/die top surface. In this manner the direct interaction of the metal lid with the substrate can be removed. The new package is thus less rigid under thermal loading and solder joint reliability enhancement is expected. This paper discusses the process development of the new package and its advantages for improved solder joint fatigue life, and being a multi-chip package and thin core substrate options. Finite element simulations have been employed for the study of its structural integrity, thermal and electrical performances. Detailed package and board level reliability test results will also be reported. 1...|$|E
40|$|High {{pin count}} and {{superior}} thermal dissipation {{are the main}} driving factors for high performance IC packages. Flip chip interconnects technology can generally achieve I/O count of more than 500, and large amount of heat in the silicon chip can be dissipated efficiently through metal heat <b>spreader</b> <b>attachment.</b> A one-piece cavity lid flip chip BGA package with high pin count and targeted reliability has recently been developed by UTAC. However {{it was found that}} solder joint reliability could be compromised due to the rigidity resulted by the one-piece cavity lid. A new design of flip chip BGA package (patent pending) has been looked into for improved board level performance. In this new design, the flip chip will be over-molded (with the die top surface exposed) before the lid is being attached. With the new single flat lid mounted onto the mold compound, the package substrate is thus less rigid under thermal loading. Hence solder joint integrity enhancement is expected. The structural differences between two flip chip BGA designs are being discussed in the paper. Test vehicles (BT substrate based) of size 40 x 40 mm with pin count of 1521 are fabricated for the evaluation of package and board level reliability. The analysis results showed that board level reliability could be improved (of more than 50 %) through design change, with no compromise in thermal performance of the package. The easy manufacturability of the flat lid has given an advantage over the complicated powder injection lid molding process, where the package cost can be reduced. Lastly, detailed package reliability of the two flip chip BGA packages is being reported. 1...|$|E
