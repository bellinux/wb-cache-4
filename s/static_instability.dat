40|$|The <b>static</b> pull-in <b>instability</b> of {{beam-type}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is theoretically investigated. Two engineering cases including cantilever {{and double}} cantilever microbeam are considered. Considering the midplane stretching {{as the source}} of the nonlinearity in the beam behavior, a nonlinear size-dependent Euler-Bernoulli beam model is used based on a modified couple stress theory, capable of capturing the size effect. By selecting a range of geometric parameters such as beam lengths, width, thickness, gaps, and size effect, we identify the <b>static</b> pull-in <b>instability</b> voltage. A MAPLE package is employed to solve the nonlinear differential governing equations to obtain the <b>static</b> pull-in <b>instability</b> voltage of microbeams. Radial basis function artificial neural network with two functions has been used for modeling the <b>static</b> pull-in <b>instability</b> of microcantilever beam. The network has four inputs of length, width, gap, and the ratio of height to scale parameter of beam as the independent process variables, and the output is static pull-in voltage of microbeam. Numerical data, employed for training the network, and capabilities of the model have been verified in predicting the pull-in instability behavior. The output obtained from neural network model is compared with numerical results, and the amount of relative error has been calculated. Based on this verification error, it is shown that the radial basis function of neural network has the average error of 4. 55 % in predicting pull-in voltage of cantilever microbeam. Further analysis of pull-in instability of beam under different input conditions has been investigated and comparison results of modeling with numerical considerations shows a good agreement, which also proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the adopted approach.

Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with high temperature gas model and perfect gas model have been solved by a parallel code, aiming at entry process of Mars Pathfinder. Aerodynamic characteristics has been calculated and analyzed, discussion about mechanism of <b>static</b> <b>instability</b> at small angle of attack found in simulation has been carried out. The results shows that good agreement is achieved among the numerical results, the reference values and the flight data of Viking, which validates the physical chemical models and the numerical methods applied in this paper.

Symptomatic scapholunate instability has been corrected so far either by limited wrist fusion or by various techniques of soft tissue repair. Limited wrist fusion greatly reduces wrist motion and increases the probability of osteoarthritis in the remaining mobile wrist segments. On the other hand, most types of soft tissue repair are technically difficult to perform and have disappointing results due to the inherent laxity. The presented dynamic approach was used in 20 wrists of 19 patients with <b>static</b> scapholunate <b>instability.</b> Preoperative evaluation included in all patients clinical examination, radiologic evaluation, and arthroscopy for establishing the diagnosis of <b>static</b> scapholunate <b>instability.</b> The technique involves the fixation of the ECRL tendon on the dorsal aspect of the scaphoid by means of a cancellous screw and a special washer.

40|$|AbstractUsing a heat {{exchanger}} with several parallel channels in boiling services, <b>static</b> <b>instabilities</b> like the Ledinegg instabilities can occur, {{resulting from a}} combination of unfortunate operating conditions and the {{heat exchanger}} design. Ledinegg instability is characterized by different flow rates in parallel channels that share common inlet and outlet manifolds. Oscillations between different conditions may also occur. In a thermodynamic system like liquefaction of natural gas, the fluids can exhibit a large temperature glide during condensation and evaporation and the actual local fluid temperature inside a heat exchanger will then be directly dependent of the local mass-flow. This means that mass-flow oscillations also imply thermal oscillations. This study shows how this type of non-ideal behavior can be predicted for a plate-fin heat exchanger by requiring all channels for each stream to have equal pressure drop. These nonlinear equations are solved on top of the thermo-hydraulic simulation model for the heat exchanger core...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the local and global bending motions of fluid-conveying pipes on an elastic foundation. The local approach refers to an infinite pipe without taking into account its finite ends, while in the global approach we consider a pipe of finite length with a given set of boundary conditions. Several kinds of propagating disturbances are identified from the dispersion relation, namely evanescent, neutral and unstable waves. As the length of the pipe is increased, the global criterion for instability is found to coincide with local neutrality, whereby a local harmonic forcing only generates neutral waves. For sets of boundary conditions that give rise only to <b>static</b> <b>instabilities,</b> the criterion for global instability of the long pipe is that static neutral waves exist. Conversely, for sets of boundary conditions that allow dynamic instabilities, the criterion for global instability of the long pipe corresponds to that for the existence of neutral waves of finite nonzero frequency. These results are discussed in relation with the work of Kulikovskii and other similar approaches in hydrodynamic stability theory. © 2002 Academic Press...|$|R

The aerodynamic coefficients were generated {{as a function of}} total angle-of-attack and either Knudsen number, velocity, or Mach number, depending on the flight regime. The database was constructed using continuum flowfield computations and data from the Mars Exploration Rover and Viking programs. Hypersonic and supersonic static coefficients were derived from Navier-Stokes solutions on a pre-flight design trajectory. High-altitude data (free-molecular and transitional regimes) and dynamic pitch damping characteristics were taken from Mars Exploration Rover analysis and testing. Transonic static coefficients from Viking wind tunnel tests were used for capsule aerodynamics under the parachute. <b>Static</b> <b>instabilities</b> were predicted at two points along the reference trajectory and were verified by reconstructed flight data.

40|$|The work {{deals with}} the {{structural}} analysis of an historic masonry building, Palazzo del Capitano in Mantua, subject to significant <b>static</b> <b>instabilities</b> due to an overturning of the longitudinal façades, probably related to ground settlements. The exact geometry of the structure is acquired {{by means of the}} laser scanning technique and thanks to previous investigations, the main mechanical properties of the materials are reasonably well defined. Based on these information a three-dimensional finite element model of the entire structure is implemented, taking into consideration all the geometrical (contact between not connected panels and large displacement effects) and material (elasto plastic damage behavior of the masonry) nonlinearities, in order to investigate the seismic behavior of the structure by means of nonlinear dynamic analysis. The outcome of the analysis points out that the longitudinal façade, overlooking Piazza Sordello, is poorly constrained both to the floors and to the transverse bracing elements, therefore not able to counteract its deformation when a seismic event occurs. Finally suggestions to reduce the seismic vulnerability of the building are critically assessed by the implemented finite element model...|$|R

The accuracy of this bridging relation in reconstructing the aero- dynamic coefficients {{given by the}} more exact methods is presented {{for a range of}} flight conditions and vehicle attitudes. There is good agreement between the various prediction methods, and a simple sine-squared bridging relation is shown to provide a reasonably good description of the axial force, normal force, and pitching moment over a range of Knudsen numbers from 0. 001 to 10.

Material properties of FG nano-beam is assumed to vary gradually along the thickness direction according to simple power-law form. With the purpose of eliminating the coupling between the stretching and bending due to the asymmetrical material variation along the thickness, a new surface reference is introduced.

40|$|The current {{generation}} of ocean general circulation models (OGCMS) uses a convective adjustment scheme to remove <b>static</b> <b>instabilities</b> and to parameterize shallow and deep convection. In simulations used to examine climate-related scenarios, investigators found that in the Arctic regions, the OGCM simulations did not produce a realistic vertical density structure, did not create the correct quantity of deep water, and did not use a time-scale of adjustment that is in agreement with tracer ages or observations. A possible weakness of the models is that the convective adjustment scheme does not represent the process of deep convection adequately. Consequently, a penetrative plume mixing scheme has been developed to parameterize the process of deep open-ocean convection in OGCMS. This new deep convection parameterization was incorporated into the Semtner and Chervin (1988) OGCM. The modified model (with the new parameterization) was run in a simplified Nordic Seas test basin: under a cyclonic wind stress and cooling, stratification of the basin-scale gyre is eroded and deep mixing occurs {{in the center of}} the gyre.

During the experiment, 59 radiosondes (Vaisala RS 92 G) were successfully launched and MU radar/lidar measurements were performed. The detection of turbulence from the in situ profiles is based on a Thorpe analysis. We have developed an original method for selecting the "true" turbulent events within the profile, i. e for rejecting the events induced by instrumental noise. The method is based on both an optimal noise reduction and a statistical hypothesis test. From the raw data of radiosoundings (3 - 6 m vertical resolution), we detected those turbulent regions whose vertical extent is larger than ~ 40 m in the troposphere, ~ 15 m in the lower stratosphere. By taking into account the water vapor saturation effects, we also detected (conditional) <b>static</b> <b>instabilities</b> within the clouds.
