6000|$|The Indians {{had also}} a {{grievance}} {{of a different}} kind. There was a conference held in Burlington, between the Indians and the whites, in 1678, which was convened on account of a complaint by the Indians that the English, in selling them some ready-made coats, had also sold them the smallpox. The temper of the Indians may be shown by one of their speeches on this occasion. A leading chief declared: [...] "We are willing to have a broad path for you and us to walk in; and if an Indian is asleep in this path, the Englishman shall pass by him and do him no harm; and if an Englishman is asleep in the path, the Indian shall pass him by and say, 'He is an Englishman; he is asleep; let him alone; he loves to sleep!' It shall be a plain path. There must not be in this path a stump to hurt our feet. And as for the smallpox, it was once in my grandfather's time, and {{it could not be}} the English that could <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> then, there being no English in the country. And it was once in my father's time, they could not <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> then, neither. And now it is in my time, I do not believe that they have sent it to us now. I do believe it is the man above who has sent it to us." [...] Soon after this, the two parties exchanged presents, and went away satisfied.|$|E

Later in July Couch's health began to fail, prompting him to offer his resignation. The army commander, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, refused <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the <b>U.S.</b> War Department, and instead Couch was promoted to major general, to date from July 4.

60|$|As for myself, {{as this is}} to be my own story, not my husband's, I {{return to}} that part which related to myself. We went on with our plantation, and managed it with the help and {{diversion}} of such friends as we got there by our obliging behaviour, and especially the honest Quaker, who proved a faithful, generous, and steady friend to us; and we had very good success, for having a flourishing stock to begin with, as I have said, and this being now increased by the addition of #150 sterling in money, we enlarged our number of servants, built us a very good house, and cured every year a great deal of land. The second year I wrote to my old governess, giving her part with us of the joy of our success, and order her how to lay out the money I had left with her, which was #250 as above, and to <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in goods, which she performed with her usual kindness and fidelity, and this arrived safe to us.|$|E

In particular we chose the story A Small, Good Thing as the starting point for this year's collaboration. An open call this website invited people to do a small, good thing, write it out and <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> All contributions were received by midnight on 22 nd April.

The officer would post the propaganda on various websites and <b>send</b> <b>it</b> in emails <b>to</b> <b>US</b> publications and broadcasters. Some propaganda would be disguised as educational or scientific reports. ... The studies had been generated at the Center by Russian experts. The reports would be 100% accurate [...] Tretyakov did not specify the targeted web sites, but made clear they selected the sites which are most convenient for distributing the specific disinformation. During his work in New York City {{in the end of}} the 1990s, one of the most frequent disinformation subjects was War in Chechnya.|$|R
40|$|The {{modernization}} {{inside each}} European {{country has been}} generated socio-economic and cultural tensions, which increased by the sudden constraint of the mass politics. The main cause for this state is {{the acceptance of the}} homogenous nation model as a fundamental landmark of modernization. In this respect, the Romania’s province of Dobroudja represents an extreme revealer of the problems and conflicts of this modernizing program. It is significant that at the Berlin Congress in 1878 the Romania's government preferred to integrate Dobroudja, a province where the Romanian population was outnumbered by the Slavs and Moslems, instead areas with a majority Romanian-speaking population, like Timok Valley. This solution had ample economic consequences, but fueled too the political conflicts between central government and local politics. The theme of the article, beyond its strictly historic character, is important as <b>it</b> <b>sends</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> research a vaster problem, the long term changing of the South-Eastern European regions on Danube Valley...|$|R
40|$|SPORE {{does not}} {{normally}} publish readers. letters, {{but we are}} making an exception in this issue because the following letter contains both important information and a word of encouragement {{for all of us}} at SPORE. To the Editor SPORE Sir, I am obliged to write and thank you for the publication (in 1987) of the address of CIMMYT (International Centre for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat). We got in touch with the Centre immediately, and in response they sent us (free) 9 kg of a maize variety adapted to high altitude conditions. This seed solved the problem of the poor productivity of maize at 3000 m (the average altitude in our area). It was so successful that now our problem is how to process all this maize rather than how to grow it (maize and potatoes are our main staple food crops). So may I, through the courtesy of your columns, thank you, and tell you that SPORE saved the livelihoods of more than 50, 000 farmers of the High Plateaux of Uvira (Zaire). Yours truly, Ruhimbika Muller Principal Development Officer, Uvira High Plateaux If proof were needed of the value of information, this is it. But information alone is not sufficient, you have to know how to use it, and so we congratulate our friends in Uvira on their initiative and CIMMYT on its readiness to help. We should also like to thank Mr Ruhimbika Muller for his kindness, and to invite any reader with a similar story to <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> The eighteenth-century British statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke once said: 'Nobody makes a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little. ' Mr Muller's story proves the point.

5000|$|James {{was the son}} of John James of Astley, Worcestershire and {{his wife}} Mary Winford, {{daughter}} of Walter Winford. He became a supporter of the Parliamentary cause and served in the army. On 19 April 1647, the Committee of both Kingdoms ordered that '"Capt. James shall have power to seize upon and recruit his troop out of such horses as are the State's, marked with the State's mark, and have been embezled and sold away to any persons in cos. Bucks, Berks, and Oxon." [...] He was added to the Committee for Sequestrations in Worcestershire on 29 July 1648, and was appointed a sequestration commissioner for the county on 4 September 1649 and on 7 February 1650. In December 1650 he was High Sheriff of Herefordshire. The Committee for Compounding wrote to him on 26 December 1650, [...] " [...] Knowing how much you may contribute to carry on sequestration work, we have joined Mr. Herring (MP for Herefordshire) with you therein, and beg you both to use the utmost care <b>to</b> manage <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the best advantage. We have heard so much of your prudence and readiness that we believe you will omit nothing, and therefore will not trouble you further." [...] He replied on 10 January 1651 [...] "Thanks for your remembrance of me and my cousin Salway (his colleague). I am sorry I cannot answer your expectations in regard of other public business, but I shall spare as much time as I can for your business" [...] and he was eventually discharged from the committee for sequestration for unsatisfactory accounts in or about March 1652 He was appointed captain of a Troop of Horse Militia in Herefordshire on 21 August 1650. As Colonel James, he was appointed commander of the Horse and Dragoons in Worcestershire, under a commission from the Council of State on 31 March 1651 to [...] " [...] raise and command the forces in co. Worcester, under the Militia Act," [...] and he received a further order on 30 June for [...] "listing volunteers in co. Worcs." [...] On 7 October 1651 the Council wrote to him at Worcester [...] "The Council have ordered Col. Cooper to search for some gold said to be hid in Worcester, belonging to the enemy; the money is found, and 150 pieces of old gold are now in your hands; <b>send</b> <b>it</b> up <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be disposed of as the Council shall direct." [...] The Council wrote him on 31 March 1651 [...] "Being informed of your fitness to command the horse and dragoons raised in co. Worcs, we have issued a commission for that purpose, which we enclose, and desire you to give your best furtherance and assistance in raising of them that they may be ready on all occasions for preservation of the peace." [...] He received a commission as captain in the 1st Horse Regiment {{for the safety of the}} Eastern Association and Inland parts on 21 April 1651, and as these measures were taken to repel the Scots army under Charles II, he probably took part in the Battle of Worcester. He was added by order of Parliament to the High Court of Justice on 25 June 1651.|$|R
