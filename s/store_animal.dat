40|$|Normal heart {{contraction}} {{and rhythm}} {{relies on the}} proper flow of calcium ions (Ca 2 +) into cardiac cells and between their intracellular organelles, and any disruption can lead to arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Electrical excitation of the surface membrane activates voltage-dependent L-type Ca 2 + channels to open and allow Ca 2 + to enter the cytoplasm. The subsequent increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration activates calcium release channels (RyR 2) located at specialised Ca 2 + release sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which serves as an intracellular Ca 2 + <b>store.</b> <b>Animal</b> models have provided valuable insights into how intracellular Ca 2 + transport mechanisms are altered in human heart failure. The aim of this review is to examine how Ca 2 + release sites are remodelled in heart failure and how this affects intracellular Ca 2 + transport {{with an emphasis on}} Ca 2 + release mechanisms in the SR. Current knowledge on how heart failure alters the regulation of RyR 2 by Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and how these mechanisms control the activity of RyR 2 in the confines of the Ca 2 + release sites is reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. beef {{industry}} and both {{national and local}} regulatory agencies have been struggling to develop a national animal identification system (NAIS) for several years. The discovery of a single cow in the United States in December 2003 infected with BSE heightened {{awareness of the need}} for animal identification (ID) and meat traceability in the United States (and subsequent discoveries with difficult traceability furthered these concerns). However, costs, design, ownership, and control concerns associated with ani-mal traceback have made implementation a substantial challenge. Questions many indus-try participants wonder about include: What are the costs of implementation and opera-tion of an ID system? Who would collect and <b>store</b> <b>animal</b> ID information? Who would have access to such information? How would this information be used? What is the value of such a system? In the mean time, global adoption of animal and meat traceability systems is moving forward at a rapid pace, placing the U. S. beef industry at a competitive disadvantage in international markets.

40|$|The growing {{capacity}} to process and <b>store</b> <b>animal</b> tracks has spurred {{the development of}} new methods to segment animal trajectories into elementary units of movement. Key challenges for movement trajectory segmentation are to (i) minimize the need of supervision, (ii) reduce computational costs, (iii) minimize the need of prior assumptions (e. g. simple parametrizations), and (iv) capture biologically meaningful semantics, useful across a broad range of species. We introduce the Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering (EMbC), a general purpose, unsupervised approach to multivariate data clustering. The EMbC is a variant of the Expectation-Maximization Clustering (EMC), a clustering algorithm based on the maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian mixture model. This is an iterative algorithm with a closed form step solution and hence a reasonable computational cost. The method looks for a good compromise between statistical soundness and ease and generality of use (by minimizing prior assumptions and favouring the semantic interpretation of the final clustering). Here we focus on the suitability of the EMbC algorithm for behavioural annotation of movement data. We show and discuss the EMbC outputs in both simulated trajectories and empirical movement trajectories including different species and different tracking methodologies. We use synthetic trajectories to assess the performance of EMbC compared to classic EMC and Hidden Markov Models. Empirical trajectories allow us to explore the robustness of the EMbC to data loss and data inaccuracies, and assess the relationship between EMbC output and expert label assignments. Additionally, we suggest a smoothing procedure to account for temporal correlations among labels, and a proper visualization of the output for movement trajectories. Our algorithm is available as an R-package with a set of complementary functions to ease the analysis...|$|E

40|$|Organic matter (OM) in the {{environment}} acts as a nutrient, but may also act as a transport vector for harmful chemical compounds and bacteria. Acetate is a labile form of OM produced during fermentation in anaerobic lagoons used to <b>store</b> <b>animal</b> fecal-waste from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Dry and liquid fertilizers from CAFOs {{pose a threat to}} groundwater by introducing excessive amounts of nutrients (e. g. OM, nitrate and ammonia), metals, and antibiotic compounds. In the epikarst of Northern Arkansas in the Buffalo River watershed additional input of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from liquid CAFO waste-fertilizers was hypothesized to increase microbial activity along groundwater flowpaths. In addition, high metal and antibiotic concentrations associated with increasing concentrations of DOC were hypothesized to be detrimental to microbial processes, with exception given to resistant bacteria species. Laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted to characterize microbial DIC production and denitrification. The microcosms were treated with acetate, nitrate, phosphate, and/or various metal species to characterize concentration effects on microbial activity. Field studies were used to calibrate laboratory conditions, and to compare biomass production and composition. Isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ 13 C-DIC), nitrate (δ 15 N-NO 3), and dissolved oxygen (DO) were used to assess microbial responses to increasing DOC concentrations. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis was used to characterize biomass produced during the experiments. Conversion of DOC-DIC and decreasing NO 3 concentrations were observed in the microcosms. Microbial productivity was greatest when DOC concentrations were 10 times greater than NO 3 concentrations. When metals were added to the microcosms, microbial activity was inhibited with exception being microcosms containing metal concentrations below 10 µg/L. FAME biomarkers indicated gram-negative bacteria were present in biomass samples from the spring orifice and metal-treated microcosms, but microcosms amended with nutrients and DOC displayed indicators of predominantly gram-positive bacteria. Critical findings of this study were: bacteria species transported in spring discharge were resistant to antibiotics and metals, high concentrations of DOC and nitrate increase biological productivity in epikarst and metal exposure inhibits nitrate removal and causes ecological shifts in biofilms selecting for resistant bacteria strains...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} using earth-banked tanks (EBT’s) as an alternative and economical means of winter storage for animal and other farmyard wastes. The study contains a detailed literature review on the subject, {{the results of a}} series of laboratory-scale experiments, field studies and a predictive model of the transport process through the soil liner of an earth-banked tank. For the laboratory studies, soils were sampled at four different locations throughout Ireland. These soils were subjected to soil classification and hydraulic conductivity tests. Since this series of experiments had been conducted using water as the permeating fluid, further investigation was undertaken to examine the effect of animal slurry flowing through a soil liner. It was concluded that the presence of suspended solids in the slurry had a pronounced sealing effect on the soil liner, significantly reducing the effective permeability of the soil due to the deposition of solids on the soil surface and within the pores of the soil. An investigation of a full-scale earth-banked tank at the Teagasc Grange Beef Research Centre at Dunsany, Co. Meath was undertaken. Groundwater quality, groundwater level and slurry infiltration rates were monitored after the tank was filled with animal slurry. As a result of the monitoring programme, it was concluded that well-constructed earth-banked tanks could successfully <b>store</b> <b>animal</b> slurry and that the quality of the groundwater around the tanks was well within permissible limits post filling and compared favourably with the groundwater quality prior to the installation of the tanks. A novel methodology for measuring infiltration rates through a subsoil liner and sampling groundwater quality from directly beneath the subsoil liner of an earth-banked tank was developed. A pilot-scale tank was constructed which enabled direct sampling of the quality and measurement of the quantity of the permeate from the tank. The slurry infiltration rate was significantly below acceptable limits and declined with time, indicative of a sealing of the pores of the soil due to the deposition of bio-solids. Examination of groundwater quality data {{in the vicinity of the}} pilot-scale earth-banked tank showed no discernible deterioration in quality. A mathematical model of the soil sealing due to the physical transport of suspended solids contained in the animal slurry through the soil liner is presented. The model describes the following hydraulic conditions: falling head, constant head and rising head. The model was validated for the falling head case using suspensions of cattle slurry at three different total solids concentrations. The proposed model may be useful to regulatory authorities, enabling an estimate of the likely soil sealing by suspensions flowing through soil liners to be made. The overall conclusion of the study is that well-constructed earth-banked tanks using suitable soil that is adequately compacted can be successfully used to temporarily store highly polluting liquids such as animal slurries. The enhanced slurry-storage capacity resulting from the use of earth-banked tanks should reduce the pressure on farmers to spread slurry on land at inappropriate times, thereby contributing to an improvement in the quality of watercourses adjacent to agricultural activities.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{pest management}} (IPM) strategy was developed to manage infestations of mould mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) in <b>stored</b> <b>animal</b> feed, due to the increasing importance of these mites as pests of feed processing and storage facilities in Australia. This strategy involved several aspects such as limiting the moisture content of the processed feed to 12 %, admixing vegetable oil to some feed (2 % w/w), strict hygiene practice {{in and around the}} processing and storage facility, and rejection of infested grain at the receiving point. Additionally, seven contact insecticides and the fumigant phosphine were evaluated for their effectiveness against the mould mite to assess their potential integration into the IPM strategy. Among them, pyrethrin synergised with piperonyl butoxide, the insect growth regulator s-methoprene and a newly developed bacterium-based material spinosad controlled the mites. Moreover, the fumigant phosphine at 1 mg/litre over a six days exposure period also controlled these mites. So far, the IPM strategy, without any involvement of insecticides or fumigant has resulted in a complete eradication of the mite population in this particular case of <b>stored</b> <b>animal</b> feed...|$|R
