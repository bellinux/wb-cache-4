These may start weeks or months after the tickbite. Initially, they may include flu-like illness, fever, headache, sore throat, fatigue, aching muscles and joints. More serious are meningitis, Bell's palsy (weakness of the face muscles), <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> and heart problems with palpitations and breathlessness. Lyme disease is difficult to distinguish from many other illnesses like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) because the symptoms may be similar.

40|$|Heparanase is an endo-glucuronidase that degrades heparan sulfate chains. The enzyme is {{expressed}} {{at a low}} level in normal organs; however, elevated expression of heparanase has been detected in several inflammatory conditions, e. g. in the synovial joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Herein, we have applied the model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) to transgenic mice overexpressing human heparanase (Hpa-tg) along with wildtype (WT) mice. About 50 % of the induced animals developed clinical symptoms, i. e. <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> {{and there were no}} differences between the Hpa-tg and WT mice in the incidence of disease.

It is currently unknown why fracture of the elastomer occurs so frequently. Motion analysis was used to determine range of motion (ROM) of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, both without and with arthroplasty, to determine how the procedure affects motion of the joint. A 12 camera motion capture system was used to capture hand kinematic data. Preliminary experiments determined the best positions for reflective markers for measuring motion. Subjects consisted of a control population (20) and a patient population (10 without surgery and 10 with). Data were processed to give maximum, minimum and ROMs of flexion/extension and abduction/adduction at all MCPs during four movements: pinch grip, key grip, fist clench and hand spread. Results showed ROM was decreased by ageing, further by RA, and further again by replacement surgery.

40|$|Background: Juvenile {{idiopathic}} arthritis (JIA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common diseases of childhood causing pain, <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> and reduced mobility. Previous research has focused on the challenges and psychosocial impact of JIA, but there has been limited attention given to how young people adjust and adapt to living with a long-term condition such as JIA. The aim of this qualitative study was therefore to explore adolescents' experiences of living with JIA, with particular focus on the process of adjustment. Methods: Ten adolescents (7 female, 3 male) aged 13 – 17 years with good treatment adherence were recruited from an adolescent arthritis clinic. In-depth interviews were conducted, and data were analysed by two researchers independently using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: These adolescents described the physical and psychosocial ‘burden of living with JIA’ and the challenges faced by an underlying preoccupation ‘to be a normal teenager’. However, their accounts also revealed ways in which they regained agency and developed ‘resilience through taking control’ over their lives. This resilience helped the adolescents re-establish a sense of well-being through an ongoing process of ‘acceptance and self-growth’. Conclusions: Although much research has adopted a deficit model that focuses on adjustment problems, the current study highlights the resourcefulness of young people in managing the challenges of living with a long-term condition. These experiences of successful adjustment can be used as the basis of positive, strength-based intervention approaches for adolescents with arthritis to enhance resilience and well-being...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, we {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} indi-vidual administration of methionine or glucosamine (GlcN) and compared with the combined administration of methionine and GlcN on the adjuvant arthritis model of rheumatoid arthritis in rats. Adjuvant arthritis was induced in female Lewis rats by injecting Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) into the right hind paws, and methionine (200 mg/kg body weight/day) and/or GlcN (400 mg/kg/day) were orally administered for 21 days. The progression of the adjuvant arthritis was clinically evaluated for characteristic signs and symptoms by employing an arthritis score. The administration of methionine combined with GlcN suppressed the swelling of FCA-uninjected left hind paws and the arthritis score. Additionally, histopathological examina-tion revealed that the combined administration of methionine and GlcN markedly suppressed synovial hyperplasia {{and the destruction of}} the cartilage surface and articular meniscus of the knee joints of FCA-injected right hind paws. Furthermore, combined methionine and GlcN administration suppressed the increase in the levels of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E 2 and hyaluronic acid in the plasma of rats with adjuvant arthritis. By contrast, individual administration of methionine or GlcN suppressed arthritis only slightly. These observations suggest that the combined administration of methionine and GlcN is more effective compared with individual administrations of methionine or GlcN in suppressing the progression of adjuvant arthritis (identified as <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> and arthritis score), possibly by synergistically inhibiting synovial inflammation (identified as synovial hyperplasia and the destruction of the cartilage surface and articular meniscus) and the production of inflammatory mediators...|$|E

To increase the familiarity of rheumatologists toward epidemiology, we describe the methodology used in a prevalence study of musculoskeletal complaints performed in Chiavari, Italy. Methods: A questionnaire, originally developed by the Epidemiology Unit of the Arthitis Research Council in Manchester, UK, to investigate the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, was used after translation and validation. 4456 subjects aged 16 years or more listed in four general practices were {{invited to participate in the}} study and to fill the ARC questionnaire. The 3294 responders reported a) any past occurrence of joint swelling lasting more than four weeks and the distribution of the swollen joints on a mannequin; b) any joint pain lasting more than four weeks; c) current joint pain or swelling; d) morning stiffness; e) whether they had been previously told by a doctor they had arthritis. Results: Four steps were necessary to obtain a 74 % response, i. e. direct contact, two mailings and a phone interview. The performance of the different questions was good. The prevalence of the most common conditions among patients answering positively to the questions regarding morning stiffness and symmetrical <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> was as follows: osteoarthritis 2. 60 %, fibromyalgia 1. 30 %, carpal tunnel syndrome 1. 14 %, rheumatoid arthritis 0. 31 %, and psoriatic arthritis 0. 10 %.

40|$|Problem statement: Osteoarthritis is an {{inflammatory}} joint disease associated with loss of cartilage matrix. There is suggestive {{evidence that the}} intake of polydextrose fiber has anti-inflammatory activity. It was reasoned that polydextrose may have {{a positive influence on}} canine osteoarthritis. Approach: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with privately owned dogs was carried out to assess the efficacy of STA-LITE® polydextrose in the treatment of osteoarthritis. With the use of a questionnaire, five clinical signs were evaluated by the owners. For a period of 8 weeks, the dogs received a complete dry food without or with 3 % polydextrose. There were 16 control and 19 test dogs. Results: The baseline values of the clinical scores for <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> stiffness and lameness indicated that the severity of osteoarthritis was much less in the test dogs than in the controls. The initial scores for activity and pain were similar in the two groups. Comparing the changes in clinical scores over time between control and test dogs would be biased by the difference in baseline severity of osteoarthritis. On strict terms, a maximum number of pairs of matched control and test dogs was formed for each clinical sign. It was found that all five clinical signs showed more group-mean improvement in the dogs fed the diet containing polydextrose than in those given the control diet. The difference between the pooled group-mean changes of the control and test dogs was statistically significant. As an overall index of the improvement of osteoarthritis, the sum of the changes for the five clinical variables was calculated. Polydextrose was found to induce a marked improvement of osteoarthritis: The polydextrose-mediated increase in the osteoarthritis improvement index was 57 %. Conclusion: Polydextrose can be considered safe and it is suggested that a dose of 3 % in a dry food would be beneficial for dogs with osteoarthritis...|$|E

DESIGN: Historic cohort study. SETTING: Radboud University Medical Centre. SUBJECTS: All consecutively admitted patients with severe traumatic brain injury (admission Glasgow Coma Scale score 8 or less) during the years 2002 - 2003. MAIN MEASURES: The development of clinically relevant heterotopic ossification, defined as painful <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> with redness and decreased range of motion, confirmed radiographically. RESULTS: Seventy-six (64 %) of the 119 patients survived and were eligible for further follow-up. Nine patients (12 %) developed 20 symptomatic heterotopic ossifications, {{in one or more}} joints. Patients with heterotopic ossification had sustained more severe brain injuries, compared to the group without heterotopic ossification. The mean coma duration in the heterotopic ossification group was 28. 11 days (SD 20. 20) versus 7. 54 days (SD 7. 47) in the patients without heterotopic ossification (P < 0. 001). The occurrence of autonomic dysregulation (relative risk (RR) 59. 55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 8. 39 - 422. 36), diffuse axonal injury (RR 20. 68, 95 % CI 4. 92 - 86. 91), spasticity (RR 16. 96, 95 % CI 3. 96 - 72. 57) and systemic infection (RR 13. 12, 95 % CI 3. 01 - 57. 17) were all associated with an increased risk of developing symptomatic heterotopic ossification. However, only autonomic dysregulation had a high positive (88. 9 %, 95 % CI 51. 7 - 99. 7) and negative (98. 5 %, 95 % CI 91. 9 - 99. 9) predictive value with regard to heterotopic ossification.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with thyroid dysfunction. Methods: One hundred and twenty-three patients (100 female, 23 male) who visited the nuclear medicine department for thyroid gland scintigraphy were included in our study. According to thyroid hormone levels, patients were allocated into five categories: hyperthyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, euthyroid, subclinical hypothyroidism, and hypothyroidism. Before neurological and musculoskeletal examinations, a standardized symptom questionnaire was completed including questions about sensory symptoms, muscle weakness, restricted joint mobility, musculoskeletal pain. Neurological examination, range of motion of joints, effusion or <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> was assessed. Diagnosis of osteoarthritis was done by the clinical and radiological characteristics. The diagnosis of FMS was made according to criteria of American College of Rheumatology. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a T-score &# 8804; - 2. 5 was classi&# 64257;ed as osteoporosis, whereas a T-score between - 2. 5 and - 1. 0 was classi&# 64257;ed as osteopenia. Thyroid status was determined by serum TSH levels. Results: Eighty-one percent of the patients were female (100) and 19 % were male (23). Mean age of female patients was 49. 99 &# 177; 15. 27 years (range 20 - 87) and mean age of male patients was 61. 8 &# 177; 12. 33 years (range 34 - 88). When divided according to thyroid status, 21. 1 % (n= 26) had hyperthyroidism, 21. 1 % (n= 26) had subclinical hyperthyroidism, 49. 6 % (n= 61) were euthyroid, 4. 9 % (n= 6) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 3. 3 % (n= 4) were hypothyroid. None of 59 % of patients had any musculoskeletal diagnosis. Osteoporosis was the most common problem, affecting 23. 7 % of patients Conclusion: The presence of musculoskeletal symptoms in patients with goiter should be considered and investigated.

50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{inflammation}} that can cause knee pain, including sprains, bursitis, and injuries to the meniscus. A diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis can be made based on a physical examination {{and the presence of}} risk factors in the person's medical history; swelling and tenderness {{at the front of the}} knee, combined with a profession that requires frequent kneeling, suggest prepatellar bursitis. <b>Swelling</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>joints</b> along with restricted range of motion may indicate arthritis instead.|$|R
50|$|Bog spavin is a <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the tibiotarsal <b>joint</b> <b>of</b> the horse's hock which, in itself, {{does not}} cause lameness. The joint becomes {{distended}} by excess synovial fluid and/or thickened synovial tissue bringing about a soft, fluctuant swelling on the front <b>of</b> the <b>joint,</b> {{as well as in}} the medial and lateral plantar pouches. Bog spavin is generally an indication of underlying pathology within the joint.|$|R
50|$|Acne fulminans {{begins as}} pain and {{inflammation}} in the joints. It eventually progresses into a <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> {{the lymph nodes}} located {{at the base of}} the neck, causing inflexibility in the neck within weeks after the nodes swell. This swelling will eventually decrease, but this decrease will be accompanied by an increased inflammation and <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>joints,</b> as well as a complete loss of appetite, though these symptoms are often ignored. After some time, the disease will cause an extreme loss of weight and atrophy of the muscles, leading to the decline of physical abilities.|$|R
