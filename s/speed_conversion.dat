40|$|Introduction Most of the {{developments}} in wave power {{have concentrated on}} {{the conversion of the}} energy in the wave into a form which can be converted into electrical energy by conventional high speed rotary generators. For example in the oscillating water column (OWC) shown in Figure 1, the column produces a low-speed reciprocating linear motion moving at a velocity in the region of 0. 5 to 1 m/s, which is converted to high speed unidirectional rotation by the air duct and Wells' turbine. Other devices such as the Bristol Cylinder and Salter's Duck employ hydraulic ring main systems to convert low speed reciprocating motion into high rotational speed. This mechanical interface required for <b>speed</b> <b>conversion</b> forms the main component of the so-called Electrical & Mechanical Plant (E&M), which according to Thorpe is the most costly part of a WEC [1].

40|$|In {{the field}} of power electronics, {{designers}} are constantly researching new methods to improve efficiency while optimizing dynamic performance. As communication technologies progress we are more often dealing with systems of increasing speed and complexity. For instance, from 1991 to 2013 we have observed the mobile broadband communication sector evolve from ~ 230 Kbits/s (2 G) speeds to ~ 100 Mbits/s (4 G LTE), a 430 % increase in communication speed. In contrast, we have not observed the same evolutionary development in industrial power converters. Most switch-mode power supplies are still manufactured for 100 KHz to 800 KHz operating frequencies. The main {{reason for this is}} that most electrical devices only require steady-state DC power, so high <b>speed</b> <b>conversion</b> performance is largely unnecessary. But as size expectations for portable electronic devices continue to decrease, the only way to meet future demand is to realize power electronics that operate at much higher switching frequencies. Furthermore there is increasing demand to improve the transient response requirements in processor-based systems and achieve practical envelope tracking in RF communication systems. The most straightforward method of increasing the dynamic response for these systems is to increase the switching frequency of the power electronics in a sustainable and coherent manner...|$|E
40|$|High-speed and low {{resolution}} analog-to-digital converters (ADC) are key {{elements in the}} read channel of optical and magnetic data storage systems. The required resolution is about 6 - 7 bits while the sampling rate and effective resolution bandwidth requirements increase with each generation of storage system. Folding is a technique {{to reduce the number}} of comparators used in the flash architecture. By means of an analog preprocessing circuit in folding A/D converters the number of comparators can be reduced significantly. Folding architectures exhibit low power and low latency as well as the ability to run at high sampling rates. Folding ADCs employing interpolation schemes to generate extra folding waveforms are called "Folding and Interpolating ADC" (F&I ADC). The aim of this research is to increase the input bandwidth of high <b>speed</b> <b>conversion,</b> and low latency F&I ADC. Behavioral models are developed to analyze the bandwidth limitation at the architecture level. A front-end sample-and-hold unit is employed to tackle the frequency multiplication problem, which is intrinsic for all F&I ADCs. Current-mode signal processing is adopted to increase the bandwidth of the folding amplifiers and interpolators, which are the bottleneck of the whole system. An operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) based folding amplifier, current mirror-based interpolator, very low impedance fast current comparator are proposed and designed to carry out the current-mode signal processing. A new bit synchronization scheme is proposed to correct the error caused by the delay difference between the coarse and fine channels. A prototype chip was designed and fabricated in 0. 35 ?m CMOS process to verify the ideas. The S/H and F&I ADC prototype is realized in 0. 35 ?m double-poly CMOS process (only one poly is used). Integral nonlinearity (INL) is 1. 0 LSB and Differential nonlinearity (DNL) is 0. 6 LSB at 110 KHz. The ADC occupies 1. 2 mm 2 active area and dissipates 200 mW (excluding 70 mW of S/H) from 3. 3 V supply. At 300 MSPS sampling rate, the ADC achieves no less than 6 ENOB with input signal lower than 60 MHz. It has the highest input bandwidth of 60 MHz reported in the literature for this type of CMOS ADC with similar resolution and sample rate...|$|E
40|$|Quantification of risk {{to natural}} {{disasters}} {{is a valuable}} endeavor from engineering, policy and (re) insurance perspectives. This work presents two research efforts relating to meteorological risk, specifically with regard to storm surge hazard estimation and wind vulnerability assessment. While many high water level hazard estimation methods have been presented in the literature and used in industry applications, none bases its results on disaggregated tidal gauge data while also capturing {{the effects of the}} evolution of storm surge over the duration of a storm. Additionally, the coastal destruction wreaked by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 prompted motivation to estimate the event’s return period. To that end, this dissertation first presents the motivation for and development of the clustered separated peaks-over-threshold simulation (CSPS) method, a novel approach to the estimation of high water level return periods at coastal locations. The CSPS uses a Monte Carlo simulation of storm surge activity based on statistics derived from tidal gauge data. The data are separated into three independent components (storm surge, tidal cycle and sea level rise) because different physical processes govern different components of water level. Peak storm surge heights are fit to the generalized Pareto distribution, chosen for its ability to fit a wide tail to limited data, and a clustering algorithm incorporates the evolution of storm surge over surge duration. Confidence intervals on the return period estimates are computed by applying the bootstrapping method to the storm surge data. Two case studies demonstrate the application of the CSPS to coastal tidal gauge data. First, the CSPS is applied to tidal gauge data from lower Manhattan. The results suggest that the return period of Hurricane Sandy’s peak water level is 103 years (95 % confidence interval 38 – 452 years). That the CSPS estimate is significantly lower than previously published return periods indicates that storm surge hazard in the New York Harbor has, until now, been underestimated. The CSPS is also applied to all tidal gauge stations managed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for which the hourly water level time histories are at least 30 years long. Comparison to NOAA’s exceedance probability levels for these stations suggests that the CSPS estimates higher return levels than NOAA, but also that the NOAA values fall within the 95 % CI from the CSPS {{for more than half of}} the stations tested. This dissertation continues with a critical comparison of windstorm vulnerability models. The intent of this research is to provide a compendium of reference curves against which to compare damage curves used in the reinsurance industry. The models tend to represent specific types of construction and use varying characteristic wind speed measurements to represent storm intensity. Wind <b>speed</b> <b>conversion</b> methods are used to harmonize wind speed scales. The different vulnerability models analyzed stem from different datasets and hypotheses, thus rendering them relevant to certain geographies or structural typologies.
