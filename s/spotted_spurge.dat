50|$|Some people mistake {{knotweed}} for <b>Spotted</b> <b>spurge.</b> An {{easy way}} {{to tell the difference}} is to break off a stem. Spurges contain milky sap; knotweed does not.|$|E
50|$|Euphorbia maculata, {{variously}} called <b>spotted</b> <b>spurge</b> or prostrate spurge, {{the latter}} name {{not to be}} confused with Euphorbia prostrata), is a fast-growing annual plant in the family Euphorbiaceae, native to North America.|$|E
50|$|The leaves {{often are}} {{marked with a}} black dash in the center, a feature {{that lead to the}} common name of <b>spotted</b> <b>spurge.</b> It is similar to Euphorbia prostrata, the usual species called {{prostrate}} spurge, but that species has shorter leaves that are more rounded at the tips. It may occasionally be confused with Euphorbia serpens but the very short and rounded leaves of E. serpens in combination with the much larger (but still inconspicuous) flowers should remove any potential for confusion.|$|E
5|$|Native {{riparian}} {{plant life}} includes sandbar willows and cottonwoods with Montana's state tree, the ponderosa pine, also being prevalent. Other native plants include wetland {{species such as}} cattails and beaked-sedge as well as shrubs and berry plants like Douglas hawthorn, chokecherry, and western snowberries. To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, <b>spotted</b> knapweed, leafy <b>spurge,</b> St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|R
50|$|Invasive weeds such as <b>spotted</b> knapweed, leafy <b>spurge,</b> cheatgrass, sulfur cinquefoil, Dyer's Woad and Dalmatian {{toadflax}} {{are established}} across Mount Jumbo. Numerous management programs {{are working to}} combat the invasive species spread. A non-profit organization called Working Dogs, has trained dogs to detect Dyer's Woad. After 10 years of detection work the number of this invasive plant has dropped from thousands to only 7 plants per year. Community weed-pulls organized by Missoula City as well as student, conservation and other private groups work to remove thousands of pounds of weeds from the mountainâ€™s face every year. Sheep have also {{been used as a}} management tool to graze on the unwanted species, although their efficacy is doubtful.|$|R
500|$|Exotic {{species of}} flora {{that are not}} native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, <b>Spotted</b> knapweed, Leafy <b>spurge</b> and Yellow toadflax. These {{non-native}} plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over [...] of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas fir beetle, and that the insects had killed between 25 and 100percent of {{the trees in the}} impacted areas. The forest service is addressing the situation by performing controlled burns, selling dead trees as firewood, timber harvesting and spraying the highest value areas.|$|R
40|$|Simazine {{loss from}} soil to surface runoff water produce both a {{decrease}} in the effectiveness of the soil chemical treatment and a water quality hazard in receiving waters. Simazine has been found in 30 % of wells sampled in Fresno and Tulare counties, California and some contamination has been attributed to simazine use in citrus orchards. Contamination of receiving water from herbicides could put important weed control tools at risk and potentially increase risks to human health. In order to better understand the off-site movement of herbicides, studies were conducted in citrus orchards to evaluate weed control efficacy under selected weed management practices and to measure selected management practices for mitigating preemergent herbicide movement in rainfall runoff from citrus orchard middles. The results showed weed management practices that avoid broadcast application of preemergent herbicides during the rainy season were as effective as the standard rate at 2. 0 lb ai /acre for weed control by using spray application to the entire orchard floor. The most common weed species included: <b>spotted</b> <b>spurge,</b> common groundsel, horseweed, annual sowthistle, and purple cudweed. Common groundsel is found to be resistant to preemergence application. Modifying how preemergence herbicides are used to control weeds is becoming increasingly important to protect th...|$|E
40|$|Seed {{dispersal}} by ants (myrmecochory) is {{a widely}} distributed plant-animal interaction in many ecosystems, {{and it has been}} regarded as a generalized (multiple species) interaction in which specialization on specific ant partners is uncommon. In this paper, we demonstrate species-specific seed dispersal of <b>spotted</b> <b>spurge</b> (Chamaesyce maculata) by ants in Japan. C. maculata produces seeds from summer to autumn in Japan. The seeds produced in autumn are carried by two ant species, Tetramorium tsushimae and Pheidole noda. We performed laboratory experiments to investigate the fate of C. maculata seeds in the nests of T. tsushimae and P. noda. P. noda consumed the seeds in the nest and rarely carried seeds out of the nest, while T. tsushimae consumed only the seed coat, and subsequently carried the seeds out of the nest. Removal of the seed coat by T. tsushimae may increase seed survival by reducing their susceptibility to infection by fungi. We also observed ant responses to filter paper soaked with an aqueous extract of the seed coat. P. noda did not react to the filter paper, but T. tsushimae carried the filter paper into their nest. Analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed that the aqueous extract contained at least four sugars and one unknown substance. Myrmecochory has been regarded as a generalized interaction with specialization for specific ant partners uncommon. However, our study suggests there is a species-specific interaction in seed dispersal by ants in autumn-flowering individuals of C. maculata in Japan...|$|E
50|$|The flora of Palmaria is {{composed}} of about 500 species. The original vegetation, {{which was to be}} formed mainly from the Mediterranean and the forest of oak, was modified to anthropogenic causes such as fire, agriculture, introduction of alien plants and animals (plane trees, palms and rabbits).Today the pines (Pinus pinaster and Pinus halepensis) share space with typical Mediterranean species such as oak (Quercus ilex), oak (Quercus pubescens), mastic (Pistacia lentiscus), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), the cysts (Cistus monspeliensis, salvifolius Cistus, Cistus incanus), the gorse (Spartium junceum), etc..Other important groups are the <b>spot</b> to plant <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia dendroides) and nearest to the sea cliffs on those characterized by samphire (Crithmum maritimum).Among the new flora should be noted Centaurea cineraria veneris, Iberis umbellata var. linifolia, exclusive in Palmaria, Centaurea aplolepa lunensis, endemic in eastern Liguria.Finally, also worth Brassica oleracea robertiana, Serapias neglecta and Cistus incanus, rare in Liguria, where it reaches its northern limit.|$|R
