The results, based on Granger-causality tests and vector autoregressive models, suggest that small traders' open interest {{is closely related}} to large speculators' open interest. Small traders and <b>speculators</b> tend to herd, which means that small traders are long [short] when <b>speculators</b> are long [short] as well. Moreover, small traders and <b>speculators</b> are positive feedback traders whereas hedgers are contrarians. Regarding information flows, <b>speculators</b> lead small traders in three of the four currency futures markets.

40|$|We {{present and}} study a Minority Game based {{model of a}} {{financial}} market where adaptive agents [...] the <b>speculators</b> [...] interact with deterministic agents [...] called producers. <b>Speculators</b> trade only if they detect predictable patterns which grant them a positive gain.

Transitions between equilibrium and out of equilibrium behavior are observed when the relative number of <b>speculators</b> to the complexity of information or to the number of producers are changed. When the system is out of equilibrium, stylized facts arise, such as fat tailed distribution of returns and volatility clustering. Without <b>speculators,</b> the price follows a random walk; this implies that stylized facts arise {{because of the presence of}} <b>speculators.</b> Furthermore, if <b>speculators</b> abandon price taking behavior, stylized facts disappear. ...|$|R

5|$|This decree allowed {{someone who}} {{purchased}} {{a contract to}} void the contract with a payment of only 3.5 percent of the contract price (or about 1/30 the contract). Thus, investors bought increasingly expensive contracts. A <b>speculator</b> could sign a contract to purchase a tulip for 100 guilders. If the price rose above 100 guilders, the <b>speculator</b> would pocket the difference as profit. If the price remained low, the <b>speculator</b> could void the contract for only 3½ guilders. Thus, a contract nominally for 100 guilders, would actually cost an investor no more than 3½ guilders. In early February, as contract prices reached a peak, Dutch authorities stepped in and halted the trading of these contracts.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the behavior and performance of <b>speculators</b> and hedgers in 15 U. S. futures markets. We find that after controlling for market risk factors, <b>speculators</b> are contrarians, but respond positively to market sentiment.

We also find that trades of <b>speculators</b> (hedgers) are positively (negatively) correlated with subsequent abnormal returns; however, {{it does not appear}} that <b>speculators</b> possess superior forecasting power. Therefore, hedging pressure effects likely explain the negative relation between the performance of <b>speculators</b> and hedgers. The positive feedback trading by hedgers together with their negative performance suggests that hedgers have a destabilizing impact on futures prices. ...|$|R

This paper proposes an asset pricing model where two types of rational traders coexist: short-term <b>speculators</b> and long-term fundamentalists, both sharing the same information set. In this framework, excess volatility not only exists, but is actually fueled by fundamental trading. Actually, efficient markets are more volatile with a few <b>speculators</b> than with many <b>speculators.</b> Regulators should therefore be aware that efforts to limit speculation might, surprisingly, end up increasing volatility.

40|$|Why do <b>speculators</b> seem to wait {{with their}} {{speculative}} {{attack on a}} fixed exchange rate? In this paper we try {{to answer this question}} by extending the models of Krugman (1979) and Flood and Garber (1984) on balance of payments crises. We review their two-country model in discrete time, while taking a more explicit look at the incentives of <b>speculators.</b> We argue that their model implies that a fixed exchange rate regime can only survive as long as the fixed rate is equal to the equilibrium exchange rate. Consequently, their model does not explain why a currency can be overvalued before the attack and why in practice the currency is devalued after the attack with profits for <b>speculators</b> as a result. We discuss two potential causes for these stylized facts: costs of speculative trading and coordination problems among <b>speculators.</b> First, we show that speculation costs, for example because a Tobin tax is levied, is able to explain overvaluation and a jump in the exchange rate after the attack, although profits for <b>speculators</b> remain zero. Second, extending the model by adding identical countries enables us to explain the stylized facts, as coordination among <b>speculators</b> becomes important in order for a focal point to emerge. The coordination date - and therefore the degree of overvaluation, the size of the devaluation, and the resulting profits for <b>speculators</b> - is shown to depend on initial beliefs, the number of <b>speculators,</b> and the amount of strategies and financial funds they have...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies a {{plausible}} connection among rational <b>speculators,</b> {{exchange rate volatility}} and capital controls. When Krugman (1999) asserted {{that there should be}} appropriate controls on international capital movements to avoid currency volatilities from speculative activities, this paper shows whether to take capital controls depends on types of shocks and the risk preference of rational <b>speculators.</b> (1) If only current account shocks occur, the increase in the risk preference of rational <b>speculators</b> will decrease the conditional variance of exchange rates. In this case, the best policy is to let capitals freely move in the world. (2) If only interest rate shocks occur, the conditional variance of the exchange rate is monotonically increasing in the risk preference of rational <b>speculators.</b> Under such circumstance, the controls over international capital movements indeed decrease the exchange rate volatility. (3) When both current account and capital account shocks occur, then, if <b>speculators</b> are more risky, capital controls decrease exchange-rate volatility; however, if <b>speculators</b> are less risky, free capital movements can temper the exchange rates response to transitory shocks...|$|R
