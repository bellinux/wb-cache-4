In the North Sea, both ‘fixed shift’ (alternate day-shift and night-shift tours) and ‘swing-shift’ rotations (with a mid-tour shift change) are operated. The present study used survey data (N= 775) to examine sleep patterns over three ‘phases’ of the offshore work cycle (day shifts, DS; night shifts, NS; and leave weeks, LS) {{in relation to}} shift roster, overtime, age, offshoreshift work exposure, and anxiety. Specific predictions were tested in a mixed-model ANOVA in which DS, NS,and LS sleep were treated as repeated measures. Sleep duration and sleep quality were predicted by significant interactions of phase with roster, anxiety, age, and shift work exposure, but the patterns of findings differed across DS, NS and LS. Consistent with other published findings, personnel working two-week nights-to-days <b>swing</b> <b>shifts</b> reported shorter DS and NS sleep duration than those working fixed shifts.

40|$|Voltage sag {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} power quality problems challenging the utility industry. Voltage sags can be compensated for by voltage and power injection into the distribution system. By injecting voltage with a phase advance with respect to the sustained source-side voltage, reactive power can be utilized to help voltage restoration. Hence, the consumption of real power, from the perspective of the energy supply device, can be reduced. This energy-saving voltage injection comes at the expense of an increased voltage injection magnitude, load power <b>swing,</b> phase <b>shift,</b> and discontinuity of voltage wave-shape. For this reason, several proposed compensation strategies are examined, in terms of satisfying custom power while taking into consideration the capacity of the energy-storage device and the voltage injection constraint of dynamic voltage restorer.

Prior to depositing the organic semiconductors, the organosilanes were applied to the SiO 2 gate insulator from solution and form a self assembled monolayer (SAM).

The examination of the material suggests that the sentiments of sympathy and aversion which were plainly reflected in the early media coverage were to some extent replaced by articles and newscasts that framed the USA as an aggressor and as being a hazard to the world and world peace.

2500|$|In 2004, Miller {{orchestra}} bassist Herman [...] "Trigger" [...] Alpert {{explained the}} band's success: [...] "Miller had America's music pulse ... He knew what would please the listeners." [...] Although Miller had massive popularity, many jazz {{critics of the}} time had misgivings. They believed that the band's endless rehearsals—and, according to critic Amy Lee in Metronome magazine, [...] "letter-perfect playing"—diminished any feeling from performances. They also felt that Miller's brand of <b>swing</b> <b>shifted</b> popular music away from the [...] "hot jazz" [...] bands of Benny Goodman and Count Basie, and toward commercial novelty instrumentals and vocal numbers. For years, even after Miller died, the Miller estate maintained an unfriendly stance toward critics that derided the band during Miller's lifetime. Miller was often criticized for being too commercial. His answer, [...] "I don't want a jazz band." [...] Many modern jazz critics still harbor similar antipathy toward Miller. As recently as 1997 on a website administered by JazzTimes, Miller is listed {{as an example of}} an overrated jazz musician by Doug Ramsey. [...] "Miller was a businessman who discovered a popular formula from which he allowed little departure. A disproportionate ratio of nostalgia to substance keeps his music alive." [...] Jazz critics Gunther Schuller (1991), Gary Giddins (2004) and Gene Lees (2007) have separately defended the Miller orchestra for whatever deficiencies earlier critics have found. In an article written for The New Yorker in 2004, Gary Giddins says he feels that these early critics erred in denigrating Miller's music, and that the popular opinion of the time should hold greater sway. The article states: [...] "Miller exuded little warmth on or off the bandstand, but once the band struck up its theme, audiences were done for: throats clutched, eyes softened. Can any other record match 'Moonlight Serenade' for its ability to induce a Pavlovian slaver in so many for so long?" [...] Schuller, notes, [...] " [...] was nevertheless very special and able to penetrate our collective awareness that few other sounds have..." [...] He compares it partially to [...] "Japanese Gagaku [...] Hindu music" [...] in its purity. Schuller and Giddins do not take completely uncritical approaches to Miller. Schuller says that Ray Eberle's [...] "lumpy, sexless vocalizing dragged down many an otherwise passable performance." [...] However finally Schuller notes: [...] "How much further [...] musical and financial ambitions might have carried him must forever remain conjectural. That it would have been significant, whatever form(s) it might have taken, is not unlikely." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} the open challenge of plan-ning quasi-static walking motions for robots with kinematically redundant limbs. Focusing on RoboSimian, a quadrupedal robot {{developed by the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), we develop a practical method for generating statically stable walking motions by pre-computing a reduced dimensional inverse kinematics (IK) lookup table with certain uniqueness and smoothness properties. We then use that lookup table to generate IK solutions {{at the beginning and}} end of walking phases (e. g., <b>swing,</b> body <b>shift,</b> etc), and connect these waypoints using the Rapidly exploring Random Tree Connect (RRT-Connect) algorithm [1]. Thus, we avoid arbitrarily choosing an IK solution at the goal (that may turn out to be difficult to reach from the start) by setting this choice through design and use of a task-specific lookup table, which can be analyzed offline. Our approach also introduces a complementary formulation of the RRT-Connect configuration space that addresses contact and closure constraints by using the forward kinematics of one stance leg to determine the body pose while treating additional stance limbs as dependent on the body pose and solving their inverse kinematics with IK table lookup. We demonstrate an implementation of some of this framework on RoboSimian and discuss generalizations and extensions. I...|$|R
40|$|The native oxide at {{the surface}} of III-V nanowires, such as InAs, can be {{a major source of}} charge noise and {{scattering}} in nanowire-based electronics, particularly for quantum devices operated at low temperatures. Surface passivation provides a means to remove the native oxide and prevent its regrowth. Here, we study the effects of surface passivation and conformal dielectric deposition by measuring electrical conductance through nanowire field effect transistors treated with a variety of surface preparations. By extracting field effect mobility, subthreshold <b>swing,</b> threshold <b>shift</b> with temperature, and the gate hysteresis for each device, we infer the relative effects of the different treatments on the factors influencing transport. It is found that a combination of chemical passivation followed by deposition of an aluminum oxide dielectric shell yields the best results compared to the other treatments, and comparable to untreated nanowires. Finally, it is shown that an entrenched, top-gated device using an optimally treated nanowire can successfully form a stable double quantum dot at low temperatures. The device has excellent electrostatic tunability owing to the conformal dielectric layer and the combination of local top gates and a global back gate. Comment: 4 figures, 9 pages.

Methods: Eleven golfers and 12 control participants (all male; 66. 2 ± 6. 8 and 71. 3 ± 6. 6 yr old, respectively) were recruited. Duration of static single-leg stance was timed.

40|$|Ultra Narrow Band Modulation {{employs a}} phase detector, {{which is also}} {{responsive}} to amplitude levels if they are large enough. Typical of the phase detectors is the XOR gate, such as the 74 AC 86. This device has zero output if the incoming signals are in phase, and a shift to the maximum rail voltage if they are opposite in phase. Figure 1 shows the XOR gate used with an established phase reference. If the incoming signal is not in phase with the reference, the output is + 5 Volts. If the signal is in phase with the reference, the output is 0 Volts. If the signal is at 90 degrees relative to the reference, the output is 2. 5 volts. For any phase angle between 0 and 180 degrees, the level is directly proportional. For example, 45 degrees will have an output level of 1. 25 volts and a 135 degree angle will have an output level of 3. 75 Volts. Phase reversal keying and missing cycle keying of Ultra narrow band signals have a full 5 volt output <b>swing.</b> Phase <b>shift</b> keying (90 degree shifts) will have a 2. 5 volt peak output.
