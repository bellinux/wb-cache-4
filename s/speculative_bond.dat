40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{behavior}} of stock prices of individual firms with different bond ratings surrounding the October market crash of 1987 and therefrom make inferences {{about the significance of}} bankruptcy costs borne by stockholders. The key findings are as follows: Immediately following the crash, stock prices of firms with different bond ratings display dramatically divergent behavior. Specifically, stocks with <b>speculative</b> <b>bond</b> ratings exhibit significantly negative cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) in the wake of crash; the more speculative a firm’s bond is, the more negative is the CAR of the firm’s stock. Regression analysis confirms that there indeed exists a significantly negative relationship between the post-crash CARs and individual firms ’ bankruptcy risk proxied by their bond ratings, a variable that measures the likelihood of financial distress ex ante. These results indicate that the bankruptcy costs borne by stockholders are significant and investors recognize it as such, especially during a period of market turbulence. I...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that the stock market reacts negatively to bond rating downgrades and that downgrades tend to follow periods of negative returns, indicating that at least some downgrades are partially predictable. Hypothesizing that the reaction to a downgrade depends on both the implications for cash flows and the degree of surprise, we explore how the reaction to downgrade announcements varies across bond issues. We find that the equity market reacts much more negatively to bond rating downgrades to and within the <b>speculative</b> <b>bond</b> category than to downgrades within the investment grade category. Within the speculative category, the reaction is stronger, the lower the old and new ratings are. The reaction to multiple-level downgrades is not very different from that to single-level downgrades. The market reaction is also stronger if the firm has experienced negative pre-downgrade abnormal returns. Our evidence indicates that downgrades are viewed by the market as providing information on likely future earnings before interest charges, not just likely future interest charges.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{exposure}} of the U. S. corporate bond returns to stock market and treasury liquidity risk over the period 1973 to 2007. We find that the liquidity risk of investment grade and <b>speculative</b> grade <b>bond</b> returns is intrinsically distinct. While in-vestment grade bond returns rise when stock- or treasury bond-market become illiquid, the <b>speculative</b> grade <b>bond</b> returns fall substantially. Importantly, this liquidity risk is regime-switching in nature with the liquidity betas, especially of <b>speculative</b> grade <b>bonds,</b> rising to extremely high values during times of high macroeconomic stress, illiq-uidity and volatility.

40|$|What {{explains}} the wide swings in the default rate on high yield bonds in recent years? Differences in credit quality {{from year to}} year account for much of the observed variation in default rates, but economic conditions and the “age ” of bonds have also played a role. The market for high yield or speculative-grade bonds 1 has grown from $ 30 billion of outstanding bonds in 1980 to nearly $ 250 billion today. Over this period, the market has evolved from a collection of “fallen angels”—bonds that have lost their investment-grade rating—into an established capital market for raising funds. Although the high yield market is now mature, its behavior during business cycle downturns is not well understood. During the severe recessions of 1980 - 82, when the market was in its infancy, few issuers of <b>speculative</b> <b>bonds</b> defaulted on their obligations to creditors. By contrast, in the mild recession of 1990 - 91, the defaul...|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{reveal that}} {{investor}} sentiment has significant explanatory {{power in the}} cross-section of stock returns and bond yield spreads. However, little is known on how and why investor sentiment influence security prices. It is suggested that these sentiment effects in prices arise from liquidity: sentiment-prone investors demand (avoid) securities, especially distressed speculative issues, when sentiment is high (low) causing overvaluation (undervaluation). In this paper, we explore whether there exist systematic differences in bond liquidity based on prevailing sentiment, and, if so, whether such differences are more prominent for high-yield <b>speculative</b> <b>bonds.</b> Using an extensive sample of corporate bond transactions and based on six measures of liquidity, we report two key findings. First, based on almost all metrics, bond liquidity is significantly larger under low sentiment than under high sentiment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on credit enhancement (CE) of corporate bonds and firm value. The first essay presents the evidence that CE use is negatively associated with firm value and firms issuing debt with CEs underperform those without. Further evidence suggests that better investment opportunities and more debt use help alleviate the negative CE effect. The second essay examines the financial cost of using CE on corporate bonds. It shows that for investment grade bonds, CE on average inflates the bond yield spread by 23 basis points. In a sharp contrast, for <b>speculative</b> <b>bonds,</b> CE on average lowers the bond yield spread by 60 basis points. Further investigation reveals {{that the effect of}} CE is a joint effect of credit rating enhancement and increased expected equity idiosyncratic volatility. Finally, the third essay reports that the underperformance of a special type of credit enhancer, credit risk insurers (CRIs), during the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis is mainly attributed to the greater systemic risk of CRIs. It also shows the credit spreads of insured bonds increase significantly after their insurers are downgraded or put in the negative watch list. ...|$|R

European corporate bond market is mostly ignored in corporate bond liquidity literature and this thesis’ purpose is to contribute to literature by being among the first papers to estimate liquidity determinants with comprehensive European corporate bond data, covering both investment grade and speculative grade rating categories. DATA The corporate bond data is from years 2005 – 2009 covering all credit ratings. Corporate bond pricing, rating, and descriptive data is obtained from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The sample consists of euro denominated corporate bonds with the amount outstanding more than 250 million euros for investment grade bonds and 100 million for <b>speculative</b> grade <b>bonds.</b> The total number of unique bonds is 2589 bonds, with the total number of bond-years amounting to 7073. Bond bid and ask quotations, company level information, and macroeconomic data is obtained from Bloomberg. RESULTS The results indicate liquidity to be priced in the corporate bond yield spreads. Liquidity measures bid-ask spread and percentage of zero return days are capturing the liquidity effect for investment grade <b>bonds</b> effectively.

40|$|Non-default Component of Sovereign Emerging Market Yield Spreads and its Determinants: Evidence from Credit Default Swap Market. In this paper, I {{show that}} a sizable {{component}} of emerging market sovereign yield spreads is due to factors other than default risk such as liquidity. I estimate the non-default component of the yield spreads as the basis between the actual credit default swap (CDS) premium and the hypothetical CDS premium implied by emerging market bond yields. On average, the basis is large and positive for <b>speculative</b> grade <b>bonds</b> and slightly negative for investment grade bonds. Large positive basis for <b>speculative</b> grade <b>bonds</b> support the existence of speculation in the CDS market when the underling’s credit quality is bad. I {{study the effects of}} bond liquidity, liquidity in the CDS market, equity market performance and macroeconomic variables on the non-default component of the emerging market yield spreads. I show that bond liquidity has a significant and positive effect on the CDS-bond basis of investment grade bonds. The results suggest that the liquid bonds of investment grade bonds are more expensive relative to the prices implied their CDS premiums. However, the results are somewhat mixed and even contrary for the <b>speculative</b> grade <b>bond</b> sample. Emerging Market Local Currency Bond Market, Too Risky to Invest? Over the last decade, local currency emerging market (EM) debt has been developing to become an attractive and complementary investment category as many EM countries have been successful to reduce currency mismatches and maturity problems by implementing sound fiscal and monetary policies. Analyzing the period from 2002 to July 2009, we show that the local currency EM debt investments provide significant additional alpha and diversification to traditional bond portfolios. In particular, first, EM local currency bond returns are less correlated to the US stock market, treasury and high-yield bond markets, and global risk premia compared to the a case of EM equity and US dollar-denominated bond markets. Second, yields and excess returns on local currency debt depend largely on expected depreciation of the exchange rate against US dollar, while excess returns on dollar-denominated EM debt are for the most part compensation for bearing the global risk. Third, EM sovereign local currency bond returns beat other emerging and mature market asset classes by providing higher risk adjusted excess returns and diversification. In light of our findings, we suggest that the development of local currency bond markets in EM countries could contribute to global financial stability by reducing currency mismatches and reliance on foreign currency debt, which in turn is linked to growth and poverty reduction. Dynamic Sources of Sovereign Bond Market Liquidity. Using 482 US Dollar and Euro denominated bonds issued by 72 sovereigns, we examine the dynamic sources of time-series and cross-sectional variations in market-wide liquidity of sovereign bonds as a novelty in the sovereign fixed income literature. Vector autoregression analysis shows that macroeconomic fundamentals and the financial market variables play a substantial role in the movements of aggregate liquidity throughout the whole sample period (1999 - 2010), although their effects are stronger during the financial crisis. Specifically, US industrial production growth rate and inflation rate have significant informative powers on the sovereign bond market liquidity. An increasing shock to the TED spread (the spread between 3 -Month Libor and US T-bill), a measure of distrust in the banking system, has detrimental impact, while on the other side equity market performance is positively linked to market-wide bond liquidity. Furthermore, the direction of causality from the world financial and macroeconomic variables towards the aggregate bond market liquidity is confirmed by Granger causality tests. Finally, impulse response functions show that these relationships are persistent up to one-year forecast horizon...|$|R
