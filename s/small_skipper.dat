500|$|The male Lulworth skipper has a {{wingspan}} of , and {{the female}} 25 to 28mm. This makes it one of Britain's smallest butterflies and, in Europe, the smallest member of the Thymelicus genus. Of Britain's five [...] "golden" [...] skippers—the others being the silver-spotted skipper (Hesperia comma), large skipper (Ochlodes sylvanus), <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus sylvestris) and Essex skipper (Thymelicus lineola)—the Lulworth is both the smallest and darkest. Beyond its small size, it is distinguished particularly by its dark, dun-coloured wings that appear with tinges of olive-brown; this darkening especially apparent in males.|$|E
50|$|The <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus sylvestris) is a {{butterfly}} of the Hesperiidae family.|$|E
50|$|Skipperlings are {{butterflies}} in the subfamily Heteropterinae. With about 150 described species, {{this is one}} {{of several}} <b>smaller</b> <b>skipper</b> butterfly subfamilies.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} skipperling {{is smaller}} than the least skipper (it is also the <b>smallest</b> <b>skipper</b> in the United States) and {{the underside of the}} hindwing has a white ray which runs the width of the hindwing from the basal area to the margin.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} {{part of the}} medieval Royal Forest of Rockingham. It has diverse habitats, with hay meadows, parkland and recently planted woodland. There are many butterflies such as large <b>skippers,</b> orange-tips, <b>small</b> <b>skippers</b> and <b>small</b> coppers. Mammals include baders and red foxes.|$|R

50|$|Thymelicus hamza, the Moroccan <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> is a {{butterfly}} {{of the family}} Hesperiidae. It is found in North Africa and from Anatolia to Turkestan.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{butterflies}} are recorded which include <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> common blue, and there are local rarities such as grayling and brown argus reported.|$|E
50|$|These are <b>small,</b> brown <b>skippers</b> {{that have}} thin, {{translucent}} spots on their wings.|$|R
50|$|Pyrgus scriptura, the <b>small</b> {{checkered}} <b>skipper,</b> is {{a species}} of skipper (family Hesperiidae). It is found from the Texas to Montana, southeastern Alberta, and southwestern Saskatchewan.|$|R
50|$|Hesperilla crypsigramma, the <b>small</b> dingy <b>skipper</b> or wide-brand sedge-skipper, is a {{butterfly}} {{of the family}} Hesperiidae. It is found in Australia in New South Wales, Northern Territory and Queensland.|$|R
50|$|This is a <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> (wingspan 18-24 mm) {{with tiny}} white {{markings}} on dark brown wings. Very {{little is known}} about the ecology of this species and the larval food plant is unknown.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{the plant}} is an {{important}} source of food for the European goldfinch, honey bee, lime-speck pug moth, and the following butterflies: large skipper, meadow brown, small heath, painted lady, peacock, red admiral, small copper and <b>small</b> <b>skipper.</b>|$|E
50|$|Atalopedes campestris (called the sachem in the United States) is a <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> butterfly. It is {{just over}} 1 in long and has orange-and-brown adults. Females are {{slightly}} larger and have paler markings on their wings compared to males.|$|E
50|$|When sailing small {{dinghies}} (rather than keelboats), {{the crew}} hiking or trapezing - essentially {{hanging off the}} side - {{is an important factor}} in keeping the boat upright and sailing it fast. A tall sailor can get their centre of gravity further out, thus providing more righting moment. For example, in the 470 class, only the crew is on trapeze, so it is beneficial to have a taller crew and a <b>smaller</b> <b>skipper</b> (because the boat requires a light overall weight). Australia's top crew of Matt Belcher and Malcolm Page exemplify this at 1.7 m and 1.85 m respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{extensive}} landscaped {{gardens are}} popular with visitors throughout the year. The most visited areas include {{the rose garden}} and the dahlia garden, which contain many dozens of varieties. Out of season the spring garden and winter dell are famed nationally, particularly in February when the snowdrops first appear.The lawns of the South Park are mown less frequently and this allows the many wildflowers to flower and set seed. Over 50 species of wildflower have been recorded, including bee orchid, twayblade, pyramidal orchid and common spotted orchid. In mid-summer, there are large numbers of butterflies such as meadow brown, gatekeeper, <b>small</b> <b>skippers</b> and marbled whites.|$|R
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in strings on the stems of grasses where they remain over the winter. The Essex skipper's favoured foodplant is cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata), and it rarely uses the <b>small</b> <b>skipper's</b> favoured foodplant Yorkshire fog. Essex skippers' other foods include {{creeping}} soft grass (Holcus mollis), couch grass (Elymus repens), timothy-grass (Phleum pratense), meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum) and tor-grass (Brachypodium pinnatum). This skipper's caterpillars emerge {{in the spring and}} feed until June before forming shelters from leaves tied with silk {{at the base of the}} foodplant to pupate. Adults fly from July through August. Like most skippers, they are fairly strictly diurnal, though individuals are very rarely encountered during the night.|$|R
5000|$|Rough {{grassland}} {{with false}} oat-grass, Yorkshire fog, yarrow, cat's ear, with bracken {{at the south}} end. There is an uneven hedge of hawthorn and buckthorn. The sunny south-west aspect encourages butterflies including holly blue, Essex skipper and <b>small</b> <b>skipper.</b>|$|E
50|$|With a {{wingspan}} of 2.5 to 2.9 cm, it is {{very similar}} in appearance to the <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> Thymelicus sylvestris. They can be told apart by the undersides of the tips of their antennae: the Essex skipper's antennae are black, whereas those of the <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> are orange. This butterfly occurs {{throughout much of the}} Palaearctic region. Its range is from southern Scandinavia through Europe to North Africa and east to Central Asia It was only identified in the UK in 1889, and its range is expanding both in England and in northern Europe. In North America, this butterfly was accidentally introduced in 1910 via London, Ontario and has spread across southern Canada and into several northern US states.|$|E
50|$|Holcus lanatus in {{its natural}} habitat is a food source for {{butterflies}} such as the speckled wood, the wall, and especially the <b>small</b> <b>skipper.</b> It is rarely utilized by the Essex skipper. In its native range it may occur in plant associations such as the Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow habitat.|$|E
50|$|Semalea atrio, the <b>small</b> silky <b>skipper,</b> is a {{butterfly}} in the Hesperiidae family. It {{is found in}} Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, {{the eastern part of}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo and north-western Tanzania. The habitat consists of primary forests.|$|R
50|$|This {{and other}} Baccharis species are nectar sources {{for most of}} the predatory wasps, native <b>skippers</b> (<b>small</b> butterflies), and native flies in their ranges.|$|R
50|$|These <b>small</b> to {{medium-sized}} <b>skippers</b> are {{brown on}} the upperside and yellow brown on the underside. They have a yellow patch on the upperside forewing.|$|R
50|$|Insect life is also {{rich and}} varied, {{with more than}} 20 kinds of {{butterfly}} seen on the reserve, including ringlet, common blue, holly blue, peacock, red admiral, painted lady, green-veined white, comma, gatekeeper, <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> large skipper, meadow brown, purple hairstreak, small heath and small copper and, rarely, brimstone and clouded yellow. There {{is also a great}} variety of damselflies and dragonflies.|$|E
50|$|The {{north-eastern}} end has older {{monuments and}} is wooded with mature cedar and yew trees. Wildflowers include common knapweed and lady's bedstraw, while brambles and roses climb the tombs in wilder areas. The burial ground {{is a very}} good site for butterflies, such as gatekeeper, <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> and meadow brown. The south-western area is more managed with mown grass, and some graves have flowers.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} is of {{national}} importance due its rare Magnesian limestone geology. The wildflower meadows and grasslands are the favourable habitats for many butterflies, {{such as the}} large skipper, the <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> and the dingy skipper. Plants include Fragaria vesca (wild strawberry) and Blackstonia perfoliata (yellow-wort). Looking {{to the north and}} east, there are good views of the Cleadon Hills and the North Sea coast.|$|E
50|$|Service in Madras allowed Hopkins {{to pursue}} his {{interest}} in butterfly collecting. He sent a fellow-naturalist, Lieutenant-Colonel (later Brigadier) William Harry Evans, D.S.O., R.E., some specimens of a <b>small</b> Sarangesa (<b>skipper)</b> he had caught during the cold season at St. Thomas Mount in Madras, which were considered new to science and were ultimately described as Sarangesa hopkinsi, Evans 1921.|$|R
50|$|Tsitana, {{commonly}} called sylphs, is a genus of skippers {{in the family}} Hesperiidae are found primarily in Africa. These are <b>small</b> to medium-sized <b>skippers</b> that are primarily unmarked brown of the upperside wings. For other sylphs see genus Metisella.|$|R
50|$|Hamford Water is a 2185.8 ha {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest between Walton-on-the-Naze and Harwich in Essex. It {{is also a}} Ramsar site, a Special Protection Area, a Nature Conservation Review site, {{and most}} of it is a National Nature Reserve. Two <b>small</b> areas, <b>Skipper's</b> Island and John Weston Nature Reserve, are managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust. The largest island, Horsey Island, can be reached on foot at low tide across The Wade from Kirby-le-Soken.|$|R
50|$|Trombidium breei is {{a species}} of red mite in the genus Trombidium in the family Trombidiidae. It is found in Europe. The larvae are parasites/hosts of certain {{butterflies}} (Lepidoptera), particularly meadow brown (Maniola jurtina), gatekeeper (Pyronia tithonus), marbled white (Melanargia galathea), common blue (Polyommatus icarus) and <b>small</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus sylvestris). They attach themselves to the thorax or legs of the butterfly and transfer from host to host when the butterflies alight to nectar at flowers.|$|E
50|$|The Swettenham Meadows {{reserve is}} managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. It covers {{an area of}} 21.5 acres (8.6 ha) and its species-rich {{grassland}} is particularly ecologically important as this type of habitat represents only 0.15% of the total land area of Cheshire. Common spotted orchid and marsh orchid thrive in the wet flushes of this highly variable grassland. Other important species include <b>small</b> <b>skipper,</b> common blue, small copper and orange tip butterflies, kingfishers, amphibians, and various Odonata.|$|E
5000|$|The lake is {{the home}} or {{breeding}} area of many birds. Kentish plover, lesser short-toed lark, lesser kestrel, crane, gull-billed tern and great bustard are among the common birds of the lake [...] According to pre-1990 figures the number of birds of the lake exceed 76000. It has been speculated that the short wave transmitter station of Turkish Radio and Television Corporation which is situated north of the lake may reduce this number. [...] <b>Small</b> <b>skipper</b> is the common butterfly around the lake area ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} species of {{butterfly}} {{to be seen in}} the reserve. Most notable is the silver-studded blue, which remains very abundant in the area, having established a colony on the limestone. Other butterfly species include small blue (seen in May/June and July/August), chalkhill blue (seen in July), dark green fritillary and Adonis blue. Grassland species include dingy <b>skipper,</b> <b>small</b> and large <b>skipper,</b> ringlet, meadow brown and marbled white, while there are migrant species such as the painted lady and clouded yellow. Moth species include the day-flying species six-spot burnet, four-spotted moth and cinnabar, as well as the night flying species Portland ribbon wave, beautiful gothic and valerian pug. Some of the {{many species of}} birds seen at the reserve include warblers and other migrants such as the green woodpecker, raven, peregrine falcon and kestrel.|$|R
50|$|As the witty young Minnie in Gregory LaCava's pre-Code comedy Bed of Roses (1933), {{she plays}} a bawdy prostitute (along with Constance Bennett) fond of getting admiring men helplessly drunk before robbing them, at least until getting caught and tossed back into jail. Kelton has all the best lines, {{surprisingly}} wicked and amusing observations that would never be allowed in an American film after the Hollywood Production Code was adopted. The movie remains realistic {{in terms of the}} interactions of the characters and features an early turn by Joel McCrea as the leading man, a <b>small</b> boat <b>skipper</b> who pulls Bennett from the river after she dives to escape capture.|$|R
50|$|Birds of prey {{including}} short-eared owls and marsh harriers {{have also}} been seen hunting over the island. Mammals on the island include mice, voles and a stable population of around 29 hares. Common seals {{have also been}} spotted in the river around the island. Butterfly species commonly found on the island include <b>skippers,</b> <b>small</b> coppers, walls, meadow browns and gatekeepers.|$|R
