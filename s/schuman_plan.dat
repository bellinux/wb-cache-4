25|$|In December 1947 Bevin hoped (in vain) {{that the}} USA would support Britain’s “strategic, {{political}} and economic position in the Middle East”. In May 1950 Bevin told the London meeting of foreign ministers that “the United States authorities had recently seemed disposed to press us to adopt a greater measure of economic integration with Europe than we thought wise” (he {{was referring to the}} <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan</b> to set up the European Coal and Steel Community). In May 1950 he said that because of links with USA and the Commonwealth Britain was “different in character from other European nations and fundamentally incapable of wholehearted integration with them”.|$|E

500|$|In West Germany, Schuman {{kept the}} closest {{contacts}} with {{the new generation of}} democratic politicians. Karl Arnold, the Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, the state that included the coal and steel producing Ruhr, was initially spokesman for German foreign affairs. He gave a number of speeches and broadcasts on a supranational coal and steel community {{at the same time as}} Robert Schuman began to propose this Community in 1948 and 1949. The Social Democratic Party of Germany ( [...] , SPD), in spite of support from unions and other socialists in Europe, decided it would oppose the <b>Schuman</b> <b>plan.</b> Kurt Schumacher's personal distrust of France, capitalism, and Konrad Adenauer aside, he claimed that a focus on integrating with a [...] "Little Europe of the Six" [...] would override the SPD's prime objective of German reunification and thus empower ultra-nationalist and Communist movements in democratic countries. He also thought the ECSC would end any hopes of nationalising the steel industry and lock in a Europe of [...] "cartels, clerics and conservatives". Younger members of the party like Carlo Schmid, were, however, in favor of the Community and pointed to the long socialist support for the supranational idea.|$|E
500|$|The Common Assembly (which {{later became}} the European Parliament) was {{composed}} of 78 representatives and exercised supervisory powers over the executive High Authority. The Common Assembly representatives were to be national MPs delegated each year by their Parliaments to the Assembly or directly elected [...] "by universal suffrage" [...] (article 21), though in practice it was the former, as there was no requirement for elections until the Treaties of Rome and no actual election until 1979, as Rome required agreement in the Council on the electoral system first. However, to emphasise that the chamber was not a traditional international organisation composed of representatives of national governments, the Treaty of Paris used the term [...] "representatives of the peoples". The Assembly was not originally specified in the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan</b> because it was hoped the Community would use the institutions (Assembly, Court) of the Council of Europe. When this became impossible because of British objections, separate institutions had to be created. The Assembly {{was intended as a}} democratic counter-weight and check to the High Authority, to advise but also to have power to sack the Authority for incompetence, injustice, corruption or fraud. The first President (akin to a Speaker) was Paul-Henri Spaak.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1950, Churchill was {{strongly}} {{critical of the}} Attlee Government's failure to send British representatives to Paris (to discuss the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan</b> for setting up the European Coal and Steel Community), declaring that les absents ont toujours tort and calling it [...] "a squalid attitude" [...] which [...] "derange(d) the balance of Europe", and risked Germany dominating the new grouping. He called for world unity through the UN (against {{the backdrop of the}} communist invasion of South Korea), while stressing that Britain was uniquely placed to exert leadership through her links to the Commonwealth, the US and Europe. However, Churchill did not want Britain to actually join any federal grouping. In September 1951 a declaration of the American, French and British foreign ministers welcomed the <b>Schuman</b> <b>plan,</b> stressing that it would revive economic growth and encourage the development of a democratic Germany, part of the Atlantic community.|$|E
5000|$|When Robert <b>Schuman</b> {{launched}} his <b>plan</b> {{to create a}} common European market for coal and steel, Luxembourg was a party to this. On 18 April 1951, the Luxembourgish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Joseph Bech, signed the treaty setting up the European Coal and Steel Community, with his French, German, Italian, Belgian and Dutch colleagues. Even though, at the time, the French ambassador remarked that [...] "Luxembourg could not not join" [...] due to its lack of political clout on the international scene, the Luxembourgish government did not agree lightly to a scheme that put the main industry of the country under a supranational authority. After the war, the steel industry remained {{the driving force of}} the Luxembourgish economy. It employed a quarter of the active population, and provided almost two-thirds of the country's industrial production. During the negotiations, the Luxembourgish government succeeded in establishing the principle of the juridical equality of all the states, even the smallest, and in having Luxembourg being directly represented in the institutions of the ECSC, namely the High Authority and the Common Assembly.|$|R
2500|$|In 1945, Monnet {{proposed}} the Monnet Plan, {{also known as}} the [...] "Theory of l'Engrenage" [...] (not {{to be confused with the}} <b>Schuman</b> <b>plan).</b> It included taking control of the remaining German coal-producing areas and redirecting the production away from the German industry and into the French, thus permanently weakening Germany and raising the French economy considerably above its pre-war levels. The plan was adopted by Charles de Gaulle in early 1946.|$|E
2500|$|Papen {{published}} {{a number of}} books and memoirs, in which he defended his policies and dealt with the years 1930 to 1933 as well as early western Cold War politics. Papen praised the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan</b> as [...] "wise and statesmanlike" [...] and believed in the economic and military unification and integration of Western Europe. In 1952 and 1953, Papen published his memoirs in two volumes in Switzerland, in which he used much ink complaining about how unfair it all was that people blamed him for bringing Hitler to power, thus making him at least partly responsible for everything that happened in Germany between 1933 and 1945. Papen made the incredible claim in his memoirs that he did not bring Hitler to power as he was only negotiating with Hitler to save the Schleicher government, which somehow ended with Hitler becoming Chancellor and Papen Vice-Chancellor in the same cabinet through no fault of his own. Weinberg called Papen's 1952 memoir Der Wahrheit eine Gasse [...] "mostly fiction" [...] as Papen recounted in much detail his courageous career as an anti-Nazi resistance fighter who sabotaged Hitler's policies. Right up until his death in 1969, Papen often gave speeches and wrote articles in the newspapers defending himself against the charge that he had {{played a crucial role in}} having Hitler appointed Chancellor and that he had served a criminal regime, which led to vitriolic exchanges with West German historians, journalists and political scientists. Rolfs wrote that Papen was [...] "no match" [...] for his [...] "scholarly" [...] critics and [...] "...his [...] "amateurish and often erroneous rebuttals failed to alter his image". Rolfs wrote: [...] "Papen's last years are a tragic record of a man who professed to follow his own conscience, but refused to acknowledge his contribution to Hitler's totalitarian system. Although he completely rejected the Nazi ideology, his willingness to continue to serve Hitler weakened all of his protestations and criticisms of National Socialism". Franz von Papen died in Obersasbach, West Germany, on 2 May 1969 at the age of 89.|$|E
50|$|According to Professor Dr. Hans Ritschl, Schuman made {{a speech}} arguing that the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan</b> was really a {{continuation}} of the Monnet Plan, and that it was solely for the sake of supporting French steel exports that they had taken on that task.

5000|$|Konrad Adenauer, the German Chancellor, called Hallstein to Bonn, at the {{suggestion}} of Wilhelm Röpke, and in June 1950 he appointed him to head the German delegation at the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan</b> negotiations in Paris, which were to lead to the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community.Jean Monnet, the leader of the French delegation, and Hallstein drew up the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan,</b> which was the basis for the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established by the Treaty of Paris in 1951. The ECSC was to develop into the European Economic Community, and later the European Union.In August 1950, to general surprise, Hallstein was made head of the Office of Foreign Affairs (...) at the Federal Chancellery (...)

50|$|Evans {{made his}} maiden speech in June 1950 {{in support of}} the United Kingdom joining the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan,</b> but his main point was to call on the Labour Party to get back to idealism and internationalism and reject the 'economic nationalism' {{outlined}} by Chancellor of the Exchequer Stafford Cripps. He was re-elected in the 1951 general election with a much improved majority of 7,915 over Labour; the previous Liberal candidate had taken a job in Switzerland and his replacement could not get established.|$|E

He was subjected to press attack after the Klaus Fuchs Affair (March 1950) as Strachey was known to have been a communist sympathiser. He then denounced the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan,</b> which did not help his reputation. He had doubts about the Korean War but unlike Aneurin Bevan did not resign in April 1951.|$|E

5000|$|As a sequence, Jean Monnet, who {{has been}} {{described}} as the founder father and the chief architect of European Unity, announced the French <b>Schuman</b> <b>plan</b> of 9 May 1950, which led to the founding a year later of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The plan brought the reconciliation of France and Germany, the axis of political European integration, furthermore, the plan announced the proposal of a European army. This led to the signing of the treaty of the European Defence Community (EDC) in 1952. The main purpose of establishing such army was to create a [...] "European security identity", through closer Franco-German military and security cooperation.|$|E
50|$|As a playwright, Luscombe {{has written}} for the National Theatre Studio in London, the Royal Court Theatre (The One You Love) and Hampstead Theatre (The <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan).</b> All three of his Jane Austen adaptations (Northanger Abbey, Persuasion and Mansfield Park) have been {{produced}} in the UK, Northanger Abbey being revived in Chicago in 2013.

50|$|The French Steel Makers' Association (Chambre syndicale de la Sidérurgie) was reconstituted in December 1944 and Aubrun was {{appointed}} president.He played {{a leading role}} in organising the post-war reconstruction of the industry.Aubrun was made a commander of the Legion of Honour on 10 July 1947.He expressed strong concerns to Jean Monnet about whether Robert Schuman's plan for integration of the European coal and steel industry would {{meet the needs of the}} French steel makers.With his health failing, he made Pierre Ricard his deputy in 1952, and next year Ricard succeeded him as president of the chamber, while he retained the title of honorary president.Possibly Aubrun's opposition to the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan</b> hastened his departure.|$|E
5000|$|Historically {{the concept}} was {{introduced}} and made a concrete reality by Robert Schuman when the French Government agreed to the principle in the Schuman Declaration and accepted the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan</b> confined to specific sectors of vital interest of peace and war. Thus commenced the European Community system beginning with the European Coal and Steel Community. The six founder States (France, Italy, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) agreed on the goal: making [...] "war not only unthinkable but materially impossible". They agreed about the means: putting the vital interests, namely coal and steel production, under a common High Authority, subject to common democratic and legal institutions. They agreed on the European {{rule of law and}} a new democratic procedure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shift of}} France {{concerning}} Ruhr and German policy after the Second World War towards a [...] "communalization" [...] {{of the coal}} and steel industries, which was opened by the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan,</b> is explained by a cognitive process on the French side. France had gradually realized that their harsh Germany policy under the foreign minister Raymond Poincaré was ultimately {{the result of a}} personal vendetta, thus failing the ultimate goals of the French state. Another explanation of the shift in French attitudes {{can be found in the}} Marshall Plan. In order to finance their own reconstruction, France had to take part in the Westintegration of West Germany. France's participation in the [...] "Westintegration" [...] was laid down by the American policy of containment in particular.|$|E
5000|$|The Pleven Plan was a 1950 for an {{army for}} Western Europe. It never went into effect. The plan was {{proposed}} in October 1950 by the French premier René Pleven, drafted mainly by Jean Monnet {{to create a}} supranational European Army {{as part of a}} European Defence Community (EDC). [...] The EDC was to include West Germany, France, Italy, and the Benelux countries. The United States would be excluded. It was a competitor to NATO (in which the U.S. played the dominant role), with France playing the dominant role. Just as the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Plan</b> was designed to end the risk of Germany having the economic power to make war again, the Pleven Plan and EDC were meant to prevent the same possibility. The United Kingdom refused to join.|$|E
