Measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> contents were obtained from a flooding experiment and transformed into <b>water</b> <b>potentials.</b> Sum excedance values were calculated as the percentage of days on which different thresholds of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> were transgressed. Groundwater depth was mapped by drilling 30 groundwater holes and extrapolating the distances to the whole study area. Results: The vegetation was characterized by only six dominant or codominant species: Alhagi sparsifolia, Karelinia caspia, Populus euphratica, Tamarix ramosissima, Calligonum caput-medusae and Phragmites australis. The vegetation patterns encountered lacked any linear features typical of phreatophytes, thus not allowing direct conclusions on the type of the sustaining <b>water</b> sources. <b>Soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> never transgressed a threshold of pF 5 (- 10 MPa) in horizons above the capillary fringe during periods without inundation, thus representing water not accessible for plants. Depth to the groundwater ranged between 2. 3 and 17. 5 m among plots and varied between 1. 7 and 8. 0 m within a plot owing to dune relief. The seven main vegetation types showed distinct niches of groundwater depths, corresponding to the observed concentric arrangement of vegetation types around the oasis. Conclusions: Inundation by flooding and unsaturated soil moisture are irrelevant for the foreland vegetation water supply. Although distances to the groundwater table can reach about 20 m, which is exceptionally large for phreatophytes, groundwater is the only water source for all vegetation types in the oasis foreland. In consequence, successful maintenance of oasis foreland vegetation will crucially depend on providing non-declining ground water tables...|$|R
