6000|$|Charles {{was less}} complimentary. [...] "You fool," [...] he answered, with that {{unpleasant}} frankness {{which is much}} too common with him. [...] "Supposing it is, why on earth <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> knock it off and disclose him? What good would it have done? If it is a wig, and we spot it, that's all that we need. We are put on our guard; we know with whom we have now to deal. But you can't take a man up {{on a charge of}} wig-wearing. The law doesn't interfere with it. Most respectable men may sometimes wear wigs. Why, I knew a promoter who did, and also the director of fourteen companies! What we have to do next is, wait till he tries to cheat us, and then--pounce down upon him. Sooner or later, you may be sure, his plans will reveal themselves." ...|$|E
60|$|Worldly people say--and say openly, just now--that this {{prayer is}} all a dream. They say God will not stir up men's wills to do good any more than to do harm. He leaves men to {{themselves}} to get through life as they can. This Heavenly Father of whom you speak will not give His holy spirit to those who ask Him. He does not, as one of your Collects says, put into men's minds good desires--they come to a man entirely from outside a man, from his early teaching, his youthful impressions, {{as they are called}} now-a-days. He does not either give men grace and power to put these desires into practice. That depends entirely on the natural strength of a man's character; and that, again, depends principally on the state of his brain. So, says the world, if you wish your own character to improve, you must improve it yourself, for God will not improve it for you. But, after all, why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> improve? why not be content to be just what you are? you did not make yourself, and you are not responsible for being merely what God has chosen to make you.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{foreword}} to her 1971 fairy-tale anthology, A Choice of Magic, Manning-Sanders writes: There {{can be no}} new fairy tales. They are {{records of}} the time when the world was very young; and never, in these latter days, can they, or anything like them, be told again. <b>Should</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> invent a new fairy tale you will not succeed: the tale rings false, the magic is spurious. For the true world of magic is ringed round with high, high walls that cannot be broken down. There is but one little door in the high walls which surround that world - the little door of [...] "once upon a time and never again." [...] And so it must suffice that we can enter through that little door into the fairy world and take our choice of all its magic.|$|E
