40|$|We {{describe}} how {{to generate a}} longitudinal brightness map for a tidally locked exoplanet from its phase function light curve. We operate under a number of simplifying assumptions, neglecting limb darkening/brightening, star <b>spots,</b> <b>detector</b> ramps, as well as time-variability over a single planetary rotation. We develop the transformation from a planetary brightness map to a phase function light curve and simplify the expression for {{the case of an}} edge-on system. We introduce two models— composed of longitudinal slices of uniform brightness, and sinusoidally varying maps, respectively— which greatly simplify the transformation from map to light curve. We discuss numerical approaches to extracting a longitudinal map from a phase function light curve, explaining how to estimate the uncertainty in a computed map and how to choose an appropriate number of fit parameters. We demonstrate these techniques on a simulated map and discuss the uses and limitations of longitudinal maps. The sinusoidal model provides a better fit to the planet’s underlying brightness map, although the slice model is more appropriate for light curves which only span a fraction of the planet’s orbit. Regardless of which model is used, we find that there is a maximum of ∼ 5 free parameters which can be meaningfully fit based on a full phase function light curve, due to the insensitivity of the latter to certain modes of the map. This is sufficient to determine the longitudes of primary equatorial hot-spots and cold-spots, as well as the presence of secondary maxima/minima.

According the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, {{more than}} 826, 000 {{vehicles}} in North America {{are involved in}} lane-change accidents each year [1]. Although the fatality rate is low compared to other types of accidents, the extent of property damage and injury are high. This has therefore remained a cause of concern to the public. There are a few preventive devices that employ radar sensors have been advertised to use as blind <b>spot</b> <b>detectors,</b> {{but none of them}} looks promising or is commercially available to the automobile industry. Automakers have been longing to introduce their vehicles equipped with high-tech systems that can see beyond the driver's peripheral vision - the dangerous blind spots. This project introduces a simple and inexpensive Optical Blind Spot Detection System (OBSDS) that is designed to assist drivers to consistently monitor the ???No Zones??? known as blind spots. The system uses a pair of infrared sensors to detect vehicles approaching the blind spots from the adjacent lanes and alert the driver with visual and audio signals before he or she proceeds on a lane change. The Optical Blind Spot Detection System was successfully designed and tested on a passenger vehicle. The maximum distance of detection is two meters. This range can be increased by adding more powerful infrared sensors to the circuit. Another good application of the OBSDS is for parallel parking. In this case, the system is used as an aid for detecting the distance between the bumpers of a vehicle and any objects behind it. The distances can be understood from the combination of the visual and audio alerts. With the addition of a motion detector circuit, the OBSDS {{can also be used to}} detect the present of pedestrians at intersection traffics.

40|$|Lane change {{collision}} avoidance systems (CAS) {{are designed to}} prevent crashes in lane change maneuvers by alerting the driver to hazards in the adjacent lanes of traffic. These systems detect surrounding vehicles {{that are on the}} sides and behind the vehicle, notify the driver through warning signals, e. g., a visual symbol in the side or rear view mirrors, and have the potential to reduce the fatalities and injuries associated with these collisions. Currently, these systems are being introduced into new vehicles; however, test data of driver performance using them remain limited. The objective of this research is to examine driver behavior using lane change CAS to determine what leads to the safest driver behavior and to investigate if the use of a lane change CAS with only a proximity warning system (i. e., blind <b>spot</b> <b>detector)</b> provides sufficient warning to drivers.

40|$|Underwater Video <b>Spot</b> <b>Detector</b> (UVSD) is a {{software}} package designed to analyze underwater video for continuous spatial measurements (path traveled, {{distance to the}} bottom, roughness of the surface etc.) Laser beams of known geometry are often used in underwater imagery to estimate {{the distance to the}} bottom. This estimation is based on the manual detection of laser spots which is labor intensive and time consuming so usually only a few frames can be processed this way. This allows for spatial measurements on single frames (distance to the bottom, size of objects on the sea-bottom), but not for the whole video transect. We propose algorithms and {{a software}} package implementing them for the semi-automatic detection of laser spots throughout a video which can significantly increase the effectiveness of spatial measurements. The algorithm for spot detection is based on the Support Vector Machines approach to Artificial Intelligence. The user is only required to specify on certain frames the points he or she thinks are laser dots (to train an SVM model), and then this model is used by the program to detect the laser dots {{on the rest of the}} video. As a result the precise (precision is only limited by quality of the video) spatial scale is set up for every frame. This can be used to improve video mosaics of the sea-bottom. The temporal correlation between spot movements changes and their shape provides the information about sediment roughness. Simultaneous spot movements indicate changing distance to the bottom; while uncorrelated changes indicate small local bumps. UVSD can be applied to quickly identify and quantify seafloor habitat patches, help visualize habitats and benthic organisms within large-scale landscapes, and estimate transect length and area surveyed along video transects...|$|E
