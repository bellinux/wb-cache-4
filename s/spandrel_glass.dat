25|$|Huddersfield is a {{manufacturing}} town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced woollen textiles. This area of business, {{along with the}} chemical and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was {{the basis of the}} town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of woollen products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making alternating current electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just £300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of £4,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley. Other local manufacturers are Cummins Turbo Technologies, founded in 1952 as Holset by Messrs. Holmes and Croset. (turbochargers), David Brown Gear systems (industrial gearing), Huddersfield Fine Worsteds (textiles), Taylor & Lodge (textiles), C & J Antich (textiles), Syngenta AG (agro-chemicals), Pennine Radio Limited (electronics transformers and sheet metalworking) and a large number of niche manufacturers, such as Dual Seal Glass (maker of <b>spandrel</b> <b>glass</b> panels) and Ellis Furniture (producer of kitchen and bathroom furniture). Huddersfield is home to Andrew Jones Pies, a regional award-winning pie-maker, where a worker was killed in a gas explosion on 10 April 2009. and Mamas and Papas – a manufacturer and retailer of prams, pushchairs and related items.|$|E
5000|$|Back painted {{glass is}} {{any form of}} clear glass that is painted from the back side and viewed from the front side, or [...] "first surface" [...] side. Back painted glass is widely used for {{architectural}} <b>spandrel</b> <b>glass,</b> colored glass walls for interior glazing, colored glass back splashes, glass markerboards and dry erase boards, colored glass counter tops, shower walls, artistic glass, auto glass, marine glass, aero space glass, and more. Back painted glass is a modern alternative to other surfacing materials such as tiles and laminates in the world's decorative and architectural industries.|$|E
50|$|In a {{building}} {{with more than}} one floor, the term spandrel is also used to indicate the space between the top of the window in one story and the sill of the window in the story above. The term is typically employed when there is a sculpted panel or other decorative element in this space, or when the space between the windows is filled with opaque or translucent glass, in this case called <b>spandrel</b> <b>glass.</b> In concrete or steel construction, an exterior beam extending from column to column usually carrying an exterior wall load is known as a spandrel beam.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by Grimshaw Architects and {{developed}} by Minerva plc with Skanska as main contractor, the Building is notable {{for the blue}} <b>glass</b> <b>spandrels,</b> pre-fabricated escape cores and a central atrium dominated by a steel structure on which a ThyssenKrupp [...] "TWIN" [...] lift system [...] runs 16 lifts on eight tracks, a rare solution in the UK. The building's creative use of structural steel has been awarded by industry bodies.|$|R
50|$|The {{courthouse}} is {{an excellent}} example of Art Deco architecture, which incorporated sleek Modern forms while retaining ornate yet stylized decorative elements. The architects utilized high-quality materials on both the interior and exterior. The walls rest on a Bethel White granite base and are faced with Vermont Eureka marble above the water table. The building is built around two light courts that admit natural light into the interior. Vertical bands of windows with aluminum muntins emphasize the height of the five-story building. Black structural <b>glass</b> <b>spandrels</b> separate the windows on the facade.|$|R
50|$|Glass {{may be used}} {{which is}} transparent, {{translucent}}, or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. Transparent glass usually refers to vision glass in a curtain wall. <b>Spandrel</b> or vision <b>glass</b> may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes. Opaque glass is used in areas to hide a column or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through shadow box construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission {{designated}} Lever House as {{an official}} landmark. By that time, however, much of Lever House's original brilliance had been dimmed by time. The building's blue-green glass facade deteriorated due to harsh weather conditions and {{the limitations of the}} original fabrication and materials. Water seeped behind the stainless steel mullions causing the carbon steel within (and around) the glazing pockets to rust and expand. This corrosion bowed the horizontal mullions and broke most of the <b>spandrel</b> <b>glass</b> panels. By the mid-1990s, only one percent of the original glass remained leaving the once glimmering curtain wall a patchwork of mismatched greenish glass.|$|E
5000|$|It {{consists}} of a 36-story tower and 13-story annex. It {{is one of the}} towers in a complex of five structures, anchored by two towers. The facades are constructed of unpolished rose-granite panels with punched aluminum framed and fixed in-place window openings. Windows are a take on tripartite windows but whose lunettes, or arched portions, are fake. A portion of both towers {{consists of}} an aluminum framed curtain wall system with a combination of reflective vision glass and <b>spandrel</b> <b>glass.</b> Elaborate classical lighting fixtures are located on exterior. [...] The building's crown {{consists of a}}n octagonal-based pyramid surrounded by a ring rising out of the tower and partially up the pyramid. This crown is illuminated at night.|$|E
50|$|By far {{the most}} common glazing type, glass can be of an almost {{infinite}} combination of color, thickness, and opacity.For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are 1/4 inch (6 mm) monolithic and 1 inch (25 mm) insulating glass. Presently, 1/4 inch glass is typically used only in spandrel areas, while insulating glass {{is used for the}} rest of the building (sometimes <b>spandrel</b> <b>glass</b> is specified as insulating glass as well). The 1 inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a 1/2 inch (12 mm) airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some inert gases, such as argon or krypton may be used to offer better thermal transmittance values. In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are 1/8 inch (3 mm) monolithic and 5/8 inch (16 mm) insulating glass. Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, relative humidity, or sound transmission requirements, such as laboratory areas or recording studios.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is of reinforced concrete construction, and was {{state of the}} art in its construction methods at the time - being clad with a curtain wall in opaque dark green <b>glass</b> <b>spandrel</b> panels framed by orange metal uprights. With its original commercial use in mind it featured an advanced elevator system for its day - four Otis Autotronic gearless lifts (also used in St. Andrew House on Sauchiehall Street) which were capable of responding to the traffic flow within the building at specific times of the day. The {{building is}} electrically heated and was also intended to feature a restaurant on the ground floor which the University later turned into a student refectory.|$|R
5000|$|Partners Leon Moed and Raul de Armas {{founded the}} firm in 1991 after leaving their {{positions}} as senior partners at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Dan Shannon, an associate at SOM, joined Moed de Armas Architects at its founding. In 1997, {{he became a}} partner and the firm {{changed its name to}} Moed de Armas & Shannon. Mike Zaborski joined the firm in 1998 and became a partner in 2012. The firm officially changed its name to MdeAS Architects in October 2014.They have jointly completed 510 Madison Avenue, Gotham Center, the rejuvenation of the GM Building Plaza, and the redevelopments of 100 Park Avenue and 330 Madison Avenue. The firm also designed a <b>glass</b> <b>spandrel</b> system to replace the deteriorating marble façade of Canada's tallest building, First Canadian Place [...] in Toronto.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{specific}} {{building permit}} records {{have not been}} located, it appears that during its approximately 50 year tenancy, the J.Newberry Co. installed various improvements/alterations with significant alterations {{that appear to be}} circa 1950 and circa 1990. The circa 1950 alterations include the installation of terrazzo flooring, installation of corner entrance and exterior canopy, and installation of the structural <b>glass</b> <b>spandrel</b> panel. A number of these alterations are visible in photographs from the 1960s and 1970s. These photographs also indicate that the neighboring building on S. Broadway (445 S. Broadway) was also part of the Newberry's store. In a 1952 building permit, the owners of 445 S. Broadway were granted permission to [...] "construct ramp and steps into Metropolitan building". This record may mark the date that the neighboring building were connected although the openings are also depicted in the circa 1950 Sanborn map noted previously. The circa 1990 alterations may include the addition of the food court space and the opening {{between the first and second}} floors.|$|R

2500|$|The {{residential}} {{tower was}} to be 42½ storeys tall consisting of one and two bedroom apartments with penthouse suites on the upper floors. It will be [...] tall, becoming the second tallest building in the city, behind the BT Tower, and the tallest residential tower in the city. The tower is slender and the curvature of the façade will respond to the changing effects of daylight. It will be covered in anodised aluminium panels, glass and polished concrete. The anodised aluminium sills will project [...] from the building. The service area will be concealed by fritted <b>glass</b> <b>spandrel</b> panels, which will also accommodate the extract vents. The columns will rise from a polished concrete base on the ground floor. The top two floors will be surrounded by a light-weight perforated metal screen. There will be a total of 332 apartments in the tower, 10% of which shall be designed to be wheelchair accessible. There will be a single central core containing lifts and stairs. The apartments will be sold on 125 year leases.|$|R
50|$|The main {{portion of}} the {{building}} is 60 ft by 65 ft by 35 ft. Upstairs about 32 ft by 60 ft was reserved {{for use by the}} Oddfellows, and there is a large kitchen and other rooms. The downstairs area is divided into three units and was intended for, and is still used for, retail space. While lower portions of the front façade have been remodeled (including covering bricks by stucco), the upper portion was mostly unchanged from the original, as of 1978, besides having been painted. It had four-over-four lights/windows and has parapets above, with finials that were added at some date after original construction. Photos from c.1890, 1976, and 2011 show upper windows substantially the same; both upper and lower sashes were moveable as of 1978. The sides and rear of the building remained unpainted. Two extensions to the rear had been added. In the lower portion, there originally was an arch (perhaps over the door?) which had a <b>glass</b> <b>spandrel</b> area, which has been filled, and the windows have been changed.|$|R
50|$|David Childs of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill {{worked in}} {{conjunction}} with glass artist and designer James Carpenter to create a design that uses ultra-clear, low-iron glass to provide reflectivity and light, with stainless-steel <b>spandrels</b> behind the <b>glass</b> to help reflect sunlight. Stainless steel used in the building façade is molybdenum-containing Type 316, which provides improved resistance to corrosion. To enclose the power substation and improve its aesthetics, {{the base of the}} building has a curtain wall with stainless steel louvers that provide ventilation for the machinery. During the day, the curtain wall reflects light, while at night it is illuminated with blue LED lights. The curtain wall around the lobby uses heavily laminated, heat-strengthened glass that meets high standards for blast resistance. At night, a large cube of light above the lobby also emanates blue light, while during the day it provides white light to the lobby, and at dusk it transitions to violet and back to blue. Inside the main lobby, artist Jenny Holzer created a large light installation with glowing text moving across wide plastic panels. The entire wall, which is 65 ft wide and 14 ft tall, changes color according to the time of day. Holzer worked with Klara Silverstein, the wife of Larry Silverstein, to select poetry for the art installation. The wall is structurally fortified as a security measure.|$|R
50|$|The J. Marvin Jones Federal Building is a three story {{concrete}} structure {{with a full}} basement, notable for the straightforwardness and simplicity of its planning and expression. Rectangular in plan, regular and symmetrical in elevation, it combines an organization derived from Classical or Renaissance Revival architecture with details drawn from the Modernistic style of its date of creation. The thirteen bay principal elevation faces Courthouse Square with regularly spaced windows cut into {{the plane of the}} light buff limestone clad wall. With a limestone spandrel {{at the level of the}} second floor itself, these set-back windows give a rhythm to the primary wall surface that allows it to read like pilasters marching along the facades. Two entries, symmetrically placed in the slightly wider second and twelfth bays, are identified with fluted pilasters that flank the doors and extend vertically approximately forty feet to the head of the third floor windows. On the south-facing elevation as well as the east and west facades the second and third floor windows are combined into a single unit with a <b>glass</b> <b>spandrel</b> window over the intermediate floor structure. Pilasters with simplified capitals rise alongside each jamb from the second story window sills to the heads of the third floor windows. This expression produces the appearance of a two-story building with a principal, upper floor of grander purpose, that of the double-height District Courtroom.|$|R
5000|$|Built for a workers' {{cooperative}} by {{that name}} and designed to house shops, storage for products and a dental clinic as well as offices, the De Volharding (Persistence) Building (1927 - 28) is De Stijl or cubistic in conception, influenced also by Russian Constructivism, and clad entirely in glass. A light tower rises from the roof above a large sign which bore {{the name of the}} cooperative; these are in white, yellow and blue glass, the blue extending downwards to form a divider between the lift tower and the staircase tower, which consist of glass bricks, as does the strip above the ground-floor windows. The remainder of the façade consists of ribbon windows separated by opal <b>glass</b> <b>spandrels,</b> which can be reached from gangways and had lettering mounted behind the glass advertising the benefits of membership. In response to the client's requirement that he include as much advertising space as possible, Buijs designed a building the entirety of which advertised both the organisation and the cooperative movement itself. It was [...] "a city-scale luminescent sculpture", an internationally famous example of architecture of the night, [...] "probably the most frequently cited example for the potential applications of a future 'light architecture' in 1920s Europe", referred to in 1935 as [...] "the most famous of all luminous buildings". However, it was criticised by some in the modern movement for combining expressionist elements and thus not being entirely devoid of ornamentation.|$|R
