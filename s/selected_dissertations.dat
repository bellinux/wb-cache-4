40|$|Abstract Graduate {{students}} {{are usually not}} sure of the appropriate tense to use in each rhetorical section of their dissertations in their disciplines. Even style guides provide little information regarding tense usage in academic texts. This paper describes a study in which frequency and usage of types of tense were compared in <b>selected</b> <b>dissertations</b> from the humanities and sciences drawn from Kenyan Public Universities. It was found that graduate research students in both humanities and sciences preferred the simple present and simple past as primary tense forms. It also emerged that authors have to alternate verb tenses even in the same rhetorical section of a dissertation to achieve particular communicative purposes. Suggesting that choices for tense in dissertations are a function of the epistemology and ideology of the disciplines, the paper proposes a genre-based approach to teaching those preparing to write their dissertations...|$|E

40|$|Context: There {{is a need}} to {{evaluate}} the quality of postgraduate dissertations of dentistry submitted to university {{in the light of the}} international standards of reporting. Aims: We conducted the review with an objective to document the use of sampling methods, measurement standardization, blinding, methods to eliminate bias, appropriate use of statistical tests, appropriate use of data presentation in postgraduate dental research and suggest and recommend modifications. Settings and Design: The public access database of the dissertations from Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences was reviewed. Subjects and Methods: Three hundred and thirty-three eligible dissertations underwent preliminary evaluation followed by detailed evaluation of 10 % of randomly <b>selected</b> <b>dissertations.</b> The dissertations were assessed based on international reporting guidelines such as strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE), consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT), and other scholarly resources. Statistical Analysis Used: The data were compiled using MS Excel and SPSS 10. 0. Numbers and percentages were used for describing the data. Results: The “in vitro” studies were the most common type of research (39 %), followed by observational (32 %) and experimental studies (29 %). The disciplines conservative dentistry (92 %) and prosthodontics (75 %) reported high numbers of in vitro research. Disciplines oral surgery (80 %) and periodontics (67 %) had conducted experimental studies as a major share of their research. Lacunae in the studies included observational studies not following random sampling (70 %), experimental studies not following random allocation (75 %), not mentioning about blinding, confounding variables and calibrations in measurements, misrepresenting the data by inappropriate data presentation, errors in reporting probability values and not reporting confidence intervals. Few studies showed grossly inappropriate choice of statistical tests and many studies needed additional tests.

VP 7 gene of bluetongue virus serotype 4 was expressed in E. coli. Using phage display technology, anti-VP 7 st 4 scFvs were selected from a chicken scFv library (Nkuku®) following different panning strategies. Polyclonal phage ELISA showed that VP 7 st 4 -specific scFvs were enriched after three rounds of panning. Six different scFvs (A 1, H 2, TA 8, TC 9, TD 12 and SA 12) were identified by sequence analysis. Stability of these scFvs was determined by incubation at different temperatures and after several freeze/thaw cycles. The scFvs were also tested in an inhibition ELISA. Inhibition with an anti-bluetongue virus guinea pig serum resulted in a 30 % decrease in ELISA signal of A 1. No inhibition was obtained with the rest of the scFvs when guinea pig and sheep serum were used. An anti-bluetongue virus chicken IgY inhibited the scFvs by 50 % to 86 %. A fragmented-gene library displaying peptides of VP 7 st 4 was constructed. The library was subjected to three rounds of affinity selection against the anti-VP 7 st 4 scFvs. Enrichment of clones specific to each scFv was observed. The clones were identified by sequence analyses. The regions on VP 7 st 4 to which the scFvs bind could not be identified since no duplicate clones were <b>selected.</b> <b>Dissertation</b> (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

40|$|Practically speaking, a well-conducted {{review of}} {{literature}} is central to a scholar’s ability to pose pertinent and timely questions within their field. As part of the culminating written assessment of a Ph. D. candidate, the dissertation literature review provides a unique vantage point to explore future scholars’ preparation. In spite of its central role within the research process, research about how future scholars are taught the doctoral competencies necessary to conduct {{a review of the}} literature for the dissertation or how the dissertation literature reviews are assessed is limited. In two separate studies, this research uses the Boote and Beile’s Literature Review Scoring Rubric as a framework to explore the textbooks used in the early stages of doctoral education and the quality of dissertation literature reviews from a field of education research. In the first study, seven of the top selling education research methods textbooks from 2010 were analyzed to determine how well they cover the 12 performance criteria on the rubric. While the results were varied, the majority of textbooks were not adequate in their coverage of the performance criteria identified by Boote and Beile. In short, the materials used to prepare doctoral students may not be equal to conveying critical components of the literature review. Efforts were then devoted to a replication study of exploring the end results of doctoral training and preparation. In the second study, the Literature Review Scoring Rubric was used to assess the quality of 30 randomly <b>selected</b> <b>dissertation</b> literature reviews from Instructional Technology. The scores of the dissertation literature reviews were also varied.

40|$|When testing nine {{different}} sunflower cultivars in 32 South African environments (location x year), an Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction analysis (AMMI) identified sizeable genotype by environment (GxE) interaction. The first two Interaction Principal Components Axes (IPCA 1 and IPCA 2) were highly significant (p< 0. 001), {{but all the}} factors responsible for the GxE interaction could not be identified, as the causes of interaction seems to be of complex nature. IPCA 1 captured 34 % of the interaction SS with only 15. 3 % of the degrees of freedom, while IPCA 2 captured 22. 5 % of the interaction SS with 14. 5 % of the degrees of freedom. This indicates that the AMMI 2 model fits the data well and is parsimonious. Both cultivars and environments grouped together in quadrants according to their length of season when their respective IPCA 1 and IPCA 2 scores were plotted against each other. Environments from the warmer dry Western and Northern regions, including the Dry Highveld Grassland, Northern Arid and Central Bushveld, grouped in opposite quadrants, 1 and 3, while environments from the cooler moist Eastern regions, including the Moist Highveld Grassland grouped in opposite quadrants, 2 and 4. The factors responsible for the division between quadrants 1 and 3, {{as well as those}} responsible for the division between quadrants 2 and 4 could not be identified. The long-season cultivars were better adapted to the Northern and Western environments, while the medium-season cultivars were better adapted to the Eastern environments. Each quadrant was dominated by a different cultivar. Because the environments and cultivars could not be sufficiently described according to the factors responsible for the observed GxE interaction, cultivars can not be advised for specific environments. It is therefore presently recommended that cultivars which are more widely adapted to South African conditions, be <b>selected.</b> <b>Dissertation</b> (MSc (Genetics)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|In 2014 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) {{implemented}} a risk adjustment program to stabilize premiums and neutralize premiums {{in the individual}} health insurance marketplace. This dissertation will {{examine the impact of}} the ACA risk adjustment program on adverse selection for one insurer during 2014. This study utilized enrollment and claims data for one insurer and employs graphical analysis to test for adverse selection. Previous studies have been unable to utilize actual insurer data to test for adverse selection in under the ACA risk adjustment program. Until the implementation of the ACA, insurers relied on underwriting methods to avoid being adversely selected. The ACA has removed the underwriting model by requiring insurers to move to a community rated model for pricing plans. This approach, along with risk adjustment was intended, by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to attract insurers to participate in the individual health insurance marketplaces. Unfortunately, not all states enjoyed a large contingent of participating insurers which consequently had a dramatic financial impact on certain insurers being adversely <b>selected.</b> This <b>dissertation</b> discusses the potential drivers of adverse selection.

40|$|South Africa relies {{significantly}} {{on the use}} of non-renewable {{resources to}} generate its electricity requirements. The release of carbon dioxide and other harmful gasses during the process of electricity generation has a negative impact on the quality of human and animal health and wellbeing. The South African renewable energy sector is currently in its infancy in comparison to the global renewable energy sector. A brief analysis and comparison of the renewable energy sectors of the other countries <b>selected</b> in this <b>dissertation</b> (i. e. Brazil, China and India) will be performed to highlight the common challenges in these countries in an effort to demonstrate the relevance and importance of the tax and limited related incentives to assist in reducing these challenges and increase the use of renewable energy resources in electricity power plants. Once the relevance and importance of tax and related incentives are highlighted, this dissertation analyses and examines the specific tax incentives available to enterprises operating in the renewable energy sector in South Africa, India, China and Brazil. Based on the analysis, recommendations and/or enhancements to the current corporate tax incentives available in South Africa will be discussed in detail. This dissertation will also discuss whether any of the recommendations and/or enhancements could be incorporated into the existing South African Special Economic Zones Act. As there are 108 solar and wind energy power plant being constructed in Brazil, but no significant corporate tax incentives currently available to qualifying taxpayers, the regulatory policy setting out the renewable energy targets and how it will be achieved is an important consideration. It was found that if there were periodic updates to the regulatory policy and it was mandatory for electricity utility companies (such as Eskom) to ensure that there is a mix between renewable energy and non-renewable energy sources based on the regulatory policy, it would ensure that the delays currently being experienced in the expansion of the renewable energy sector would be significantly reduced.

40|$|M. Ed. Despite the {{substantial}} body of Educational Information and Communication Technology (ICT) research {{there is very}} little evidence that the theoretical frameworks that underpin research studies have been considered, or applied optimally. The central argument of this dissertation is that theoretical frameworks serve as epistemological guides that account for the knowledge that is produced in a study. The purpose of this inquiry is to explore how theoretical frameworks are evident in <b>selected</b> masters <b>dissertations</b> and doctoral theses at selected South African universities. A blended theoretical framework, situated in interpretivist theory, with an element of critical theory and positivist theory frames this study. A review of components of research dissertations required both quantified and qualitative data. A mixed methods approach was used to conduct a methodological inventory - cum survey review of 103 texts. A research template was devised in order to record and analyse the data that would be isolated in a reading of the texts, with specific reference to the sections of texts that showed the use of terms related to theoretical frameworks. The findings reveal that studies that were theoretically developed yielded data that could be interpreted in more depth, while a substantial majority of authors that employed their theoretical frameworks in a very limited way, presented findings that were no more than descriptive in nature. I conclude that the reason for the theoretically impoverished studies is possibly, more broadly speaking, located in the wider South African socio-economic, political and localised context. South African Higher Education Institutions face pressures of having to produce masters and doctoral studies in order to secure funding, while supervisors face pressures of having to publish to secure promotion and employability. In the process, students are not given enough opportunity for theoretical emancipation...|$|R
40|$|This study explores how {{educators}} {{could use}} the Information Systems Success (ISS) model to successfully evaluate, select and use mobile educational applications. It aims to illustrate how each dimension of the ISS model could be evaluated to meaningfully contribute to mathematics learning. The increase in mobile device usage has created various opportunities {{for the development of}} learning material which can be accessed through these devices. Mobile learning is learning on the move. Mobile learning creates opportunities for learners not to be bound to a fixed location. Learners are able to work at their own pace and they are given access opportunities. The core problem statement {{of this study is that}} mathematics educators experience challenges to evaluate, select and use applications that will support meaningful learning in their subject field and the study comments on existing applications with the aim to improve their design. Qualitative data was collected from three mathematics subject specialists, six teachers who specialise in various subject fields, one technology and technical expert and six further education and training (FET) mathematics classes. The information gathered from the participants enabled the researcher to determine how educators evaluate and select mathematical applications and how each dimension of the ISS model could meaningfully contribute to education environments. The analysis of the data has indicated that teachers do not use a specific methodology to evaluate and select mathematics applications. If they encounter applications they regard as useable they will evaluate the content of the application according to their curricula outcomes. The research contends that each dimension of the ISS model could be evaluated and contributes to the evaluation and selection of mobile education applications (MEAs). This provides credibility to the use of the ISS model as an evaluation tool. The conceptual framework of this study which is based on the ISS model can be regarded as a framework teachers could use to evaluate and <b>select</b> MEAs. <b>Dissertation</b> (MEd) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.
