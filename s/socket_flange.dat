50|$|A <b>socket</b> <b>flange</b> appears {{similar to}} a slip-on flange, but its bore is counter-bored to accept pipe. A fillet weld around {{the hub of the}} flange {{attaches}} the flange to the pipe, with an interval weld added in high-stress applications. It is most frequently used in high-pressure systems, such as hydraulic and steam lines.|$|E
50|$|From their outset cable {{protection}} systems {{were designed to}} be simple, effective, and easy to assemble. The systems consisted {{of a series of}} half shells which had a convex flange at one end and a larger <b>socket</b> <b>flange</b> at the other allowing the sections to form a flexible universal joint connection between them. Due to the intended use of heavy cast or forged metals they also had the added advantage of increasing the weight of the cable being installed, thus reducing movement on the seabed.|$|E

40|$|A {{specification}} {{utilized for}} the nondestructive evaluation of socket type pipe joints at Langley Research Center (LaRC) is discussed. The scope of hardware shall include, {{but is not}} limited to, all common pipe fittings: tees, elbows, couplings, caps, and so forth, <b>socket</b> type <b>flanges,</b> unions, and valves. In addition, the exterior weld of slip on flanges shall be inspected using this specification. At {{the discretion of the}} design engineer, standard practice engineer, Fracture Mechanics Engineering Section, Pressure Systems Committee, or other authority, four nondestructive evaluation techniques may be utilized exclusively, or in combination, to inspect socket type welds. These techniques are visual, radiographic, magnetic particle, and dye penetrant. Under special circumstances, other techniques (such as eddy current or ultrasonics) may be required and their application shall be guided by the appropriate sections of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (B&PVC) ...|$|R
