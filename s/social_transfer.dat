40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} corporatism in a two-player game which integrates macroeconomic {{stabilization policy}} and {{a policy of}} <b>social</b> <b>transfers.</b> The government decides {{on the level of}} nominal <b>social</b> <b>transfers,</b> and the trade union decides on the nominal wage level. A central finding is that if one assumes that the trade unions utility not only depends on employment, output and inflation, but also on the level of <b>social</b> <b>transfers,</b> there is always scope for Pareto-improvements, relative to the noncooperative Nash equilibrium. In particular, there always exists a bargained combination of lower wages and higher social benefits that is beneficial for both players. Another important result is that an increase in the degree of inflation aversion of the trade union leads to a lower wage level, a lower level of inflation and a higher level of output. The effect on <b>social</b> <b>transfers</b> depends, among other things, on the degree of inflation aversion of the government. Finally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of when the wage level and the level of <b>social</b> <b>transfers</b> are strategic complements or substitutes for each of the players...|$|R

Using elasticities of <b>social</b> <b>transfers</b> on work effort (estimated through sample selection corrected participation probits and working hour OLS), new tests on intrahousehold allocation are developed for Chile. These tests strongly reject the unitary model and exogenous bargaining, accepting endogenous bargaining only among non-poor households.

Family allowances are pro-poor in nature, but because of their small share in beneficiaries’ total income, their impact on overall inequality is much weaker. “Other social benefits” have the weakest inequality-reducing effect, which is due to their higher concentration towards the richest decile and increasing share in total income. Despite the inequality-decreasing impact of <b>social</b> <b>transfers,</b> we argue that they should not be regarded as the sole remedy for the sharp income disparities in the country, but need to be accompanied by relevant active labor market policies...|$|R

[...] With these cuts, the federal government essentially “starved the provinces fiscally”. Courchene notes that in an intriguing twist “these CHST cuts compromised virtually every provincial program except Medicare, since gutting medicare would mean certain electoral defeat for provincial governments. Hence, the provinces diverted money from everywhere else to medicare”. [...] Nevertheless, even though healthcare funding remained mostly unchanged “the inevitable result was that the provinces had to starve other policy areas, {{so much so that}} citizens and cities alike welcomed federal funding in these cash-starved areas”. [...] This is what provided the inroad {{for the federal government to}} take a more direct role in funding provincial jurisdictions. Whereas previously the federal government would mostly establish conditional transfer funds for social programs to the provinces to distribute to their citizens and cities, where the federal government could attach conditions the provinces would have to meet to receive the funding, providing a round about way for the federal government to influence provincial jurisdictions. Now under this proposed hourglass federalism model the federal government is taking a more direct route and directly dealing with citizens and cities and transferring the funds for provincial programs directly to them.|$|E
