The Life StepVan had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, {{appears to be an}} influence in vehicles with the front passengers <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a transversely installed engine with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.|$|E

With his strong reformist views, he was obviously opposed {{to many of the}} conservative ideas not only in society but even in the Brahmo Samaj. That {{was the beginning of the}} split in the Brahmo Samaj of India, which ultimately led to the formation of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1878. Ganguly served several terms as secretary of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj.|$|E

He converted to Catholicism {{in the summer of}} 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife, Mara's death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney, a practicing Catholic. Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, [...] "I'd rather die watching football than in my bed with my boots off." [...] Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at Franklin Field on October 11, 1959. The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans. <b>Sitting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> end zone during the fourth quarter of the game, he suffered a heart attack and died later that day.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of the 3 March 1943 the Luftwaffe was active again. Cunningham {{scrambled}} too late to get contact with the GCI's contact. He climbed toward a searchlight box. The searchlights operated in a box-shape, separated by evenly spaced markers. Each fighter was given a box and flew to its allotted marker beacon. There he orbited until the lights illuminated a target, or formed a cone where he could pick up an AI contact. Soon he had a contact—a Dornier Do 217. He closed in but his cannons jammed. After <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Dornier for some time and trying in vain to encourage the guns to fire, the German crew suddenly woke up and dived away. Cunningham was furious. Three-quarters of the squadron got airborne but only he had seen an enemy. Unsatisfied with ground and aircrews, he used his influence in the small night-fighter community to bring in personnel from his old unit, 604, currently languishing in Cornwall. With the new VIII radar a uniform facility, Cunningham took command of a Mosquito NF.XII—the first Mosquito to have a smooth [...] "bluff" [...] nose dome over the dish antenna.|$|E

Roy allowed nine goals on 26 shots, which was highly unusual, as star goalies are generally {{taken out of}} the game quickly on off-nights. During the second period, the crowd provided mock applause after Roy made an easy save, prompting him to sarcastically raise his arms in mock celebration.

2500|$|This {{version of}} the Batmobile is a simple sleek pod with sharp angles and rounded sides. Its {{interior}} is a red illuminated single-person cockpit, with computer circuitry and displays visible all around. It is armed with guided immobilizer missiles and grappling cables. Being a [...] "single-seat" [...] by design, it {{was never meant to}} carry two people, as shown when Terry's friend Maxine was once <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> seat to great discomfort. According to Bruce, the vehicles top speed is Mach 3; however Terry has never piloted the vehicle at those speeds through Gotham City. It features a drop down hatch; this allows Terry swift exit/entrance from underneath without having to park the vehicle and get out, allowing him to literally get the drop on his opponents. Like Terry's batsuit the Batmobile features a camouflage system rendering it invisible; however another system consisting of holographic projector disguising it as a simple garbage dumpster or random car to keep away prying eyes and potential vandals. The vehicle has built in digital recorders and cameras for collecting audio and visual evidence.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1917, the Sopwith Aviation Company {{designed}} a two-seat fighter aircraft, the 3F.2 Hippo, possibly to replace the Sopwith 1½ Strutter in French service. [...] While the British Air Board did not place an order for the Hippo, it did grant Sopwith a licence {{to allow it to}} build prototypes as a private venture. The Hippo was designed to give the best possible view to the pilot and gunner, which dictated the aircraft's shape. [...] Its two-bay wings had heavy (2ft 3 in (0.69 m)) negative stagger, with the pilot sitting ahead of the upper wing and the gunner <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> rear spar of the upper wing. [...] The fuselage filled the gap between the wings, with the crew's heads level with the upper wing and cutouts in the wing's forward and trailing edges for the pilot and gunner. [...] The pilot was armed with two synchronised Vickers machine guns, while the observer was provided with two Lewis guns on a rocking pillar mount. [...] It was powered by a Clerget 11 eleven-cylinder rotary engine, chosen as it was not heavily used.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{moment in}} [...] "Crisis", of Lionel {{preparing}} to kill himself, was also added {{at the last}} minute.

While filming, Greg Beeman, James Marshall and Miles Millar were all <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> monitors, {{trying to come up}} with the cliffhanger ending that was going to be attached to [...] "Crisis". Beeman added the moment where the phone rings, interrupting Lionel from completing his suicide; this was used as the opening for [...] "Legacy" [...] and it all eventually set up Lionel’s terminal liver disease. Another late change, though it was not at the last minute, came for Lionel’s physical appearance on the show. John Glover came up with the idea of cutting Lionel’s hair for the season finale. Glover was busy preparing for a play that he was going to be acting in, and he needed his hair cut for the part. Glover made the suggestion while the crew was filming [...] "Memoria", as well as the idea of setting the scene in prison. Gough admits to needing some kind of device to cut back to while all of the other cliffhangers are occurring—Clark being taken away, the Kryptonian symbol burned into field on the Kent farm, and Lex being poisoned—and he felt that Glover’s suggestion would help them pull off the effect they wanted.|$|E
2500|$|Natan-Zada {{boarded the}} Shefa-'Amr-bound bus on Thursday, 4 August 2005. He {{was dressed in}} full IDF uniform, {{carrying}} his IDF-issued M16 rifle, and, according to observers, wearing the skullcap, beard, and sidelocks of an observant Jew, {{as well as an}} orange ribbon hanging from his pocket. According to witnesses, the bus driver was initially surprised to see a religiously-observant Jewish soldier making his way to Shefa-'Amr (an overwhelmingly Arab city) via public bus, so he asked Natan-Zada if he was certain he wanted to take his current route. [...] Upon arriving in Shefa-'Amr's primary Druze neighborhood, Natan-Zada stood up and approached the front door as if to disembark the bus. [...] When the door opened, Natan-Zada turned around and shot the driver. He then fatally shot a man <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> driver, and fired into the rest of the bus, killing two young women and wounding twenty-one passengers. When he paused to reload his weapon, a passenger grabbed the barrel of his gun, sustaining burn injuries, and he was subdued by streetgoers gathered around the scene of the bus shooting. When the police arrived at the scene he was tied up but still alive, but the small force of police officers on the scene could not prevent the crowd from lynching him, and nine police officers were injured attempting to protect him. It took the police four hours to remove his body from the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Her last {{motion picture}} {{was in a}} British horror film, Fanatic (1965). She chose this role over the lead in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, which she had turned down. Fanatic was {{released}} in the U.S. as Die! Die! My Darling!, which she protested, thinking it was exploiting her characteristic catchphrase, but {{did not succeed in}} getting it changed. During the screening she held privately for her friends, she apologized for [...] "looking older than God's wet nurse" [...] (in the film she wore no makeup and dyed her hair grey, and the film used very claustrophobic close-ups to accentuate her age and frailness). She called the B-movie horror flick [...] "a piece of shit", though her performance in it was praised by critics and remains popular as a cult film and with her fans. Her last appearances on television came in March 1967 as the villainous Black Widow in the Batman TV series, and on the December 17, 1967, episode of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour comedy-variety TV series, in the [...] "Mahta Harry" [...] skit. She also appeared on NBC's famous lost Tonight Show Beatles interview that aired on May 14, 1968. <b>Sitting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> interview desk and beside Joe Garagiola, who was substituting for an absent Johnny Carson, she took an active role during the interview, questioning Paul McCartney and John Lennon.

2500|$|Out of caution, Radić was {{quieter than}} usual at the {{following}} evening's session of parliament. A verbal confrontation erupted that night when HSS deputy Ivan Pernar shouted insults at several Serbian politicians, questioning their wartime record and suggesting they were responsible for committing atrocities. Croatian politician Lubomir Maštović then made a speech protesting how the death threats against Radić made by Popović and Račić the previous day had gone unpunished {{by the president of}} the Assembly, Ninko Perić. Popović responded by saying [...] "...if Stjepan Radić, who shames the Croatian people, further continues with his insults, I guarantee that his head will fall." [...] The opposition benches reacted by shouting insults and death threats at the NRS party deputies, who responded in similar fashion. Perić ordered a five-minute recess and retreated to his private chamber, where he spoke with Račić. Račić was given the floor when the session was resumed. In his speech, he asserted that Serbian interests had never been in greater danger and stated that he would not refrain from using [...] "other weapons, as need be, to defend the interests of Serbdom". Opposing politicians, especially Pernar, responded by taunting Račić and shouting as he spoke. Račić demanded that Perić penalize those jeering at his speech. Pernar then shouted [...] "you plundered beys!", accusing Račić of looting Muslim homes in Macedonia. Seeing that Perić was not going to reprimand Pernar, Račić reached into his pocket and produced a handgun. The Minister of Justice, Milorad Vujičić, who was <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> podium, grabbed Račić by the back while the former Minister of Religion, Obradović, seized his right shoulder. Račić pushed both men away and shot Pernar first. He then turned his attention to Ivan Granđa and shot him. He attempted to shoot Svetozar Pribićević just as HSS deputy Đuro Basariček jumped to the podium. Račić aimed at Pribićević but shot Basariček instead. He then shot Radić in the hand and stomach. Radić's nephew, Pavle, rushed to help his uncle. Upon seeing him, Račić yelled [...] "I was waiting for you!" [...] and shot him at point-blank range. He then fled the chamber. Basariček and Radić's nephew died immediately. Pernar and Granđa were wounded but survived. Radić was seriously wounded and was taken to hospital immediately, where he was visited by King Alexander I.|$|E
