40|$|There {{is now a}} {{substantive}} body of academic literature which focuses on protests against local infrastructural developments. This literature is often characterised by the key words ‘NIMBY’ or (facility-) ‘siting controversies’. The rapid development of renewable energy technologies – which are largely sited in rural areas – {{has created a new}} version of this controversy; energy-landscape conflicts. In many countries, large infrastructural developments are regulated through spatial planning legislation, often causing various tensions between new technologies, an evolving policy agenda, and a legislative framework which was largely conceived in a different era and which is slow to adapt. Alternatively, and in line with neo-liberal thinking, the logic of development can be subjected to cost-benefit analysis, whereby the value of the wind farm can be compared with the value of the ‘unspoiled’ landscape. This paper takes a more holistic approach to energy-landscape conflicts, by examining claims of ownership and notions and measures of value inherent in different claims and value systems which (seek to) influence decision-making. We examine both the logic of monetary valuation and the implicit value <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> various policy <b>intervention</b> options to point at the need for a more heterogeneous and multidisciplinary approach to policy evaluation. We then look at notions of ownership, rights and duties in relation to landscape and to our energy future, and we highlight the potential for using an analytical property rights framework which cuts across various levels of claims and value statements, from the national and ideological to the personal and practice-based...|$|R

The dual of a true <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> a projective plane is therefore a true <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> the dual projective plane and the implication is that for self-dual planes, the dual of a true <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> that plane is also a true <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> that plane.|$|R

50|$|Loop-carried {{dependencies}} and loop independent dependencies {{are determined}} by the relationships between <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> iterations of a loop. When a <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> one iteration of a loop depends in some way on a <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> a different iteration of the same loop, a loop-carried dependence exists. However, if a <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> one iteration of a loop depends only on a <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> the same iteration of the loop, this creates a loop independent dependence. // Code block 1 // Code block 2 for(i = 0; i < 4; i++) for(i = 0; i < 4; i++) S1: bi = 8; S1: bi = 8; S2: ai = bi-1 + 10; S2: ai = bi + 10;In this example, code block 1 shows loop-dependent dependence between statement S2 iteration i and statement S1 iteration i+1. This is to say that statement S2 cannot proceed until <b>statement</b> S1 <b>in</b> the previous iteration finishes. Code block 2 show loop independent dependence between statements S1 and S2 in the same iteration.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{intermediate}} program representation form, the Restricted Permutation Trees (RPT), and describe its construction and semantics via rewrite rules along with proofs of correctness. The RPT inherently reflects {{most of the}} legal permutations of the <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> a program and hence is suited to optimizations that involve code reordering. We illustrate the use of RPTs for performing Register Allocation and Instruction Scheduling, the performance of both of which depends upon the ordering of <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> a program. 1 Introduction The performance of many compiler optimizations depends upon the order of <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> the program. For example, the data cache hit rates are high if the <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> a program are ordered such that locality of variable accesses are high. Pipeline stalls are reduced if the <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> a program are ordered such that adjacent instructions are as independent as possible. In every case, the ordering of statements should ensure that the semantics o [...] ...|$|R
