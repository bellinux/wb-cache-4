5|$|Thomas is also speculated to {{have been}} one of the driving forces behind the Battle of the Neva, a disputed Swedish-Novgorodian {{conflict}} that took place in 1240. The <b>speculation</b> <b>is</b> based on the 14th-century Russian Primary Chronicle mention of Finns and Tavastians fighting on the Swedish side, which according to some historians would have been organized by the bishop. However, as the Chronicle also lists the very unlikely Norwegians as allies, the information is often regarded as mid-14th century propaganda, depicting Sweden as being in control of Norway, Finland and Tavastia.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential <b>speculation</b> <b>is</b> that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly {{on the basis of these}} structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} {{of the ceiling}} has had various interpretations in the past, some elements {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of the ceiling. One such <b>speculation</b> <b>is</b> that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E

25|$|While {{there is}} no clear {{agreement}} on what causes bubbles, there is evidence to suggest that they are not caused by bounded rationality or assumptions about the irrationality of others, as assumed by greater fool theory.

Further, {{it has been shown that}} bubbles appear even when <b>speculation</b> <b>is</b> not possible or when over-confidence is absent.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} the AFE zone is the {{anterior}} fornix itself, but it is thought by some sex experts to be a degenerated female prostate (a theory that {{has been applied to}} the G-spot and the Skene's gland) or the area where the vaginal nerves connect, which is thought to be near it. <b>Speculation</b> <b>is</b> that it is the vesicouterine pouch, due to its proximity to the supposed location of the AFE zone and the supposed erogenous qualities of the rectouterine pouch.|$|E
25|$|Glucokinase {{has been}} found in the brain in largely the same areas that contain glucose-sensing neurons, {{including}} both of the hypothalamic nuclei. Inhibition of glucokinase abolishes the ventromedial nucleus response to a meal. However, brain glucose levels are lower than plasma levels, typically 0.5–3.5mmol/L. Although this range is matches the sensitivity of the glucose-sensing neurons, it is below the optimal inflection sensitivity for glucokinase. The presumption, based on indirect evidence and <b>speculation,</b> <b>is</b> that neuronal glucokinase is somehow exposed to plasma glucose levels even in the neurons.|$|E

25|$|Outside of his dialectic, it was {{in ethics}} that Abelard showed {{greatest}} activity of philosophical thought. He stressed the subjective intention as determining, if not the moral character, at least the moral value, of human action. His thought in this direction, anticipating something of modern <b>speculation,</b> <b>is</b> remarkable because his scholastic successors accomplished least {{in the field of}} morals, hardly venturing to bring the principles and rules of conduct under pure philosophical discussion, even after they were made fully aware of Aristotle's great ethical inquiries.|$|E

25|$|If {{the bond}} angles, bond lengths and torsion angles of the {{components}} are not modified at any stage of complex generation, it is known as rigid body docking. A subject of <b>speculation</b> <b>is</b> whether or not rigid-body docking is sufficiently good for most docking. When substantial conformational change occurs within the components {{at the time of}} complex formation, rigid-body docking is inadequate. However, scoring all possible conformational changes is prohibitively expensive in computer time. Docking procedures which permit conformational change, or flexible docking procedures, must intelligently select small subset of possible conformational changes for consideration.|$|E

In addition, the South China Morning Post estimated the attendance of Hong Kong Disneyland will reach 4 million in its second year, far lower than its first year of operation, citing unnamed sources. The SCMP's sources are still unknown, {{and some of its}} <b>speculation</b> <b>is</b> a bit overly optimistic. In December 2007, the Disney park admitted that the park had only attracted 4million visitors in the year 2006–2007, which had fallen 23 percent when compared to the first year attendance.|$|E
25|$|Astrobiology {{makes use}} of physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology, {{molecular}} biology, ecology, planetary science, geography, and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from that on Earth. The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology. Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data, and although <b>speculation</b> <b>is</b> entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories. Given more detailed and reliable data {{from other parts of}} the universe, the roots of astrobiology itself—physics, chemistry and biology—may have their theoretical bases challenged.|$|E

25|$|Penderecki {{explained}} this shift {{by stating that}} he had come to feel that the experimentation of the avant-garde had gone too far from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: 'The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism. The musical world of Stockhausen, Nono, Boulez and Cage was for us, the young – hemmed in by the aesthetics of socialist realism, then the official canon in our country – a liberation...I was quick to realise however, that this novelty, this experimentation and formal <b>speculation,</b> <b>is</b> more destructive than constructive; I realised the Utopian quality of its Promethean tone'. Penderecki concluded that he was 'saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition'.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Nungesser mysteriously {{disappeared}} on {{an attempt}} to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight from Paris to New York, flying with wartime comrade François Coli in L'Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird). Their aircraft took off from Paris on 8 May 1927, was sighted once more over Ireland, and then was never seen again. The disappearance of Nungesser {{is considered one of the}} great mysteries in the history of aviation, and modern <b>speculation</b> <b>is</b> that the aircraft was either lost over the Atlantic or crashed in Newfoundland or Maine. Two weeks after Nungesser and Coli's attempt, Charles Lindbergh successfully made the journey, flying solo from New York to Paris in Spirit of St. Louis. Monuments and museums honoring Nungesser and Coli's attempt exist at Le Bourget airport in Paris and on the cliffs of Étretat, the location from which their plane was last sighted in France.|$|E
25|$|Socially {{the island}} is highly diverse, with the {{creative}} sector (artists, musicians, scientists, writers, poets and actors) and eccentrics strongly represented. It has 1,206 businesses but around 1,000 people commute daily to Auckland as career opportunities are limited. 60.9 per cent of the residents are in employment. The main employment sectors are hospitality (23 per cent) and retail (15%) followed by education, agriculture/horticulture and healthcare (10% each). Gentrification and land <b>speculation</b> <b>is</b> having an impact, with high rates and mortgage interest rates forcing some people on fixed incomes to relocate. New Zealand council rates are based on land and building valuations, which take into account potential value for redevelopment even if the owners live on the property and have no intention to sell or redevelop. The cost of living is higher compared to the mainland, due to the shipping-freight costs of most foodstuffs, fuel and amenities.|$|E
