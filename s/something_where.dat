500|$|Hamels {{pitched in}} Game 1 of the National League Division Series against the Brewers, {{pitching}} [...] "eight spectacular two-hit shutout innings" [...] {{during which he}} struck out nine hitters, notching his first career playoff win, and the Phillies' first playoff win since 1993. He commented, [...] "I knew {{the importance of the}} game. And it's <b>something</b> <b>where,</b> because of last year, I learned what it really takes in trying to ... kind of mellow out, not to have that sort of excitement where you can't really control everything." [...] He was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the National League Championship Series, going 2–0 in the NLCS with a 1.93 ERA and winning the series clincher on October 15 in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Through her Liberty Counsel attorneys, Davis {{filed an}} {{appeal of the}} order holding her in {{contempt}} of court, asking that she be released immediately from jail and that her name be removed from marriage licenses, allowing her deputies to issue them. Separately, Davis asked Governor Beshear to free her. The governor's office said that the conflict was a [...] "matter {{between her and the}} courts"; Beshear added that he lacked the legal authority to either remove Davis from office or to relieve Davis of her statutory duties. Rowan County Democratic Judge-Executive Walter Blevins stated that he did not believe he would need to appoint a replacement for Davis, and that he believed the Attorney General of Kentucky and [...] "the General Assembly will pass <b>something</b> <b>where</b> marriage licenses don't have anyone's name on them".|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, a {{video of}} Robyn and Diplo working on [...] "Dancehall Queen" [...] in the studio was posted onto YouTube. The song {{originally}} leaked onto the Internet in February 2010, under the title [...] "No Hassle". In an interview with music website Stereogum, Robyn spoke of the song's origin, saying; [...] "We [...] were talking about Ace of Base {{and we were just}} having fun with that kind of genre music. And the idea of making this song came out of that discussion. It was fun.

500|$|Adamson also {{desired to}} make the film larger in scale; [...] "I've gained {{confidence}} having gone through the first. This time, I {{was able to go}} larger [...] scale, with more extras and bigger battle scenes." [...] Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle, a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz's castle was created. Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original. Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian's conflict and Edmund's maturity, in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama. Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes, asking his young male actors not to perform angrily. Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by [...] "tell people {{at the end of the}} scene, 'Now just give me <b>something</b> <b>where</b> you're not thinking about anything.' By using it in context, the audience will read an emotion into it." ...|$|E
500|$|The band rescheduled European tour {{dates in}} the {{aftermath}} of the September 11 attacks. [...] "After the attacks the world kind of went into freeze mode and we didn't know whether to carry on with things or not... so we decided we'd rather everyone was safe and play the shows a little later instead," [...] said Hoppus shortly thereafter. The European dates were canceled a second time after DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back. With time off from touring, DeLonge felt an [...] "itch to do <b>something</b> <b>where</b> he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was", and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration. Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project, which led Hoppus to feel betrayed. The event caused great division within the trio for some time and an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band's later hiatus.|$|E
500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket became Blink-182's first {{number one}} album in the United States upon its June 2001 release; it also hit the top {{position}} in Canada and Germany. Hit singles [...] "The Rock Show" [...] and [...] "First Date" [...] continued the band's mainstream success worldwide, with MTV cementing their image as video stars. However, guitarist Tom DeLonge {{felt as though}} his creativity was stifled by label limitations, and sessions became contentious among the trio. They rescheduled European tour dates {{in the aftermath of}} the September 11 attacks, and they were called off a second time after DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back. With time off from touring, DeLonge felt an [...] "itch to do <b>something</b> <b>where</b> he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was," [...] and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration.

500|$|For the crew's space suits, Scott was {{inspired}} to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in Steve Jobs' biography about building an office out of Gorilla Glass. Scott said, [...] "If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why would I design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is <b>something</b> <b>where</b> I have 360 [...] Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet." [...] The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, Janty Yates, used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a neoprene suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.|$|E
500|$|Sheila gives Berger {{a yellow}} shirt. He goofs around {{and ends up}} tearing it in two. [...] Sheila voices her {{distress}} that Berger seems to care more about the [...] "bleeding crowd" [...] than about her ("Easy to Be Hard"). [...] Jeanie summarizes everyone's romantic entanglements: [...] "I'm hung up on Claude, Sheila's hung up on Berger, Berger is hung up everywhere. Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger." [...] The tribe runs out to the audience with fliers inviting them to a Be-In. [...] Berger, Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they fold it ("Don't Put it Down"). [...] After young and innocent Crissy describes [...] "Frank Mills", a boy she's looking for, the tribe participates in the [...] "Be-In". [...] The men of the tribe burn their draft cards. [...] Claude puts his card in the fire, then changes his mind and pulls it out. [...] He asks, [...] "where is the <b>something,</b> <b>where</b> is the someone, that tells me why I live and die?" [...] ("Where Do I Go"). [...] The tribe emerges naked, intoning [...] "beads, flowers, freedom, happiness." ...|$|E
500|$|For DeLonge, he had {{developed}} an [...] "itch to do <b>something</b> <b>where</b> he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was." [...] According to DeLonge, Box Car Racer was not [...] "meant {{to be a real}} band," [...] but rather [...] "something to do in some spare time that was really only expected to be on the low list of the totem pole of priorities in my life, and just to have an experimental creative outlet." [...] The project was at first solely acoustic guitar-based; he considered it in its earliest stages to be a [...] "Violent Femmes-esque acoustic record". The unnamed project went through other names, such as The Kill, and the album was initially titled Et tu, Brute?. He eventually settled on the name Box Car Racer, which was actually the name of a band Barker was in just after high school that DeLonge liked. He began writing songs {{about the end of the}} world, and connected it thematically with the biblical Book of Revelation and World War II. When reading about the war, DeLonge was [...] "freaked out" [...] to learn that Fat Man, the atomic bomb that was detonated over Nagasaki, was dropped from the B-29 bomber Bockscar (commonly misspelled Boxcar).|$|E

500|$|After multi-platinum success, arena tours, and cameo {{appearances}} (American Pie), {{the band}} recorded Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), which debuted at {{number one in}} the United States, Canada, and Germany. Hit singles [...] "The Rock Show","Stay Together for the Kids" [...] and [...] "First Date" [...] continued the band's mainstream success worldwide, with MTV cementing its image as video stars. Finn returned to produce the record and was a key architect of the [...] "polished" [...] pop punk sound, and he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound. Recording sessions were sometimes contentious, as DeLonge strove for heavier and dirtier guitar-driven rock. With time off from touring, he felt an [...] "itch to do <b>something</b> <b>where</b> he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was," [...] and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration.

500|$|Munroe {{stated in}} terms of the story line that ideas were floated as extreme as the Turtles being in space, but {{eventually}} it just came back to New York City, and the theme of the family that had fallen apart. When developing the screenplay, Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or [...] "less Cowabunga" [...] and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience. [...] "I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing. Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny. I think that version of the movie could do really well, but we wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>where</b> it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting!" [...] Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation, he was after the feel of a comic book. Karai was one of Munroe's favoriite characters from the comics and he [...] "was the one who really pushed for Karai" [...] to appear in the film. TMNT co-creator Peter Laird stated it takes place in its own universe separate from the previous films. However, director Munroe says the film exists in the same continuity as the other films, which was supported by the memento wall {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E
500|$|In a 2015 interview, Pierre {{notes that}} fans {{have told him}} that they find Commit This to Memory a [...] "winter album," [...] to which he agrees, noting the unintentional mention {{of the new year}} in several songs. [...] His lyricism on Commit This to Memory centralizes around change and, in his words, [...] "being a {{complete}} fuckup, yet, at the same time, being somewhat successful". On the record, he [...] "addresses the themes of substance abuse, psychological disorders and failing relationships." [...] Pierre penned [...] "Everything Is Alright" [...] as a summary of his OCD (Obsessive–compulsive disorder) tendencies. He intended to utilize his social anxiety and fears in the song's form, which he has since employed in numerous other compositions. [...] "I don’t think the [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] is correct, but it’s <b>something</b> <b>where</b> the verses are one thing and then the chorus is another, but it's sort of like giving yourself a pep talk," [...] said Pierre. The song's lyrics include hating such mundane things as [...] "theme parks, flying, strangers, [...] waiting in line," [...] things that Pierre genuinely disliked {{at the time of the}} song's writing. For the record, he intended to simplify his lyrics to enhance storytelling and he drew inspiration from Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson's writing styles. Keeping in the Waits/Folds inspiration, Pierre strove to write from another person's point of view; in the case of [...] "Time Turned Fragile", it is sung from the perspective of his father.|$|E

500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to <b>something</b> <b>where</b> the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

2500|$|While in {{his senior}} year of high school, Fabolous began to pursue a career in hip hop music. He was invited to rap live on American record {{producer}} and music executive DJ Clue's radio show, then on New York City radio station Hot 97. DJ Clue subsequently signed Fabolous to his record label, Desert Storm Records. Fabolous was then featured on several DJ Clue mixtapes, as well as mixtapes with Roc-A-Fella artists. This earned Fabolous and Desert Storm a distribution deal with Elektra Records. In a September 6, 2001 interview with Hot104.com, Fabolous said he never planned on becoming a rapper and told the website: [...] "I was just trying to make some money, ya know?

2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly {{where to look for}} a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get <b>something</b> <b>where</b> he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E
