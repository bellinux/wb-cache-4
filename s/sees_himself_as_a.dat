Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took {{half an hour to}} put on.|$|E
5|$|The exiled prisoners from Earth {{form the}} Confederacy of Man in the Koprulu Sector. A de facto plutocracy, the Confederacy's inner {{workings}} are elaborated {{on in the}} novels Liberty's Crusade, Speed of Darkness and Nova. Taking {{the role of the}} primary antagonistic faction in StarCrafts Episode I, the Confederacy is shown as the most powerful faction in the sector at the beginning of StarCraft; in the novels, it is depicted as being brutal towards the public and corrupt at the highest levels on its capital Tarsonis.

The Dominion is an autocracy with Mengsk as its emperor. The Dominion's operations are built on in The Dark Templar Saga series of novels.

While he does not kill at random or without purpose, his reasons are at times abstract.

500|$|Economically, Morales' {{policies}} have sometimes been termed [...] "Evonomics" [...] and {{have focused on}} creating a mixed economy. Morales' presidential discourse has revolved around distinguishing between [...] "the people", of whom he <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> representative, and the oppressive socio-economic elite and the old political class, whom he believes have mistreated [...] "the people" [...] for centuries. Morales sought to make Bolivia's representative democracy more direct and communitarian, through the introduction of referendums and a citizen-led legislative initiative. George Philip and Francisco Panizza claimed that like his allies Correa and Chávez, Morales should be categorized as a populist, because he appealed [...] "directly to the people against their countries' political and economic order, divided the social field into antagonistic camps and promised redistribution and recognition in a newly founded political order." ...|$|E

When asked on multiple occasions which current NBA player he most resembled, Hill responded by picking Monta Ellis, adding that he <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> combo guard and an energy player who enjoys playing defense and getting into the passing lanes.

2500|$|Stephenie Meyer {{stated that}} the {{original}} concept of Edward originated in a dream that she had, in which an [...] "average girl" [...] and a [...] "fantastically beautiful, sparkly ... vampire ... were having an intense conversation in a meadow in the woods." [...] In this dream, the pair [...] "were discussing the difficulties inherent in the facts that ... they were {{falling in love with}} each other while ... the vampire was particularly attracted to the scent of her blood, and was having a difficult time restraining himself from killing her." [...] She chose the name [...] "Edward" [...] because she thought it was [...] "a name that had once been considered romantic, but had fallen out of popularity for decades". Meyer says that Edward is a combination of her three favorite leading men - Jane Eyres Edward Rochester, Fitzwilliam Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, and Gilbert Blythe from Anne of Green Gables—particularly Edward Rochester, who, like Edward Cullen, <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "monster". A recurring theme in the series, especially in the first three books, is that Edward is constantly trying to avoid accidentally harming Bella, due to his vampire nature.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spiritual leader}} of the tail section. Director Bong first saw Hurt in The Elephant Man while at middle-school, which made him curious about the actor; for the part of Gilliam he wanted an older actor, though one {{with the ability to}} [...] "exude the {{ambience}} of spirituality." [...] On the character of Gilliam, Hurt said, [...] "He is certainly shadowy, but he is shadowy for a reason. Even though I still am not entirely certain what the reason is," [...] adding, [...] " [...] as far as Gilliam is concerned, he believes in the status quo, but he also <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> true humanitarian. I mean he has literally given his limbs to these people." [...] Hurt stated that the role of Gilliam was physically challenging one at that, because, [...] " [...] the fact that I had one leg strapped behind me, trying to stagger around on those not very easy-to-use crutches. [...] and having {{to make it look like}} as though I'd been doing it for years." [...] He too acknowledged Bong's encouragement of collaboration in allowing the cast and crew to [...] "interpret things as we want, as we see fit" [...] as well as adding pointers to the act. Hurt said of Bong, [...] "I just fell in love with him. He was wonderful. I hadn't seen anything. I hadn't seen Mother or anything, which I immediately did when I got home. I went, 'Wow, that's the chap I was talking to.' Thank God instinct has left me completely. I adored him then, I adored him ever since." [...] as well as previously adding, [...] "He is quite different but technically, he is as clever as Hitchcock. That's saying something. [...] He is one of the best directors I've worked with. I absolutely adore working with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though using profanity on occasion, Butters {{does not}} indulge in foul-mouthed {{language}} {{as often as}} the other children on the show, instead preferring to use minced oaths; [...] "oh hamburgers" [...] is one he uses frequently, as well as [...] "gee whiz" [...] mostly in earlier seasons. Butters speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as [...] "nerdy", and he obliviously maintains a wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters. His happy-go-lucky persona {{has been described as}} resembling that of a typical 1950s sitcom child character, and is usually presented {{in stark contrast to the}} harsh treatment he receives at the hands of his friends and strict parents, including his mother's deranged attempt to murder him after discovering his father's bisexuality, as well as when his grandmother happens to be in town and constantly bullies him during her stay. Stone describes him as embodying [...] "permanent innocence". [...] Butters, however, <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> problem child because his parents tell him so and often expresses remorse at being [...] "out-of-control". Exceptions to this include the episode [...] "The Ungroundable", in which Butters makes his parents worry about their ability to ground him when he refuses to be punished. This rebellious behavior begins after he joins the vampire kids at his school, but ends when he helps the Goth kids burn down a Hot Topic store. He is also known for being gullible, quickly believing anything told to him by others and tending to do whatever he is told to do with little protest, no matter how ridiculous these things seem to be. As such, he is always made an unknowing accomplice in Cartman's various devious schemes. There are cases, however, where Butters has shown a darker side, such as in episodes like [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] and [...] "Butterballs"; in the latter of which he viciously assaulted Dr. Oz and verbally castigated his abusive grandmother.|$|E
50|$|Previously, Strindberg had <b>seen</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> martyr, {{constantly}} persecuted by women.
