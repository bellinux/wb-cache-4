5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe asked for a {{cigarette}} to <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> the middle of reading a kvitel, {{it was a sign}} that the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a follower of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe asked for a cigarette while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> the bong.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the <b>smoke,</b> <b>in</b> a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth position by lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team radio that he could smell <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> his race car, which his team responded that {{it was probably a}} tire rubbing against the car. During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin had moved to the 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued to move toward the front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second position by lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version {{in the content of}} gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> his cell.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was once}} again fastest during third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, even while suffering from overheating under his seat. The two Mercedes cars were separated by two-tenths of a second with the two Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen behind, another half a second down. Red Bull had a slight upturn in fortune, with Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat finishing fifth and sixth respectively. McLaren-Honda had another problematic session as Fernando Alonso stopped the car just after starting his installation lap. Teammate Jenson Button was called into the pit lane as well, citing a similar problem with the engine, but was able to continue later in the session. Felipe Massa experienced <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> his cockpit both on Friday and Saturday, apparently caused by the new titanium plates underneath the cars which also create sparks when driving over bumps on the track.|$|E

5|$|Howard (Melissa Leo) quits smoking, and {{her partner}} Felton (Daniel Baldwin) fears her edginess will endanger his safety. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) also tries to quit smoking, but tries to live {{vicariously}} through his smoking partner Pembleton (Andre Braugher). Howard and Bayliss petition Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{to set up a}} non-smoking section for the squad room, but an amused Gee refuses because most of the detectives smoke. Howard, Felton, Bayliss and Pembleton find they share a common suspect in a Union Square murder, and plan a joint stakeout. Howard and Bayliss decide to ride together so Pembleton and Felton can <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> the car. Although outwardly critical and skeptical, Pembleton and Felton are actually impressed with their partners' willpower and discuss the merits of quitting smoking. Howard and Bayliss, however, talk about nothing but smoking, prompting Bayliss to walk to Pembleton's car window and ask for a cigarette. As the result, the four detectives almost miss the suspect, and have to engage him in a foot chase to arrest him.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the tunnel boring machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an electrical fire.|$|E

He {{was taken to}} the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of <b>smoke.</b> <b>In</b> 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.|$|E
