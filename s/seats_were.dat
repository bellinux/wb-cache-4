5|$|The first Singaporean elections, held in March 1948, {{were limited}} as only {{six of the}} twenty-five seats on the Legislative Council were to be elected. Only British {{subjects}} had the rights to vote, and only 23,000 or about 10% of those eligible registered to vote. Other members of the Council were chosen either by the Governor or by the chambers of commerce. Three of the elected <b>seats</b> <b>were</b> won by a newly formed Singapore Progressive Party (SPP), a conservative party whose leaders were businessmen and professionals and were disinclined to press for immediate self-rule. The other three <b>seats</b> <b>were</b> won by independents.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the same amount of seats. More than half of PKB <b>seats</b> <b>were</b> received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN <b>seats</b> <b>were</b> automatically secured.|$|E
50|$|The seats {{can face}} forward or backward. Most <b>seats</b> <b>are</b> turquoise, while the Reserved/Priority <b>seats</b> <b>are</b> navy blue.

Thereafter at most five <b>seats</b> <b>are</b> allocated using the largest remainder method (using the Droop quota). Any additional <b>seats</b> <b>are</b> allocated amongst the parties who then already have seats using the highest averages method.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the delay}} in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh {{parliament}} was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these <b>seats</b> <b>were</b> not removed until the 2014 election.|$|E
