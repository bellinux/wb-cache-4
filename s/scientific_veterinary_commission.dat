The aim of this round robbin was to check a wet ashing procedure followed by a flame AAS determination as described too in EEC doc. 2266 /VI/ 77. Special attention has been given to the latest version of this method, i. e. "Revision 3 ". In the tables 1 a- 3 a and 1 b- 3 b (a for Pb, b for Cd) all measuring data, including absorbances and blank values have been collected. In tables 4 a (Pb) and 4 b (Cd) the results of the various analyses have been given. The EEC <b>Scientific</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Commission</b> needs a method of analysis for the determination of lead and cadmium in fresh meat, to control the Directive for import from third countries. In a meeting at 1979 - 10 - 18 the experts of the ad-hoc subgroup IV in principle have adopted two methods: a dry ashing method, doc. 3027 /VI/ 79 and a wet ashing method. The wet ashing method was originating from the Netherlands National Institute of Public Health (Schuller, Vaessen), doc. 2266 /VI/ 77. This method was redrafted by Andersen, doc. 2266 /VI/ 77 Rev. 1 and Rev. 2. Recently at a meeting on 1980 - 05 - 08 Andersen, De Ruig, Schulier and Wolf redrafted the method again, doc. 2266 /VI/ 77 Rev. 3. To check the method, in the meeting on 1979 - 10 - 18 the experts decided to a small intercomparison, with two samples: - bovine kidney (NIPH 71 601), - bovine liver (NIPH 74 228) ...|$|E

Supporters of battery husbandry contend that alternative systems such as free range also have welfare problems, such as increases in cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking. A recent review of welfare in battery cages made the point that such welfare issues are problems of management, unlike the issues of behavioural deprivation, which are inherent in a system that keeps hens in such cramped and barren conditions. [...] Free range egg producers can limit or eliminate injurious pecking, particularly feather pecking, through such strategies as providing environmental enrichment, feeding mash instead of pellets, keeping roosters in with the hens, and arranging nest boxes so hens are not exposed to each other's vents; similar strategies are more restricted or impossible in battery cages.|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} is a daunting public health threat affecting {{both human and}} animal health {{and it is a}} cause for concern wherever antimicrobial agents are in use. The usage of antimicrobial drugs in food producing animals could result in a significant food safety issue - antimicrobial resistance among zoonotic bacteria in these animals. The resistant bacteria may then be transmitted to humans through the food supply and increase risk of treatment failures. Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. are two examples of food borne pathogens in which increasing resistance gives rise to concern. No monitoring program has been applied in Serbia. Therefore, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture financed three projects of the <b>Scientific</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Institute 'Novi Sad' to screen the spread of resistant food borne pathogens. The examinations have shown a similar situation as in the EU. Resistance to one or more antimicrobial drugs was found in 25 - 40. 58 % Salmonella spp. and 40 - 75. 32 % Campylobacter spp. isolates from poultry and pig carcasses. Zoonotic pathogens in food have to be controlled through a complete, continuous farm-to-fork system. Application of prophylactic and sanitary measures in farm breeding, slaughtering, food distribution and preparation of food in the kitchen may considerably reduce risk from the incidence of resistant zoonotic pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Animal Machines (Harrison, 1964), there has been wide-spread public pressure in Europe—supported by European institutions—to “ban the battery cage. ” The European Union (EU) and national governments (particularly in Northern Europe) funded research on noncage systems for egg production and en-riched cages. In 1986, the EU passed a Directive specifying a minimum size for cages, but public opinion—again particularly in the North—continued to require more. A market sector emerged that would pay more for noncage eggs. Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland passed more stringent legislation {{than the rest of}} Europe. A 1999 Direc-tive with details based on advice from the EU’s <b>Scientific</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Committee will phase out conventional laying cages but allow enriched cages. Implementation de-pends on various factors, including negotiations in the World Trade Organization. In the next 10 years, however, major changes to the housing of most laying hens in Eu-rope almost certainly will occur. Similar changes in other countries will follow. As in Europe, change probably will be piecemeal, affected both by public pressure and by all sectors of society: producers, retailers, consumers, legislators, and the media. On June 15, 1999, the new European Union (EU) Directive on welfare of laying hens was passed, which requires conventional laying cages to be phased out by 2012. Enriched laying cages will still be allowed. In this article, I outline how this came about and the scientific, social, economic, and political issues in-volved.

40|$|Title of the paper: Weifare {{assessment}} of segregated early weaning (SEW) in pigs – a review The technology of segregated early weaning (SEW) {{has been established}} primarily in large pig farm enterprises across North America. SEW is characterised by weaning piglets at days 7 to 21 of age (mostly between days 12 to 16) and isolated housing in nurseries and growing / finishing units (multi-site production with all-in all-out pig flow). The goal of this technology is to break the infection chain by utilising acquired maternal (passive) immunity from the dam before piglets develop their own active immunity in response to pathogens. A high Standard of feeding and hygiene management facilitates a superior health Status resulting in improved growth rates. The EU-Report on the welfare Status of intensively housed pigs (<b>SCIENTIFIC</b> <b>VETERINARY</b> COMMITTEE, 1997) suggests that the technology of SEW should be allowed {{only if it is}} demonstrated that any welfare advantages to sows and piglets outweigh the disadvantages. Recent research on the behaviour of piglets showed that piglets weaned before days 21 of age develop higher levels of nosing and chewing each other which persist into the grow/ftnish period. Longer-term consequences of SEW for the reproduetive Performance of sows are not yet sufficiently evaluated, although reduced nursing periods result into reduced litter sizes and piglet weights. That does, however, not exciude that the total number of litters/sow/year increases, resulting in greater number of piglets produced. Considering the EU legislation laying down a minimum weaning age of 21 days, it is recommended that SEW technology could be implemented by utilising the appropriate health management features (multi-site production, all-in all-out). The benefits of isolated housing on health Status and Performance of pigs seem to outweigh the additional advantages of weaning piglets {{at a very early age}} (< 21 days of age) ...|$|R
