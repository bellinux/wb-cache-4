50|$|A {{self-centering}} chuck, {{also known}} as a , uses dogs (usually called jaws), interconnected via a scroll gear (<b>scroll</b> <b>plate),</b> to hold onto a tool or workpiece. Because they most often have three jaws, the term three-jaw chuck without other qualification is understood by machinists to mean a self-centering three-jaw chuck. The term universal chuck also refers to this type. These chucks are best suited to grip circular or hexagonal cross-sections when very fast, reasonably accurate (±0.005 inch mm TIR) centering is desired.|$|E
5000|$|There are hybrid {{self-centering}} chucks {{that have}} adjustment screws {{that can be}} used to further improve the concentricity after the workpiece has been gripped by the scroll jaws. This feature is meant to combine the speed and ease of the <b>scroll</b> <b>plate's</b> self-centering with the run-out eliminating controllability of an independent-jaw chuck. The most commonly used name for this type is a brand name, Set-Tru. To avoid undue genericization of that brand name, suggestions for a generic name have included [...] "exact-adjust".|$|R

50|$|Face cams {{may provide}} {{repetitive}} motion with a groove that forms a closed curve, or may provide function generation with a stopped groove. Cams used for function generation may have grooves that require several revolutions {{to cover the}} complete function, and in this case, the function generally needs to be invertible so that the groove does not self intersect, and the function output value must differ enough at corresponding rotations that there is sufficient material separating the adjacent groove segments. A common form is the constant lead cam, where displacement of the follower is linear with rotation, such as the <b>scroll</b> <b>plate</b> in a scroll chuck. Non-invertible functions, which require the groove to self-intersect, can be implemented using special follower designs.|$|E

40|$|Facetted {{growth of}} snow {{crystals}} {{leads to a}} rich diversity of forms, and exhibits a remarkable sixfold symmetry. Snow crystal structures result from diffusion limited crystal growth {{in the presence of}} anisotropic surface energy and anisotropic attachment kinetics. It is by now well understood that the morphological stability of ice crystals strongly depends on supersaturation, crystal size and temperature. Until very recently {{it was very difficult to}} perform numerical simulations of this highly anisotropic crystal growth. In particular, obtaining facet growth in combination with dendritic branching is a challenging task. We present numerical simulations of snow crystal growth in two and three space dimensions using a new computational method recently introduced by the authors. We present both qualitative and quantitative computations. In particular, a linear relationship between tip velocity and supersaturation is observed. The computations also suggest that surface energy effects, although small, have a larger effect on crystal growth than previously expected. We compute solid plates, solid prisms, hollow columns, needles, dendrites, capped columns and <b>scrolls</b> on <b>plates.</b> Although all these forms appear in nature, most of these forms are computed here for the first time in numerical simulations for a continuum model.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} installing a small-scale organic Rankine cycle system for the generation of electricity in remote areas of developing countries. The Organic Rankine Cycle Systems (ORC) system uses a commercial magnetically-coupled <b>scroll</b> expander, <b>plate</b> type heat exchangers and plunger type working fluid feed pump. The heat source for the ORC system can be solar energy. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to confirm the cycle efficiency and expander power output of the system. Using the actual system data, the exergy destruction on the system components and exergy efficiency were assessed. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} variations of system energy and exergy efficiencies with different operating parameters, such as the evaporating and condensing pressures, degree of superheating, dead state temperature, expander inlet temperature and pressure ratio were illustrated. The system exhibited acceptable operational characteristics with good performance under a wide range of conditions. A heat source temperature of 121 °C is expected to deliver a power output of approximately 1. 4 kW. In addition, the system cost analysis and financing mechanisms for the installation of the ORC system were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{analysis}} {{has been carried}} out on a high side scroll compressor having a fixed scroll equipped with a circular oil groove on its thrust surface. Oil is supplied to the oil groove through an intermittent opening from a high pressure oil reservoir formed inside the orbiting scroll hub. Oil in the groove is then delivered to both suction and back pressure chambers by pressure differentials and viscous pumping action of the orbiting <b>scroll</b> base <b>plate.</b> Mathematical modeling of this oil groove system has been incorporated into main compressor performance simulation program for optimum oil groove design. Pressure in the oil groove can be controlled by changing the oil passage area and oil groove configuration. With an enlarged oil passage, pressure in the oil groove increases due to increased flow rate, but pressure increase in the back pressure chamber is not that large, resulting in reduced friction loss at the thrust surface between the two scrolls. On the other hand, by increasing the oil passage area, oil content in the refrigerant flow increases, and the orbiting scroll stability could be negatively affected by oil groove pressure increase. Considering all these factors, EER could be improved by about 3. 6 % at ARI condition by optimum oil groove design...|$|R

The simulation included the upper main bearing housing, thrust <b>plate,</b> <b>scrolls,</b> dummy and discharge ports, check valve, plenum, and discharge line. The basic geometric features and physical mechan-isms that the scroll compressor performance is associated with were simulated first. The work-ing fluid was Refrigerant 134 a. The suction process was studied {{as a part of}} the integrated working environment. The fundamental mechanism of the suction process was defined. The interaction of the compressor design features was quantified. The overall parameters were cal-culated from the field quantities. The relationship between design details, flow physics, and per-formance characteristics was established. The methodology developed and the data obtained can be applied to the design and optimization of scroll compressors...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the performance of variable thickness scroll compressors, a detail mathematical modeling based on energy and mass balances is established in this two-part. In part I, the geometric modeling and thermodynamic modeling are developed. The profile based on circle involute, high order curve, and arc is built up using the base line method. The volume of working chambers from suction to discharge is defined. Thereafter, the evolution and derivative of the working chamber volume {{with respect to the}} orbiting angle are discussed. The energy and the mass balance for working chamber are described. Suction gas heating, radial and flank leakage, heat transfer between the working fluid, <b>scroll</b> wraps and <b>plates</b> are considered in the thermodynamic modeling.

The dynamical modeling and model validation are reported in part II. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{economical}} {{and political}} pressure {{due to the}} depletion of fossil fuel and global warming potential, {{it is necessary to}} develop more sustainable techniques to provide electrical power. In this context, medium and large scale Organic Rankine Cycle solar power plants appear to be a promising solution because of their good efficiency, robustness and acceptable economical probability. However, only a few ORC solar power plants are in operation today, but technical literature indicate that several demonstration projects are under development. The spreading out of that technology requires, among others, a good knowledge of control strategies of the entire plant comprising the field of parabolic trough collectors, the ORC engine and thermal storage systems. The present project aims at designing, building and testing a small scale ORC solar power plant (a few kWe) in order to define and optimize control strategies that could be applied to larger systems. The paper presents the design step of the solar power plant, and more specifically the ORC engine. This design is defined based on simulation models of the ORC engine and on the experience gained in the Thermodynamics laboratory in the field of testing small-scale ORC systems. The design accounts for technical limitations such as allowed operating ranges and technical maturity of components. The paper first presents the architecture of the envisioned solar plant. The choice of the different technologies of components is justified. Simulation models of components (<b>scroll</b> expander, <b>plate</b> and fin-and-tubes heat exchangers, etc.) and of the whole system are then presented. Based on those models, parametric studies are conducted in order to optimize the sizing and the operating conditions of the system and to select the most appropriate working fluid. Also, the relevance of using two expanders in series is discussed and the control of the ORC engine is investigated. Simulations indicate that ORC engine efficiency close to 12 % can be reached for evaporating and condensing temperatures of 140 °C and 35 °C. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades a strong driving force is {{directed}} to development of the simulation models and methodologies for vapor compression systems and its main components simulation. These models are highly useful as an effective method to predict the system performance and the thermodynamic processes of the vapor compression system under different operating conditions or different componentsâ€™ properties. This paper presents the mathematical model of a reversible heat pump and numerical steady-state simulations with refrigerant R 407 C. Using the information from manufacturer data and real properties of <b>scroll</b> compressor, brazed <b>plate</b> heat exchangers and additionally built-in liquid-vapor heat exchanger, the mathematical model of the thermodynamic and heat transfer processes in its different components is developed in order to predict the operating conditions of the heat pump. With numerical simulations the effect of: the liquid-vapor heat exchanger; number of plates in the evaporator, condenser and desuperheater; different temperatures at condenserâ€™s and evaporatorâ€™s inlet of water and propylene-glycol water mixture; as well as the effect of degree of superheat and degree of subcooling, are analyzed. The final goal is to predict the thermodynamic states, pressure drops, heat transfer rates and system performance of the heat pump and to identify the heat pump configuration which will result in the most adequate operating conditions...|$|R
50|$|The Gloucestershire {{historian}} Ralph Bigland (d.1784) {{identified him}} with the surviving ledger stone set into {{the floor of the}} South aisle of St Laurence's Church, Lechlade, in which he had founded the chantry of St Blaise. The north and south chapels in that church are likely to have been paid for by the Duchess of York and John Twynyho to house the chantries founded in 1472. However more recently it has been suggested as the brass of Robert Hitchman (d. circa 1510). Of the many brasses the ledger stone displayed originally, including effigies of his wife, children, heraldic escutcheons, marginal inscription, two <b>scrolls,</b> and four <b>plates,</b> on which were most probably the evangelistical symbols, and his merchant's mark (a tau cross combined with a Latin cross) only that of a figure representing John Twynyho survives. Only the matrices of the other brasses indicate their positions and shapes. His brass measures 3 ft. 2in. by 9in. He wears long hair but his face is clean shaven. His tunic reaches to his ankles and is faced with fur, a customary garment among the civilians {{at the end of the}} 15th century and commencement of the 16th century. The large open sleeves hide the girdle which most probably he wore. The under-garment is seen at the neck, and again at the wrists, where its sleeves appear to be tightly buttoned. The feet are encased in the large square-toed shoes of the period. The figure is erect and slightly turned to his left with his hands uplifted in a prayerful attitude. The brass is illustrated in Ralph Bigland's Gloucestershire, Vol II, p. 144.|$|R
