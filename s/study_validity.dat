50|$|A {{central issue}} in {{qualitative}} research is trustworthiness (also known as credibility or dependability, or in quantitative <b>studies,</b> <b>validity).</b> There {{are many different}} ways of establishing trustworthiness, including: member check, interviewer corroboration, peer debriefing, prolonged engagement, negative case analysis, auditability, confirmability, bracketing, and balance. Most of these methods are described in Lincoln and Guba (1985). As exemplified by researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg, data triangulation and eliciting examples of interviewee accounts are two of the most commonly used methods of establishing trustworthiness in qualitative studies.|$|R
30|$|The coding {{process was}} {{conducted}} in a two-phase mode reflecting the two-stage analysis. During the first stage, general characteristics of the studies, such as research authors, sample sizes, study dates, research design type, and pretest-posttest scores, were extracted to describe the study features. During the second phase, additional scrutiny took place to more accurately reflect on the stated research questions and seek moderators that might influence {{the strength of the}} effect sizes. The majority of the coding features, including study authors, study publication date, locale, and research design type, were extracted to support the <b>study</b> <b>validity.</b> The formulation of other coding, including grade level, instrumentation, and learning type, was enacted to apply moderator analysis that would lead to answering the supplemental research questions.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the psychometric properties}} of the D-Catch instrument. METHODS: A cross-sectional methodological <b>study.</b> <b>Validity</b> and reliability were estimated with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and internal consistency and inter-rater reliability, respectively. FINDINGS: A sample of 250 nursing documentations was selected. CFA showed the adequacy of a 1 -factor model (chronologically descriptive accuracy) with an outlier item (nursing diagnosis accuracy). Internal consistency and inter-rater reliability were adequate. CONCLUSIONS: The D-Catch is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring the accuracy of nursing documentation. Caution is needed when measuring diagnostic accuracy since only one item measures this dimension. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The D-Catch can be used as an indicator of the accuracy of nursing documentation and the quality of nursing care...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Studies of {{caregivers}} illustrate a classic sampling dilemma: maximizing recruitment without compromising <b>study</b> <b>validity.</b> Because caregivers are defined {{in relation to}} a care recipient, sampling methods are often determined by pragmatic decisions such as access, efficiency, and costs. However, overlooking validity may result in selection bias, misclassification of caregiver status, and the confounding of results. Validity and pragmatic concerns were compared in four caregiver studies that used different sampling frames: community based, Alzheimer’s disease registry, and ancillary studies to existing epidemiologic studies. Methods: Systematic comparison of validity and of pragmatic aspects of sampling frames, recruitment methods, and participation rates, with attention to caregiver identification, inclusion criteria, and sample restriction. Results: All studies used task-based inclusion criteria. Caregiver participation rates ranged from 81 % to 96 %, with higher rates in community-base...|$|E

40|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) affects 2 %– 26 % {{of women}} of reproductive age and is often accompanied by obesity. Modest weight loss reduces health risks and ameliorates effects of the syndrome. Weight loss interventions are mainly of short duration and have limited success. A systematic {{review of the literature}} was carried out to assess the efficacy of long-term (12 months), nonsurgical weight loss interventions for women with PCOS. Fifteen databases were searched, resulting in eight papers that met the search criteria. Comparison of results and meta-analysis was difficult due to heterogeneity of studies. Behavioral components of interventions were poorly described, and compliance was difficult to ascertain. The results suggested that the inclusion of a lifestyle component improves outcomes, but protocols must be clearly described to maintain <b>study</b> <b>validity</b> and to identify successful behavioral strategies...|$|E
