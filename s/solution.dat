One <b>solution</b> circle excludes the given circles that are enclosed by its conjugate <b>solution,</b> and vice versa. For example, in Figure6, one <b>solution</b> circle (pink, upper left) encloses two given circles (black), but excludes a third; conversely, its conjugate <b>solution</b> (also pink, lower right) encloses that third given circle, but excludes the other two. The two conjugate <b>solution</b> circles are related by inversion, by the following argument.|$|E

5|$|Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in {{the study}} of partial {{differential}} equations. For many classes of partial differential equations, such as linear elliptic equations, it is possible to consider a generalized <b>solution</b> (known as a weak <b>solution)</b> by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a <b>solution</b> or, often what is more important, showing that a <b>solution</b> exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic equations, one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical <b>solution</b> of partial differential equations.|$|E

5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in a solvent, it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte <b>solution.</b> As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining <b>solution,</b> and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound.

5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk {{to a point}} P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , which {{is the problem of}} finding a <b>solution</b> circle tangent to the two {{remaining}} given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the <b>solution</b> circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed <b>solution</b> is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such <b>solution</b> lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal homothetic centers of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a <b>solution</b> line into the desired <b>solution</b> circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.|$|E
