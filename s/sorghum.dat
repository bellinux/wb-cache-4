5|$|A {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet <b>sorghum</b> instead of grain <b>sorghum</b> could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food, feed and fuel. With grain <b>sorghum</b> currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet <b>sorghum</b> could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{agriculture}} was {{the major}} profession {{in most of the}} provinces in Zambia. Maize, mixed beans, rice, <b>sorghum,</b> soya beans, sunflower, sweet potatoes and wheat were the major crops in the provinces. Among all provinces, Central had the maximum area, , constituting 20.64 per cent, while Luapula had the smallest area at 3.06 per cent of the total area. Maize production was maximum in Eastern (22.5%), mixed beans (51.66%) in Northern, <b>sorghum</b> in Southern (40.62%), sunflower in Eastern (70.2%), soya beans (45.06%), sweet potatoes (28.5%) and wheat (49.51%) in Central Province.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{plants and}} {{economically}} important plants {{from around the}} world, including bananas, sugar cane, coffee, tea, <b>sorghum,</b> cotton, grasses, and forbs (non-grass plants eaten by livestock); also a collection of weeds arranged in an attractive agricultural setting.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and <b>sorghum)</b> may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with <b>sorghum</b> with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and <b>sorghum</b> are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. <b>Sorghum</b> heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E
5|$|In Ghana, FES is brewed in Kumasi by Guinness Ghana Breweries, {{which is}} 50.5 per cent owned by Diageo. GFE {{is mixed with}} a locally brewed <b>sorghum</b> lager, but it differs from the Nigerian version in that it {{contains}} no wheat and has {{a higher proportion of}} roast barley. In Ghana, the product is believed to have medicinal properties, strengthening the blood and improving circulation.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{feeds on}} a variety of {{different}} produce, including blackberries, blueberries, peaches, pears, apples, prickly pears, chapotes, persimmons, peanuts, watermelons, cantaloupes, and carrots. During the winter and early spring, the coyote eats large quantities of grass, such as green wheat blades. It sometimes eats unusual items such as cotton cake, soybean meal, domestic animal droppings, beans, and cultivated grain such as corn, wheat, and <b>sorghum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main {{agricultural}} {{staple foods}} during the Han dynasty were foxtail millet, proso millet, rice (including glutinous rice), wheat, beans, and barley. Other food items included <b>sorghum,</b> taro, mallow, mustard plant, jujube, pear, plum (including Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), peach, apricot, and myrica. Chicken, duck, goose, beef, pork, rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, crane, and {{various types of}} fish were commonly consumed meats.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} coined by the {{historian}} Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period, including four staple crops, namely durum wheat, Asiatic rice, <b>sorghum,</b> and cotton. He {{also argued that}} techniques such as irrigation were spread across the region at that time. The paper was not based on direct archaeological or scientific evidence, and its approach has been called old-fashioned and philological.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with <b>sorghum,</b> millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
5|$|Francelia's {{rainfall}} {{extended into}} El Salvador, where about 1,000homes were flooded along the Lempa River. Isolated residents along the Paz River required food to be airdropped. The floods damaged corn and <b>sorghum</b> crops, and some livestock were killed. Francelia destroyed 42houses in El Salvador, destroyed a bridge, and caused $1.6million in damage. The hurricane killed two people and injured 40others. Heavy damage also occurred along the Belize coast, and communications were cut. The storm caused extensive damage to crops, including heavy losses to the banana industry. High waves and heavy rainfall caused power outages and flooded coastal roadways.|$|E
5|$|Malawian cuisine is diverse, with tea {{and fish}} being popular {{features}} of the country's cuisine. Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, <b>sorghum,</b> cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy. Lake Malawi {{is a source of}} fish including chambo (similar to bream) usipa (similar to sardine), and mpasa (similar to salmon and kampango). Nsima is a food staple made from ground corn and typically served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. It is commonly eaten for lunch and dinner.|$|E
5|$|Rice and Ragi {{form the}} staple food in South Karnataka, whereas Jolada rotti, <b>Sorghum</b> is staple to North Karnataka. Bisi bele bath, Jolada rotti, Ragi mudde, Uppittu, Benne Dose, Masala Dose and Maddur Vade {{are some of}} the popular food items in Karnataka. Among sweets, Mysore Pak, Karadantu of Gokak and Amingad, Belgaavi Kunda and Dharwad pedha are popular. Apart from this, coastal Karnataka and Kodagu have {{distinctive}} cuisines of their own. Udupi cuisine of coastal Karnataka is popular all over India.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, {{able to be}} saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley. Less widely used starch sources include millet, <b>sorghum</b> and cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others. The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the empire was largely {{dependent}} on agriculture. <b>Sorghum</b> (jowar), cotton, and pulse legumes grew in semi-arid regions, while sugarcane, rice, and wheat thrived in rainy areas. Betel leaves, areca (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as turmeric, pepper, cardamom, and ginger grew in the remote Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of masons, sculptors, and other skilled artisans.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{rice and}} millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, soy and azuki beans. In the Sahel region of Africa, local rice and <b>sorghum</b> were domesticated by 5,000 BC. Kola nut and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with einkorn, emmer, and durum wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, swamp deer, blackbuck, chital, wild ass, wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{also caused}} major effects to marine interests. High waves, {{estimated}} to have exceeded 15ft (4.6m), disabled a sailboat with a crew of six on it. They were quickly rescued after issuing a distress signal to a nearby tanker vessel. The storm caused the loss of 1,799bags of <b>sorghum</b> from water damage when a freighter encountered Josephine en route to Baltimore, Maryland. The major shipping lanes of North America were severely impacted, with more than 25 ships reporting winds of at least 58mph (93km/h) {{over a period of}} nine days. Furthermore, at least five of those ships reported hurricane force winds during a period of six days. The highest wind speed reported from a ship was 92mph (148km/h), which was observed on October16.|$|E
5|$|Over 48% of South India's {{population}} {{is engaged in}} agriculture, which is largely dependent on seasonal monsoons. Some of the main crops cultivated in South India include paddy, <b>sorghum,</b> pearl millet, pulses, sugarcane, cotton, chilli and ragi. Areca, coffee, tea, rubber and spices are cultivated on the hilly regions. The staple food is rice; the delta regions of Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri are amongst the top rice producing areas in the country. Frequent droughts have left farmers debt-ridden, forcing them to sell their livestock and sometimes to commit suicide. The region accounts for 92% of the total Coffee production in India. South India is also a major producer of cotton, tea, rubber, turmeric, mangoes and spices. Other major agriculture related produce include silk and poultry.|$|E
5|$|Over 80% of Chad's {{population}} {{relies on}} subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops grown and {{the locations of}} herds {{are determined by the}} local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of <b>sorghum</b> and millet. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered oases support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, <b>sorghum,</b> tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel affected {{about two-thirds of}} Mexico. The rains from Ingrid caused flooding and landslides across Mexico, causing many rivers to rise, and isolating towns. In Veracruz alone, the rains flooded 68rivers, which damaged 121roads and 31bridges, including two destroyed bridges. About 14,000houses were damaged to some degree. Heavy rainfall forced 23,000people to evacuate their homes, 9,000of whom went to emergency shelters, some forced to leave by the Mexican army in high risk areas. Evacuees who did not reside in shelters generally went to the houses of friends and family. Also in Veracruz, flooding killed about 20,000livestock. Along the coast of Tamaulipas, damage occurred from Soto la Marina to La Pesca. The Pánuco River in Tamaulipas rose above its banks, flooding two poor towns along its path and damaging adjacent roads. Also in the state, the storm damaged local <b>sorghum</b> fields. Two {{people in the state}} required rescue after their truck was swept away by a river.|$|E
5|$|The main {{agricultural}} products of Malawi include tobacco, sugarcane, cotton, tea, corn, potatoes, <b>sorghum,</b> cattle and goats. The main industries are tobacco, tea and sugar processing, sawmill products, cement and consumer goods. The industrial production growth rate {{is estimated at}} 10% (2009). The country makes no significant use of natural gas. , Malawi does not import or export any electricity, but does import all its petroleum, with no production in country. Beginning in 2006, the country began mixing unleaded petrol with 10% ethanol, produced in-country at two plants, to reduce dependence on imported fuel. In 2008, Malawi began testing cars that ran solely on ethanol, and initial results are promising, {{and the country is}} continuing to increase its use of ethanol.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed <b>sorghum,</b> Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|Torrential {{rainfall}} in Honduras caused flooding, which forced 60,000people {{from their}} homes. In addition, 4,000homes were destroyed and 40wooden bridges were washed away. Roads were significantly affected, with six roads {{and the national}} highway damaged in Cortés Department. Damage to the highway infrastructure totaled to approximately $500,000. No.5|work=UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs|date=December 5, 1996|publisher=ReliefWeb|accessdate=March 21, 2013|location=Geneva, Switzerland}} Television broadcast images from La Lima showed houses submerged to their roofs. Flood waters also inundated nearly 50,000acres of banana and fruit plantations owned by Chiquita Brands International. Other crops that sustained damage were maize, beans, <b>sorghum,</b> and rice. Agricultural losses associated with the storm totaled to approximately $7.7million. Along the Caribbean coastline of Honduras, about 1,000shanty houses were destroyed. Overall, Marco caused nine fatalities in the country. In the Pacific and northern regions of Nicaragua, numerous houses washed away in the floods. In addition, Nicaraguan civil defense authorities reported two fatalities. Further north in Guatemala, at least one death occurred, and flood waters damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes. Swollen rivers in Costa Rica flooded several towns and numerous banana plantations.|$|E
5|$|US113Alternate {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with US113 and DE1 (Bay Road) in Little Heaven. Connections from southbound US113Alternate to northbound US113 and DE1 and from southbound US113 and DE1 to northbound US113Alternate {{were provided by}} Mulberrie Point Road. The highway headed northwest as two-lane Clapham Road through the town of Magnolia, where the highway followed Main Street. There, US113Alternate intersected Walnut Street, {{which led to the}} late 18th-century Matthew Lowber House and the Queen Anne–style John B. Lindale House. The highway continued northwest as South State Street to the unincorporated village of Rising Sun, where the highway veered north and intersected DE10Alternate (<b>Sorghum</b> Mill Road). DE10Alternate joined US113Alternate in a concurrency north across Tidbury Creek to DE10Alternate's eastern terminus at their junction with DE10 (Lebanon Road).|$|E
5|$|Watson {{argued that}} the economy {{established}} by Arab and other Muslim traders across the Old World enabled the diffusion of many crops and farming techniques across the Islamic world, {{as well as the}} adaptation of crops and techniques from and to regions outside it. Crops from Africa, such as <b>sorghum,</b> from China, such as citrus fruits, and from India, such as mango, rice, cotton and sugar cane, were distributed throughout Islamic lands, which, in his opinion, had not previously grown these plants. He listed eighteen such crops. He further {{argued that the}}se introductions, along with an increased mechanization of agriculture and irrigation, led to major changes in economy, population distribution, vegetation cover, agricultural production and income, population, urban growth, distribution of the labour force, industries linked to agriculture, cooking, diet and clothing in the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|Zebu, {{a form of}} humped cattle, were {{introduced}} to the island around 1000CE by settlers from east Africa, who also brought <b>sorghum,</b> goats, possibly Bambara groundnut, and other food sources. Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture, they were eaten only rarely, typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals. Fresh zebu milk and curds instead constituted {{a major part of the}} pastoralists' diet. Zebu were kept in large herds in the south and west, but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced, a sizable population of wild zebu established itself in the highlands. Merina oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King Ralambo (ruled 1575–1612), who is credited with the discovery, although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed in the highlands prior to Ralambo's time. It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period, which corresponds with the emergence of complex, structured polities in the highlands.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet <b>sorghum</b> instead of grain <b>sorghum</b> could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide fuel in addition to food and animal feed. With grain <b>sorghum</b> currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet <b>sorghum</b> could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sorghum</b> Festival is {{held every}} year on {{the second and third}} {{weekends}} in October, celebrating the <b>sorghum</b> harvest and showcasing rural mountain culture and skills such as bluegrass music and clogging.|$|E
25|$|Sweet <b>sorghum</b> {{is another}} {{potential}} source of ethanol, and is suitable for growing in dryland conditions. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) is investigating the possibility of growing sorgham {{as a source of}} fuel, food, and animal feed in arid parts of Asia and Africa. Sweet <b>sorghum</b> has one-third the water requirement of sugarcane over the same time period. It also requires about 22% less water than corn (also known as maize). The world’s first sweet <b>sorghum</b> ethanol distillery began commercial production in 2007 in Andhra Pradesh, India.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the land}} {{assigned}} for <b>sorghum</b> cultivation by the Mechanized Farming Corporation had previously been used by pastoralists to graze their animals. One {{of a number of}} pastoral groups whose grazing grounds were encroached upon is the Rashaida in the Kassala area of eastern Sudan. This tribe emigrated from Saudi Arabia to the Sudan in the last century and, because of their relatively recent arrival, their territorial rights have been regarded as tenuous at best. However, as specialized camel breeders, {{they have been able to}} adapt themselves well to the expansion of <b>sorghum</b> cultivation into their grazing grounds. By using <b>sorghum</b> byproducts to feed their camels, they have been able to significantly increase food output per unit area.|$|E
25|$|In {{parts of}} Asia and Africa where {{drylands}} prevail, sweet <b>sorghum</b> {{is being investigated}} as a potential source of food, feed and fuel combined. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in arid conditions, as it only extracts one seventh of the water used by sugarcane. In India, and other places, sweet <b>sorghum</b> stalks are used to produce biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Table sugar (sucrose) {{comes from}} plant sources. Two {{important}} sugar crops predominate: sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and sugar beets (Beta vulgaris), in which sugar {{can account for}} 12% to 20% of the plant's dry weight. Minor commercial sugar crops include the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), <b>sorghum</b> (<b>Sorghum</b> vulgare), and the sugar maple (Acer saccharum). Sucrose is obtained by extraction of these crops with hot water, concentration of the extract gives syrups, from which solid sucrose can be crystallized. In 2013, worldwide production of table sugar amounted to 175 million tonnes.|$|E
