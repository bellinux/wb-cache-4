5|$|The Boeing 747 is a large, {{wide-body}} (two-aisle) airliner {{with four}} wing-mounted engines. The wings {{have a high}} <b>sweep</b> <b>angle</b> of 37.5 degrees for a fast, efficient cruise of Mach0.84 to 0.88, depending on the variant. The sweep also reduces the wingspan, allowing the 747 to use existing hangars. Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3–4–3 seat arrangement (a cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2–3–2 arrangement in first class on the main deck. The upper deck has a 3–3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2–2 arrangement in first class.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} wing sweep, {{the angle of}} the wings in {{relation}} to the fuselage, can be altered in flight at the pilot's control. The variable wing can adopt any <b>sweep</b> <b>angle</b> between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle; some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing-sweep system to reduce pilot workload. When the wings are swept back, the exposed wing area is lowered and drag is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight. The weapons pylons pivot with {{the angle of the}} variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater <b>sweep</b> <b>angle</b> than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{presents}} a preliminary {{investigation into the}} effects of cross-flow on transition at low Reynolds numbers, an area which has essentially remained unexplored. The flow around an infinite SD 7003 wing at an angle of attack of 4 ◦ is considered at a chord Reynolds numbers of 60, 000, and for <b>sweep</b> <b>angles</b> ranging between 0 ◦ and 60 ◦. A separation bubble is present on the upper surface where the flow transitions to turbulence, and both Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves and cross-flow instabilities are observed. The level of coupling between cross-flow and streamwise boundary layer velocity components is evaluated by projecting them along two-dimensional equivalent directions. It is established that the cross-flow cannot be decoupled from the streamwise evolution for <b>sweep</b> <b>angles</b> between about 10 ◦ and 40 ◦ due to strong non-linear interactions that take place after the laminar boundary layer separates. Hence, in separation-induced transition at low Reynolds numbers, {{it is not possible}} to treat streamwise and cross-flow instabilities independently for wings at intermediate <b>sweep</b> <b>angles,</b> and predicting the mixed transition cannot be reduced to treating the disturbances of each component separately.

The normal flow past a circular cylinder is a more canonical case and testing was undertaken at high speeds on a 37. 23 mm diameter cylinder and at low speeds on a 152 mm diameter cylinder. The lateral spacing between streaks on cylinders had been predicted by Kestin and Wood and the present tests gave excellent agreement with their theory.
