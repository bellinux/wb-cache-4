40|$|In 1998 it {{was noted}} that 40, 838 {{additional}} steelhead were counted at John Day Dam than at The Dalles Dam. The Dalles Dam is located downstream of John Day Dam and therefore all adult steelheads must pass The Dalles Dam prior to passing over John Day Dam. Also, above The Dalles Dam, there is an active gill net fishery and a major tributary (The Deschutes River) that can further reduce numbers of fish available to pass John Day Dam. Therefore adult steelhead counts at The Dalles Dam should be greater than at John Day Dam. Conversion rates of steelhead, based on dam counts between The Dalles and John Day dams, indicate that the problem did not occur until 1998. In that year, the spill pattern and volumes were changed at John Day due to installation of flow deflectors in the <b>spill</b> <b>basin.</b> In 1999 and 2000 The Corps of Engineers Fisheries Field Unit installed video recorders in the count stations at John Day and The Dalles to evaluate if the problem was associated with counting error or a differential in nighttime passage between the two dams. In 1999, the difference between the dam counts could be explained by over counting at John Day but in 2000, {{it was a combination of}} over counting at John Day an...|$|E
40|$|Evaluations {{of adult}} fish passage at Ice Harbor and Lower Monumental Dams were {{conducted}} from 12 April to 16 June 1982. Each fishway entrance was monitored with electronic fish detectors and chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were radio tracked {{in the projects}} 2 ̆ 7 tailraces and fish collection systems. An additional study with electronic detectors was conducted from 23 August though 10 October 1982 at Lower Monumental Dam. The study was conducted during a year of unusually high spring river flows. High spill levels and reductions in powerhouse discharge were characteristic during the spring study at both projects; therefore, results may not fully describe fish behavior during all conditions of project operation. Spill did not occur during the fall study at Lower Monumental. Radio tagged fish characteristically held in areas several hundred feet downstream of the powerhouse at both projects. The behavior was related to high spill and low powerhouse discharge conditions {{and may have been}} a response to tailrace eddies that developed during these conditions. The most frequently used entrance into the Ice Harbor fishway under all conditions except low powerhouse discharge was located {{at the north end of}} the powerhouse next to the spillway. The next most frequently used entrance, and the most frequently used entrance during low powerhouse discharge, was on the shore at the south end of the powerhouse. The most commonly used entrance to the Lower Monumental fishway was on the shore at the north end of the powerhouse. The entrances at the south end of the Lower Monumental powerhouse, next to the spillway, had either net fallout or low net entry. The use of submerged orifice entrances along the powerhouse generally decreased with increased distance from the shore at both projects. Radio tagged fish moved both up and down the collection channels and held at the ends of the channels, particularly at the north end of the Ice Harbor fishway and near the base of the Lower Monumental powerhouse fish ladder. Also, tagged fish sometimes backed down the fish ladders, especially at the Ice Harbor powerhouse ladder. Several operational conditions were assessed at both projects. The operation of the ice and trash sluiceway at Ice Harbor was associated with decreased entry at the south end of the powerhouse and increased entry along the submerged orifice entrances. The entrances at the south end of the Lower Monumental powerhouse were opened in several combinations during the spring and fall research seasons to study the net fallout phenomenon at the entrances. Net fallout or very low net entry continued at the two entrances facing downstream into the tailrace during all conditions in the spring and fall. Net entry occurred at the entrance facing the <b>spill</b> <b>basin</b> during all conditions in the fall. Radio tagged fish were delayed a median of 118. 6 hours at Ice Harbor and 44. 8 hours at Lower Monumental. Probable causes of delay included holding downstream of the dams, fallout at the south end of the Lower Monumental fishway, fish backing down fish ladders and falling back over dams, holding at extensive movement in the collection channels, and recovery from handling and tagging stress...|$|E

40|$|To {{assist in}} {{deriving}} biological specifications for design of turbine rehabilitation measures, new ''fish-friendly'' turbines, and spillway designs and operations, {{scientists at the}} Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed and tested an autonomous multi-sensor device called a Sensor Fish that can acquire pressure and tri-axial linear acceleration data during passage through severe hydraulic conditions. The purpose of the Sensor Fish is to characterize physical conditions fish experience during passage through hydro turbines, <b>spill</b> stilling <b>basins,</b> high-discharge outfalls, and other dam passage routes. The Sensor Fish was developed {{with the support of}} the U. S. Department of Energy's Advanced Hydropower Turbine System program. Field tests of the Sensor Fish at Rock Island, McNary, The Dalles, Bonneville, and Wanapum dams on the Columbia River and the Prosser Irrigation District on the Yakima River have shown that the device can withstand the severe environments of turbine, spill, and fish bypass passage and provide useful environmental data that can ultimately aid in the design and operation of new and existing turbines, spill, and dam fish bypass facilities...|$|R
40|$|Consider rain falling at {{a uniform}} rate onto a terrain T {{represented}} as a triangular irregular network. Over time, water collects in the basins of T, forming lakes that <b>spill</b> into adjacent <b>basins.</b> Our goal is to compute, for each terrain vertex, the time this vertex is flooded (covered by water). We present an I/O-efficient algorithm that solves this problem using O(sort(X) log(X/M) + sort(N)) I/Os, where N {{is the number of}} terrain vertices, X is the number of pits of the terrain, sort(N) is the cost of sorting N data items, and M is the size of the computer’s main memory.

40|$|Occurrence of intraslope basins and {{distinct}} seismic faices assemblages {{of the basin}} fills in the Kaoping Slope, offshore SW Taiwan, reflect interactions between regional convergent tectonics, local mud diapirism and sedimentary processes of fill-and-spill during slope development. Located west of the Kaoping Submarine Canyon, three major intraslope basins separated by diapiric mud ridges mainly trending NNE-SSW are determined. They are elongated depressions with a length ranging from 10 to 40 km and a width of about 12 km, similar to intraslope basins east of the Kaoping Canyon. Basin fills are characterized by a distinct upward change in seismic facies beginning with a basal convergent-baselapping facies, succeeded by chaotic facies and overlain by parallel and draping facies. The basal convergent-baselapping facies {{is the most common}} and the parallel and draping facies is restricted to slope areas shallower than 1000 m in water depth. Sediments from the prograding shelf and upper slope are transported and deposited mainly in the confined basal accommodation space of intraslope basins, forming convergent-baselapping seismic facies in the early stage of the basin fill history. Rates of deposition being slower than rates of basin subsidence due to local mud diapirism kept the early intraslope basins partially filled by sediment, representing a confined style of deposition. In the late stage of basin development sediments have been transported to a lower slope distal to the sediment sources, progressively filling and <b>spilling</b> intraslope <b>basins</b> in a generally southwestward direction...|$|R
40|$|An {{infiltration}} basin is a shallow impoundment {{that is designed}} to infiltrate stormwater. Infiltration basins use the natural filtering ability of the soil to remove pollutants in stormwater runoff. Infiltration facilities store runoff until it gradually infiltrates into the soil and eventually into the water table. This practice has high pollutant removal efficiency and can also help recharge groundwater, thus helping to maintain low flows in stream systems. Infiltration basins can be challenging to apply on many sites, however, because of soils requirements. In addition, some studies have shown relatively high failure rates compared with other management practices. Inspection/Maintenance Considerations Infiltration basins perform better in well-drained permeable soils. Infiltration basins in areas of low permeability can clog within a couple years, and require more frequent inspections and maintenance. The use and regular maintenance of pretreatment BMPs will significantly minimize maintenance requirements for the <b>basin.</b> <b>Spill</b> response procedures and controls should be implemented to prevent spills from reaching the infiltration system...|$|R

40|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are {{often found in}} oily wastewaters. Their presence is usually the result of human activities and has {{a negative effect on}} the environment. One important step in addressing this problem is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} PAH removal by biological processes since these are the most cost-effective treatments known today. Many techniques are presently available for PAH determination in wastewaters. Solid phase microextracion (SPME) is known to be one of the most effective techniques for this purpose. When analyzing complex matrices with substances such as natural organic matter (NOM) and non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL), it is important to differentiate the free dissolved PAH from matrix-bonded PAH. PAHs associated with the bonded fraction are less susceptible to biological treatment. The present study concerns the development of a simple and suitable methodology for the determination of the freely dissolved and the total fraction of PAHs present in oily wastewaters. The methodology was then applied to an oily wastewater from a fuel station retention basin. Material and methods Headspace SPME was used for analyzing PAH since the presence of a complex or dirty matrix in direct contact with the fiber may damage it. Four model PAHs—anthracene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene—were analyzed by GC-MS. Negligible depletion SPME technique was used to determine the free fraction. Total PAH was determined by enhancing the mass transfer from the bonded phase to the freely dissolved phase by temperature optimization and the use of the method of standard additions. The PAH absorption kinetics were determined in order to define the optimal sampling conditions for this method. The fitting of the experimental data to a mathematical model was accomplished using Berkeley Madonna software. Humic acid and silicon oil were used as model NOM and NAPL, respectively, to study the effect of these compounds on the decrease of SPME response. Then, the method was evaluated with wastewater from a fuel station <b>spill</b> retention <b>basin.</b> Results The SPME kinetic parameters—k 1 (uptake rate), k 2 (desorption rate), and K SPME (partition coefficient) —were determined from experimental data modeling. The determination of the free fraction required 15 -min sampling to ensure that PAH depletion from sample was below 1 %. For total PAH, a 30 -min extraction at 100 °C ensured the maximum signal response in the GC-MS. For the determination of free and total PAHs, extractions were performed before reaching the SPME equilibrium. The wastewater used in this study had no free fraction of the analyzed PAHs. However, the four studied PAHs were found when the method for total PAH was used. Discussion The addition of NOM and NAPL dramatically decreased the efficiency of the SPME. This decrease was the result of a greater partition of the PAHs to the NAPL and NOM phases. This fact was also observed in the analysis of the fuel station <b>spill</b> retention <b>basin,</b> where no free PAH was measured. However, using the method of standard addition for the determination of total PAH, it was possible to quantify all four PAHs. Conclusions The method developed in the present study was found to be adequate to differentiate between free and total PAH present in oily wastewater. It was determined that the presence of NOM and NAPL had a negative effect on SPME efficiency. Recommendations and perspectives The presence of binding substances had a great influence on SPME kinetics. Therefore, it is of extreme importance to determine their degree of interference when analyzing oily wastewaters or results can otherwise be erroneous. Other factors influencing the total PAH determinations should be considered in further studies. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) - SFRH/BD/ 18816 / 2004, POCI/AMB/ 61044 / 200...|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that if an oil spill akin to that of the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico (2010) {{occurred}} in the Basin, the environmental repercussions could be even worse. The Deepwater spill was due to the failure of the blowout preventer - a failure which may be attributed to the great depth of the well. The current Chevron well in the Basin is almost twice as deep as the Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf, possibly posing increased risk for blowout preventer failure. Methane hydrate crystals, which form in low temperatures and high pressure, formed and prevented early attempts to plug the Gulf well. This pressure is doubled in the Basin due to the increased ocean depth. Any rigs to drill a relief well in the event of similar <b>spill</b> in the <b>Basin</b> would have to be brought in from other areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico. This increased wait time for a relief well to be drilled as well as the typically harsh weather conditions of the North Atlantic would make a spill in this region particularly difficult.|$|R
