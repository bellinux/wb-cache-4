5|$|An {{agreement}} was reached between Elizabeth's and Polish delegates in Sieradz on 26 February 1383. The queen dowager thereby proposed her youngest daughter Hedwig as Louis' successor in Poland, and absolved the Polish nobles from their 1382 oaths to Mary and Sigismund. She agreed to send Hedwig to be crowned in Kraków but requested that, in view of her age, she spend three more years in Buda following the ceremony. The Poles, entangled in a bloody civil war, initially conceded to the requirement, but soon found it unacceptable for their monarch to reside abroad for so long. At the second meeting in Sieradz, held on 28 March, they contemplated offering the crown to Hedwig's distant relative, Duke SiemowitIV of Masovia. They eventually opted against it, but at the third Sieradz meeting, on 16 June, Siemowit himself decided to lay claim to the crown. Elizabeth reacted by having an army of 12,000 men devastate Masovia in August, forcing him to drop his pretensions. Meanwhile, {{she realized that she}} could not expect the nobles to accept her request and instead resolved to delay Hedwig's departure. Despite continuous Polish demands to expedite her arrival, Hedwig did not move to Kraków until the end of August 1384. She was crowned on 16 October 1384. No regent was appointed, and the 10-year-old exercised her authority according to the advice of Kraków magnates. Elizabeth never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|This set {{of events}} made Ada famous in Victorian society. Byron {{did not have}} a {{relationship}} with his daughter, and never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b> He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life. Ada was not shown the family portrait of her father (covered in green shroud) until her twentieth birthday. Her mother became Baroness Wentworth in her own right in 1856.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 1541 Cranmer {{revealed}} {{these matters}} {{in a letter}} to the King. The King immediately ordered that the Queen be confined to her apartments, and never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b> The Dowager Duchess, hearing reports of what had happened while Catherine had been under her lax guardianship, reasoned that 'If there be none offence sithence the marriage, she cannot die for that was done before'. Unfortunately for the Queen and the Dowager Duchess, further investigations by Cranmer and the Council revealed that with the connivance of one of her attendants, Lady Rochford, Catherine had allegedly had an affair with Thomas Culpeper, one of the King's favourite gentlemen of the privy chamber, after her marriage to the King.|$|E

50|$|A {{re-examination}} of {{her case}} resulted in her release in 1904. She supported herself through various occupations {{until her death}} on 23 October 1941. From her initial incarceration until her death, she never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> children <b>again.</b>|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} {{events of}} Smart's confinement are unknown. He {{may have been}} in a private madhouse before St Luke's and later moved from St Luke's to Mr Potter's asylum until his release. At St Luke's, he transitioned from being [...] "curable" [...] to [...] "incurable", and was moved to Mr Potter's asylum for monetary reasons. During Smart's confinement time, his wife Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland. There is no record that he ever <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b> His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote Jubilate Agno.|$|E
500|$|While {{some historians}} believe that Oppenheimer had an extramarital affair with Tatlock {{while he was}} working on the Manhattan Project, others assert he met with Tatlock only once after he was picked to head the Los Alamos Laboratory in mid-June 1943. On June 14, 1943, Oppenheimer was in Berkeley to recruit David Hawkins as an {{administrative}} assistant. They went to a Mexican restaurant in her green 1935 Plymouth coupe, and spent the night together at her San Francisco apartment at 1405 Montgomery Street. All the while, U.S. Army agents, waiting in the street outside, had them under surveillance. [...] At that meeting she told him that she still loved him and wanted to be with him. He never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The seven-year-old Mademoiselle <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> father <b>again</b> in October 1634. For {{the first}} time in two years she met him at Limours, where seeing him she [...] "flung herself into his arms". Gaston resided at Blois where Mademoiselle would be a {{frequent}} visitor.|$|R
500|$|Her parents' {{relationship}} was quarrelsome; Marguerite Louise took every chance to humiliate Cosimo. On one documented occasion, she branded him [...] "a poor groom" [...] {{in the presence}} of the Papal nuncio. The enmity between them continued until 26 December 1674; after all attempts at conciliation failed, a stressed Cosimo consented to his wife's departure for the Convent of Montmartre, France. The contract created that day revoked her privileges as a petite fille de France, and declared that upon her death all her assets were to be inherited by her children. Cosimo granted her a pension of 80,000 livres in compensation. She abandoned Tuscany in June 1675; Anna Maria Luisa never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b> Although Cosimo doted on his daughter, she was raised by her paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
500|$|Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking {{but never}} held {{a job for}} very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many {{vaudeville}} theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name. At the Trocadero club, a converted cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool, he first saw an [...] "auburn-haired girl with a bright smile and high cheekbones"; Julia Stanley. [...] He <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again</b> in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Lennon, who {{was dressed in a}} bowler hat and with a cigarette holder in hand, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. Julia (14 years old) said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old Alf replied that she looked [...] "lovely", and sat down next to her. She asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly threw it straight into the Sefton Park lake.|$|E
500|$|Catherine had {{at least}} taken the {{precaution}} of marrying Margaret, her youngest daughter, to Navarre. Margaret, however, became almost {{as much of a}} thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers. Catherine sent Pomponne de Bellièvre to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again. She retreated to her property at Agen and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough [...] "to put food on her table". Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the Château d'Usson. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret. Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
50|$|One grandson, Martín, {{was born}} in captivity. Oesterheld's widow, Elsa Sánchez, learned about the boy and {{recovered}} him from government custody, although she never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> daughter <b>again.</b> She raised Martin.

500|$|Shelley {{wrote to}} his wife Mary that Allegra looked pale and quiet {{when he saw her}} in 1818. When he <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again</b> in 1821 at the Capuchin convent in Bagnacavallo, when she was four, he again felt she looked pale and {{delicate}} and was infuriated by the Roman Catholic education she was receiving, though he had initially told Byron he approved of her being sent to a convent. [...] "(Besides) Paradise & angels ... she has a prodigious list of saints—and is always talking of the Bambino ... The idea of bringing up so sweet a creature in the midst of such trash till Sixteen!" [...] he wrote." [...] However, though Shelley thought the little girl was more serious and contemplative than he remembered, he said she had not lost her [...] "excessive vivacity." [...] After five months in the convent school, her behaviour had also improved; she obeyed the nuns readily and was well-disciplined, though Shelley didn't think the nuns had been too severe with her. The child asked Shelley to [...] "tell her mother she wanted a kiss and a gold dress and would he please beg her Papa and Mammina to visit her." [...] Allegra no longer had any real memory of Clairmont, but had grown attached to [...] "her Mammina," [...] Byron's mistress Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, who had mothered her. Teresa gave the little girl her own childhood toys and played with her when she spent weeks recovering from a childhood illness.|$|E
2500|$|William Fisher {{was killed}} in a riding {{accident}} when John was 15. John's relationship with his mother Sophie suffered from their separation, and he never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b> However, he continued to send her an allowance until her death. In 1870, she suggested visiting Fisher in England, but he dissuaded her as strongly as he could. Fisher wrote to his wife: [...] "I hate the very thought of it and really, I don't want to see her. I don't see why I should as I haven't the slightest recollection of her." ...|$|E
