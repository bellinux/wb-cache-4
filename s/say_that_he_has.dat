5|$|After {{frequently}} {{collaborating with}} rapper Wiz Khalifa, Juicy J joined Taylor Gang Records in December 2011 as a part-owner and A representative. Soon after he started recording {{for his next}} studio album. On March 7, 2012, Juicy J stated his third studio album would be titled Stay Trippy. He went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> recorded many songs with rap group Odd Future. In late November 2012, Juicy J announced the album would be released in February 2013 and indicated an interest in working with Nas, Dr. Dre and Jay-Z. He also {{went on to say}} the album was almost finished. Juicy J had stated he recorded around 80 songs for the project, which were mostly recorded in hotel rooms while on tour. Complex ranked the album at number 22 on their list of the 50 most anticipated albums of 2013.|$|E
5|$|After this {{demonstration}} of power, AJ is promoted by his manager. A montage of AJ being promoted for doing absurd tasks follows. Soon, AJ is promoted to a rank {{with a private}} office. Danny and Morgan refuse to work for AJ further, finding him corrupt with power. AJ throws them out, and afterward he is promoted to CEO by a former officer—a decrepit man within a robotic business suit. AJ floats {{to the top of}} the suit, from which he spots a beach ball-destroying machine to the side. He hallucinates the beach balls as the heads of Morgan and Danny, who <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> destroyed the spirit of summer. Realizing his mistake, AJ rejects the promotion. He returns to his friends outside, and together they plan the rest of their summer.|$|E
25|$|In a {{statement}} released on November 28, 2005, Dorgan responded by asserting {{that he has}} never personally met Jack Abramoff, nor has he ever received money from Abramoff. Dorgan did acknowledge receiving money from Abramoff's clients, but the donations began prior to their involvement with Abramoff. Dorgan's statement went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> supported the programs that benefited Abramoff's clients years prior to the contribution.|$|E

25|$|The Polovtsian army {{returns in}} triumph singing the praise of Khan Gzak (Polovtsian March). Konchak sings of the sack of Putivl and other {{victories}} and confidently predicts {{that they will}} soon capture all of Russia. Igor and his son Vladimir have their worst fears confirmed by the new captives. Vladimir and the other prisoners urge Igor to escape, but he is at first reluctant, singing of his shame and {{saying that it is}} the duty of the other Russian princes to save the homeland (Igor's Monologue, Mariinsky edition only). Ovlur now arrives to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> prepared horses for Igor and Vladimir and Igor now agrees to escape. The distressed Konchakovna comes, challenging Vladimir to show his love by either taking her with him or by staying. Igor urges his son to come, but Vladimir feels unable to leave Konchakovna who threatens to wake the camp. Eventually Igor flees alone and Konchakovna sounds the alarm. She and her father refuse to let the Polovtsy kill Vladimir. Instead Konchak orders the death of the guards and marries Vladimir to his daughter. As for Igor, Konchak thinks more of him for his escape.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{they visit}} Johnny at the {{hospital}} when he is in critical condition. On their way home, Pony spots Cherry and they talk. Cherry says she is unwilling to visit Johnny in the hospital because he killed her boyfriend. Pony calls her a traitor, but after explaining herself, they come to good terms. After escaping the hospital, Dally shows up {{just in time for}} the rumble. The Greasers win the fight. Afterward, Pony and Dally hurry back to see Johnny. He dies while they are in the hospital and a maniacal Dally runs out of the room. Pony returns home that night feeling confused and disoriented. Dally calls the house to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> robbed a store and is running from the police. The Greasers find him, but see that Dally is pointing an unloaded gun at the police. They shoot Dally and he dies instantly. Ponyboy becomes overwhelmed and faints. He regains consciousness and is sick in bed for several days due to a concussion. When the hearing finally approaches, the judge is generous and Pony is free from responsibility for Bob’s death. Pony will be allowed to remain at home with Darry and Soda.|$|E

Boniface sends the pallium with this letter, adding {{that it is only}} to be worn when celebrating [...] "the Holy Mysteries".|$|E
500|$|Though an {{accomplished}} comic, Hardee was arguably more highly {{regarded as a}} [...] "character", a compère and talent-spotting booker at his own clubs, particularly The Tunnel Club in Greenwich, South East London, which gave vital and early exposure to up-and-coming comedians {{during the early years}} of British alternative comedy. In its obituary, The Times opined that [...] "throughout his life he maintained a fearlessness and an indifference to consequences" [...] and one journalist claimed: [...] "To <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no shame is to drastically exaggerate the amount of shame that he has". In a publicity quote printed in Hardee's autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake, Arthur Smith wrote that Hardee had [...] "led his life as though for the perfect autobiography and now he has paid himself the compliment of writing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Coward was {{homosexual}} but, {{following the}} convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned. The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 {{was close to}} an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: [...] "Forty years ago he was Slightly in Peter Pan, and you might <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been wholly in Peter Pan ever since. No private considerations {{have been allowed to}} deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." [...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still a few old ladies in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E

500|$|Henry married Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont in February 1575, {{two days}} after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a {{political}} marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal nuncio Salviati observed, [...] "it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring... physicians and {{those who know him}} well <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> an extremely weak constitution and will not live long." [...] As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, Francis, Duke of Alençon, known as [...] "Monsieur", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion. Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Abbie Hoffman {{appears as}} a {{commentator}} in the documentary and addresses some points raised in Davis's speech, stating: [...] "It's rather arrogant of Rennie to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> found God and has his Telex number in his wallet." [...] The TVTV crew interviewed different [...] "premies", or followers of Prem Rawat, throughout the film, and one teenage boy is shown stating: [...] "Before I came to the Guru I was a freak, smoking dope and dropping out – and my parents were happier then than they are with this." [...] In a later part of the film, a loudspeaker voice announces: [...] "Those premies who came in private cars can leave now. Those who came in rented buses can stay and meditate until further notice." [...] Adherents of other belief systems also appear in the documentary, including a born-again Christian who criticizes devotees for [...] "following the devil", and a Hare Krishna follower.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Mac and Sonny, whose name derives from [...] "son", {{is central to}} the film's exploration of the father–child theme. Sonny tries to conjure an image of his biological father, whom he never had the chance to know, through old photographs, his mother's memories and visits to his father's grave. Sonny finds a father figure in Mac—when another young boy asks Sonny if he likes Mac more than his real father, Sonny says that he does, because he never knew the other man; Briley says that this [...] "emphasizes the distinction between companionship and blood relationship Foote has pointed out before." [...] The final scene, in which Mac and Sonny play catch with a football Mac bought him as a gift, symbolizes the fact that although Mac has lost the chance to reconcile with his daughter, he now has a second chance at establishing a father–child relationship with Sonny. The father–child theme also plays out through Mac's relationship with the young band members, who <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been an inspiration to them, playing a paternal role in their lives before they even met him. Sledge eventually teams up with the musicians, offering them fatherly counsel in a much more direct way.|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} book, Calvin {{describes}} how the spiritual union of Christ and humanity is achieved. He first defines faith as the firm and certain knowledge of God in Christ. The immediate effects of faith are repentance and the remission of sin. This is followed by spiritual regeneration, which returns the believer {{to the state of}} holiness before Adam's transgression. Complete perfection is unattainable in this life, and the believer should expect a continual struggle against sin. Several chapters are then devoted to the subject of justification by faith alone. He defined justification as [...] "the acceptance by which God regards us as righteous whom he has received into grace." [...] In this definition, it is clear that it is God who initiates and carries through the action and that people play no role; God is completely sovereign in salvation. Near the end of the book, Calvin describes and defends the doctrine of predestination, a doctrine advanced by Augustine in opposition to the teachings of Pelagius. Fellow theologians who followed the Augustinian tradition on this point included Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther, though Calvin's formulation of the doctrine went further than the tradition that went before him. The principle, in Calvin's words, is that [...] "All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been predestinated to life or to death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{aspect of}} Milton's God {{is that he}} is {{material}}. This is not to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a human form, as Milton states, [...] "God in his most simple nature is a SPIRIT." [...] However, such [...] "spirits" [...] to Milton, as with many of his contemporaries like Thomas Hobbes, are a type of material. God, from his material essence, is able to establish all other matter and then manipulate that matter to create forms and beings.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of Peña Nieto's {{security}} strategy, however, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> offered [...] "little sense" [...] {{in exactly}} how he will reduce the violence. During the three-month campaign, Peña Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wonder whether Peña Nieto is holding back politically sensitive details in his security strategy or simply does not know yet how he will squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in Mexico's drug war. Moreover, U.S. officials are worried that the return of Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) after ruling Mexico for 71 years [...] may mean returning to the old PRI tactics of [...] "corruption [...] backroom deals" [...] with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace. Peña Nieto denies that he will negotiate with the cartels.|$|E

2500|$|Beckmesser, still sore {{from his}} drubbing the night before, enters the workshop. He spots the verses of the Prize Song, written in Sachs's handwriting, and infers that Sachs is {{secretly}} planning {{to enter the}} contest for Eva's hand. The cobbler re-enters the room and Beckmesser confronts him with the verses and asks if he wrote them. Sachs confirms that the handwriting is his, but does not clarify {{that he was not}} the author but merely served as scribe. [...] However, he goes on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no intention of wooing Eva or entering the contest, and he presents the manuscript to Beckmesser as a gift. He promises never to claim the song for his own, and warns Beckmesser that it is a very difficult song to interpret and sing. Beckmesser, his confidence restored by the prospect of using verses written by the famous Hans Sachs, ignores the warning and rushes off to prepare for the song contest. Sachs smiles at Beckmesser's foolishness but expresses hope that Beckmesser will learn to be better in the future.|$|E
2500|$|When Mark goes to Much Deeping {{with the}} famous mystery writer, Ariadne Oliver, to a village fete {{organised}} by his cousin, he learns of a house converted from an old inn called the Pale Horse, now inhabited by three modern [...] "witches" [...] led by Thyrza Grey. Visiting houses in the area, he meets a wheelchair-using man, Mr Venables, who has no apparent explanation for his substantial wealth. He also visits the Pale Horse, where Thyrza discusses with Mark the ability to kill at a distance, which she claims to have developed. In retrospect it seems to Mark {{that she has been}} outlining to him a service that she would be willing to provide. In the police investigation, there is a witness, Zachariah Osborne, who describes a man seen following Father Gorman shortly before the murder. Later, he contacts the police to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> seen this same man in a wheelchair: it is Venables. When he learns that Venables suffered from polio and is incapable of standing due to atrophy of the legs, Osborne is nonetheless certain of his identification and begins to suggest ways that Venables could have faked his own disability.|$|E
2500|$|The Thought Police capture Winston {{along with}} Julia in their rented room. The two are then {{delivered}} to the Ministry of Love (Miniluv) for interrogation. Mr. Charrington, the shopkeeper who rented the room to them, reveals himself as a Thought Police agent. O'Brien is also {{an agent of the}} Thought Police. He is part of a special sting operation used by the police to find and arrest suspected thoughtcriminals. Winston is placed in a prison cell with Parsons, who had been reported by his children and believes himself to be guilty. O'Brien interrogates and tortures Winston with electroshock, telling Winston that he can [...] "cure" [...] himself of his [...] "insanity"—his manifest hatred for the Party—through controlled manipulation of perception. Winston is held in the prison for an unspecified length of time, and confesses to crimes that O'Brien tells him to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> committed, but O'Brien understands that Winston has not betrayed Julia. After awakening from a nightmare in which he confesses his love for Julia, O'Brien sends him to Room 101 for the final stage of re-education, a room which contains each prisoner's worst fear. Winston shouts [...] "Do it to Julia!" [...] as a wire cage holding hungry rats is fitted onto his face, thus betraying her.|$|E
