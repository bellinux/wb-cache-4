50|$|A chignon is a {{temporary}} swelling left on an infant's head after a ventouse <b>suction</b> <b>cap</b> {{has been used to}} deliver him or her. It is not a sign of serious injury and may take as little as two hours or as long as two weeks to disappear.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEndoscopic mucosal {{resection}} (EMR) technique with <b>suction</b> <b>cap</b> is {{a simpler}} and easier refinement of EMR methods. The technique requires a specialized transparent cap that is fitted {{to the tip}} of an endoscope. Here the EMR technique with <b>suction</b> <b>cap</b> is demonstrated. This article is part of an expert video encyclopedia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{numerical}} simulation of contact between compliant gripping element and rigid object of handling. Compliant gripping element is represented with a rubber <b>suction</b> <b>cap</b> and the handling object is comprised by rigid plate. Contact is researched under various load conditions taking account to chosen material of <b>suction</b> <b>cap</b> that is characterized with nonlinear dependence between strain and stress. For the purpose of the numerical simulation of this kind of solved problem the time-tested MSC MARC software allowing high non-linearity {{to be taken into account}} has been used in our department. Key words: FEM, simulation, contact task, elastic deformation...|$|E
5000|$|The moulded [...] "disc" [...] (referred to as a 'green' disc, lacking final processing) {{is removed}} from the mould by vacuum handling; {{high-speed}} robot arms with vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>caps.</b> They are moved onto the finishing line infeed conveyor, or cooling station, in preparation for metallisation. At this point the discs are clear and contain all the digital information desired; however they cannot be played because there is no reflective layer.|$|R
40|$|BRAHSS is a {{major project}} aimed at {{understanding}} how humpback whales respond to noise, particularly from seismic air gun arrays. It also aims to infer the longer term biological significance of the responses from the results and knowledge of normal behaviour. The aim is to provide the information that will allow seismic surveys to be conducted efficiently with minimal impact on whales. It also includes {{a study of the}} response to ramp-up in sound level. Ramp-up is widely used at the start of operations as a mitigation measure intended to cause whales to move away, but there is little information to show that it is effective. BRAHSS involves four experiments with migrating humpback whales off the east and west coasts of Australia with noise exposures ranging from a single air gun to a full seismic array. Two major experiments have been completed off the east coast, the second involving 70 scientists. Whale movements were tracked using theodolites on two high points ashore and behavioural observations were made from these points and from three small vessels and the source vessel. Vocalising whales were tracked underwater with an array of hydrophones. These and other moored acoustic receivers recorded the sound field at several points throughout the area. Tags (DTAGs) were attached to whales with <b>suction</b> <b>caps</b> for periods of several hours. Observation...|$|R
40|$|Bend-twist {{coupling}} {{behavior is}} induced in a blade by displacing the <b>suction</b> side spar <b>cap</b> towards the leading edge, {{and the pressure}} side one in the opposite direction. Additional couplings are introduced by rotating the spar cap fibers. The structural configuration of the blade is optimized using an automated design environment. The resulting blade shows significant benefits in terms of mass and loads {{when compared to the}} baseline uncoupled one. Finally, the lightweight design concept is used to increase the rotor size, resulting in a larger energy yield for the same hub loads...|$|R

It has been projected the technology to execution CAM of the landmark where they revealed aspects of processing sequence and technological parameters...|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by <b>suction.</b> Diaphragms and <b>caps</b> are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10â€“13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|R
