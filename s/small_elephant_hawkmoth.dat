Of the 23 butterfly species recorded at Murlough, the marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia), is of European importance - other notable species include dark-green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), grayling (Hipparchia semele) and cryptic wood white (Leptidea juvernica). One species, the wall brown butterfly (Lasiommata megera) has not been recorded {{for several years and}} is considered extinct at this site. Over 660 species of moth have been recorded within the boundary of Murlough Nature Reserve, more than at any other site in Northern Ireland - notable examples include <b>small</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>hawkmoth</b> (Deilephila porcellus), sand dart (Agrotis ripae) and the micro moths Pyrausta cingulata and Hysterophora maculosana. The total number of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) recorded within the nature reserve boundary is 685 (348 macro moths, 314 micro moths and 23 butterflies).|$|E

50|$|The native {{range of}} the species {{includes}} North Africa, most of Europe up to southern Sweden, and parts of Asia. It is absent from much of Scandinavia and north-west Scotland. It has been introduced to North America and Australia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats without dense tree-cover up to 2,500 metres above sea-level. Common habitats include marshland, ditches and the banks of rivers and streams. It flowers from June to September, with a peak in July and August. The flowers are visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome. A number of insects feed on the leaves including the <b>elephant</b> <b>hawkmoth,</b> Deilephila elpenor.|$|R

50|$|All around us, we find {{instances}} where objects like tall man or <b>small</b> <b>elephant</b> combine {{one or more}} categories. This was a problem for extensional semantics, where the semantics of a word such as red is to {{be defined as the}} set of objects having this property. Clearly, this does not apply so well to modifiers such as small; a small mouse is very different from a <b>small</b> <b>elephant.</b>|$|R

They include the Elephant hawk moth, Deilephila elpenor, the <b>Small</b> <b>Elephant</b> Hawk Moth (D. porcellus) and the Chitral Elephant Hawk Moth (D. rivularis). The Oleander Hawk Moth is sometimes classified in this genus as D. nerii, but sometimes treated in genus Daphnis.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} {{elephants}} {{in the north}} Kalimantan region of Borneo coincides with {{the rule of the}} Sultans of Sulu over Sabah. The Sultanate of Sulu enjoyed peaceful ties with the Hindu Sultanate of Java. As a token of appreciation, the rulers of Java sent their elephants to Sulu, much as they have sent Javanese elephants to the Sultanate of Maguindanao, which also partly gives the reason why skeletal remains of <b>small</b> <b>elephants</b> are found in Mindanao, south Philippines. The Sultan of Sulu and his family shipped some of their prized Javanese elephants to northeast Borneo due to lack of land and for the elephants to help in hauling logs out of the forest to create fast and long ship vessels. When this lease was signed, most of these timid and largely domesticated <b>small</b> <b>elephants</b> under the employ of Sulu's shipbuilders and traders were released into the forests so they could live deep inside the jungle away from any feuding sultan who might use them for war. This single act of releasing the pachyderms to the wild made the Bolkiah family of Sulu and their allies the savior of what remaining elephants are left, old locals attest.|$|R

50|$|Astrapotherium ("Great Lightning Beast") is an extinct genus of South American mammal which vaguely {{resembled a}} cross between a <b>small</b> <b>elephant,</b> and a very large tapir. This peculiar-looking animal was {{unrelated}} to modern elephants, and was, instead, related to other extinct South American ungulates. The beast lived in the Early to Middle Miocene. Fossil remains of the type species A. magnus have been found in the Santa Cruz Formation in Argentina. Other fossils have been found in the Deseado, Sarmiento and Aisol Formations of Argentina, in Colombia (Honda Group), Chile (Cura-Mallín and Río Frías Formations) and Chaguaramas Formation, Venezuela.|$|R

In that case the coin scene would represent a victory of Buddhism. According to other interpretations the elephant was the symbol of the city of Taxila.|$|R
