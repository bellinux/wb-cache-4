5|$|The neck {{formed a}} straighter S shape (a <b>sigmoid</b> curve typical of theropods) than that seen in other theropods; in fact, the neck was {{initially}} thought to lack the Scurve. The {{shape of the}} cervical vertebrae indicate that they tapered towards the head and were progressively longer front to back. The neural spines of the cervical vertebrae were low, thin, and were not always sutured to the centra (the bodies of the vertebrae). The axis vertebra, small relative {{to the size of}} the skull, had a well-developed hyposphene. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae were similar in size. Like other dinosaurs, Baryonyx reduced its weight (skeletal pneumaticity) with fenestrae (openings) in the neural arches and with pleurocoels (hollow depressions) in the centra (primarily near the transverse processes). From front to back, the neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae changed from short and stout to tall and broad.|$|E

40|$|Methods {{to speed}} up {{learning}} in back propagation and to optimize the network architecture have been recently studied. This paper shows how adaptation of the steepness of the <b>sigmoids</b> during learning treats these two topics in a common framework. The adaptation of the steepness of the <b>sigmoids</b> is obtained by gradient descent. The resulting learning dynamics can be simulated by a standard network with fixed <b>sigmoids</b> and a learning rule whose main component is a gradient descent with adaptive learning parameters. A law linking variation on the weights to variation on the steepness of the <b>sigmoids</b> is discovered. Optimization of units is obtained by introducing a tendency to decay to zero in the steepness values. This decay corresponds to a decay of {{the sensitivity of the}} units. Units with low final sensitivity can be removed after a given transformation of the biases of the network. A decreasing initial distribution of the steepness values is suggested to obtain a good compromise between s [...] ...|$|R

We tested the approximation and estimation capabilities of networks using functions more complex than <b>sigmoids.</b> Three classes of functions were tested: polynomials, rational functions, and flexible Fourier series. Un-like <b>sigmoids,</b> these classes can fit non-monotonic functions. They were compared on three problems: prediction of Boston housing prices, the sunspot count, and robot arm inverse dynamics. The complex units at-tained clearly superior performance on the robot arm problem, which is a highly non-monotonic, pure approximation problem. On the noisy and only mildly nonlinear Boston housing and sunspot problems, differences among the complex units were revealed; polynomials did poorly, whereas rationals and flexible Fourier series were comparable to <b>sigmoids.</b> ...|$|R

In a nutshell, we estimate the gradient of the regression function at a set of random points, and cluster the estimated gradients. The centers of the clusters are used as estimates for the parameters of hidden units. We justify this approach by studying a toy model, whereby the regression function is a linear combination of <b>sigmoids.</b> We prove that indeed the estimated gradients concentrate around the parameter vectors of the hidden units, and provide non-asymptotic bounds on the number of required samples.

This paper describes a concatenation approach that uses <b>sigmoids</b> to represent the evolution of labial parameters.

A first formal algorithm determines the relevant transitions, i. e. those corresponding to phonemes imposing constraints on one of the labial parameters. Then relevant transitions are either retrieved or interpolated from a set of reference <b>sigmoids</b> which have been trained on a speaker specific corpus.

40|$|Methods {{of testing}} {{competitive}} antagonism in bacterial systems are considered and evaluated with particular reference to antifolic acids. Four antifolic acids—pteridine O/ 129, methotrexate, CB 2295 and CB 2335 —were examined for competitiveness and potency in three test systems—Leuc. citrovorum and folinic acid, Str. faecalis and folinic acid, and Str. faecalis and pteroylglutamic acid. For comparison, phenol and formaldehyde were {{studied in the}} Leuc. citrovorum and folinic acid system. Interpretation of results was based on families of log. concentration/growth curves obtained in each system in the presence and absence of each antagonist. These curves were usually simple <b>sigmoids.</b> From these families of curves, pA values were derived and reciprocal growth/reciprocal concentration curves were drawn. Pteridine O/ 129 was fully competitive in all systems, while methotrexate was fully competitive in the Str. faecalis and folinic acid system, but did not give simple <b>sigmoids</b> {{in the other two}} systems. CB 2295 showed some competitive features in all and CB 2335 in the two systems in which it was active.
