40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{vertical}} magnetic field of the Milky Way towards the <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles,</b> determined from observations of Faraday rotation toward more than 1000 polarized extragalactic radio sources at Galactic latitudes |b | ≥ 77 ◦, using the Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We find median rotation measures (RMs) of 0. 0 ± 0. 5 rad m− 2 and + 6. 3 ± 0. 7 rad m− 2 toward the north and <b>south</b> <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles,</b> respectively, demonstrating that there is no coherent vertical magnetic field in the Milky Way at the Sun’s position. If this is a global property of the Milky Way’s magnetism, then the lack of symmetry across the disk rules out pure dipole or quadrupole geometries for the Galactic magnetic field. The angular fluctuations in RM seen in our data show no preferred scale within the range ≈ 0. ◦ 1 to ≈ 25 ◦.

Working with Konrad Kuijken, he used spectra of faint stars in the region around the <b>South</b> <b>Galactic</b> <b>Pole</b> obtained with the Anglo-Australian Telescope to measure the stars' radial velocities, and consequently to determine the surface mass density of the Galactic disc.

50|$|The Galactic {{plane is}} {{inclined}} by about 60 {{degrees to the}} ecliptic (the plane of Earth's orbit). Relative to the celestial equator, it passes {{as far north as}} the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earth’s equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic, relative to the Galactic plane. The north Galactic pole is situated at right ascension 12h 49m, declination +27.4° (B1950) near β Comae Berenices, and the <b>south</b> <b>Galactic</b> <b>pole</b> is near α Sculptoris. Because of this high inclination, depending on the time of night and year, the arc of the Milky Way may appear relatively low or relatively high in the sky.

40|$|We {{study the}} Faraday {{rotation}} measure (RM) {{due to the}} Galactic magnetic field (GMF) toward high Galactic latitudes. The RM arises from the global, regular component {{as well as from}} the turbulent, random component of the GMF. We model the former based on observations and the latter using the data of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. For a large number of different GMF models, we produce mock RM maps around the <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles</b> and calculate various statistical quantities with the RM maps. We find that the observed medians of RMs toward the north and <b>south</b> <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles,</b> ∼ 0. 0 ± 0. 5 rad m^- 2 and ∼ + 6. 3 ± 0. 5 rad m^- 2, are difficult to explain with any of our many alternate GMF models. The standard deviation of observed RMs, ∼ 9 rad m^- 2, is clearly larger than that of simulated RMs. The second-order structure function of observed RMs is substantially larger than that of simulated RMs, especially at small angular scales. We discuss other possible contributions to RM toward high Galactic latitudes. Besides observational errors and the intrinsic RM of background radio sources against which RM is observed, we suggest that the RM due to the intergalactic magnetic field may account for a substantial fraction of the observed RM. Finally we note that reproducing the observed medians may require additional components or/and structures of the GMF that are not present in our models. Comment: To appear in ApJ.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the detection of}} non-Gaussianity in the 4 -year COBE data reported by Pando, Valls-Gabaud & Fang (1998), using a technique based on the discrete wavelet transform. Their analysis {{was performed on the}} two DMR faces centred on the North and <b>South</b> <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles</b> respectively, using the Daubechies 4 wavelet basis. We show that these results depend critically on the orientation of the data, and so should be treated with caution. For two distinct orientations of the data, we calculate unbiased estimates of the skewness, kurtosis and scale-scale correlation of the corresponding wavelet coefficients in all of the available scale domains of the transform. We obtain several detections of non-Gaussianity in the DMR-DSMB map at greater than the 99 per cent confidence level, but most of these occur on pixel-pixel scales and are therefore not cosmological in origin. Indeed, after removing all multipoles beyond ℓ = 40 from the COBE maps, only one robust detection remains. Moreover, using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability of obtaining such a detection by chance is 0. 59. We repeat the analysis for the 53 + 90 GHz coadded COBE map. In this case, after removing ℓ > 40 multipoles, two non-Gaussian detections at the 99 per cent level remain. Nevertheless, again using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability of obtaining two such detections by chance is 0. 28. Thus, we conclude the wavelet technique does not yield strong evidence for non-Gaussianity of cosmological origin in the 4 -year COBE data. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{description}} of the isotropic and anisotropic random component of the small-scale magnetic field within the existing magnetic field model of the Milky Way from Jansson&Farrar, by including random realizations of the small-scale component. Using a magnetic-field power spectrum with Gaussian random fields, the NE 2001 model for the thermal electrons and the Galactic cosmic-ray electron distribution from the current GALPROP model we derive full-sky maps for the total and polarized synchrotron intensity as well as the Faraday rotation-measure distribution. While previous work assumed that small-scale fluctuations average out along the line-of-sight or which only computed ensemble averages of random fields, we show that these fluctuations need to be carefully taken into account. Comparing with observational data we obtain not only good agreement with 408 MHz total and WMAP 7 22 GHz polarized intensity emission maps, but also an improved agreement with Galactic foreground rotation-measure maps and power spectra, whose amplitude and shape strongly depend on the parameters of the random field. We demonstrate that a correlation length of 220 pc (50 pc being a 5 σ lower limit) is needed to match the slope of the observed power spectrum of Galactic foreground rotation-measure maps. Using multiple realizations allows us also to infer errors on individual observables. We find that previously-used amplitudes for random and anisotropic random magnetic field components need to be rescaled by factors of 0. 3 and 0. 6 to account for the new small-scale contributions. Our model predicts a rotation measure of - 2. 8 ± 7. 1 rad/m^ 2 and 4. 4 ± 11. 0 rad/m^ 2 for the north and <b>south</b> <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles</b> respectively, in good agreement with observations.

50|$|Because of {{the large}} amounts of {{interference}} that can affect BIRS' measurements, several methods had to be employed to process the data. Data had to first be fed to a preamplifier and slope filter to prevent interference from overloading the signal and drowning out the desired information. The signal could then be amplified and fed to a commercially bought spectrum analyzer which selects 128 relatively interference free frequencies to observe every 3 seconds for half an hour. The frequencies below 20 MHz are largely used for international communications, so the system needed to adapt its filters every {{half an hour to}} effectively remove the interference. The antenna used the galactic background radiation for calibration. The BIRS is oriented to point almost directly at the <b>galactic</b> <b>south</b> <b>pole,</b> so background is measured at that point for calibration.|$|R
