Evidence from interviews conducted in the five major labour sending countries to Qatar (Philippines, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India) suggests that the recruitment procedures and corrupt practices by recruitment agencies and employing company personnel in the receiving country place unskilled workers in a highly vulnerable position prior to departure from their home countries. As a consequence of practices such as deception, false promises, <b>substitute</b> <b>contracts,</b> bribery, and extortion, {{there is evidence of}} debt bondage, forced labor, and trafficking within the normative framework of labor migration. Reform measures that are currently underway in Qatar include the banning of workers paying recruitment fees and charges to agents.

30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{whether the}} two major labor market reforms implemented in Spain in the 1990 s to reduce the share of temporary employment succeed in promoting flows into permanent employment. The 1994 reform severely restricted temporary contracts and the 1997 reform introduced a new permanent contract figure with lower payroll taxes and dismissal costs than the ordinary. To evaluate these non-targeted treatments I present an estimation procedure that uses pre-treatment outcomes to predict the one {{that would have been}} otherwise observed in the post-treatment period {{in the absence of the}} treatment and I derive its large sample properties. Using data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey I find that both reforms failed at reducing the share of temporary employment because they had no impact on contract conversions, which account for most new permanent contracts. The 1997 reform succeed in increasing permanent hirings for some groups of workers.

40|$|Abstract. Firms {{and workers}} may sign complex {{contracts}} that govern {{many aspects of}} their interactions. I show that when firms regard <b>contracts</b> as <b>substitutes,</b> bargaining over <b>contracts</b> {{can be understood as}} bargaining only over wages. Substitutes is the assumption commonly used to guarantee the existence of stable matchings of workers and firms. Workers and firms may bargain over general, multi-dimensional contracts; they may negotiate over health benefits, housing, retirement plans, etc. In this note I show that, when firms regard <b>contracts</b> as <b>substitutes,</b> bargaining over <b>contracts</b> can be embedded into a model of bargaining over wages. Substitutes, on the other hand, is the assumption commonly used to guarantee the existence of stable matchings of workers and firms. The economics of the embedding are straightforward, except for a small twist. When a firm and a worker negotiate over a contract, they may bargain over many dimensions. However, the Pareto frontier of contracts is, in a sense, “one-dimensional: ” what is better for the worker is worse for the firm. So Pareto optimal contracts may be viewed as salaries, with the better contracts for the firm meaning lower salaries, and the better contracts for the worker meaning higher salaries. The twist is that the firm’s ranking over contracts might be affected by the firm’s other hires. For example, health plan A may be better than B for a firm if it has many employees, but B beats A if it has few. When <b>contracts</b> are <b>substitutes,</b> {{it turns out that the}} ranking is not affected in this way. Hatfield and Milgrom (2005) present a model of two-sided workerfirm matching with contracts. A firm will hire a collection of workers, and will negotiate a contract with each one of them. The model is a generalization of Kelso and Crawford (1982), where each firm and eac...|$|R

We consider the effects of these new contracts on case-level inputs and examine the extent of substitution across inputs remunerated by fixed prices and fee-for-service.

Our results have implications for legal aid expenditure control, and current policies on personal injury litigation, as well as providing empirical evidence on the effects of remuneration contracts.

In middle age, agents receive preference shocks and trade amongst themselves in an anonymous manner.

40|$|Latin American governments {{progressively}} <b>substituted</b> build–operate–and–transfer (BOT) <b>contracts</b> for government–provided highways {{during the}} nineties. Because under BOT a private franchise holder finances and operates {{the road in}} exchange for tolls, it is often claimed that BOT represents a privatization of highways. We argue that, as currently applied, the BOT model is an imperfect and incomplete privatization, because the franchise holders’ budget constraint has been soft, with losses being shifted to tax payers via minimum income guarantees and contract renegotiations. Soft budget constraints are inconsistent with the standard {{arguments in favor of}} BOT contracts and call into question their avowed advantages. Moreover, both renegotiations and minimum income guarantees allow governments to finance current expenditures with future tax receipts, sidestepping the normal budgetary process.  We propose various changes to the current model aimed at correcting its defects. First, franchises should be awarded through Present-Value-of-Revenue auctions rather than fixed-term franchises. Second, the agency in charge of monitoring contract compliance and regulating franchises should differ from the agency that plans and auctions projects. Third, franchises should be subject to hard budget constraints, so that both profits and losses are privatized.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three essays studying firms in low income countries. The first chapter explores how relational <b>contracts</b> that <b>substitute</b> for formal <b>contracts</b> in the presence of weak institutions, are affected by changes to the outside option of one of the parties. I investigate this question by assessing how a change in the pay-off of cultivating an alternative crop by farmers affects the relationship with downstream buyers in the sugar industry in colonial Taiwan (1895 - 1945). Using novel historic sugar mill level data, I analyse effects on interlinked lending and the provision of inputs by mills to farmers following a reversal of the downward price trend of the main alternative crop, rice. In the second chapter, which is co-authored with Anna Baiardi, we empirically assess the importance of ethnic networks in facilitating international trade. In particular, we investigate the impact of ethnic Cantonese networks in the United States on the export performance of firms based in Southern China. In the third chapter, I investigate whether the dominance of small firms in developing countries {{can be explained by the}} production of customised goods, which allows smaller and less efficient firms to compete with larger and more efficient modern firms.

40|$|This thesis {{applies the}} {{incomplete}} contract approach to studying the corporate governance in two cases: Chinese banking and U. S. franchising, {{both of which}} are issues of great significance from either academic or industrial perspective, but researches on them are still far from enough. First, a wave of centralizing control rights has been widely observed in Chinese banking recently. Based on a two-state incomplete contract model, we show that it’s actually a reaction to the following four facts—the opening up of the banking market, the reform of going public, the increasing serious financial frauds and the persistent high ratio of non-performing loans—which happen almost at the same time. Second, the mixed governance structure as well as the uniform and time-invariant linear contract in franchising also confuses many economists. This thesis establishes a two-period double-sided moral hazard model to study the dynamic decision making on governance structure and contracting of a franchise chain. Our results suggest that both resource scarcity theory and agency theory work but carry different weights in different stages along the whole life. Moreover, the accumulation of branding value brings helps remove the diversification of contracting across outlets as well as phases in the long run. Following this logic, we conduct an empirical analysis on the strategic interactions among franchise chains. Using data of 351 U. S. franchise chains from 43 sectors in 2005, we find significant evidence for spatial effects among franchise chains. Specifically, the coexistence of the complementary strategy in governance structure and the <b>substituting</b> strategy in <b>contracting</b> is consistent with the observed competition behavior and duopoly industrial structure in franchising...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} the extent to which minor surgery undertaken by general practitioners after the introduction of the 1990 <b>contract</b> <b>substituted</b> for hospital outpatient workload. DESIGN [...] Before and after observational study. SETTING [...] Four English family health services authorities. SUBJECTS [...] Patients in 22 practice populations who were operated on by their general practitioner or referred to hospital for minor surgery during April to June 1990 or April to June 1991. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Numbers of minor surgical procedures undertaken in general practice and in hospital, numbers of referrals to hospitals for conditions treatable by a minor surgical procedure, and the mix of diagnoses and procedures undertaken in each setting. RESULTS [...] General practitioners claimed reimbursement for 600 minor surgical procedures during April to June 1990 and for 847 during April to June 1991, an increase of 41 %. Referrals to hospital for comparable conditions showed no compensatory decrease (385 during April to June 1990 and 388 during April to June 1991, 95 % confidence interval for change in referrals - 51 to 57), and the number of hospital procedures resulting from those referrals also remained constant (187 in the first period, 189 in the second, 95 % confidence interval for change in procedures - 36 to 40). The mix of procedures did not change significantly from one study period to the next in either setting. CONCLUSIONS [...] Many or all of the additional patients receiving minor surgery under the terms of the 1990 contract may not have previously been referred to hospital. General practitioners seem not to have systematically shifted towards treating the more trivial cases. The overall increase in minor surgical activity may reflect an improvement in accessibility of care or changes in patients' perceptions and attitudes...|$|R

We {{suggest that there is}} a specific role for bureaucracies in environments with insure property rights. In such situations, bureaucracies <b>substitute</b> for enforceable <b>contracts.</b> We study irreversible investment in an asset over which property rights are unclear, and model the property rights allocation as a game between a ruler and investors. Since the ex ante ownership allocation is not enforceable, it is optimal for the ruler to increase his ownership share of the asset ex post. This adjustment is costly to the ruler; the heavier the bureaucratic machine the higher the cost. Bureaucracy improves investment incentives by reducing the wedge between the ruler’s ex ante and ex post equilibrium ownership shares.

40|$|In Italy {{over the}} last decade non-typical labour {{contracts}} have been increasingly used. Among them, much {{attention has been paid to}} the so-called "collaborazione coordinata e continuativa" (co. co. co.) contracts. These contracts may provide a buffer to entrants, displaced or retiring workers, i. e. they can complement standard open-ended dependent contracts during career transition phases. However, if they become a <b>substitute</b> for standard <b>contracts</b> in every phase of the working career, then a segment of workers at-risk-ofsocial-exclusion could emerge. Hence, it becomes crucial to analyse the careers of co. co. co. workers. Our first goal is to learn if, within the "co. co. co. world", a group of at-risk workers actually exists; then, we will try to shed some light upon those workers' careers. We use a dataset unique to Italian labour research, the Work Histories Italian Panel (WHIP). It is a longitudinal random sample of individuals drawn from the social security administration (INPS) archive; through WHIP the co. co. co. archive ("Gestione Separata") can be linked to other archives (e. g. the private sector dependent workers' archive) and can be observed for the longest time span available for this type of data at the moment, i. e. from the birth of the "Gestione Separata" (1996) to 1999. It becomes apparent that two different groups of individuals contribute to the "Gestione Separata": highly skilled individuals, who enjoy a good position in the labour market (managers and professionals) and the ones we call "parasubordinati strictu sensu". "Parasubordinati" are young, receive lower annual wages and most of them are women and/or low-skilled. The brevity of the available time series (only one year for "parasubordinati strictu sensu") reduces the longitudinal analysis to the very short run. We observe a very gradual inflow into the "Gestione Separata" of the 1999 stock of "parasubordinati strictu sensu". The estimated probability to switch to a dependent labour contract seems to be higher for younger, low-paid individuals, particularly if they move geographically. Finally, and predominately for women, the co. co. co. contract seems like an alternative to a part-time job. ...|$|R
