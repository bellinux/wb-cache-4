5|$|According to Sebastian Conrad, proto-globalization {{is marked}} with a “rise of {{national}} chauvinism, racism, <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism,</b> and genocidal thinking” which came to be with relations to the “establishment of a world economy”.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of sociobiology to humans (discussed {{only in the}} first and last chapters of the book) was immediately controversial. Some researchers, led by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, contended that sociobiology embodied biological determinism. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had been in the past, to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. They referred to <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> and eugenics of the early 20th century, and other more recent developments, such as the IQ controversy of the early 1970s, as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society. They believed that Wilson was committing the naturalistic fallacy, attempting to define moral principles using natural concepts. Academics opposed to Wilson's sociobiology, including Gould, Lewontin, Jon Beckwith, Ruth Hubbard, and Anthony Leeds created the Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People to counter his ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism,</b> which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{classical}} liberalism developed into neo-classical liberalism, which argued {{for government to}} be as small as possible to allow the exercise of individual freedom. In its most extreme form, neo-classical liberalism advocated <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism.</b> Right-libertarianism is a modern form of neo-classical liberalism.|$|E
25|$|For many, {{the name}} of Herbert Spencer would be {{virtually}} synonymous with <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism,</b> a social theory that applies {{the law of the}} survival of the fittest to society; humanitarian impulses had to be resisted as nothing should be allowed to interfere with nature's laws, including the social struggle for existence.|$|E
25|$|The {{last two}} decades of the 19th century were also marked by the {{development}} of a Haitian intellectual culture. Major works of history were published in 1847 and 1865. Haitian intellectuals, led by Louis-Joseph Janvier and Anténor Firmin, engaged in a war of letters against a tide of racism and <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> that emerged during this period.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} fascism's support of violent action in {{politics}} is connected to <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism.</b> Fascist movements have commonly held social Darwinist views of nations, races and societies. They say that nations and races must purge themselves of socially and biologically weak or degenerate people, while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people, {{in order to survive}} in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict.|$|E
25|$|Carl Peters (27 September 1856 – 10 September 1918), was a German colonial ruler, explorer, {{politician}} and author, a major promoter {{of the establishment}} of the German colony of East Africa (part of the modern republic Tanzania). A proponent of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> and the Völkisch philosophy, his attitude towards the indigenous population {{made him one of the}} most controversial colonizers even during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Huxley, Darwin's Bulldog, {{spent much}} of his book Evolution and Ethics debunking <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism,</b> piece by piece. The {{following}} is a summary of his arguments in the Prolegomena, the most detailed and comprehensive of the two sections devoted to it. It should be noted that Huxley is here attempting to disprove the science behind Social Darwinism; as such, the moral arguments only come in later in the essay.|$|E
25|$|Bryan opposed Charles Darwin's {{theory of}} {{evolution}} through natural selection for two reasons. First, he believed that what he considered a materialistic account of the descent of man (and all life) through evolution was directly contrary to the Biblical creation account, which he accepted. Second, he considered Darwinism as applied to society (<b>social</b> <b>Darwinism)</b> {{to be a great}} evil force in the world, promoting hatred and conflicts, especially the World War, and inhibiting upward social and economic mobility of the poor and oppressed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> {{suggested}} {{that the success of}} these different ethnic groups in world affairs, and social classes in a society, were the result of evolutionary struggle in which the group or class more fit to succeed did so; i.e., the ability of an ethnic group to dominate other ethnic groups, or the chance to succeed or rise to the top of society was determined by genetic superiority. In more modern times it is typically seen as dubious and unscientific for its apparent use of Darwin's ideas to justify the position of the rich and powerful, or dominant ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|Spencer's {{association}} with <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> might have its origin {{in a specific}} interpretation of his support for competition. Whereas in biology the competition of various organisms can result {{in the death of}} a species or organism, the kind of competition Spencer advocated is closer to the one used by economists, where competing individuals or firms improve the well being of the rest of society. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both voluntary association and informal care to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. He further recommended that private charitable efforts would be wise to avoid encouraging the formation of new dependent families by those unable to support themselves without charity.|$|E
25|$|Kang, one of {{the major}} thinkers that {{influenced}} Phan, took the idea of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> and discussed the survival of the fittest concept as it applied to nations and ethnic groups. He described the dire outcomes that would face China if the country did not embark on a series of reforms, similar to those faced by the Ottoman Empire and colonial India. He believed that reforms made by Peter the Great and Emperor Meiji were excellent examples of the political restructuring that needed to take place to save China. From Kang's work, Phan realized why Emperor Tự Đức's decision to ignore Nguyễn Trường Tộ's proposed modernization reforms had led to the downfall of Vietnam and had allowed for French rule in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, {{a number of}} laws {{enabling}} emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries. The old laws restricting them to ghettos, {{as well as the}} many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by racial antisemitism, encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau and particularly his Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race of 1853–5. Nationalist agendas based on ethnicity, known as ethnonationalism, usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race. Allied to this were theories of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism,</b> which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white Aryans to Semitic Jews.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of divergent ethnic “Tutsi” and “Hutu” identities was formulated during {{the era of}} European colonization from the late 1880s to the 1950s. German colonialism did little to alter the existing stratified social system. The Germans {{were not interested in}} disrupting social affairs – their sole concern was the efficient extraction of natural resources and trade of profitable cash crops. Colonial bureaucrats relied heavily on native Tutsi chiefs to maintain order over the Hutu lower classes and collect taxes. Thus, the German affirmation of the stratified social structure was utilized by the Tutsi aristocracy as justification for minority rule over the lower-class Hutu masses. Germany’s defeat in World War I allowed Belgian forces to conquer Rwanda. Belgian involvement in the region was far more intrusive than German administration. In an era of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism,</b> European anthropologists claimed to identify a distinct “Hamitic race” that was superior to native “Negroid” populations. Influenced by racialized attitudes, Belgian social scientists declared that the Tutsis, who wielded political control in Rwanda, must be descendants of the Hamites, who shared a purported closer blood line to Europeans. The Belgians concluded that the Tutsis and Hutus composed two fundamentally different ethno-racial groups. Thus, the Belgians viewed the Tutsis as more civilized, superior, but most importantly, more European than the Hutus. This perspective justified placing societal control {{in the hands of the}} Tutsis at the expense of the Hutus. Moreover, this Belgian affirmation of the Hamitic theory provided a conceptual foundation for Tutsis and Hutus to start identifying themselves as different ethnic groups. The Belgians established a comprehensive race theory that was to dictate Rwandan society until independence: Tutsi racial superiority and Hutu oppression. The institutionalization of Tutsi and Hutu ethnic divergence was accomplished through administrative, political economic, and educational means.|$|E

500|$|All {{this is to}} {{say that}} Kanō's {{educational}} philosophy was a combination of both traditional Japanese neo-Confucianism and contemporary European and American philosophies, to include Instrumentalism, Utilitarianism, and [...] "evolutionary progressivism", as <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> was then known.|$|E
500|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> and {{the concept}} of [...] "human nature" [...] are ideas that are {{prevalent}} throughout The Satanic Bible. LaVey describes Satanism as [...] "a religion based on the universal traits of man," [...] and humans are described throughout as inherently carnal and animalistic. Each of the seven deadly sins is described as part of human's natural instinct, and are thus advocated. <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> is particularly noticeable in The Book of Satan, where LaVey plagiarizes portions of Redbeard's Might Is Right, though it also appears throughout in references to man's inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation. LaVeyan Satanism has been described as [...] "institutionalism of Machiavellian self-interest" [...] because of many of these themes.|$|E
500|$|Evolution {{has been}} used to justify <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism,</b> the {{exploitation}} of so-called [...] "lesser breeds without the law" [...] by [...] "superior races," [...] particularly in the nineteenth century. Typically strong European nations that had successfully expanded their empires could be said to have [...] "survived" [...] in the struggle for dominance. With this attitude, Europeans except for [...] Christian missionaries rarely adopted any customs and languages of local people under their empires.|$|E
500|$|Themes of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> and {{survival}} are prevalent throughout [...] "Beside the Dying Fire." [...] In the episode, Andrea {{is separated from}} the group and is forced to fend herself against the horde of walkers that invaded Hershel's farm. Mazzara felt that separating Andrea from her group would be essential in exploring her character in-depth, as he stated that she was viewed {{in the light of}} other characters on The Walking Dead.|$|E
500|$|... s.Neoliberalism {{and shock}} therapy were {{presented}} to the Polish public as a rational (scientific, based on mathematical economics) and merit-based, nonpolitical and objective system. The supposedly natural (biological) character of the systemic changes was stressed.

500|$|Particularly {{among the}} Plains Aborigines, as {{the degree of}} the [...] "civilizing projects" [...] {{increased}} during each successive regime, the aborigines found themselves in greater contact with outside cultures. The process of acculturation and assimilation sometimes followed gradually {{in the wake of}} broad social currents, particularly the removal of ethnic markers (such as bound feet, dietary customs and clothing), which had formerly distinguished ethnic groups on Taiwan. The removal or replacement of these brought about an incremental transformation from [...] "Fan" [...] (barbarian) to the dominant Confucian [...] "Han" [...] culture. During the Japanese and KMT periods centralized modernist government policies, rooted in ideas of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> and culturalism, directed education, genealogical customs and other traditions toward ethnic assimilation.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut was a vocal {{critic of}} the society in which he lived, and this was {{reflected}} in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society. In The Sirens of Titan, the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to one of Saturn's moons, Titan, {{as a result of}} his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward. In God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances as the lives of both groups' members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty. Further, in Hocus Pocus, the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views. In Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion, Thomas F. Marvin states: [...] "Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States." [...] Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate what happens when a [...] "hereditary aristocracy" [...] develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished. Vonnegut also often laments <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism,</b> and a [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] view of society. He points out that <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because [...] "they deserve their fate". Vonnegut also confronts the idea of free will in a number of his pieces. In Slaughterhouse-Five and Timequake the characters have no choice in what they do; in Breakfast of Champions, characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in Cat's Cradle, Bokononism views free will as heretical.|$|E
500|$|Rockefeller {{was also}} the founder of both the University of Chicago and Rockefeller University and funded the {{establishment}} of Central Philippine University in the Philippines. He was a devout Northern Baptist and supported many church-based institutions. Rockefeller adhered to total abstinence from alcohol and tobacco throughout his life. He was a faithful congregant of the Erie Street Baptist Mission Church, where he taught Sunday school, {{and served as a}} trustee, clerk and occasional janitor. Religion was a guiding force throughout his life and Rockefeller believed it to be the source of his success. Rockefeller was also considered a supporter of capitalism based on a perspective of <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> and was quoted often as saying: [...] "The growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest".|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut disregarded more {{mainstream}} political ideologies {{in favor of}} socialism, which he thought could provide a valuable substitute for {{what he saw as}} <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> and a spirit of [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] in American society, believing that [...] "socialism would be a good for the common man". Vonnegut would often return to a quote by socialist and five-time presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs: [...] "As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I'm of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free." [...] Vonnegut expressed disappointment that communism and socialism seemed to be unsavory topics to the average American, and believed that they may offer beneficial substitutes to contemporary social and economic systems.|$|E
500|$|According to {{literary}} critic Frank Kermode, The Coral Island [...] "could {{be used as}} a document in the history of ideas". A scientific and social background for the novel is found in Darwinism, of the natural and the social kind. For instance, published a year before Origin of Species (whose ideas were already being circulated and discussed widely), Charles Darwin's 1842 The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs was one of the best-known contemporary accounts of the growth of coral. Ballantyne had been reading books by Darwin and by his rival Alfred Russel Wallace; in later publications he also acknowledged the naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes. The interest in evolutionary theory was reflected in much contemporary popular literature, and <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> was an important factor contributing to the world view of the Victorians and their empire building.|$|E
500|$|Crowley {{enjoyed being}} {{outrageous}} and flouting conventional morality, with John Symonds {{noting that he}} [...] "was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time". Crowley's political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones. Pasi {{argued that it was}} difficult to classify Crowley as being either on the political left or right but he was perhaps best categorised as a [...] "conservative revolutionary" [...] despite not being affiliated with the German-based conservative revolutionary movement. Pasi noted that Crowley sympathised with extreme ideologies like Nazism and Marxism-Leninism, in that they wished to violently overturn society and hoped that both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union might adopt Thelema. Crowley described democracy as an [...] "imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness," [...] and commented that The Book of the Law proclaimed that [...] "there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the 'lone wolf' and the herd". In this attitude he was influenced by the work of Friedrich Nietzsche and by <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism.</b> Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy, he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine, once describing his ideology as [...] "aristocratic communism".|$|E
500|$|The social {{implications}} {{of the theory of}} evolution by natural selection also became the source of continuing controversy. Friedrich Engels, a German political philosopher and co-originator of the ideology of communism, wrote in 1872 that [...] "Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind, and especially on his countrymen, when he showed that free competition, the struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest historical achievement, is the normal state of the animal kingdom." [...] Herbert Spencer and the eugenics advocate Francis Galton's interpretation of natural selection as necessarily progressive, leading to supposed advances in intelligence and civilisation, became a justification for colonialism, eugenics, and <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism.</b> For example, in 1940, Konrad Lorenz, in writings that he subsequently disowned, used the theory as a justification for policies of the Nazi state. He wrote [...] "...selection for toughness, heroism, and social utility... must be accomplished by some human institution, if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy. The racial idea as the basis of our state has already accomplished much in this respect." [...] Others have developed ideas that human societies and culture evolve by mechanisms analogous to those that apply to evolution of species.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the first}} book of The Satanic Bible is taken from parts of Redbeard's Might Is Right, edited to remove the racism, anti-Semitism, and {{misogyny}} present in the original version. It challenges both the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, advocating instead a tooth-for-tooth philosophy. LaVey, through Redbeard, strongly advocates <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism,</b> saying, [...] "Death to the weakling, wealth to the strong!" [...] Humans are identified as instinctually predatory, and [...] "lust and carnal desire" [...] are singled out as part of humans' intrinsic nature. The Book of Satan suggests a hedonistic outlook, saying, [...] "I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly happiness." [...] Indulgence is endorsed, and readers are encouraged {{to make the most}} of their lives. It criticizes both law and religious principles, instead suggesting doing only what makes one happy and successful. LaVey continues to denounce other religions, and he rails against what he considers to be arbitrary definitions of [...] "good" [...] and [...] "evil". Religion is criticized as a man-made construct, and the reader is urged to question everything and destroy any lies that he or she uncovers. Long-standing lies that are believed to be irrefutable truths are identified as the most dangerous. The last part of The Book of Satan is an adaptation of the Christian Beatitudes, changed to reflect the principles of LaVeyan Satanism.|$|E
500|$|Gray, {{considered}} by Darwin {{to be his}} friend and [...] "best advocate", also attempted to convince Darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life, and {{to return to his}} faith. Gray saw nature as filled with [...] "unmistakable and irresistible indications of design" [...] and argued that [...] "God himself is the very last, irreducible causal factor and, hence, the source of all evolutionary change." [...] Darwin agreed that his theories were [...] "not at all necessarily atheistical" [...] but was unable to share Gray's belief. [...] "I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton," [...] he wrote. Gray was a Christian, but he was a staunch supporter of Darwin in America. He collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, Darwiniana (1876); these essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, {{at a time when many}} on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray denied that investigation of physical causes stood opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it [...] "most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies". The result of all this is that Gray distanced himself from <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism.</b> Gray is a critical link in the history of American intellectualism, and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment; thereby providing a way for believers in Creationism to consider Darwin's ideas.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} widely {{translated}} in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators {{were expected to}} make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated [...] "favoured races" [...] as [...] "perfected races", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating <b>social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, it had appeared in an additional 18 languages.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> {{is another}} concept that justifies the {{discourse}} of white superiority. Herbert Spencer, a 19th-century philosopher, advanced the idea of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> is an application {{of the theory of}} natural selection to social, political, and economic issues. This theory was used to promote the idea that the white race was superior to others, and therefore, destined to rule over them. It gave a scientific justification for white dominance, exploring ideas of head size, eye color, and other traits. At its worst, the implications of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> were used as scientific justification for the Holocaust. The Nazis claimed that the murder of Jews in World War II was an example of cleaning out the inferior genetics. [...] Various other dictators have claimed the cause of <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> in carrying out other such acts. Even without such actions, <b>Social</b> <b>Darwinism</b> {{has proven to be a}} false and dangerous philosophy. However, it was yet another way for whites to defend their claim of being a superior race. [...] It could potentially be used, as manifest destiny was, as a reason for expansion.|$|E
