40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of fine machining efficiency of 34 CrMo 4 steel with roller burnishing tools. Application of roller burnishing process as a clean and environmentally friendly machining process which can replace other pollution processes is of great interests. It is important to evaluate the influence of material properties (primary hardness) for smoothing efficiency and achieving of lower roughness and higher work piece hardness. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental tests of cutting outputs have been done on specimens prepared for final machining process to estimate the rate of roughness decrease, and diameter increase. Roughness measured data before and after roller burnishing process have been compared. Findings: It was found that surface roughness is significantly lower after roller burnishing. Roughness ratio (before/after process) and decrease factor was 4 what doesn’t satisfy expected results. Some roughness results after burnishing exceed upper limits. Research limitations/implications: Results and findings presented in this paper are qualitative and might be slightly different in other machining condition (e. g. higher hardness materials and higher roughness of row material).

These light-weight alloys are composed of silicon-aluminium and their coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) can be controlled to a chosen value between 7. 5 and 20 ppm/°C, simply by adjusting the proportions of these two constituents. CE Alloys can be machined to tight tolerances using <b>standard</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> and plated with nickel, gold or silver finishes using standard processes.

The additional benefit of high stiffness has made CE Alloys with the lower CTEs eminently suitable for optical and opto-electronic housings.

40|$|The {{target of}} the mass {{production}} {{is to increase the}} productivity and increase the accuracy. This is done by reducing the set up cost and manual fatigue. Thus mass production can be achieved by the use of jigs. For large scale production of different materials a lot of time is wasted in set up of the device and clamping the device. Trial and error method is usually practiced until the axis of the hole is properly aligned with the axis of the drill. In such a situation a lot of time is being wasted to maintain the accuracy. Eventually it increases the operator’s fatigue. Thus drill jig increases productivity by eliminating individual positioning, marking and frequent checking. The main advantage of the jigs is interchangeability. A fixture is a production tool. The main aim is to locate, hold and support the work securely so that the required machining operations can be performed. Set blocks and feeler or thickness gauges are also used to provide reference of the cutter with the workpiece. A fixture must be easily fastened with the table and the machine. As a result the work can be done. Fixture is largely used in milling machines.

In addition to being flexible in their ability to model different types of attributes, the presented kernels are computationally efficient and some of them can easily be computed for large datasets (N of the order 10. 000) of trees with 30 - 600 branches. Combining the kernels with <b>standard</b> <b>machine</b> learning <b>tools</b> enables us to analyze the relation between disease and anatomical tree structure and geometry. Experimental results: The kernels are used to compare airway trees segmented from low-dose CT, endowed with branch shape descriptors and airway wall area percentage measurements made along the tree. Using kernelized hypothesis testing we show that the geometric airway trees are significantly differently distributed in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) than in healthy individuals. The geometric tree kernels also give {{a significant increase in the}} classification accuracy of COPD from geometric tree structure endowed with airway wall thickness measurements in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, giving further insight into the relationship between airway wall thickness and COPD.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this work was {{to work out the}} {{technology}} of manufacturing carbon and titanium based layers on the surfaces of sintered carbides machining edges used in furniture industry. Design/methodology/approach: A hybrid deposition system employing DC magnetron sputtering and radio frequency plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition (RF PACVD) in one reaction chamber was used to manufacture Ti:C gradient layers. For the laboratory investigation layers were deposited on sintered carbide samples. Friction coefficient and SEM EDS analysis were made. For the exploitation tests layers were deposited on the commercial sintered carbide tools widely used in furniture industry. Findings: As the result of investigation it was noticed that Ti and C based gradient layers deposited on sintered carbides surfaces seems to be a very interesting alternative for <b>standard</b> non modified <b>machining</b> <b>tools</b> because of they noticeably decreased friction coefficient and improved durability. Practical implications: Presented technology is dedicated for furniture industry as a layer improving the cutting properties of the machining toolsOriginality/value: Application of carbon and titanium based layers deposited by hybrid deposition method on sintered carbide cutting edges for wood and wood-based materials machining...|$|R

Research was needed to determine modifications to the current <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> curriculum to create an alignment between the school district and the local area. An active advisory committee stressed the importance of updating the district's <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> curriculum to meet local manufacturing and technical college standards. To accomplish this goal, the researcher used an interview and survey to determine what <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> are used in the Sheboygan area, what <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> careers are readily available in theSheboygan area, what <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> proficiencies are expected of entry level <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> employees and technical college students, and what modifications must be made to the current <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> curriculum to align the curriculum with {{the needs of the}} Sheboygan area manufacturers and post-secondary <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> programs. After reviewing the data, the researcher concludes that the existing Metals/Manufacturing <b>Machine</b> <b>Tool</b> curriculum is adequate for teaching manual <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> skills. However, the curriculum does not reflect current machining processes and skills used by local industries and technical colleges. Changes that are required include using computer controlled <b>machine</b> <b>tools,</b> incorporating meti...|$|R
