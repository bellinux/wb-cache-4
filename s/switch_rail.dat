On the left is the profile of this squat <b>switch</b> <b>rail.</b> The centre diagram shows how the <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> has to be planed, and on the right it is shown fitting against the stock rail.

5000|$|Early S&C {{allowed only}} a very slow speed on the {{subsidiary}} route (the [...] "turnout"), so geometrical design was not too important. Many older s&c units had a loose joint at the heel so that the <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> could turn to close to the stock rail or open from it. When the <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> was closed, a reasonable alignment was secured; when it was open, no wheel could run on it so it did not matter.|$|E
25|$|Turnouts, {{also known}} as points and switches, are the means of {{directing}} a train onto a diverging section of track. Laid similar to normal track, a point typically consists of a frog (common crossing), check <b>rails</b> and two <b>switch</b> <b>rails.</b> The <b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> may be moved left or right, {{under the control of}} the signalling system, to determine which path the train will follow.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This {{detail of}} a switch shows the pair of tapered {{moveable}} rails known as the <b>switch</b> points (<b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> or point blades) ...|$|R
50|$|The points (<b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> or point blades) are the movable rails which {{guide the}} wheels towards either the {{straight}} or the diverging track. They are tapered on most switches, but on stub switches they have square ends.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tangential}} <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> {{has less}} steel planed away, and the mid {{part of the}} switch [...] "scallops" [...] into the web of the stock rail for greater strength. The higher baseplate also supports the <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> better. This makes a stronger switch which can be curved, reducing the jolt to the train and allowing higher speeds. However tangential turnouts still lack a smooth transition where the switch blade contacts the main rail, so {{there is still some}} jolt as the train passes over, though it is a much smaller jolt than with the old-style turnouts.|$|E
5000|$|A single tongue trap {{consists}} {{of only one}} <b>switch</b> <b>rail,</b> leading away from the main line to a short tongue of rail. This is usually placed in the rail farthest from the main line.|$|E

50|$|Scenarios when {{speaking}} English, are pre-scripted {{activities in which}} the user plays through {{a specific set of}} challenges, such as transporting passengers to their destinations on schedule, or <b>switching</b> <b>rail</b> cars in a rail yard without damaging the cargo.|$|R
50|$|Turnouts were {{originally}} built with straight switch blades, which ended at the pointed {{end with a}} sharp angle. These switches cause a bump when the train traverses in the turnout direction. The switch blades could be made with a curved point which meets the stockrail at a tangent, causing less of a bump, but the disadvantage is that the metal at the point is thin and necessarily weak. A solution to these conflicting requirements {{was found in the}} 1920s on the German Reichsbahn. The first step was to have different rail profile for the stock <b>rails</b> and <b>switch</b> <b>rails,</b> with the <b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> being about 25 mm less high, and stockier in the middle.|$|R
50|$|As speeds rose, {{this was}} no longer {{feasible}} and the <b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> were fixed at the heel end, and their flexibility enabled the toe end to open and close. Manufacture of the <b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> was a complex process, {{and that of the}} crossings even more so. Speeds on the subsidiary route were rarely higher than 20 mph except in very special designs, and great ingenuity was employed to give a good ride to vehicles passing through at speed on the main line. A difficulty was the common crossing where continuous support to wheels passing was difficult, and the point rail was planed to protect it from direct impact in the facing direction, so that a designed irregularity in support was introduced.|$|R

50|$|As faster speeds were required, more {{configurations}} of s&c were designed, {{and a very}} large number of components, each specific to only one type of s&c, was required. At faster speeds on the turnout road, the divergence from the main route is much more gradual, and therefore a very considerable length of planning of the <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> is required.|$|E
50|$|Axle {{counters}} {{are used}} in rail yards to detect train cars as they are sorted. Axle counters are placed on the track before each switch and on each track that exits the <b>switch.</b> <b>Rail</b> yard management software uses occupancy data from the axle counters to lock in switches and prevent cars from being routed to tracks that are occupied by other cars.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensive}} trackwork at the Alice exchange sidings (near Crossgates) {{were all}} of mixed gauge. Trouble was experienced with the mixed gauge points, and some were converted to a type where the approach rails were shifted to meet the lead rails, so {{that there were no}} <b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> at all.|$|R

50|$|On 19 May 2004, Unit 507009 derailed at {{points as}} it {{approached}} Birkenhead North station. The leading bogie of four wheels {{came off the}} track, but the train remained upright. None of the 20 or so passengers on the train were injured. The cause was a worn <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> and an imbalance in wheel loads across the leading carriage of the train.|$|E
50|$|In North America {{the term}} Spike and Wedge {{is used as}} instead of a clip, a rail spike is driven through a hole set in the metal base plate that is located flush up against the <b>switch</b> <b>rail,</b> holding it in place against the stock rail. The block of wood set in the open gap {{is known as the}} wedge and is {{functionally}} equivalent to a scotch.|$|E
5000|$|To {{clip and}} scotch {{a set of}} railway points (Amer. a switch) uses two pieces of {{equipment}} to temporarily lock a set of points into a particular position. [...] The point clip clamps {{the end of a}} moving rail (the <b>switch</b> <b>rail)</b> of a set of points to its associated stock rail, and the scotch is a timber wedge used to ensure that the other moving rail is kept away from its associated stock rail. In this way the points are fixed in either the 'normal' or 'reverse' positions and cannot be moved by the usual setting mechanisms. For infrequently used points, this guards against mechanical failure of the points leaving them in a condition to derail trains. The 'clip and scotch' method {{can also be used to}} positively deny access to the turnout or mainline.|$|E
40|$|The {{dimensioning}} of the {{locking device}} of a switch is made essentially {{as a function}} of the applied loads during the <b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> movement or considering a false route. The phenomena related to the vibrations induced by the track are therefore normally not taken into account. Such vibrations are particularly accentuated by the ballast bed deconsolidation in the sleeper panel supporting the locking device. Unfortunately, there is no specific technical reference in order to control these aspects, even though the most frequent cause of locking device components failures is relied to the vertical oscillations induced by the trains, rather than to the effort to commute the <b>switch</b> <b>rails.</b> In this study, the results of a field investigation carried out at two levels of ballast tamping are reported and discussed. It is found that the ballast compaction plays a fundamental role for the component to be prone to the early attainment of critical mechanical conditions. Procedures for the monitoring of the stability and efficiency of the ballast bed to ensure the required reliability of the locking device are also envisaged...|$|R

40|$|Inspired by a {{manufacturing}} process of switch rails for railway turnouts, {{a method for}} the optimisation of <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> profile geometry is presented. The <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> profile geometry is parameterised with four design variables to define a B-spline curve for the milling tool profile, and two design variables to prescribe the deviation from the nominal vertical path of the milling tool. The optimisation problem is formulated as a multi-objective minimisation problem with objective functions based on the contact pressure and the energy dissipation in the wheel–rail contact. The front of Pareto optimal solutions is determined by applying a genetic type optimisation algorithm. The <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> profile designs are evaluated by simulations of dynamic train–turnout interaction. It is concluded that the obtained set of Pareto optimal solutions corresponds to a rather small variation in design variables where increased profile height and increased profile shoulder protuberance are preferred for both objectives. The improvement in the objectives comes {{at the cost of}} an earlier wheel transition to the <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> and thus increased vertical loading at a thinner rail cross-section. The performance of the optimised geometry is evaluated using a set of 120 measured wheel profiles, and it is shown that the optimised geometry reduces damage also for this large load collective. It is concluded that accurate limits on <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> loading need to be established to determine the feasible design space for <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> geometry optimisation...|$|E
40|$|As a carrier, turnout is an {{extremely}} important part of transport, when railways is operating. So the detection of turnout should meet the requirement.

50|$|The switch {{consists}} of the pair of linked tapering rails, known as points (<b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> or point blades), lying between the diverging outer rails (the stock rails). These points can be moved laterally into one of two positions to direct a train coming from the point blades toward the straight path or the diverging path. A train moving from the narrow end toward the point blades (i.e. it will be directed {{to one of the}} two paths depending on the position of the points) is said to be executing a facing-point movement.|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} for numerical prediction of accumulated rail damage in railway turnouts is presented. Based on simulation of dynamic vehicle-track interaction {{followed by a}} discretisation of the conditions in each wheel-rail contact, distributions of rail wear are calculated by the Archard model of sliding wear, while surface initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damage is evaluated by the Palmgren–Miner rule and an index building on shakedown theory. Partial slip in the wheel-rail contacts and variable amplitude loading are considered. For freight traffic in the diverging route, the influence of rail inclination and <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> elevation on damage in the switch panel is investigated in a demonstration example. Two-point contact situations with one contact on the <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> and {{one on top of}} the stock rail induce relative motion and slip between wheel and rail leading to high energy dissipation. In agreement with field observations, it is concluded that wear is the dominating damage mechanism on the gauge side of the <b>switch</b> <b>rail</b> while the risk for RCF is higher on the crowns of the switch and stock rails. For accurate prediction of rail life for given combinations of wheel/rail materials and traffic conditions, the methodology needs to be calibrated by field measurements...|$|E
