25|$|In 1903 {{the ship}} was {{extensively}} refitted specifically as a steam rescue ship with auxiliary <b>sail</b> <b>propulsion.</b> The original horizontal reciprocating engine was replaced with a more compact yet more powerful engine and boilers salvaged from a wreck, allowing addition of more water storage, coal bunkering and fuel oil for heating. Additional bulkheads to create a total of eight compartments and hull reinforcement were added. The bilge keels were removed to facilitate damage-free passage through ice. Hard shell above deck storm and wave protection for crew was added fore and aft. Additional insulations of cork and sawdust were added.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an integrated simulation approach, combining CFD and time-domain simulation techniques {{in order to}} represent the interaction between motor and <b>sailing</b> <b>propulsion</b> of the tall ship Amerigo Vespucci. Through a complete propulsion and generation system retrofitting, the ship will be equipped with a new electric propulsion motor, to be used {{not only for the}} motor propulsion but possibly also during the sailing navigation. A newly developed control system will drive the propeller to the “zero-thrust” condition during sailing, for every wind direction and force.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulation approach developed {{to evaluate the}} interaction between <b>sailing</b> and motor <b>propulsion</b> of a tall ship. In particular, the study {{is focused on the}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the wind thrust action on the sails. CFD modelling has been used because of the lack on scientific literature of the performance assessment of a square soft sail, especially if the interference among the several sails has to be considered. CFD results are discussed and then properly arranged to develop a propulsion simulator, able to provide interesting information on the whole ship performance. In <b>sailing</b> <b>propulsion</b> mode, it is worth paying attention also to the effect of the trailing propeller on the shaftline dynamics, mainly for reasons due to the efficiency reduction of the oil lubrication system at low revolutions. The final goal of the present work is to propose material and methods to find out and set up innovative control logics, in order to optimise the particular motor-sailing propulsion of the tall ship...|$|R
