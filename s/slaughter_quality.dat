40|$|The {{greatest}} welfare {{challenges for}} sheep during grazing are tick-borne fever (TBF), blow-flies, alveld and predators. Production losses on tick infested pastures are substantial, {{and it is}} expected that more than 300 000 lambs/sheep are affected by TBF. In sustainable farming, particularly organic farming, the focus on solving these challenges should be on preventive measures. The dependence on drugs implies a risk for developing resistance. It is therefore of general interest to use preventive methods. However, few efficient preventive measures against tick infection and TBF are available. Thus, {{there is a need for}} alternative strategies. The focus of the project will be on: Indirect losses The indirect loss caused by TBF is impaired welfare, growth rate, meat quality and income. National data will provide information on weight, <b>slaughter</b> <b>quality</b> and losses of animals on tick infested pastures and will be used to identify and quantify indirect losses. Increased knowledge about the extent of indirect losses to ticks will increase awareness and motivation for implementing preventive measures. Turn out time on pasture and immunity Lambs on tick infested pasture and sheep brought to tick infested pasture for the first time are at highest risk. Animals will develop immunity after the first infection.

40|$|Summary. In {{constant}} aspiration {{to decrease}} in expenses {{in the course}} of production of meat of broilers many processes are automated, and quality of many of the Russian overworking enterprises doesn't concede to the international standards any more. However the domestic enterprises sustain still considerable losses on decrease in categorization and deterioration of carcasses of the broilers which are handed over on <b>slaughter.</b> <b>Quality</b> of fowl depends on a number of factors. Process of devocalization has the defining impact on qualitative characteristics of finished goods. A number of factors which prove use of a gas way of devocalization is revealed (higher level of an bloodless allows to improve quality of meat, the gas which is applied in system of devocalization lulls a bird and allows to give a bird to the line of an unconscious hinge plate). Use of a gas way allows to get rid in many respects of problems inherent in an electric method of devocalization of a bird: electric discharges before devocalization, unevenness of categories, restoration of activity of a bird after devocalization, traumatism; unevenness of bloodless, difficult working conditions of operators of a hinge plate (dust, noise and other), need of fixing of a live bird, different quality of devocalization of different weight bird. In article data on studying of influence of devocalization of a bird are provided in the controlled gas environment on indicators of quality of meat of broilers. Comparison of ways of devocalization is carried out: gas and electric. Consistent patterns of change of pH in fowl depending on a way of devocalization are determined. On the basis of the obtained research data it is possible to draw a conclusion on expediency of use of a method of gas devocalization at slaughter and primary processing of broilers that will allow to increase competitiveness of domestic poultry farming significantly...|$|E
40|$|Protein was {{the first}} {{substance}} recognized as {{a vital part of}} living tissue. About 18 percent of the human body {{is in the form of}} protein, and certain protein constituents can be obtained only from dietary sources. Since meat is the chief source of protein in the normal diet, this study was aimed primarily at factors influencing quality of meat. The problem included two particular meats, lamb and turkey. The per capita consumption of lamb in the United States is lower than that for any other meat. In 1944 in the United States 6. 7 pounds of lamb were eaten per capita. This amount decreased to a low of 3. 4 pounds in 1951 but was followed by an increase. In 1958, a new low of 4. 1 pounds per capita consumption was reported. Several factors such as regional differences, customs, supply, and habits can be listed as factors influencing these changes. The Western United States represents almost half of the total sheep production in this country, and Utah ranks among the leading Western states. Sheep and lambs produced on Utah farms in 1961 totaled 1, 188, 000 and represented a dollar value of $ 19, 483, 000. Palatability and tenderness of lamb can be attributed directly to the quality of the animal at the time of <b>slaughter.</b> <b>Quality</b> is determined by several factors including fat covering, which in turn is determined by the feeding regime. Thus, the producer is vitally concerned with the best feeding plan to produce the highest quality animal, while the housewife is likewise looking for the best buy for her money. The objective of the first phase of this study was to show the effect of varying rates of weight gain on palatability and tenderness of lamb. The year 1960 was a revolution to the turkey industry with a one third increase of turkey production over the previous year. In the years since the World War II, turkey consumption in the United States has nearly doubled. This can be attributed to the fact that convenience was greatly increased with the availability of eviscerated ready-to-cook turkeys, the availability of frozen turkeys throughout the entire year, some decline in prices of turkey meat compared with most other meats, and the fact that smaller turkeys or parts of the whole carcass were available as well as other factors. Many recent advances in processing turkeys have been made to decrease the time and labor spent. Technical machinery and newer methods are now used to produce the oven-ready birds. Factors, such as scalding time and temperatures, methods of feather removal, chilling time and chilling methods, freezing rates, and cooking methods have been shown to have an influence on the tenderness of turkey. As new methods and machinery are developed for shortening processing time, the effect on the tenderness of the final product should be a prime consideration. It was the primary objective of the second phase of this study to show the effect of length of chilling time as influenced by method of chilling on the tenderness of roasted turkeys. Other variables that were considered were sex differences, method of feather removal, and method of cooking...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} housing of {{veal calves}} in individual crates without roughage has received prolonged and serious criticism, since it denies the animals various social activities, {{freedom of movement}} and the possibility to consume roughage and to ruminate. In order to develop an economically acceptable alternative to this housing system, which would provide a significant improvement in calf welfare, the housing of calves in groups of five was evaluated with regards to husbandry, health and ethological aspects. The present study focussed mainly on the behaviour of the calves in individual crates and group pens (chapter IV) {{and it was only}} casually concerned with the production and health of the animals (chapter III). A major problem in the group pens was the occurrence of preputial sucking and urine drinking, which had a negative influence on production, health and behaviour. The development of these activities was described (chapter V) and several experiments concerning their prevention were presented (chapter VI). The influence on lying behaviour of the tethering of the calves during the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival - as a preventive measure against preputial sucking and urine drinking - was studied in chapter VII. Finally, restrictions to particular lying postures in the crates were investigated with respect to their effect on sleep (chapter VIII). In five consecutive experiments, a total of 94 calves were housed in individual crates (1, 65 x 0, 65 m) and provided with 100 g straw/calf/day. whereas 99 calves were kept in groups of five in pens (2, 20 x 3, 83 m) on concrete slatted floors with straw bedding and an ad libitum supply of straw in baskets. The group housed calves were not tethered during the first weeks after arrival. In four other experiments, a total of 47 calves were housed in individual crates (1, 70 x 0, 70 m) and given 200 g straw cobs/calf/day from week 7 or 9 onwards, whereas 139 calves were kept in groups of five in pens (2, 40 x 3, 05 m) on wooden (and in some pens partly concrete) slatted floors. 1 kg straw cobs was supplied daily from week 7 or 9 onwards in one trough per group pen. During the first 6 weeks after arrival, the calves were tethered to the feeding gate, separated individually by partitions. All calves were male and predominantly black and white (FH x HF). In three out of the nine experiments, male red and white (MRY) calves were used. The influence of this breed difference was not discussed. The calves were fed a milk replacer in open buckets twice daily at approximately 8. 00 and 16. 00 h. In chapter III, limited data on production, health and labour requirements of the calves in these housing systems are reported, which provide a first impression on how individual crates and group pens compare. Growth rate (about 1200 g /day) and feed conversion (about 1, 5) of the calves slaughtered at a normal weight in group pens with and without straw bedding {{on the one hand and}} individual crates on the other were comparable and quite favourable. <b>Slaughter</b> <b>quality,</b> which was satisfactory in general, was also similar in these different housing systems. Haemoglobin levels at slaughter were fairly high (8 - 110 g/ 100 ml), but meat colour was still acceptable. A relatively large number of group housed calves, however, died or had to be culled or eliminated. The total of these losses amounted to 10, 1 % in the group pens with straw bedding, against 4, 3 % in the corresponding crates; in the group pens with slatted floors the total losses were 9, 4 % against 2, 2 % in the crates. These high losses in the group pens mainly occurred because in this housing system it was difficult to treat diseased calves individually (for example by supplying a medicinated milk replacer) since they were often pushed away by penmates. When disregarding these losses, the health status of the calves, as measured by the frequency and duration of the different medical treatments imposed,seemed no worse in the group pens than in the individual crates. In the group pens, the provision of 23, 3 kg strawlcalf for feeding and 106, 3 kg straw/ calf for bedding took 138, 7 min/calf in total during the entire fattening period, against 32, 6 min/calf for supplying 7, 1 kg straw/calf in the individual crates. In the group pens with bare slatted floors and the corresponding crates, the total amount of straw cobs provided from week 9 onwards (13 - 14 kg/calf) and the time required to do this (15 - 17 min/calf) were about equal. In the first series of experiments, when the calves were tethered for the first 6 weeks after arrival, preputial sucking did not occur. The muzzling of preputial suckers was not satisfactory, since it obstructed smelling, licking and the intake of straw and moreover, it did not stop the ingestion of urine. Abomasal lesions (erosions, ulcers, scars), which were mainly located in the pyloric region, were observed in calves housed in individual crates and group pens alike. In only 14 - 37 % of the animals, the abomasums were not affected by lesions. It was concluded that group housing with or without straw bedding is not incompatible with fast growth, favourable feed conversion and adequate <b>slaughter</b> <b>quality.</b> The high losses in the group pens may perhaps be reduced by restraining the calves at feeding with a self- yoking feeding gate, which facilitates not only the treatment of illnesses but also their detection. The latter seems particularly valuable on practical farms, when health inspection is not as intensive as in the present study. The supply and removal of straw as a bedding is extremely labour intensive and therefore wooden slatted floors without straw are preferred in further research. The study of the causation and prevention of preputial sucking and urine drinking has a high priority, since preventive tethering restricts freedom of movement, social contact and exploratory behaviour. In chapter IV, it was investigated to what extent calves in individual crates were restricted in their behaviour in comparison to calves in group pens and how they dealt with their situation. For this purpose, the behaviour of the same calves whose production characteristics were described in the previous chapter was registered. Observations were carried out on all individual calves in both housing systems over one period of 23 hours (24 hours with exception of feeding periods) in weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20 after arrival by means of instantaneous sampling in 10 minute intervals. Subsequently, an analysis of variance was executed to calculate the average frequency and trend for each behaviour and both housing systems were compared on the basis of these parameters. The percentages quoted are close approximations of average values over the second series of four experiments (with group pens on slatted floors without straw bedding and the corresponding crates). The calves in the crates spent more time lying than those in the group pens (74 against 68 %). This is probably above all the result of a greater variety of stimuli in the group pens, but occasional mounting and treading of penmates may also have contributed to this difference. Lying on the side or on the brisket with both hindlegs stretched in the group pens amounted to 2 and 8 % of total lying time respectively. Lying was severely restricted by the sidewalls of the crates and consequently, these postures only rarely occurred in the crates at the end of the fattening period. It is argued that these restrictions may interfere with the relaxation of the body. Moreover, these limitations seemed to affect behavioural thermoregulation; the crated calves regulated heat loss by stretching their forelegs forwards during lying (27 % of total lying) or by bending them under the body, whereas the group housed calves increased or decreased body. contact with the floor often by stretching and bending their hindlegs instead of their forelegs (hindlegs stretched: 10 % of total lying; forelegs stretched: 15, 5 % of total lying). Lying with the head turned backwards, which is the usual posture for supporting the head (in the group pens 20 - 25 % of total lying) became increasingly restricted in the individual crates towards the end of the fattening period. In the crates, the duration of this lying posture as a proportion of total lying decreased from 25 % in week 8 to 5 % in week 20. Although the head was supported forwards on the floor more often (10 % instead of 5 % of total lying) or against the partitions (1 - 2 % of total lying), the duration of lying with the head supported was clearly reduced in the crates in comparison to the group pens: 16 % and 30 % respectively. The latter percentage includes lying with the head on penmates in the group pens (5 % of total lying). Since supporting the head is necessary for the relaxation of the neck muscles during certain states of sleep, the restriction of these tying postures in the crates may interfere with sleep as a physiological process. Furthermore, the licking of the belly, back, thighs or hindlegs (1, 7 % in the crates and 3, 2 % in the group pens) and the scratching of the head, neck or shoulders (0, 05 against 0, 16 %) were also hindered by the sidewalls of the crate, whereas rubbing (0, 6 - 0, 7 %) was not impaired. On the other hand, the licking of the forelegs (1, 0 against 0, 7 %) and the muzzle (1, 9 against 1, 1 %), which are easily accessible, was more frequently performed by the crated calves than by the group housed ones. The increase of the latter activities in the individual crates may be related to conflict situations. Self stretching was reduced in the crates as compared to the group pens (0, 14 against 0, 25 %). In the individual crates, physical interactions between neighbouring calves were usually limited to licking and sucking at feeding times when the front was opened, whereas in the group pens mutual licking occurred regularly throughout the day (2, 5 %) and head butting and mounting (together 1, 0 %) were also performed. Preputial sucking and urine drinking were seldom in this period from 8 to 20 weeks after arrival (together less than 0, 3 %). Occasional licking outside feeding periods was observed in the crates as soon as the calves were able to reach over the sidewalls, which shows their desire for social contacts. Head butting against inanimate objects and jumping as an introduction to play were more frequent in the individual crates than in the group pens (together 0, 4 % against 0, 2 %), which may indicate a need for social play in the individually housed animals. Exploration by the crated calves was confined to the licking and sniffing at the front part of the crates and the surveying of the area in front of and behind the crates. As a consequence of the limited (visual) contact with the environment, the calves in the crates were quickly alarmed, in contrast to those in the group pens, which could survey the environment even when lying. Eating and ruminating were clearly enhanced in the group pens with straw bedding and ad libitum straw for feeding (7 and 22 % respectively) as compared to the group pens with slatted floors and a limited supply of straw cobs (1, 5 and 9, 5 % respectively) or the individual crates with small gifts of straw or straw cobs (1 - 2 % and 8 - 12 % respectively). The performance of stereotypies such as the licking (4 - 5 %) or scraping (2 - 3 %) of objects and tongue playing (2 %) was not affected by individual or group housing as such, but these activities were somewhat reduced when straw supply was ad libitum instead of restricted. Wooden slatted floors were slippery and uneven in comparison to concrete slatted floors with straw bedding although this probably did not interfere with the mobility of the calves, for instance during head butting and mounting. As a first step in finding ways of preventing preputial sucking and urine drinking, it is described in chapter V how the orientation of sucking behaviour develops in calves which are loose housed in groups of five upon arrival. Initially, sucking was orientated towards physical objects or body parts of congeners other than the prepuce. Most calves preferred a certain body part or (more seldom) a physical object for sucking, such as the ears, mouth, legs or scrotum of penmates, the rim of a bucket or a horizontal bar. These preferences differed among individual calves and usually changed over time. In the second and third week after arrival, many calves showed a preference for sucking at the prepuce of congeners. In reaction, the sucked calf usually started to urinate, while the sucking calf held on to the prepuce and ingested most of the urine. This preputial sucking was observed in the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival; thereafter, the frequency of this behaviour and of the other sucking activities was strongly reduced in all calves. Seven out of the 30 calves in this study never sucked the prepuce and two only seldom. In most calves, preputial sucking took up several hours per day, whereas sucking at physical objects or other body parts lasted one hour per day at most. Moreover, preputial sucking occurred during several activity periods throughout the day and night, whereas other sucking was concentrated at feeding times. Individual preferences or aversions for sucking at the prepuce of particular penmates were uncommon. Persistent preputial sucking resulted in the loss of hair around the muzzle and cases of poor growth among the sucking calves, whereas hairloss of the prepuce and avoidance reactions occurred among the calves which were sucked. Urine drinking, the licking of the urine jet of a urinating calf, was relatively harmless and infrequent; it was performed by preputial suckers as well as non-preputial suckers. On the basis of this information, two hypotheses were proposed. The first one implicated that the attraction of preputial sucking as compared to other sucking was connected to the intake of urine during this activity. The second one suggested that the absence of preputial sucking in some calves had to do with their early sucking experience. Both hypotheses were tested in chapter VI. In a pilot study (chapter VI. 1), several sucking and drinking devices were presented in different combinations to calves in group pens which had been fed during the first day of their life either with open buckets, with teat buckets or by the mother cow. All calves were fed a milk replacer in open buckets twice daily. The drinking and sucking behaviour of the calves was registered during one 24 hour period in weeks 2, 3 and 4 after arrival. Teats connected to a water reservoir were sucked more than empty teats, which suggests that the release of fluid from the sucked object is an incentive in sucking. This indirectly supports the idea that the excretion of urine stimulates preputial sucking. Furthermore, 11 out of 22 open bucket reared calves and 2 out of 10 cow reared calves started preputial sucking, whereas all 8 teat bucket reared calves refrained from this activity, which tentatively shows that early sucking experience may influence the frequency of preputial sucking. Next (chapter VI. 2), it is argued that the provision of only small amounts of milk replacer during the first weeks of the fattening period (3 - 4 l/calf/day) may lead to a fluid deficit which may be one of the causes of preputial sucking. Therefore, the effect of extra water supply on the incidence of preputial sucking was investigated. In three replicate experiments, 3 - 5 l water (25 - 35 °C) was provided two or three times per day in open buckets to a total of 60 calves in groups of five, whereas 60 other group housed calves did not receive extra water. Total fluid intake (milk replacer + water) was on average two to three times higher in the extra water groups than in the control groups of calves (for instance in week 3 : 14 l against 5 l/calf/day). Nevertheless, in extra water groups 10 calves started preputial sucking against 14 calves in the groups without extra water; there was no significant influence of an extra supply of water on the incidence of preputial sucking. In one of the three replicates, drinking intensity of all individual calves was measured every two days by recording latency till drinking and drinking rate in separate "drinking tests". Surprisingly, the drinking intensity of calves provided with extra water was no less than that of calves without extra water. Moreover, those calves which drank the maximum of 15 l of water daily showed the highest drinking intensity. This raises some interesting questions concerning water intake regulation in these young calves. In the last section (chapter VI. 3), it was investigated if early sucking experience indeed affected the development of preputial sucking as suggested by earlier data. In the first experiment 20 bucket reared, 15 teat bucket reared and 5 cow reared calves were kept in groups of five and fed twice daily from open buckets. 13 out of 20 bucket reared calves and three out of five cow reared calves started preputial sucking, whereas again none of the 15 teat bucket reared calves engaged in this behaviour. The difference between bucket and teat bucket reared calves was significant (p(one-tailed) = 0, 028). In the second experiment, eight bucket reared and nine teat bucket reared calves were observed, but preputial sucking did not occur. In this experiment, the contacting and sucking of a teat was studied by presenting a non-nutritive teat to each calf individually for 5 minute periods, six times a day. Four out of eight bucket reared calves usually failed to suck the teat, whereas all nine teat bucket reared ones nearly always attached to the teat and sucked. The average duration of sucking of those calves which contacted the teat was similar in both groups. The fact that in three experiments none out of a total of 32 teat bucket reared calves engaged in preputial sucking, compared to 24 out of 50 bucket reared and 5 out of 15 cow reared calves, strongly suggests that early sucking experience influences the development of preputial sucking. Furthermore, the failure of some of the bucket reared calves to attach to the teat may indicate that such calves are less likely to find the teats of an automatic feed dispenser on their own as compared to teat bucket reared calves. The practical consequences of these findings should be investigated further with a larger number of animals. Although the previous results advanced the understanding of how preputial sucking develops and what factors are involved in its causation, they did not provide an instant method for preventing this unwanted behaviour. Since at present, tethering the calves and separating them by small partitions during the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival seems the only effective and practical way to avoid preputial sucking, different tethering methods were evaluated regarding their consequences for calf behaviour (chapter VII). Stalls (i. e. spaces where single calves were tethered between partitions) of 0, 48 m and 0, 58 m in width were equipped with either 0, 48 m long chains with contraweights (0, 2 kg) which were guided through openings in the feeding gate or fixed chains of medium length (0, 40 m); in a second experiment, the long chains with contraweights were replaced by short fixed chains (0, 34 m). Different lying postures and patterns of standing up and lying down were recorded, mainly from 6 to 9 weeks after arrival, just before the calves were untethered. The tethering of calves in 0, 48 m wide stalls restricted lying on the side or on the brisket with the hindlegs stretched at 6 and 8 weeks to about the same extent as housing in 0, 70 m wide crates at 8 weeks; in 0, 58 m wide stalls, both lying postures were hindered less. The stretching of the forelegs in these different types of stalls was not impaired. Stalls of 0, 48 m in width restricted the lying with the head turned backwards in contrast to stalls of 0, 58 m in width, but these restrictions were not serious. The use of chains of 0, 34 m in length and chains provided with contraweights to prevent entanglement of the forelegs was unnecessary and moreover, it hindered the turning of the head backwards during lying; these chains should not be used. In all tethering stalls, the space in front of the calves was insufficient to swing the head forwards freely when standing up. Casual contacts with the partitions or restrictions by the chains were of minor importance, since they did not really interfere with standing up and lying down. In general, standing up and lying down occurred without great difficulty, but the calves' performance deteriorated in cold conditions. Moreover, at temperatures below approximately 8 °C, which is the lower critical value for veal calves of 4 - 10 weeks of age, they experienced discomfort, as appeared from the shivering of the animals and extreme postural changes including the tucking in of all legs and the burying of the head in the flank. Therefore, such low temperatures are clearly disagreeable. The support of the head while lying, which is necessary for the relaxation of the neck muscles during paradoxical sleep (PS), was diminished in the individual crates as a result of restrictions to lying with the head turned backwards. The consequences of this impairment for the performance of PS in calves of about one week old were examined in chapter VIII. Lying with the head turned backwards was obstructed for 24 hours by the use of a short halter and the performance of PS was measured before, during and after this obst...|$|E

40|$|Improvement of {{nutrition}} of dairy cows and {{improvement of the}} genetic capacity for milk production aim to improve the efficiency of converting feed into milk. This efficiency can be expressed as the ratio between energy in milk and Net Energy intake (defined as the biological efficiency) or as the difference between returns from milk and feed costs (defined as the economic efficiency). In these two definitions of efficiency the relationship between feed intake and milk production is very important. Little is known about genetic differences in feed intake and feed efficiency and a possible interaction with diet composition. Genetic differences among cows may be reflected in differences between groups of cows of different breeds, which are selected with a different breeding goal. Differences in diet composition are reflected in complete diets, which differ in the ratio between concentrates and roughages. The aim of this thesis is to describe differences between dairy breeds in feed intake and in partition of Net Energy between milk production, maintenance and gain in different circumstances: different parities, different parts of lactation, feeding ad libitum complete diets which differ in roughage content and treatment with different dosages of bovine somatotropin. Relationships between feed intake and milk production, maintenance and gain are presented in the different circumstances. Possibilities to manipulate feed intake and energy utilization in dairy cattle are outlined. The study is based on feed intake experiments with cows of four breeds: the Jersey, the Holstein Friesian (HF), the Dutch Friesian (DF) and the Dutch Red and White (DRW). In four experiments the cows were fed ad libitum two completely mixed diets with respectively 0 and 50 per cent concentrates. In a fifth experiment cows of different breeds were treated with bovine somatotropin (BST), while fed ad libitum a diet with 50 per cent concentrates. In all trials the roughage {{was a mixture of}} corn silage and of high quality grass silage or artificially dried grass. In Chapter 2 an experiment with HF, DF and DRW heifers is described. From 2 months before the first calving until 10 months of lactation they were fed ad libitum a complete diet with roughages or a complete diet of the similar roughages with 50 per cent concentrates on a dry matter basis. In the experimental period of 52 weeks the breeds differed significantly in energy intake, milk energy production and in biological efficiency. In the HF, DF and DRW heifers these figures were respectively: 32601, 30884 and 30581 MJ NE in feed; 16553, 15086 and 14814 MJ energy in milk and 51, 49 and 48 per cent. Despite large differences in feed energy intake and milk energy production between the concentrates (C) and roughage (R) diet (8500 MJ NE and 4246 MJ) no significant interaction was found between breed and diet composition for any of the studied characteristics. The biological efficiency for milk production was equal for the C and R diet: 49 per cent. Body weight gain of the concentrates group was 59 kg higher than that of the roughage group. In Chapter 3 the results of a feed intake study with HF, DF and DRW cows in second lactation are presented and discussed. These cows participated in the study described in Chapter 2 on the same diets. In this experiment their feed intake was measured from two months before the second calving until 10 months of the second lactation. For none of the studied traits a significant interaction between breed and diet composition was found: differences between breeds were independent of diet composition. In the HF, DF and DRW cows feed energy intake was 35052, 35182 and 32015 MJ NE respectively; milk energy was 18700, 15475 and 15548 MJ respectively and biological efficiency 55, 44 and 48 per cent respectively. Between the concentrates and the roughage diet the difference in feed energy intake was 6210 MJ NE, in milk energy production 4423 MJ and in biological efficiency on an absolute basis 4 per cent. The increase in milk yield from first to second lactation was significantly higher in the HF cows than in the DF and DRW cows. The body weight gain of the concentrates group in second lactation was much less than in first lactation. Chapter 4 reports on an experiment with Jersey heifers and a control group of HF + DF + DRW heifers, which were fed a complete diet of roughages or a complete diet of the similar roughages and 50 per cent concentrates on a dry matter basis in the first 39 weeks of lactation. Significant interactions between breed and diet composition were found for feed energy intake, milk yield, fat percentage in milk, milk protein yield and milk energy production. For these traits the differences between the breeds were dependent of the diet composition. Mean differences between the Jersey and the HF + DF + DRW heifers on the C diet and on the R diet (in parentheses) were: - 6527 (- 4319) MJ NE for feed energy intake; - 1791 (- 991) kg for milk yield; 2. 31 (1. 84) for fat percentage; - 5 (- 16) kg for protein yield and - 2533 (- 898) MJ for milk energy production. These breed x diet interactions might be caused by a higher feed intake capacity of the Jersey heifers compared to the HF + DF + DRW heifers and the relatively higher need of Jerseys for lipogenic precursors and a lower need for aminogenic and glucogenic precursors for milk synthesis, which have better been provided for on the roughage diet. The biological efficiency for milk production was 65 per cent for the Jersey heifers on the roughage diet, 59 per cent for the Jersey heifers on the concentrates diet, 56 per cent for the HF + DF + DRW heifers on the R diet and 55 per cent for the HF + DF + DRW heifers on the C diet. In Chapter 5 a further study with Jersey cows and a control group of HF + DF + DRW cows is described. After their third calving these cows, which participated in the former study as a heifer, were fed the same diets as in the previous described study. Again body weight, milk production and feed intake were recorded in the first 39 weeks of lactation. Only for fat percentage of milk a significant interaction between breed and diet composition was found. Mean differences between the Jersey and the HF + DF + DRW cows on the C diet and on the R diet (in parentheses) were - 6460 (- 5162) MJ NE for feed energy intake; - 2560 (- 1707) kg for milk yield; 2. 82 (2. 38) for fat percentage in the milk; - 55 (- 26) kg for protein yield and - 3241 (- 1112) MJ for milk energy production. The increase in Net Energy intake and milk yield from first to third lactation was for the Jerseys and the HF + W + DRW cows on the C diet 25 and 24 per cent, respectively and on the R diet 48 and 51 per cent respectively. The biological efficiency for milk production was 69 per cent for the Jerseys on the roughage diet, 57 per cent for the Jerseys on the C diet, 61 per cent for the HF + DF + DRW cows on the R diet and 56 per cent for the HF + DF + DRW cows on the C diet. In Chapter 6 the effect of parity on feed intake and feed efficiency are established in weeks I - 39 of lactation. For this purpose 265 lactations of 159 cows out of the experiments described in the Chapters 2 - 5 were available. Unequal variances among breeds in the different parity x diet groups and some differences in ranking of the breeds caused a significant three-way interaction parity x breed x diet. In general, the differences between the C and R diet groups in feed intake and milk production decreased with increasing parity. Biological efficiency was not affected by parity. Economic efficiency increased in higher parities, which was most pronounced on the R diet. The presence of data from cows in two lactations facilitated calculations of repeatabilities for the studied traits. Repeatabilities for fat concentration (0. 75), protein concentration (0. 68) and average body weight (0, 69) were high. Repeatabilities for dry matter intake (0. 39), milk yield (0. 47), biological efficiency (0. 46), economic efficiency (0. 37) and gain during lactation (0. 27) were lower. An attempt to detect possible differences between parities, diets and breeds in Net Energy requirements for milk production, maintenance and gain was not successful. A multiple regression of Net Energy intake on milk energy, metabolic weight and gain yielded unrealistic coefficients of regression, which might be due to measurement errors for the independent variables and to relationships between these variables. Chapter 7 is a description of an experiment with Jersey, Friesian and Dutch Red and White cows, which were treated from week 13 to week 36 of lactation with recombinantly derived bovine somatotropin in a sustained delivery vehicle. After an 84 days pretreatment period four treatments were used: an untreated control and three different levels of somatotropin administered once every 28 -days in a sustained delivery vehicle by subcutaneous injection. From weeks 1 - 36 the cows were fed ad libitum a complete diet of 50 per cent concentrates and 50 per cent roughage, No significant interaction between breeds and treatment was detected. In the three breeds the 640 mg-dosage gave optimum results: an increase in daily milk yield of 3. 3 kg was found and fat percentage increased by 0. 24 per cent. The plasma levels of 3 -hydroxybutyrate tended to be higher in treated cows and fat percentage of their milk showed large variations within a four weeks period, which both indicate the involvement of adipose tissues in the response in milk fat production after BST-treatment. This {{is one of the reasons}} to study effects of exogenous bovine somatotropin over more than one lactation. Cows with a higher milk yield in the pretreatment period, showed a slightly lower increase in milk production after treatment with somatotropin than cows with a lower milk yield in the pretreatment period. Chapter 8 is a general discussion, which founds the conclusions of this thesis. Between breeds differences exist in voluntary feed intake, which are related to differences in their feed requirements. Jerseys have a much lower voluntary feed intake than Holstein Friesians, Dutch Friesians and Dutch Red and Whites. However, the feed intake capacity (feed intake in relation to body weight) is higher in the Jerseys. When Jerseys are involved in a breed comparison, the differences between the breeds depend on the concentrates level of the diet. Jerseys have a different ratio between fat, protein and lactose in the milk compared to the other breeds, which might be an explanation for the breed x diet interaction, when Jerseys are involved in a comparison with larger breeds. Differences in feed intake capacity between breeds are associated with differences in body conformation and are negatively related to <b>slaughter</b> <b>quality</b> traits. Feed intake capacity increases with parity, especially on a roughage diet. The Jerseys and Holstein Friesians have a higher biological and economic efficiency for milk production than Dutch Friesians and Dutch Red and Whites, because of a higher ratio between milk energy production and maintenance requirements. Stage of lactation has a considerable effect on biological efficiency. Biological efficiency for milk production is slightly lower on a concentrates diet than on a roughage diet. Differences between breeds in biological efficiency are more pronounced on the roughage diet. Differences between breeds in economic efficiency are dependent on the diet. The profitability of concentrates feeding decreases with increasing parity, especially in the dairy breeds. The total economic efficiency of a breed on farm level is mainly determined by prices for milk, beef and feed and by market restrictions. Biological and economic efficiency can be improved by a higher milk yield. Biological efficiency is not affected by differences in dry matter intake or body weight. Feed intake of dairy cows is greatly influenced by the ratio between concentrates and roughage in the diet and to a limited extent by treatment with bovine somatotropin. The ratio between concentrates and roughage in the diet has a minor effect on feed efficiency. Administration of bovine somatotropin and selection for milk yield has a positive effect on feed efficiency by diluting maintenance costs per kg milk. ...|$|E

We extended an existing model of the sensitivity of detection of Salmonella in individual samples to create a mathematical model of the sensitivity of pooled sam-pling. Parameters for the model were estimated using data obtained by collecting 50 faecal sam-ples from 2 pig farms. Individual samples of 0. 1, 0. 5, 1, 10 and 25 g were tested and pools of 5, 10 and 20 samples were created from these. For individual samples, the highest test sensitivity (90 %) was found at 10 g whilst the 25 g test sensitivity was 83 %. Sensitivity reduced with sample weight for samples of less than 10 g. Incubation for 48 hours produced a more sensitive test than incubation for 24 hours.

Three treatments were compared in a completely randomized experiment using 36 single male Suffolk Down lambs with an initial age and live weight of 80 d and 25 kg, respectively. The three treatments were: (a) suckling lambs kept with their mothers on annual Mediterranean grassland (GRAZE); (b) weaned stall-fed lambs on a control ration (CONC); and (c) weaned stall-fed lambs on an olive cake-based ration (CAKE). At the end of the 28 -d experimental period, lambs were <b>slaughtered,</b> carcass <b>quality</b> evaluated, and samples of subcutaneous fat analyzed for fatty acids. Treatments did not differ in weight gain or carcass weight and quality, but highly significant differences were found in several fatty acid contents.

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to study the effect of fasting, lairage and transport durations on four main attributes of the technological pork meat quality. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression approach was adopted. The results of our meta-analysis showed that fasting time had a significant effect on pH measured 24 h post-mortem (pHu) and drip loss (DL) measured in longissimus muscle. While, lairage affected only the pHu in semimembranosus muscle. Interestingly, we found that DL was the lone attribute that was affected by transport time and its interaction with fasting time...|$|R
