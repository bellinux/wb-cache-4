50|$|Two new distilleries (Daftmill in Fife and Annandale in Dumfries and Galloway) {{have started}} distilling {{but have not}} yet brought a single malt to market. Daftmill could legally <b>start</b> <b>bottling</b> a single malt (or {{supplying}} blenders) at any time, because its first batches have now been in cask for over three years. Three years is the legal minimum pre-bottling aging period for a product labelled Scotch whisky, but single malts this young are usually only marketed in countries like Italy. It is not known whether Daftmill are supplying malt to producers of blended whisky or vatted malts, but this is likely (the majority of most distilleries' production is sold this way).|$|R

50|$|The {{spring in}} Southern France from which Perrier is drawn was {{originally}} known as Les Bouillens. It {{had been used}} as a spa since Roman times. Local doctor Louis Perrier bought the spring in 1898 and operated a commercial spa there; he also bottled the water for sale. He later sold the spring to St John Harmsworth, a wealthy British visitor. Harmsworth was the younger brother of the newspaper magnates Lord Northcliffe and Lord Rothermere. He had come to France to learn the language. Dr. Perrier showed him the spring, and he decided to buy it. He sold his share of the family newspapers to raise the money. Harmsworth closed the spa, as spas were becoming unfashionable. He renamed the spring Source Perrier and <b>started</b> <b>bottling</b> the water in distinctive green bottles. The shape was that of the Indian clubs, which Harmsworth used for exercise.|$|R
5000|$|In {{cooperation}} with Larvik Bad the local brewery Vestfold bryggeri <b>started</b> <b>bottling</b> mineral {{water under the}} brandname of [...] "Salus". Bottling commenced on August 16, 1907, making it the oldest brand of mineral water in Norway. In 1912 a new factory was initiated, by the architects Christian Morgenstierne and Arne Eide. It was expanded in 1915, {{the same year that}} the production was moved to the new site. The building was expanded again in 1980, and is still the bottling facility for Farris. In 1915 also the brand name was altered to [...] "Farris". According to Thomson Financial, [...] "Farris has come to symbolise ‘Norwegian sparkling mineral water’, appears to have a virtual stranglehold on this sector with other local brands simply too small to warrant any strongly promotional activities to try to break this stranglehold." [...] It holds a market percentage of 71% in Norway.|$|R
50|$|In high mountains, {{atmospheric}} pressure is lower and {{this means that}} less oxygen is available to breathe. This is the underlying cause of altitude sickness. Everyone needs to acclimatise, even exceptional mountaineers that have been to high altitude before. Generally speaking, mountaineers <b>start</b> using <b>bottled</b> oxygen when they climb above 7,000 m. Exceptional mountaineers have climbed 8000-metre peaks (including Everest) without oxygen, almost always with a carefully planned program of acclimatisation.|$|R

50|$|The {{distillery}} {{was formally}} opened on 30 January 1967 by the actor Andrew Cruickshank, {{the star of}} the BBC's ‘Dr Finlay's Casebook’ series. Deanston <b>started</b> <b>bottling</b> in 1971 and the first single malt was named Old Bannockburn. Teith Mill, a blended whisky, was also produced at this time - a kiosk was set up at Blair Drummond Safari Park which sold Old Bannockburn and Teith Mill in take-away cartons. At this point, although it made business sense to sell Deanston as a single malt, it was mainly produced for blending purposes. In 1971, Invergordon Distillers (bought by Whyte & Mackay in 1990) bought Brodie Hepburn Ltd, with Tullibardine Distillery and a 30% share in Deanston Distillery. A year later, Invergordon purchased Deanston outright and the first single malt bearing the name Deanston was produced in 1974. After a downturn in the whisky industry, Deanston Distillery ceased production in 1982 for eight years, before being purchased by current owners Burn Stewart Distillers Limited in 1990 (now part of Distell_Group_Limited).|$|R
