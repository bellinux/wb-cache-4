5|$|White <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate,</b> AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver {{was associated with the}} moon. It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to. <b>Silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> {{and silver}} halides in {{photography}} has rapidly declined {{with the advent}} of digital technology.

40|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of precipitation nitrate reflects the {{processes involved in}} its formation. <b>Silver</b> <b>nitrates</b> prepared from Maryland precipitation were thermally decomposed to gases for mass spectrometric analyses. Nitrate &# 948; 15 N ranged from - 5. 1 ± 0. 5 to + 5. 9 ± 0. 5 (1 &# 963;), &# 948; 18 O ranged from + 42. 6 ± 0. 5 to + 81. 9 ± 0. 5, and &# 916; 17 O ranged from + 15. 33 ± 0. 05 to + 31. 71 ± 0. 05.

Differences between the methods were attributed to organic contaminants in the <b>silver</b> <b>nitrates.</b> Nitrate &# 948; 15 N, &# 948; 18 O, and &# 916; 17 O were highest {{in the winter and}} lowest in the summer. Ion concentrations, storm track data, and the &# 948; 34 S of precipitation sulfate were used for interpretations. Most likely, &# 948; 15 N varied due to seasonal changes in the NOx photo-stationary state, and &# 948; 18 O and &# 916; 17 O varied due to changes in oxidation chemistry...|$|R

5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is used in}} {{numerous}} applications other than as currency, such as solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term silverware), and as an investment medium (coins and bullion) Silver is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, and in catalysis of chemical reactions.

Contaminants are more likely to cause chronic health effects. Water can be contaminated from pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites.

Inorganic contaminants include toxic metals like arsenic, barium, chromium, lead, mercury, and <b>silver.</b> <b>Nitrates</b> are another source of inorganic contamination.

5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
5|$|The common {{oxidation}} {{states of}} silver are (in order of commonness): +1 (the most stable state; for example, <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate,</b> AgNO3); +2 (highly oxidising; for example, silver(II) fluoride, AgF2); and even very rarely +3 (extreme oxidising; for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF4). The +1 state {{is by far}} the most common, followed by the reducing +2 state. The +3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain, such as fluorine or peroxodisulfate, and some silver(III) compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass. Indeed, silver(III) fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with the strongest known oxidizing agent, krypton difluoride.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. <b>Silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> is the starting material in all cases.|$|E
40|$|Porous carbon xerogels {{synthesized}} in {{a previous}} study were investigated as catalysts supports. The support chosen was a micro-mesoporous carbon xerogel obtained from the pyrolysis of a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin whose synthesis variables were fixed at suitable values. Palladium and silver were deposited on this tailored texture carbon by co-impregnation using a solution of palladium and <b>silver</b> <b>nitrates</b> in nitric acid and water. Several catalysts were prepared with various Pd and Ag global contents, the latters being measured experimentally. Alloy particles, detected in all bimetallic samples, were studied {{by a combination of}} various techniques that enabled us to obtain their size as well as their bulk and surface composition. When present, the fraction of unalloyed silver was also calculated. The characterization data were related to the results of catalytic tests obtained for selective hydrodechlorination of 1, 2 -dichloroethane into ethylene. Results show that when the Ag content is too high, pure Ag particles are formed and the alloy composition remains constant. As a consequence, the surface composition of the alloy is constant as well and the catalytic tests lead to similar results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning.

40|$|Subject of Study. The paper {{deals with}} novel {{research}} of ion exchange duration influence on spectral-luminescent properties of silver clusters formed in photo-thermo-refractive glass. Method. Photo-thermo-refractive matrix glass based on Na 2 O–Al 2 O 3 –ZnO–SiO 2 –F (% mol.) system doped with 0, 002 % mol. of Sb 2 O 3 was synthesized for further research. Silver ions were introduced with low temperature ion exchange method. The glass samples were {{immersed in the}} mixture of sodium and <b>silver</b> <b>nitrates</b> 5 AgNO 3 / 95 NaNO 3 (% mol.) at the temperature of 320 °C. Ion exchange duration varied from 5 minutes to 21 hours. Luminescent silver clusters were formed in surface layers of photo-thermo-refractive glass by subsequent heat treatment at the temperature of 450 °C. Main Results. Embedding of silver ions in photo-thermo-refractive glass with ion exchange method led to long-wavelength shift of the UV edge of strong absorption. Location of the UV edge of strong absorption and emission peak of silver clusters depends on ion exchange duration and shifts to the greater wavelengthswith increasing the ion exchange process time. Quantum yield of luminescence decreases significantly according to Stern-Volmer equation with the rising of ion exchange duration. Practical Relevance.
