40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{resource}} scheduling within given resource constraints on a sectionalised construction project. A computer model has been developed which realistically simulates the progress of projects. A project has been selected and divided into <b>sections</b> whereby <b>section</b> <b>managers</b> are allocated part of the site resources to carry out their work and are made responsible for the performance of the work on their sections. The major part of the model is a heuristic scheduler that has been run under three types of project organisations, these are; central management, section management with co-operation between the sections and independent section management. The resultant project duration under fixed resource level has been used in each of these project management regimes as a measure of the efficiency of the resource scheduling process. It has been found that the scheduling is more effective in the case of section management with co-operation between the sections than the other two cases...|$|R
