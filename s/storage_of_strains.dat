40|$|A {{method for}} cryopreserving embryos of the screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), was {{developed}} for the long-term <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> used in research projects and for colonies maintained as back-up to production strains that are mass-reared for sterile insect release programs. This protocol, when combined with a previous procedure {{that was designed to}} render screwworm embryos permeable to water loss and the influx of cryoprotectants, yields rates of ~ 53 % hatching, 22 % pupation, and 75 % adult emergence. These yields are all lower than control levels, but by the next generation the progeny of the cryopreserved flies are near or equal to control levels and are available in sufficient numbers to reestablish laboratory colonies. Important to the success of this study was identifying the optimum embryonic stage for treatment, formulating an incubation regime, which allowed consistent retrieval of embryos at the optimum stage, establishing the correct dehydration time for the previtrification step, and developing a recovery system after liquid nitrogen storage of the embryos...|$|E
40|$|The yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is biotechnologically {{important}} due to {{its ability}} to produce the pigment astaxanthin, but is poorly understood at the genetic level. This is mainly because its preservation is difficult {{and many of the}} mutants obtained are unstable. The objectives of the present work were (i) the mutagenesis X. dendrorhous and, (ii) isolation of mutants with auxotrophic markers suitable for genetic studies of the carotenogenesis pathway and sexual cycle. Additionally, two kinds of preservation methods at the laboratory level were tested for the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>strains.</b> A collection of X. dendrorhous mutants affected in the production of carotenoid pigments or development of sexual structures and auxotrophic requirements were isolated by treatment with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and the antibiotic nystatin. From a detailed analysis about the requirements of auxotrophic mutants the ARG 7, ARG 3 and PRO 3 loci can be defined in this yeast. Among the methods assayed for the long-term preservation of X. dendrorhous strains, the dehydrated gelatin drop method showed the highest recovery of viable yeast after storage for 65 months. No changes in auxotrophic properties and in macro or micro morphology were observed after applying the latter method.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the survival <b>of</b> six <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> Rhizobium meliloti filtered on membrane filters and held in atmospheres of controlled relative humidities (RH) of from 0 to 100 % at 30 °C in the presence of air. The rate of water loss in the desiccator was determined by the humidity-controlling solution used. Drying was accelerated by a mild evacuation of the desiccator during the drying step. Survival rates <b>of</b> R. meliloti <b>strains</b> were much higher after slow drying to 0 % RH than immediately after rapid drying. Fast drying (drying period less than 3. 4 h) was shown to adversely affect the tolerance to storage at all RH values tested (no survival after 2 to 5 days <b>of</b> <b>storage).</b> When survival during storage was measurable (after slow drying), the optimum RH values for storage were 43 % for strains A 145 and Wu 498, 22 to 43 % for strains RCR 2011, Wu 499, and Ar 16, and 83 % for strain RCR 2004. The most favorable drying periods were 8, 9. 2, 14. 2, and 50. 1 h for the subsequent <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> RCR 2011 at RH values of 0, 22, 43, and 83 %, respectively.

40|$|This essay explores how the {{properties}} of striated muscles are matched to the tasks they perform during running, swimming and flying. During exercise the major locomotory muscles undergo alternate cycles of lengthening and shortening.

50|$|Deep {{research}} into the anatomy of large mammals such as, kangaroos and other large ungulates such as deer and gazelle, suggests strongly {{that some sort of}} elastic mechanism is important for this energetic savings. Previous combination of careful experiments, with anatomical (e.g. tendon dimensions), mechanical (e.g. force plate recordings) and mathematical calculations revealed that a significant fraction of the work done with each step could be provided by the spring-like action of tendons, rather than by muscle work.When the animal’s foot contacts the surface of the ground during high speed locomotion, the tendon or ligament is pressed tightly together, storing elastic energy much like a compressed spring. As the foot gets of the ground, the pressure on the compressed tendons and ligaments is released, and elastic recoil from these spring like structures provides additional force to propel the animal thus resulting in energetic savings. Simple calculations based kangaroo hopping and forces involved in hopping show how <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> elastic <b>strain</b> energy can save twenty to thirty percent of metabolic energy required for hopping. Measurements of oxygen consumption with fluctuations of kinetic and gravitational potential energy, indicate elastic savings of at least fifty four percent at high speeds.|$|R

40|$|Physcomitrella {{cell culture}} {{conditions}} 1 Overview Physcomitrella plants can be cultivated either on solidified medium or in liquid culture (Fig. 1). Upon cultivation on solidified medium the plants undergo normal developmental progression {{resulting in the}} formation of leafy gametophores. Starting from protonema tissue gametophore development is initiated by the formation of buds consisting of a three-faced cell. Plant tissue cultures of gametophores can be maintained by sub-culturing the gametophores monthly. Liquid cultures can be started from gametophores by inoculating liquid medium with gametophore tissue. Mechanical disruption of the gametophores using an Ultra-Turrax leads to predominant growth of protonema tissue in the liquid medium. Liquid cultures can be maintained in Erlenmeyer flasks in small volumes or plants are grown in semi-continuous bioreactor cultures for large-scale production of moss material. At any stage moss material from liquid cultures can be used to set up cultures on solidified medium. Upon regular sub-culturing the protonema tissue will undergo normal developmental progression resulting {{in the formation of}} leafy gametophores. For routine use of Physcomitrella plants it is recommended to keep plant cultures on solidified medium as a backup system or to keep spores which can be used to initiate new culture lines.

The capacity to produce Yst generally disappears during <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>strains.</b> In these strains, the yst gene is intact but remains silent. The pYV plasmid encodes the eleven secreted antihost proteins called Yops {{as well as}} the outer membrane protein YadA. The Yops are secreted by a novel, pYV-encoded secretion mechanism. This mechanism which does not involve the removal of an N-terminal signal sequence, is encoded by the pYV virA and virC loci. The virC locus contains 13 genes called yscA-M. The virA locus encodes the LcrD membrane protein. The yop, yadA and ysc genes form the yop regulon controlled by transcriptional activator VirF. Transcription of the yop, yadA, ysc and virF genes is controlled by temperature. A chromosome-encoded histone-like protein, called YmoA, is involved in the thermoregulation of the yop regulon, which suggests that this thermoregulation could result from temperature-induced changes in DNA topology. The phenotype of ymoA mutants resembles that of osmZ or drdX mutants of E. coli but YmoA is not the Yersinia homologue of the E. coli histone H 1.

Methods: Forty recreational and highly trained runners ran at four speeds barefoot and shod on a motorized treadmill. “Barefoot” runners wore thin, five-toed socks and shod runners wore neutral running shoes. Subjects were instructed to run comfortably at each speed with no instructions about foot strike patterns. Results: Eleven runners landed with an FFS when barefoot and shod and eleven runners landed with an RFS when barefoot and shod. The 18 remaining runners shifted from an FFS when barefoot to an RFS when shod (shifters). Shod shifters ran with a lower stride frequency and greater stride length than all other runners.

40|$|Abstract Background Freezing is an {{increasingly}} important means <b>of</b> preservation and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> microbial <b>strains</b> used for many types of industrial applications including food processing. However, the yeast mechanisms of tolerance and sensitivity to freeze or near-freeze stress are still poorly understood. More knowledge on this regard would improve their biotechnological potential. Glycerol, in particular intracellular glycerol, has been assigned as a cryoprotectant, also important for cold/near-freeze stress adaptation. The S. cerevisiae glycerol active transporter Stl 1 p {{plays an important role}} on the fast accumulation of glycerol. This gene is expressed under gluconeogenic conditions, under osmotic shock and stress, as well as under high temperatures. Results We found that cells grown on STL 1 induction medium (YPGE) and subjected to cold/near-freeze stress, displayed an extremely high expression of this gene, also visible at glycerol/H + symporter activity level. Under the same conditions, the strains harbouring this transporter accumulated more than 400 mM glycerol, whereas the glycerol/H + symporter mutant presented less than 1 mM. Consistently, the strains able to accumulate glycerol survive 25 - 50 % more than the stl 1 Δ mutant. Conclusions In this work, we report the contribution of the glycerol/H + symporter Stl 1 p for the accumulation and maintenance of glycerol intracellular levels, and consequently cell survival at cold/near-freeze and freeze temperatures. These findings have a high biotechnological impact, as they show that any S. cerevisiae strain already in use can become more resistant to cold/freeze-thaw stress just by simply adding glycerol to the broth. The combination of low temperatures with extracellular glycerol will induce the transporter Stl 1 p. This solution avoids the use <b>of</b> transgenic <b>strains,</b> in particular in food industry. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on color stability of fresh pork. Of the seven LAB strains isolated from the Chinese dry-cured hams, H strain was identified as Lactobacillus salivarius (CCTCC M 2010374) by serial biochemical tests and 16 S rRNA analysis. The fresh pork samples were immersed in the H strain and Lactobacillus fermentum extracts for 1 min after ultrasonic cells disruption and samples immersed in sterile 0. 9 % (m/V) saline was served as a control group, then samples were vacuum packaged and stored at 4 °C. Nitrate oxide synthase (NOS) and metmyoglobin (MetMb) reductase were found in the cells extracts <b>of</b> H <b>strain.</b> After 6 days <b>of</b> <b>storage,</b> H <b>strain</b> group was found {{to be associated with the}} highest CIE a* values (P< 0. 05) and the lowest MetMb (41 %). L. salivarius H strain has thus shown a beneficial effect on the color stability of fresh pork. Further research is necessary to elucidate its mechanism...|$|R

However, experimental verification of theoretical predictions is still greatly lacking. Such high strains could simply not be controllably achieved. In our group, MEMS based tensile devices were developed to gen- erate large strain on graphene membranes. In this thesis, graphene grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition was transferred and clamped on these devices. In-situ Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed, while straining the material. Scanning Electron Microscope images proved that the fracture strain was ex- ceeded, rupturing the membrane. Nonetheless no Raman peak shift was observed, opposed to what was expected from the literature.

30|$|Tendons {{transmit}} the force exerted by the corresponding muscle to the skeleton and, therefore, are crucial components for human locomotion [1 - 3]. Further, the non-rigidity of tendons allows the <b>storage</b> and return <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> energy during locomotion [4, 5] and facilitates the muscle force potential {{due to the}} force-length-velocity relationship [6 - 8]. Hence, tendon properties not only affect human daily locomotion like walking/running [9] and stability performance [10], but also significantly determine athletic performances, e.g., sprinting [11, 12] and jumping [8, 13, 14] {{as well as the}} economy of running [15 - 17]. Furthermore, tendons are sensitive to their mechanical environment [18 - 22]. Following a period of enhanced mechanical loading, tendon stiffness may increase [23 - 26] to maintain physiological ranges <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> during locomotion, since the ultimate tendon strain is more or less constant [27]. Two mechanisms could account for an increase of tendon stiffness: a) changes of the tendon material (i.e., increase of Young’s modulus) and b) changes of the tendon morphological properties (i.e., increase of cross-sectional area) [24, 28 - 31]. Both tendon material and morphological changes result not only from an increase of collagen synthesis but also from changes of collagen fibril morphology and levels of collagen molecular cross-linking [19, 32, 33]. Besides physiological adaptive responses, excessive mechanical loading (i.e., overloading) was considered as an important factor in the etiology of tendinopathy [20, 34, 35], which is associated with pain, focal tendon tenderness, and decreased strength and movement [32].|$|R
