40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to build an efficient algorithm (a) to estimate seismic velocity from time-migration velocity, and (b) to convert time-migrated images to depth. We establish theoretical relations between the time-migration velocity and the seismic velocity in 2 -D and 3 -D using paraxial ray tracing theory. The relation in 2 -D implies that the conventional Dix velocity is {{the ratio of the}} interval seismic velocity and the geometrical <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> the image <b>rays.</b> We formulate an inverse problem of finding seismic velocity from the Dix velocity and develop a numerical procedure for solving it. This procedure consists of two steps: (1) computation <b>of</b> the geometrical <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> the image <b>rays</b> and the true seismic velocity in the time-domain coordinates from the Dix velocity; (2) conversion of the true seismic velocity from the time domain to the depth domain and computation of the transition matrices from time-domain coordinates to depth. For step 1, we derive a partial differential equation (PDE) in 2 -D and 3 -D relating the Dix velocity and the geometrical <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> the image <b>rays</b> to be found. This is a nonlinear elliptic PDE. The physical setting allows us to pose a Cauchy problem for it. This problem is ill-posed. However we are able to solve it numerically in two ways on the required interval of time. One way is a finite difference scheme inspired by the Lax-Friedrichs method. The second way is a spectral Chebyshev method. For step 2, we develop an efficient Dijkstra-like solver motivated by Sethian’s Fast Marching Method. We test our numerical procedures on a synthetic data example and apply them to a field data example. We demonstrate that our algorithms give significantly more accurate estimate of the seismic velocity than the conventional Dix inversion. Our velocity estimate {{can be used as a}} reasonable first guess in building velocity models for depth imaging...|$|R

Furthermore, in contrast to Pc 3 - 4 waves, these fluctuations show no ground magnetic signatures and display a pronounced gap in power/occurence around local noon.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to further explore results obtained by Gall, Williams, and Clark (1988) {{in a series of}} numerical frontogenesis experiments. In the course of those simulations, gravity waves were produced which grew in intensity as the fronts (one at each of the two horizontal planes bounding the model domain) increased in strength. Waves formed ahead (upwind) of and directly above the surface front, but not behind it, which suggests a connection with the banded cloud patterns often seen ahead of cold fronts (Fig. 1). In addition, structures resembling standing waves were observed in the "wedge" between the frontal surface and the ground. The question of the asymmetrical distribution of waves relative to the surface front was investigated using the method of ray-tracing. The frontal fields which served as the mean state were obtained from the anelastic model developed by T. L. Clark at NCAR. Hypothetical sources of various frequencies were place in the vicinity of both frontal zones and the energy followed through the fluid. It was found that the energy density of those waves moving {{toward the center of the}} model domain (which includes waves moving behind the surface front) decreased with time. This decrease was due mainly to geometrical <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rays</b> and the loss of energy to the mean flow via the action of Reynolds stresses. By contrast, waves moving away from the center of the domain (including waves propagating ahead of the surface front) gained energy from the mean flow and appeared to experience a much smaller ray divergence. The single most important factor in producing this asymmetry was found to be vertical shear of the frontogenesis-induced cross-front circulation. The first attempts to analyze the waves underneath the surface front using linear theory produced a surprising result: If waves impinge upon a horizontal surface at a certain angle a reflected wave of infinite amplitude is produced. It is suggested that this may be a mechanism responsible for the buildup of energy beneath the front (rather than multiple reflections between the front and the ground) ...|$|R
