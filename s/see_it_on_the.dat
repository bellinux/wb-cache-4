Throughout the song, Jackson sings in a quick-voice, which some music critics viewed as Jackson [...] "not singing" [...] but [...] "harrumphing". [...] It is a plea to the public to not believe everything in the tabloids; and the lyrics are about media bias and sensational journalism about Jackson and in general. This can be heard in lyrics such as, [...] "Just because you read it in the magazine or <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TV screen don't make it factual".|$|E
500|$|Killen avouched {{that writing}} the episode's script {{was one of}} the more {{difficult}} processes of creating the series. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result, they created outlines and distinguished them in green and red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. [...] "So the things that are initially confusing to us when we are just trying to break story, I think by the time they reach an audience, so much {{attention has been paid to}} how to make it clear where you are that all of the little tricks that we needed sort of go away. And hopefully when you <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, you are pretty instantly oriented as to which world you are in." ...|$|E

His teams {{are known for}} their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. The secret to basketball – and life – is [...] "just to do the job {{to the best of your}} ability and don't worry about anything else," [...] Stevens says. [...] "Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won", he says. In short, Stevens is a strong believer in [...] "The Butler Way" [...] – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team. [...] "I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define," [...] Stevens says, [...] "but you can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “The {{color of}} food {{packaging}} {{is considered to}} be extremely important in the marketing world” (Blackbird, Fox & Tornetta, 2013) as people see color before they absorb anything else. Consumers buy items based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> color they’ve <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advertisement and they have a perception of what the packaging colors should also look like. However, when it comes to buying food, usually consumers can only judge <b>the</b> product based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> packaging and usually consumers judge products based on color.|$|R

500|$|David Browne, of Entertainment Weekly, {{noted that}} [...] "Tabloid Junkie," [...] comes as [...] "close to {{transcendence}} as {{anywhere on the}} album" [...] and described the chorus, [...] "Just because you {{read it in the}} magazine or <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TV screen don't make it factual" [...] as Jackson's [...] "grabbiest, most driven refrain in years." [...] Although Browne praised the song, he commented, [...] "The rest of the song, however, is mucked up with fake tabloid-TV snippets about his 'life,' and on the verses Jackson's delivery is so terse (he's not singing, he's harrumphing) that his lyrics are all but obliterated. Handed a golden opportunity, he throws it all away — but then, it wouldn't be the first time." [...] Deepika Reedy, of The Daily Collegian, described the [...] "rust in songs" [...] like [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] as having a [...] "raw aspect" [...] that Jackson [...] "hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean'." [...] Patrick Macdonald, of The Seattle Times, noted that [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] was a [...] "disingenuous attack on sensational news stories" [...] about Jackson, remarked that most of stories were [...] "planted" [...] by Jackson himself.|$|E

2500|$|The Coronation {{ceremony}} of Elizabeth II followed {{a similar pattern}} to the coronations of the kings and queens before her, being held in Westminster Abbey, and involving the peerage and clergy. However, for the new Queen, several parts of the ceremony were markedly different. The coronation of the Queen was the first ever to be televised (although the BBC Television Service had covered part of the procession from Westminster Abbey after her father's coronation in 1937), and was also the world's first major international event to be broadcast on television. There had been considerable debate within the British Cabinet on the subject, with Prime Minister Winston Churchill against the idea; but, Elizabeth refused her British prime minister's advice on this matter and insisted the event take place before television cameras, {{as well as those}} filming with experimental 3D technology. The event was also filmed in colour, separately from the BBC's black and white television broadcast. [...] Millions across Britain watched the coronation live, while, to make sure Canadians could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same day, RAF Canberras flew film of the ceremony across the Atlantic Ocean to be broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the first non-stop flights between the United Kingdom and the Canadian mainland. At Goose Bay, Labrador, the film was transferred to a Royal Canadian Air Force CF-100 jet fighter for the further trip to Montreal. In all, three such voyages were made as the coronation proceeded.|$|E

He is depicted as having [...] "a look on his face that Tamar recognized. had <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> faces of poor crazy homeless people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets, the ones who are desperate to tell you their tragic life stories. Dad had the same twist to his mouth, the same determination to get things said." ...|$|R
50|$|A Wife for a Month was revived {{during the}} Restoration era, with Thomas Betterton in the cast; {{but it does}} not seem ever to have been popular. Samuel Pepys {{mentions}} it in his famous Diary, in his entry for 19 December 1662...but he notes having read the play, not having <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage. <b>It</b> was reprinted in a single-play edition in 1717.

5000|$|BtRL {{planned to}} feature an {{original}} soundtrack with pieces inspired by Bear McCreary and Richard Gibbs' soundtrack. It also intended to include character-based gameplay and voice acting. The three-mission demo campaign follows a storyline that precedes the episode, [...] "Scar", adding some background {{to the events}} of that episode. Online multiplayer, including [...] "Deathmatch" [...] and [...] "Team vs. Team", is supported. The Mk II and VII Vipers are featured with authentic weaponry, flight controls, and semi-Newtonian physics (the development team stated that, [...] "if you've <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show, you can do it in BtRL").|$|R
5000|$|The {{etymology}} of foo is obscure. Its use {{in connection}} with bar is generally traced to the World War II military slang FUBAR, later bowdlerised to foobar. <b>The</b> word foo <b>on</b> its own was used earlier. Between about 1930 and 1952 it appeared in the comic Smokey Stover by Bill Holman, who stated that {{he used the word}} due to having <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of a jade Chinese figurine in Chinatown, San Francisco, purportedly signifying [...] "good luck". This {{may be related to the}} Chinese word fu ("福", sometimes transliterated foo), which can mean happiness.|$|R

John Terry, the Chelsea player with the clearest view of the [...] "goal" [...] from his vantage point <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, admitted uncertainty: [...] "I thought it hit me, if I'm honest.

Kurt did not get sick but agreed that he had blurred vision when very anxious. He also gave other indications of cognitive perceptual disturbance (“Even if I know a piece or a part really well, it’s almost like my brain <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> paper and doesn’t recognize it.

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} is not new.

25|$|Titus Andronicus is by {{no means}} the most brutal of Shakespeare's plays. More people die in Richard III. King Lear is a much more cruel play. In the whole Shakespearean {{repertory}} I can find no scene so revolting as Cordelia's death. In reading, the cruelties of Titus can seem ridiculous. But I have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching Titus Andronicus we come to understand – perhaps more than by looking at any other Shakespeare play – the nature of his genius: he gave an inner awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on earth.|$|R
