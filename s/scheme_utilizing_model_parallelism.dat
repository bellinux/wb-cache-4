40|$|Abstract. We formalise {{the notion}} of {{adaptive}} proofs of knowledge in the random oracle model, where the extractor has to recover wit-nesses for multiple, possibly adaptively chosen statements and proofs. We also discuss extensions to simulation soundness, as typically required for the “encrypt-then-prove ” construction of strongly secure encryption from IND-CPA <b>schemes.</b> <b>Utilizing</b> our <b>model</b> we show three results: (1) Simulation-sound adaptive proofs exist. (2) The “encrypt-then-prove ” construction with a simulation-sound adap-tive proof yields CCA security. This {{appears to be a}} “folklore ” result but which has never been proven in the random oracle model. As a corollary, we obtain a new class of CCA-secure encryption schemes. (3) We show that the Fiat-Shamir transformed Schnorr protocol is not adaptively secure and discuss the implications of this limitation. Our result not only separates adaptive proofs from proofs of knowledge, but also gives a strong hint why Signed ElGamal as the most prominent encrypt-then-prove example has not been proven CCA-secure without making further assumptions. ...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{saturation}} in induction motors {{is a very}} common, {{complex and}} undesirable phenomenon. It reduces the accuracy of drive control {{with respect to the}} fundamental current/voltage components, and gives rise to additional harmonics which degrades the total harmonic performance of the drive. The existing mitigation strategies include accurate modeling of the saturated motor and harmonic filtering. A different approach is presented in this paper. An advanced control scheme is designed which specifically targets and eliminates the tracking error at fundamental frequency and harmonic components produced by magnetic saturation.

40|$|G-Guidance is {{a robust}} G&C (guidance and control) {{algorithm}} developed under the small-body GN&C task. The G-Guidance <b>scheme</b> <b>utilizes</b> a <b>model</b> predictive control approach, {{along with a}} convexification of the governing dynamics, control constraints, and trajectory/state constraints. This report details an enhancement to the FY 2005 G-Guidance algorithm; {{the addition of a}} fire-second approach helps to nullify velocity errors and hit desired final velocities much more precisely than the original Fire-first scheme developed in FY 2005. The enhancement preserves the primary benefit of the algorithm, which is to ensure required thruster silent times during trajectory maneuvers. The fire-second scheme increases the versatility of the algorithm for missions employing G-Guidance. For instance, a landing sequence could employ the fire-second scheme to ensure a null final velocity at landing, whereas an ascent sequence could <b>utilize</b> a fire-first <b>scheme</b> to ensure there is no drift of the spacecraft toward the ground {{at the beginning of the}} maneuver. Examples are provided within to demonstrate a fire-first versus fire-second guidance scheme. As in the existing G-Guidance algorithm, the examples and schemes incorporate gravity models and thruster firing times into discrete dynamics that are solved as a optimal control problem to minimize fuel consumption or thruster energy expenditure...|$|R

Finally, the results are used to derive the average transmission delay for data types defined in MarPVS. Numerical results are provided along with simulation results which confirm the accuracy of the proposed analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MarPVS results in lower transmission latency and higher packet success rate in comparison with the default IEEE 802. 11 p scheme and greedy scheduler scheme...|$|R
