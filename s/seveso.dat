5|$|TCDD is {{the most}} potent {{compound}} (congener) of its series (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, known as PCDDs or simply dioxins) and became known as a contaminant in Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Vietnam War. TCDD was released into the environment in the <b>Seveso</b> disaster. It is a persistent environmental contaminant usually present in a complex mixture of dioxin-like compounds, and is a carcinogen.|$|E
5|$|Developmental effects {{occur at}} very low doses in animals. They include frank {{teratogenicity}} such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis. Development of some organs {{may be even more}} sensitive: very low doses perturb the development of sexual organs in rodents, and the development of teeth in rats. The latter is important in that tooth deformities were also seen after the <b>Seveso</b> accident and possibly after a long breast-feeding of babies in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of <b>Seveso,</b> Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but the evidence is not very strong.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, {{large amounts}} of dioxins were {{released}} in an industrial accident at <b>Seveso,</b> Italy, although no immediate human fatalities or birth defects occurred.|$|E
25|$|On August 26, 1591, the {{archbishop}} ordained four newly arrived sisters as nuns: Sister Virginia Maria, Sister Benedetta Felice, Sister Teodora da <b>Seveso</b> and Sister Ottavia Caterina Ricci. On September 26, 1591 Marianna became Sister Virginia Maria.|$|E
25|$|Many {{watercourses}} {{and coastal}} stretches {{have also been}} contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while because of rising water levels, Venice has been regularly flooded throughout recent years. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas, {{as in the case}} of the <b>Seveso</b> disaster. The country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but, after the Chernobyl disaster and a referendum on the issue the nuclear programme was terminated, a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008, planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with French technology. This was in turn struck down by a referendum following the Fukushima nuclear accident.|$|E
25|$|Low {{concentrations}} of dioxins existed in nature prior to industrialization {{as a result}} of natural combustion and geological processes. Dioxins were first unintentionally produced as by-products from 1848 onwards as Leblanc process plants started operating in Germany. The first intentional synthesis of chlorinated dibenzodioxin was in 1872. Today, {{concentrations of}} dioxins are found in all humans, with higher levels commonly found in persons living in more industrialized countries. The most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), became well known as a contaminant of Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. Later, dioxins were found in Times Beach, Missouri and Love Canal, New York and <b>Seveso,</b> Italy. More recently, dioxins have been in the news with the poisoning of President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine in 2004, the Naples Mozzarella Crisis the 2008 Irish pork crisis, and the German feed incident of 2010.|$|E
25|$|Dioxins (most {{notably the}} polychlorinated dibenzodioxins) are {{chemicals}} that are produced when chlorinated products are burned, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This occurs when chlorinated products {{are used in}} certain manufacturing industries. Dioxins are also added to the air when gasoline and diesel fuels break down. Dioxins are able to bioaccumulate, meaning that they settle and stay in human and animal fat {{for long periods of}} time. There are many different types of dioxins and only a few of them have been labeled by the Environmental Protection Agency as definite human carcinogens and endocrine hormone disruptors. Although dioxins are floating in the air, they eventually settle on plants and other vegetation surfaces. These plants and vegetation are them eaten by cows and other animals. Humans end up eating the produce, milk, eggs, and meat produced by these animals that have consumed dioxin covered vegetation. Dioxins are more harmful when ingested this way. Multiple studies have led to the idea that increased dioxin levels can increase one's risk for breast cancer. A study done in 1976 after a chemical plant explosion in <b>Seveso,</b> Italy concluded that high dioxin level exposure in a woman's body correlated with a more than double chance of developing breast cancer.|$|E

50|$|The {{approach}} {{advocated by}} the ACMH was largely followed in subsequent UK legislation and regulatory action, but following the release of chlordioxins by a runaway chemical reaction at <b>Seveso</b> in northern Italy in July 1976, 'major hazard plants' became an EU-wide issue and the UK approach became subsumed in EU-wide initiatives (the <b>Seveso</b> Directive in 1982, superseded by the <b>Seveso</b> II Directive in 1996).
