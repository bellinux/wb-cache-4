500|$|The {{original}} {{building had}} a harmonious and unadorned prospect, known through Rome's plan by Antonio Tempesta published in 1593, published when the palace was just finished, with seventeen windows and three floors. The facade along Via Alessandrina resembles those of coeval buildings, like Palazzo Ruspoli, built in Via del Corso by Bartolomeo Ammannati. Resulting {{from the union}} of several small houses, the edifice was very long, especially after the addition of another wing at the west end, along Via del Mascherino, sixty years {{after the death of}} Rusticucci in 1603. After this addition, the palace was unanimously described by the coeval city's guides as [...] "lacking grace". Its main front had a monotonous and modest appearance: it was [...] long, with three floors and a mezzanine, twenty-two windows and a rusticated portal. Its area covered [...] To the right of the entrance lay a rectangular yard with three orders, doric, ionic and corinthian. On the opposite <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> a smaller square yard, surrounded by a portico with serliana.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{its small}} dimensions, the {{building}} cannot {{be identified as}} a church, but rather as an oratory belonging to a monastery. The edifice has a rectangular shape, and nowadays has a single nave with three projecting apses {{to the east and}} a narthex to the west. The interior decoration has, for the most part, not survived. Only two hammered carved capitals, part of the triple arcade between the narthex and the naos, are still in place. The roof and the windows have also been modified. [...] Excavations during the 1960s have shown that the building's original plan was more complex. [...] The small church had three naves (possibly surmounted by a dome) and a tripartite bema. [...] On the west <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> an exonarthex topped by a vault, while in the south side a small chapel with esonarthexes on three sides was built. Based on its masonry and plan, the building can be dated to the late eleventh century, although according to other scholars [...] the brickwork texture could also stem from the Palaiologan age (13th–15th century).|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the royal Norwegian {{monopoly}} on shipping contributed to the end of trade and contact. However, Christianity and European customs continued to hold sway among the Greenlanders for the greater part of the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1921, a Danish historian, Paul Norland, found human remains from the Eastern Settlement in the Herjolfsnes church courtyard. The bodies were dressed in 15th century medieval clothing with no indications of malnutrition or inbreeding. Most had crucifixes around their necks with their arms crossed as in a stance of prayer. Roman papal records report that the Greenlanders were excused from paying their tithes in 1345 because the colony was suffering from poverty. The last reported ship to reach Greenland was a private ship that was [...] "blown off course", reaching Greenland in 1406, and departing in 1410 with the last news of Greenland: the burning at the stake of a condemned witch, the insanity and death of the woman this witch was accused of attempting to seduce through witchcraft, and the marriage of the ship's captain, Thorsteinn Ólafsson, to another Icelander, Sigridur Björnsdóttir. However, there are some suggestions of much later unreported voyages from Europe to Greenland, possibly as late as the 1480s. In the mid-1500s, a German ship drifted off-course to Greenland and, coming ashore a small island, discovered the body of a dead man lying face down who demonstrated cultural traits of both Norse and Inuit. An Icelandic crew member of the ship wrote: [...] "He had a hood on his head, well sewn, and clothes from both homespun and sealskin. At his <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> a carving knife bent and worn down by whetting. This knife they took with them for display." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{symbols of}} the club are the green and white colours in a broken shield. In the white <b>side</b> <b>lays</b> a black laurel with golden fruits, with two flowers of a first quarter and the Sun, everything in golden.

60|$|The lads {{peered through}} the hedge. Far across the field, on the bank, the other <b>side,</b> <b>lay</b> {{what looked like a}} bundle of clothes.|$|E
60|$|Pippin had finished. His {{forehead}} {{rested on}} the table, his arms hung at his sides; he was stone-dead! His face wore a smile, and by his <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> an empty laudanum bottle.|$|E
60|$|Our coach rattled {{out of the}} city, and at a short {{distance}} from its outskirts passed over a bridge of elegant construction, but somewhat too slight, as I imagined, to sustain any considerable weight. On both <b>sides</b> <b>lay</b> an extensive quagmire, which {{could not have been more}} disagreeable either to sight or smell, had all the kennels of the earth emptied their pollution there.|$|R
50|$|To make an English rabbit, {{toast the}} bread brown on both <b>sides,</b> <b>lay</b> it in a plate before the fire, pour {{a glass of}} red wine over it, and let it soak the wine up. Then cut some cheese very thin and lay it very thick over the bread, put it in a tin oven before the fire, and it will be toasted and browned presently. Serve it away hot.|$|R

60|$|The courtier was bending down, {{and by the}} {{creaking}} sound that reached him Ercole guessed his occupation to be the winding of the arbalest string. On the table at his <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> a quarrel swathed in a sheet of paper.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>sides</b> <b>lay</b> {{claim to}} the {{tradition}} of the earliest club named Union Solingen, founded in 1897 out of the merger of a number of clubs from the district of Ohligs in Solingen. Over time these would include Ohligs FC 06, VfR Ohligs, Walder Ballspielverein, and BV Adler Ohligs. Of these clubs, only VfR Ohligs would distinguish itself with any time spent in first division football when they played the 1940-41 season in the Gauliga Niederrhein before being relegated after a last place result.|$|R

60|$|By degrees {{the smoke}} melted away, {{and there on}} the ground were the ten or twelve crooked pieces of ebony that they had seen consumed, now to all {{appearance}} quite untouched by the flame.

6000|$|At last {{we opened}} Malta, an island, or rather a city, {{like no other}} in the world. The seaport, {{formerly}} the famous Valetta, {{comes down to the}} sea-shore. On the one <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> the [Knights], on the other <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> the Turks, who finally got entire possession of it, while the other branch remained {{in the power of the}} Christians. Mutual cruelties were exercised; the Turks, seizing on the survivors of the knights who had so long defended St. Elmo, cut the Maltese cross on the bodies of the slain, and, tying them to planks, let them drift with the receding tide into the other branch of the harbour still defended by the Christians. The Grand-Master, in resentment of this cruelty, caused his Turkish prisoners to be decapitated and their heads thrown from mortars into the camp of the infidels.[490] ...|$|E

5|$|When Angel {{was first}} opened, a long {{dead-end}} siding was provided for train stabling, converging {{from the left}} onto the northbound line {{just south of the}} station. This was retained over the years but eventually it was closed on 23 January 1959 (along with the signal box {{at the south end of}} the platform) to simplify through running. The <b>siding</b> <b>lay</b> derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme. Part of the siding was used as the northbound diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing northbound line, cut through into the end of the siding and continued along it until it branched off left to the new northbound platform.|$|R

6000|$|The [...] "Caroline" [...] {{received}} the blast like a stout and buoyant ship, yielding readily to its impulse, until her <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> nearly incumbent on the element {{in which she}} floated; and then, as if the fearful fabric were conscious of its jeopardy, it seemed to lift its reclining masts again, struggling to work its way heavily through the water.|$|E
60|$|He {{led the way}} to one of the neatest of {{the plank}} cottages, which stood on the highest ridge of the island, so that from the front windows it {{commanded}} a view of the great blue ocean with its breakers that fringed the reef as with a ring of snow, while, on the opposite <b>side,</b> <b>lay</b> the peaceful waters and islets of the lagoon.|$|E
60|$|The Wieroos salaamed and withdrew, {{closing the}} door behind them. He Who Speaks for Luata grasped a sword nervously in his right hand. At his left <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> the second weapon. It was evident that he lived in {{constant}} dread of being assassinated. The fact that he permitted none with weapons within his presence and that he always kept two swords at his side pointed to this.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1876 {{the church}} {{was the site of}} a planned Republican meeting, {{attended}} mostly by freedmen, which was interrupted by a large party of more than 150 white men, Democrats from Charleston who arrived by steamboat and demanded equal time. As this followed the massacre by whites of seven freedmen at Hamburg in Aiken County from July 4 to July 8, tensions were high. While efforts were made to have both <b>sides</b> <b>lay</b> down their arms, the tensions broke out into shooting, which resulted in the deaths of one African-American man and three to six whites. It [...] "represented a rare instance during Reconstruction where the African American combatants got the better of their opponents." ...|$|R
60|$|On each <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> shallow {{sheets of}} {{stagnant}} water overlying a treacherous bottom of semi-fluid mud, which {{rose above the}} surface {{here and there in}} moist, sweltering banks, mottled over with occasional patches of unhealthy vegetation. Great purple and yellow fungi had broken out in a dense eruption, as though Nature were afflicted with a foul disease, which manifested itself by this crop of plague spots.|$|E

6000|$|On {{the stone}} slab {{floor of the}} low living-room Tant Mettie lay dead.
