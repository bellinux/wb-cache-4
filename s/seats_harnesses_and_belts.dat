In this study, WBV were measured on a medium-sized compact wheel loader (CWL) in its typical operations. The effect of short-term exposure to the WBV on the ride comfort was evaluated according to ISO 2631 - 1 : 1985 and ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997. ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 and ISO 2631 - 5 : 2004 were adopted to evaluate the effect of long-term exposure to the WBV on the human health. Reasons for the different evaluation results obtained according to ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 and ISO 2631 - 5 : 2004 were explained in this study.

The seat effective amplitude transmissibility (SEAT) and the seat transmissibility in the frequency domain in these three cases were analyzed to investigate the effect of a safety belt on the seat transmissibility. Seat tests were performed on a multi-axis shaking table in laboratory to study the dynamic behavior of a suspension seat under the vibration excitations measured on the CWL. The WBV intensity was reduced by optimizing the vertical and the longitudinal seat suspension systems with the help of computational simulations.

2500|$|A {{crash test}} dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic test device that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. Using human and animal cadaver research from earlier studies, the first artificial {{crash test dummy}} was an anthropomorphic dummy named [...] "Sierra Sam". It was invented in 1949 by Samuel W. Alderson at his Alderson Research Labs (ARL) And Sierra Engineering Co. for the United States Air Force while conducting tests on aircraft ejection <b>seats,</b> pilot restraint <b>harnesses,</b> <b>and</b> aviation helmets. Alderson's early dummies and those of his competitors were fairly primitive, with no pelvic structure and little spinal articulation. With American automakers interested in durable crash test dummies that could be tested and retested while yielding back {{a broad spectrum of}} data during simulated automobile crashes, the first crash test dummy used for automative testing was again invented by Samuel Alderson in 1968.

40|$|Copyright © 2003 SAE International Computational {{modeling}} {{continues to}} play an increasingly {{significant role in the}} design of more effective vehicle crash safety systems. Models configured with sophisticated computer analyses permit researchers to perform extensive “what-if? ” exploratory studies {{at a fraction of the}} cost and time that would be required by physical testing alone. Presently, our research team is developing a modeling and analysis capability that will provide child restraint system (CRS) engineers, designers, and analysts a validation tool that will supplement conventional engineering results attained from sled testing, which is often timely and costly. Supplementing these physical tests and digital modeling capabilities is the newly developed NYSCEDII CRS Visualization Module (NCVM), which allows a user to immersively visualize the MADYMO-calculated automotive crash simulation imagery. Depicted are the motion of, and interactions between, the CRS shell, human “dummy”, <b>harness</b> <b>and</b> latch <b>belt</b> assemblies, <b>and</b> applicable vehicle cabin-interior surfaces and structure; and nodal finite element Von Mises color stress contours for the CRS shell and its attendant restraint straps. Supplemental NCVM features include: plotted instantaneous body segment acceleration-time responses; dummy displacements visually tracked using on-screen reference markers- to be tracked as a function of time; forwards or backwards animation capability; and stereo viewing, using anaglyphic stereo, to convey a sense of depth and immersion. This paper demonstrates the utility of the NCVM using a combination conventional/finite element system model of a recent-production child restraint system (CRS) and its three-year-old dummy occupant in a modified FMVSS 213 sled test environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the European project 'HeliSafe TA' was to improve the survivability of occupants in helicopter crashes and to minimise the risk of injuries. This was achieved by an advanced safety system concept based on interacting safety features such as enhanced safety <b>seats,</b> improved <b>harness</b> systems <b>and</b> deployment of airbags. A key feature of ‘HeliSafe TA’ was the application of numerical simulation tools to predict cabin and occupant response to crash loads in order to optimise {{the layout of the}} safety system. For the verification of the simulation models and in order to generate a broad load data base, three fully instrumented drop tests were carried out in Europe’s most extensive helicopter crash test programme to date. Furthermore, numerous sled tests with two generic helicopter mock-ups were conducted. The paper gives a brief overview on HeliSafe TA with emphasis on DLR’s contribution to the project. DLR was responsible for the crash simulation of the full-scale helicopter drop tests and the definition of acceleration pulses in the sled test programme. Detailed simulation models of the cockpit mock-up were developed which included the pilot dummy and safety features such as the energy absorbing seat <b>and</b> the <b>belts.</b> With the verified models, DLR carried out different parametric studies in order to optimise the properties of the energy absorbers used in the cockpit seats and to propose a concept which leads to the lowest possible injury rates for occupants of different weights and sizes. Optimised adaptive and non-adaptive attenuator systems were then proposed. ...|$|R
