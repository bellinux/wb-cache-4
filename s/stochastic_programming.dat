40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a unit {{commitment}} prob-lem with uncertain wind power output. The problem is for-mulated as a chance-constrained two-stage (CCTS) <b>stochastic</b> <b>program.</b> Our model ensures that, with high probability, {{a large portion of}} the wind power output at each operating hour will be utilized. The proposed model includes both the two-stage <b>stochastic</b> <b>program</b> and the chance-constrained <b>stochastic</b> <b>program</b> features. These types of problems are challenging and have never been studied together before, even though the algorithms for the two-stage <b>stochastic</b> <b>program</b> and the chance-constrained <b>stochastic</b> <b>program</b> have been recently developed sep-arately. In this paper, a combined sample average approximation (SAA) algorithm is developed to solve the model effectively. The convergence property and the solution validation process of our proposed combined SAA algorithm is discussed and presented in the paper. Finally, computational results indicate that increasing the utilization of wind power output might increase the total power generation cost, and our experiments also verify that the proposed algorithm can solve large-scale power grid optimization problems...|$|R

25|$|In {{the field}} of {{mathematical}} optimization, <b>stochastic</b> <b>programming</b> is a framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty. Whereas deterministic optimization problems are formulated with known parameters, real world problems almost invariably include some unknown parameters. When the parameters are known only within certain bounds, one approach to tackling such problems is called robust optimization. Here {{the goal is to}} find a solution which is feasible for all such data and optimal in some sense. <b>Stochastic</b> <b>programming</b> models are similar in style but take advantage of the fact that probability distributions governing the data are known or can be estimated. The goal here is to find some policy that is feasible for all (or almost all) the possible data instances and maximizes the expectation of some function of the decisions and the random variables. More generally, such models are formulated, solved analytically or numerically, and analyzed in order to provide useful information to a decision-maker.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} methods for solving <b>stochastic</b> <b>programs</b> is {{approximation}} by discretizing the probability distribution.

SGE has many applications such as characterizing optimality conditions of a nonsmooth stochastic optimization problem and a stochastic equilibrium problem. We derive quantitative continuity of expected value of the set-valued mapping with respect to the variation of the underlying probability measure in a metric space. This leads to the subsequent qualitative and quantitative stability analysis of solution set mappings of the SGE. Under some metric regularity conditions, we derive Aubin’s property of the solution set mapping with respect to the change of probability measure.
