30|$|Early {{reports of}} {{decompression}} and stabilization {{in patients with}} neurological deficit and thoracolumbar fracture demonstrated improvement that was {{equal to that of}} nonoperative results in the literature [28 – 34]. With the advent of newer instrumentation techniques and aggressive direct anterior decompression, the degree of neurological recovery appears more favorable than earlier reports [35 – 41]. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are two techniques that show good potential in terms of decreasing pain and improving function in osteoporotic low-energy compression and burst fractures. Early reports demonstrate these techniques to be highly effective with good pain relief and relatively few complications [42 – 46]. Primary goals in thoracolumbar trauma patients are preservation of remaining spinal cord function, restoration of spinal alignment, achievement of pain-free fracture site, maximum neurological recovery, and early rehabilitation. This can be achieved by optimizing neural decompression while providing stable internal fixation over the least number of spinal segments [47]. The pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>rod</b> systems, by virtue of direct fixation through middle and anterior columns, are able to reduce fractures of these columns by ligamentotaxis [48 – 52]. Transpedicular <b>screw</b> <b>rod</b> construct is currently the standard in segmental fixation of thoracolumbar spine [53 – 55]. Posterior surgery with pedicle screw constructs over a short segment stabilizes the fracture and allows early mobilization, much as nonoperative regimes do. Recent prospective randomized studies comparing these two treatment options suggest there is no clinical advantage of surgery over nonoperative care [56, 57].|$|E

40|$|Scoliosis is {{a spinal}} {{deformity}} characterised by lateral curvatures of the spine. It typically occurs during adolescence, but in rare incidences {{can occur in}} young children. In adolescents, if severe or progressive, surgical treatment {{in the form of}} spinal fusion using <b>screw</b> and <b>rod</b> constructs may take place. However, in younger patients the spine and lungs are still growing, therefore, fusion is not recommended before the age of eight years. For early onset scoliosis fusionless techniques are used, with the current gold standard being traditional growing <b>rods,</b> incorporating pedicle <b>screws</b> and <b>rods,</b> which are periodically lengthened through frequent surgical interventions. Due to the number surgeries throughout the treatment period, this treatment suffers from high complication rates. As this treatment is far from ideal, alternative treatments are being explored to reduce these issues. This thesis describes the initial development of an alternative implant for the treatment of early onset scoliosis to alleviate the issues of traditional growing rods. The implant was based on a pedicle <b>screw</b> and <b>rod</b> system, but incorporated a bearing component to allow free extension of the construct without the need for further surgery. The development of the implant design was achieved through finite element analysis of individual components and of constructs using contact conditions. It was initially intended to use a UHMWPE bearing component incorporating a crosslink and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sliding rod, with a commercially available pedicle screw.

Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) have been popularized rapidly {{by virtue of their}} unique advantage in minimal invasiveness. We analysed our results in osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures using percutaneous kyphoplasty and posterior <b>screw</b> <b>rod</b> system. To investigate the possibility of treatment of rupture of the posterior vertebral osteoporotic fractures by means of kyphoplasty combined with the posterior screw-rod system. Materials and Methods: Twenty six patients (65 years of age or older) with the single spine fractures included in study. The preoperative bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy X-ray. The PKP was done in all the cases. Decompression was done if neurological symptoms were present. Results: The results demonstrated osteoporosis with BMD T value ≤ − 2. 5; injured posterior vertebral body (3 cases) had shown the whole damage accompanied by neurological symptoms through X-ray or CT. After 2 days, the remaining patients of back pain symptoms were relieved or disappeared except for three cases of patients with decompression incision.

The comparison in between anterior interbody application, anterior, posterior and anterior posterior instrumentation combinations is also stated. The statical applications of interbody device in conditions with anterior interbody applications, anterior, posterior and anterior+posterior instrumentation combinations are done through the gain of stiffness and displacement. In this biomechanical study, instrument stiffness and displacement values are measured and evaluated under axial loading. Materials and Method: In 7 calf spine, interbody device applications, thoracolumbar anterior and posterior instrumentations were held. The measurements were done in the following order: interbody device, interbody device + thoracolumbar anterior instrumentation, interbody device + thoracolumbar posterior instrumentation, interbody device + thoracolumbar anterior instrumentation + thoracolumbar posterior instrumentation. Stiffness and deformations were measured under 500 Newton in each specimen. The loading device was SHIMADZU Autograph AG- 50 kNG. The statistical analysis was done with Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: The mean axial stiffness values obtained in 7 experiments in calf spine model were as follows: İCD: 9958 N/mm, İCD + A: 21062 N/mm, İCD + P: 11877 N/mm, İCD + A + P: 22301 N/mm. Interbody device application demonstrated higher stiffness values when compared to anterolateral plate and screw-rod applications. There was no significant difference between circumferential stabilisation, interbody device application and anterolateral screw-rod instrumentation.

40|$|AbstractWith {{the aging}} of human society and the rapid {{development}} of transportation industry, the disease rates of bone and joint are also in constant increase, making the biological healing and regeneration of articular cartilage as a core issue of joint surgery in basic and clinical. In general, the regeneration capacity of articular cartilage injury difficult to selfrepair {{is considered to be}} limited. At present, many new technologies and methods have been used for clinical treatment, but it only can relieve the pain of the patients. Human knee joint has two main movement patterns: rolling and sliding. Rolling, as a typical representative of the articular cartilage, is very similar to the mechanical environment in vivo. Accordingly, we first proposed and developed this rolling depression loading device with perfusion system for the mechanobiology researching on in vitro articular cartilage, which includes rolling control system, compression adjusting system and circulating perfusion system. The innovation of the biological reactor is the combination of the rolling loading system and circulation of grouting system. The roll controlling system is achieved by roller rolling back and forth through stepper motor driving <b>screw</b> <b>rod.</b> The compressive system could produce uniform, controlled compressions by relatively sliding of two wedge blocks. The circulating perfusion system is mainly finished by controlling the peristaltic pump. It can provide an environment which is closer to the normal physiological condition of articular cartilage. Rolling depression loading is useful to clarify the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and apply biomechanical factors to prevent and treat osteoarthritis and repair cartilage. This device is small enough to work in the general culture box, and we will test it with biological experiment in future...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increased}} incidence of road traffic accidents and industrial trauma, {{there has been}} {{a significant increase in the}} number of thoraco - lumbar spinal injuries. Decompression and early fusion with instrumentation is a generally accepted treatment meth od for patients with unstable injuries and with a neurological deficit; it helps in early mobilization, and avoids the complications of prolonged recumbency. The pedicle screw - rod system is versatile in that it stabilizes the three columns of the spine. Th e pedicle is the strongest part of the vertebra and is the force nucleus of the vertebral body. Through the pedicle all forces are transmitted from posterior elements to the vertebral body. Therefore, by fixation of the vertebral body through the pedicle, significant strength of the entire vertebral complex is possible. In our study we operated on 28 patients of unstable thoraco - lumbar injuries, where we performed Moss - Miami instrumentation (pedicular <b>screw</b> <b>rod</b> fixation). All the cases were followed up for a minimum of one year. In all these cases we had favorable results. There was a reduction of an average pre - op kyphotic angle of 15. 8 º to an average post - op kyphotic angle of 6. 6 º. W e also noted significant neurological improvement as assessed by Frankel g rading. In this study, we found that the t ranspedicular fixation with screws and rods system is effective in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar spinal injuries. Although the prognosis of the neurological injury seems to be largely determined at the ti me of trauma, surgical decompression will definitely improve the neurologic deficit in incomplete cord injuries.

The mechanical behavior of lower profile cervical implants used to create PSHR, hybrid cable plate constructs, and titanium miniplating has not previously been described. MethodsCalf lumbar spines (L 2 -L 6) were utilized for testing (n= 27). Intervertebral rotation was measured in the intact spines across the L 4 - 5 segment before and after creation of bilateral pars interarticularis defects. Defects were then stabilized with one of three repair techniques, PSHR, miniplate, or cable plate (CP) constructs. (n= 9). A 5 -Nm load was applied in flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. Fracture displacement was measured under flexion-extension and lateral bending modes. ResultsOsteotomy of the pars interarticularis increased intervertebral rotation from 4. 6 ° to 9. 2 ° (P<. 05). The three techniques of repair reduced intervertebral rotation without statistical superiority of one method. In lateral bending the miniplate was most effective in reducing pars defect displacement (0. 6 mm, P< 0. 05). Although, the miniplate provided lower defect displacement in flexion-extension and axial rotation, these differences were not statistically significant. ConclusionsBilateral miniplate fixation demonstrates superiority in restoring stability in lateral bending as compared to pedicle <b>screw</b> hook <b>rod</b> techniques and cable plate constructs. In flexion-extension and axial rotation, it was as effective as a PSHR method. Consideration of anatomic plate designs warrants consideration. Level of evidenceIV...|$|R
