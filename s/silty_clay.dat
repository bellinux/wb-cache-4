5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile <b>silty</b> <b>clay</b> soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E

These exceptional data sets showed, for the first time, that ruptures can propagate to the trench during subduction megathrust earthquakes. Previously, this domain had been considered to slip only aseismically 4. This observation immediately raises follow-on questions: Is there evidence that co-seismic slip to the trench has occurred in other subduction zones? What is the potential for other megathrusts to co-seismically rupture to the trench? Following ocean drilling results in the Japan Trench 5, investigation has focused on the smectite-rich, pelagic clays recovered from the shallow portions of the Tōhoku megathrust. Friction experiments showed that when the fault’s original fabric is preserved, the Tōhoku pelagic clays are cohesionless, reducing fracture energy and favouring earthquake rupture propagation 6. The very small fracture energy and shear stress of pelagic clays when sheared at seismic slip velocities (1 [*]m[*]s– 1) can allow propagation of earthquake rupture from depth 7, 8, explaining slip to the trench during the 2011 Tōhoku-Oki earthquake 8. On the ocean floor, deposition of pelagic sediments typically alternates between clays and biogenic oozes 9, 10, with the latter mostly subducting in the eastern central and south Pacific (Fig. 1). In contrast to pelagic clays, biogenic oozes have been proposed to inhibit both fault rupture propagation and displacement during earthquakes, and so prevent the occurrence of tsunamis 9. Laboratory friction experiments have suggested, however, that biogenic oozes may play a key role in earthquake nucleation at depth 11, 12, 13...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Holocene {{history of}} south-central Long-lsland and the {{adjacent}} inner continental shelf, as {{recorded in the}} stratigraphy of transgressive deposits, was studied, using information obtained from more than 400 boreholes, cores, and marsh probings in the barrier- and backbarrier-areas nd vibracores and numerous eismic-reflection a d bathymetfic profiles on the inner shelf. A sequence of deposits which records the Flandrian transgression is preserved in the backbarrier areas of south-central Long Island. The vertical sequence of these trangressive deposits was produced by the movement of successive nvironments of coastal deposition landward and upward with the rising sea. The vertical sequence is as follows reading from bottom to top: the buried Pleistocene surface, brackish- to salt-marsh peat, open-lagoonal <b>silty</b> <b>clays,</b> backbamer sands, backbarrier-fringe salt-marsh peat, and barrier island sands. The entire transgressive s quence forms a lens-shaped deposit.

40|$|The Pliocene-Quaternary sediments that we drilled {{at eight}} {{sites in the}} Gulf of California consist of <b>silty</b> <b>clays</b> to clayey silts, diatomaceous oozes, and {{mixtures}} of both types. In this chapter I have summarized various measurements of their physical properties, relating this information to burial depth and effective overburden pressure. Rapid deposition and frequent intercalations of mud turbidites may cause underconsolidation in some cases; overconsolidation probably can be excluded. General lithification begins at depths between 200 and 300 meters sub-bottom, at porosities between 55 and 60 % (for <b>silty</b> <b>clays)</b> and as high as 70 % (for diatomaceous ooze). Diatom-rich sediments have low strength and very high porosities (70 - 90 %) and can maintain this state {{to a depth of}} nearly 400 meters (where the overburden pressure = 1. 4 MPa). The field compressibility curves of all sites are compared to data published earlier. Where sediments are affected by basaltic sills, these curves clearly show the effects of additional loading and thermal stress (diagenesis near the contacts). Strength measurements on well-preserved hydraulic piston cores yielded results similar to those obtained on selected samples from standard drilling. Volumetric shrinkage dropped to low values at 100 to 400 meters burial depth (0. 3 to 2. 0 MPa overburden pressure). Porosity after shrinkage depends on the composition of sediments...|$|R
