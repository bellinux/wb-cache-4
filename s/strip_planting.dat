Enrichment planting on Indonesian Silvicultural System of Selective Cutting and <b>Strip</b> <b>Planting</b> (TPTJ) aims {{to increase the}} productivity of logged-over areas (LOA) using Strip Plantation System. <b>Strip</b> <b>Planting</b> System is an intensive management system attempted by opening logged-over area for <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> and planting purposed species. Plantation in Strip Plantation System needs much nutrition for its growth. Nutrition returning through litter on TPTJsystem was essentially notified. This research aims to identify litter production in <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> and on-strip planting at logged-over areas, within one year, five years, ten years after logging, andprimary forest at PT. Sari BumiKusuma. This research was conducted from September 2010 to February 2011. The litter trap was used to calculate litter accumulation. Litter production at LOA after one year of planting is 2. 27 ton. ha- 1. 6 months- 1 in <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> and 3. 68 ton. ha- 1. 6 months- 1 in non-strip planting; litter production at LOA after five years is 4. 97 ton. ha- 1. 6 months- 1 in <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> and 4. 98 ton. ha- 1. 6 months- 1 in non-strip planting; while litter production at LOA after ten years is 4. 03 ton. ha- 1. 6 months- 1 in <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> and 4. 67 ton. ha- 1. 6 months- 1 in non-strip planting.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the feasibility of legumes intercropping in sorghum based cropping system at 60, 30 / 90 and 30 / 120 cm spaced single, double and triple row strips, respectively. The data showed that planting pattern of double row strips (30 / 90 cm) significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the grain yield (5. 95 t ha - 1) of sorghum than single (5. 65 t ha - 1) or triple row strip (5. 53 t ha - 1) planting pattern. Legumes associations decreased the sorghum grain yield by 3. 72 and 6. 60 % then pure stands of sorghum. The interaction between planting geometry and associated legumes culture was non-significant in both the years. However, double row <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> with two rows of intercrop between the 90 cm space was found superior to other treatment combinations. Thus, this planting technique of sorghum-based legumes intercropping can be recommended for adoption to the farmers...|$|E

40|$|A Versatile Multi-crop Planter (VMP) was {{designed}} and built for seed and fertilizer application in lines when driven by 2 -wheel tractors (2 WT) for: single-pass shallow-tillage (SPST); <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> (SP); zero tillage (ZT); bed planting (BP) and conventional tillage (CT). Land preparation cost by VMP was decreased by up to 75 % for single pass compared to CT (Haque at el., 2011). The VMP was capable of sowing many types of crop seeds from small jute seed up to maize seed. Demand for mechanized planters by smallholder farmers is growing rapidly due to the shortage of farm labour for operations such as planting or transplanting. Despite the promising seeder and planter developments, few of the present planters for 2 WT are commercialized in Bangladesh. With the funding support from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), the VMP commercialization activities commenced in 2012. Initially (2012 to 2014), the VMP commercialization activities were led by International Development Enterprises (IDE) and that approach {{was followed by a}} different approach implemented by the Project Implementation Office (PIO) of Murdoch University, Australia.

40|$|Non-control {{of weeds}} will reduce wheat grain yield {{significantly}} (Sing et al., 2015). In Bangladesh, farmers use 2 - 6 tillage passes by 2 -wheel tractor (2 WT) to control pre-plant weeds and prepare {{the land to}} sow the seeds. Minimum soil disturbance {{is one of the}} key principles of conservation agriculture (CA). However, minimum soil disturbance planting systems could enhance weed infestation (Sing et al., 2015) if pre-plant weeds are not controlled properly. Although the use of herbicide is increasing quite rapidly in Bangladesh (Hossain, 2015), the use of non-selective herbicide (e. g., glyphosate) to control pre-plant weeds is limited due to higher price of glyphosate and non-availability at farmers' level. The Versatile Multi-crop Planter (VMP) (Haque et al., 2011) performs <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> of various crop seeds and application of fertilizer in lines, and covering seeds simultaneously in a single pass operation. To manage pre-plant weeds in the field, the rotary shaft of VMP was redesigned with small blades attached between strips to cut the existing weeds while sowing seeds in the field.

40|$|Keeping in {{view the}} low {{fertilizer}} and water use efficiency of autumn sugarcane in Pakistan, {{a research project}} was initiated at the research area of the Rukh Bibi campus of Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan and Main Line Lower Land Reclamation Research Station Chak No 37 TDA (Thal Development Authority) Bhakkar during 2003 - 2004 and 2004 - 2005 to provide a practicable package of resource conservation technology to sugarcane growers under arid envirnment. Three experiments were {{laid out in a}} Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with factorial arrangement, replicated 4 times. The net plot size was 24 m 2. Approved sugarcane variety HSF 240 was used in all experiments. In first experiment four NPK doses F 1 (0 - 0 - 0), F 2 (100 - 100 - 100), F 3 (150 - 150 - 100), F 4 (200 - 200 - 100) and F 5 (250 - 200 - 100) kg ha- 1 and four planting patterns like G 1 (60), G 2 (75) cm spaced single row planting pattern, G 3 (30 / 90), and G 4 (30 / 120) cm spaced paired row <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> pattern were studied. In secand experiment four available soil moisture depletion levels (ASMDL) including ASMDL 1 (20 %), ASMDL 2 (40 %), ASMDL 3 (60 %) and ASMDL 4 (80 %), four planting patterns viz. G 1 (60), G 2 (75) cm spaced single row planting pattern and G 3 (30 / 90), G 4 (30 / 120) cm spaced paired row <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> pattern were studied. In third experiment four Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) levels viz. NAA 0 (control), NAA 1 (60), NAA 2 (120) and NAA 3 (180) ml ha- 1 were applied at four plant growth stages S 1 (Germination), S 2 (Tiller formation), S 3 (Cane formation) and S 4 (Cane maturity) stage. Data were recorded on various growth and yield parameters like germination %, number of shoots m- 2, shoot dry weight (SDW), Crop growth rate (CGR), Leaf area index (LAI), Leaf area duration (LAD), Net assimilation rate (NAR), number of millable canes m- 2, weight per stripped cane, cane length; cane diameter, stripped-cane yield, sugar yield (SY), benefit cost ratio (BCR), fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) in all experiments. In first trail under arid conditions on silty clay and sandy loam soils, the highest benefit cost ratio (BCR) and fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) were obtained from the combination of 200 â€“ 200 - 100 kg NPK ha- 1 and 30 / 90 cm spaced paired row <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> pattern. In secand trail, maximum economic benefit was obtained by irrigating sugarcane crop at 40 % ASMD level and planting it in 30 / 90 cm spaced paired row strips under arid conditions on silty clay and sandy loam soils. In the third trail maximum economic benefit was obtained from normal investment by applying 120 ml NAA ha- 1 at tiller formation stage and maximum sugar recovery percentage was obtained by applying 180 ml of NAA ha- 1 at cane maturity stage on silty clay and sandy loam soils. It is concluded that sugarcane growers of arid areas can get maximum return from sandy loam and silty clay soils, when sugarcane is planted in 30 / 90 cm spaced paired row strips with fertilizer dose of 200 : 200 : 100 kg NPK ha- 1 and field is irrigated at 40 % ASMD level with one foliar spray of NAA at the rate of 120 ml ha- 1 is applied at tiller formation stage. Production technology evolved through this research has following implications. NAA can also be used as cane ripener and one folier spray of 180 ml NAA ha- 1 at cane maturity stage gives maximum sugar recovery percentage. Better water and fertilizer use efficiency of autumn sugarcane on above mentioned soils due to enhanced light interception. Cultural operations in standing crop like irrigation, fertilization, weeding, hoeing,earthing up and foliar spray of pesticides are easily carried out as ample interstrip space is available. Minimum lodging was observed due to avilability of adequate space among the paired row strips. There is also better scope for intercroping to get additional benefits...|$|E

40|$|The {{cropping}} {{intensity of}} Bangladesh is increasing {{year after year}} because most small holders start growing three or more crops in a year. Over a 5 -year cycle due to changing profitability of crops, farmers cultivate 4 - 6 crops with diverse seed sizes, seed rate, row spacing, fertilizer rates, and seed depth. Hence a planter for such diverse cropping systems needs to have multi-functional capabilities. Service providers {{also need to be}} able to hire out their planter for business all year round to justify the investment cost. There are a number of other criteria and challenges that would need to be satisfied by potential purchasers of a planter. The VMP (Versatile Multi-crop Planter) is such a unique machine for two-wheel tractor which can meet the above criteria and successfully establish a diverse range of crops since 2008 (Haque et al., 2011). It has designed with capability for seeding and fertilizing with fluted roller or vertical plate meters in lines for single-pass shallow-tillage, <b>strip</b> <b>planting,</b> zero tillage and bed planting. The service providers remove seeding unit from VMP and convert only for high speed rotary tiller (HSRT). Most of the grain seeds like wheat, paddy, maize, jute, pulses, oilseeds etc. can be sown in line using VMP. It owners are using this device for their own land cultivation and earning cash income through custom hiring to other farmers and could improve their livelihood through this machine. Therefore, an attempt was made to assess the profitability of VMP operations at farm level and the impacts of its operations on service providers’ livelihood...|$|E
40|$|Shortages of {{hired labour}} are leading to greater {{interest}} in mechanisation for crop establishment in smallholder agriculture. Due to small field sizes, mechanised planters mounted on four-wheel tractors are not a suitable technology. The Versatile Multi-crop Planter (VMP) was developed for zero tillage (ZT), <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> (SP) or single pass shallow tillage (SPST) on flat land and for forming and planting on tops of beds, each {{in a single pass}} operation, when mounted on a two-wheel tractor (2 WT). The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the field performance of the VMP in comparison to conventional broadcast seeding and full rotary tillage (2 to 4 passes; called CT) for establishing chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), jute (Corchorus olitorius L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus), maize (Zea mays L.), mung bean (Vigna radiata L. R. Wilczek), rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 15 locations of Bangladesh. Plant populations emerging from all single pass operations viz. SP, ZT, and bed planting (BP) were generally satisfactory and in 12 out of 15 experiments plant populations after SP were similar to or greater than after CT. In addition, SP gave comparable or greater plant populations than SPST and BP planting methods. Overall, the SP planting achieved comparable yields and lower costs of establishment than CT. We conclude that effective and reliable planters are now available for sowing a range of crop species on small fields with minimum soil disturbance. This opens up realistic options for the development of mechanised conservation agriculture suited to small field sizes...|$|E

In the block planting, pigeon peas and annual crops were spatially separated {{with a single}} interface between them. The <b>strip</b> <b>planting</b> had 4 pigeon pea strips 4 m wide alternating with annual crop strips 8 m wide, providing 7 interfaces. Spacing was the same in both planting patterns, i. e. 1 × 1 m for pigeon peas and 45 × 15 cm for annual crops. Crops were planted (and harvested) in the order sorghum (planted with the pigeon peas), chickpeas (first cropping), sunflowers, chickpeas (second cropping). Growth of the perennial pigeon peas was compared at the tree-crop interface (TCI) {{and in the middle}} of the block planting. Perennial pigeon pea plants at the interface had significantly more branches and larger stems than those in the middle of the block planting at the onset of the following rainy season. The greater number of flowers and grains in interface pigeon pea plants was partly due to a better lateral light level and partly due to better access to water. There was a negative effect on growth of annual crops at the TCI, which extended to 1. 5 m during the rainy season and to 2. 5 m during the post-rainy season. Significant reduction in the growth of annual crops occurred 30 - 40 days after sowing and was associated with shading by the taller pigeon pea plants. Measurements of the root profile of pigeon pea at the interface indicated that competition for moisture was the major cause of yield reduction of chickpeas during the post-rainy season, but an allelopathic effect may also have been involved. The results are compared with other TCI studies (especially with Leucaena leucocephala) and the possible mechanisms for moisture interaction at the TCI are discussed. ...|$|E

To supply a nurse for a tender species The nurse species may, in general, be regarded as an artificial serai stage, introduced in order to obtain an approximation to forest conditions so that a valuable species may be enabled to establish itself under what would otherwise be adverse conditions. The nurse may act through the soil, the existing vegetation, or the atmosphere and when deciding upon a nurse, it is important to be quite clear what particular site factors require to be ameliorated. These may include low temperatures, high temperatures, evaporation, competing vegetation, re-ducing conditions in the soil, &c. The effect of reduced light in improving the form of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) may also be included under this head (i). The following example demonstrates an early nursing effect of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) upon Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis Carr.) when grown in mixture on a Calluna heath. It may be noted that there are also long-term benefits in this case depending upon the deeper rooting habit of the pine with a consequent improvement in some physical properties of the soil (3) ...|$|E

There are a substantial number of restaurants, cafes and coffee shops along Leura Mall, among the boutiques, gift and antique shops.|$|R
