5|$|Dipterans are an {{important}} group of insects and have a considerable impact on the environment. Some leaf-miner flies (Agromyzidae), fruit flies (Tephritidae and Drosophilidae) and gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) are pests of agricultural crops; others such as tsetse flies, screwworm and botflies (Oestridae) attack livestock, causing wounds, spreading disease, and creating significant economic harm. See article: Parasitic flies of domestic animals. A few can even cause myiasis in humans. Still others such as mosquitoes (Culicidae), blackflies (<b>Simuliidae)</b> and drain flies (Psychodidae) impact human health, acting as vectors of major tropical diseases.|$|E
25|$|Some other aquatic Diptera, such as <b>Simuliidae,</b> do {{survive in}} Iceland, but their habits and adaptations {{differ from those}} of mosquitoes; <b>Simuliidae</b> for example, though they, like mosquitoes, are bloodsuckers, {{generally}} inhabit stones under running water that does not readily freeze and which is totally unsuited to mosquitoes; mosquitoes are generally not adapted to running water.|$|E
25|$|The Chironomidae (informally {{known as}} chironomids, nonbiting midges, or lake flies) {{comprise}} {{a family of}} nematoceran flies with a global distribution. They {{are closely related to}} the Ceratopogonidae, <b>Simuliidae,</b> and Thaumaleidae. Many species superficially resemble mosquitoes, but they lack the wing scales and elongated mouthparts of the Culicidae.|$|E
25|$|Over 3,500 {{species of}} the Culicidae have already been described. They are {{generally}} divided into two subfamilies which in turn comprise some 43 genera. These figures are subject to continual change, as more species are discovered, and as DNA studies compel rearrangement of the taxonomy of the family. The two main subfamilies are the Anophelinae and Culicinae, with their genera {{as shown in the}} subsection below. The distinction is of great practical importance because the two subfamilies tend to differ in their significance as vectors of different classes of diseases. Roughly speaking, arboviral diseases such as yellow fever and dengue fever tend to be transmitted by Culicine species, not necessarily in the genus Culex. Some transmit various species of avian malaria, {{but it is not clear}} that they ever transmit any form of human malaria. Some species do however transmit various forms of filariasis, much as many <b>Simuliidae</b> do.|$|E
500|$|Dipteran larvae have no jointed, [...] "true legs", {{but some}} {{dipteran}} larvae, such as species of <b>Simuliidae,</b> Tabanidae and Vermileonidae, have prolegs adapted {{to hold onto}} a substrate in flowing water, host tissues or prey. The majority of dipterans are oviparous and lay batches of eggs, but some species are ovoviviparous, where the larvae starting development inside the eggs before they hatch or viviparous, the larvae hatching and maturing {{in the body of}} the mother before being externally deposited. These are found especially in groups that have larvae dependent on food sources that are short-lived or are accessible for brief periods. This is widespread in some families such as the Sarcophagidae. In Hylemya strigosa (Anthomyiidae) the larva moults to the second instar before hatching, and in Termitoxenia (Phoridae) females have incubation pouches, and a full developed third instar larva is deposited by the adult and it almost immediately pupates with no freely feeding larval stage. The tsetse fly (as well as other Glossinidae, Hippoboscidae, Nycteribidae and Streblidae) exhibits adenotrophic viviparity; a single fertilised egg is retained in the oviduct and the developing larva feeds on glandular secretions. When fully grown, the female finds a spot with soft soil and the larva works its way out of the oviduct, buries itself and pupates. Some flies like Lundstroemia parthenogenetica (Chironomidae) reproduce by thelytokous parthenogenesis, and some gall midges have larvae that can produce eggs (paedogenesis).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sense}} of the entire family Culicidae, {{mosquitoes}} are cosmopolitan; in every land region except for Antarctica and a few islands, mainly in polar or subpolar climates, at least some species of mosquito will be present. Iceland is such an island, being essentially free of mosquitoes. [...] In warm and humid tropical regions, some mosquito species are active for the entire year, but in temperate and cold regions they hibernate or enter diapause. Arctic or subarctic mosquitoes, like some other arctic midges in families such as <b>Simuliidae</b> and Ceratopogonidae may be active for only a few weeks annually as melt-water pools form on the permafrost. During that time, though, they emerge in huge numbers in some regions and may take up to 300 ml of blood per day from each animal in a caribou herd.|$|E

50|$|Enderlein {{published}} {{more than}} 500 scientific articles, mostly about insects. He worked in taxonomy and systematics of many Diptera families. Many insects were named by him and some still carry his name. His way of distinction by external characteristics led to some disputes inside the scientific community of that time (see Zwick 1995 for details). Enderlein was mostly interested in the fly family, <b>Simuliidae.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ceratopogonidae, or biting midges, are {{a family}} of small flies (1-4 mm long) in the order Diptera. They are also known as no-see-ums, midgies, sand flies, punkies, and others in North America, and sandflies in Australia. (The name [...] "sandfly" [...] is ambiguous, as it is also applied informally to many other flies, such as the {{subfamily}} Phlebotominae.) They {{are closely related to}} the Chironomidae, <b>Simuliidae</b> (or black flies), and Thaumaleidae.|$|E
5000|$|The minute black {{scavenger}} flies or [...] "dung midges", are a family, Scatopsidae, of nematoceran flies. Despite being {{distributed throughout}} the world, they form a small family with only around 250 described species in 27 genera, although many await description and doubtless even more await discovery. These are generally small, sometimes minute, dark flies (from 0.6 to 5 mm), generally similar to black flies (<b>Simuliidae),</b> but usually lacking the humped thorax characteristic of that family.|$|E
50|$|The blenny darter lives {{a maximum}} of two to three years, grows to {{a maximum of}} 69 mm {{standard}} length, and is sexually mature at one year. It is reproductively active throughout March and April. Spawning occurs over gravel riffles with swift currents. Mature eggs are orange and translucent. The fish are insectivorous, with analyzed gut contents containing Nematocera larvae, more specifically black fly (<b>Simuliidae)</b> and midge (Chironomidae) larvae. Significant numbers of mayfly (Ephemeroptera) and caddisfly (Trichoptera) nymphs were also found.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, a {{total of}} ten macroinvertebrate taxa were {{observed}} in Crab Run.

50|$|Thaumaleidae, {{the solitary}} midges or trickle midges, are {{a group of}} nematoceran flies related to the Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae, and the <b>Simuliidae.</b> They are small, stocky, yellow to brown flies (3-4 mm). Very few species are known for this family (about 120 species in five genera). Larvae are found in films on rocks and the nonfeeding adults are usually found on foliage along the same streams in which the larvae are found. A few solitary midges {{are found in the}} Southern Hemisphere, but Thaumaleidae are {{generally}} an Holarctic family.|$|E

50|$|He {{attended}} {{secondary school}} in Kolozsvár and university of Selmecbánya. Tömösváry completed his university studies in Budapest in 1881, and his doctoral thesis concerned the anatomical {{structure of the}} respiratory organ of Scutigera coleoptrata. In his scientific career Tömösváry wrote 57 papers. When he arrived in the Lower Danube region to study the Columbatch fly (<b>Simuliidae)</b> he became sick with tuberculosis. Because of this continuing illness he wasn't able {{to work as a}} zoologist and {{in the last year of}} his life he worked as a teacher at Kassa. He died on August 15, 1884 in Déva.|$|E
50|$|Once a new {{generation}} of microfilariae is released in the primary host, those in turn must seek out host tissue suited {{to the nature of the}} vector species. For example, if the vector is a skin-piercing fly such as a mosquito the microfilaria must enter the peripheral blood circulation, whereas species borne by skin-rasping flies such as <b>Simuliidae</b> and skin-cutting flies such as Tabanidae tend to establish in hypodermal tissues. For obscure reasons, some such species actually undergo daily migrations to bodily regions favoured by the vector ectoparasites. Outside those periods they take refuge in blood circulation of the lungs.|$|E

5000|$|Midges are a {{group of}} insects that include many kinds of small flies. They are found (seasonally or otherwise) on {{practically}} every land area outside permanently arid deserts and the frigid zones. The term [...] "midge" [...] does not define any particular taxonomic group, but includes species in several families of Nematoceran Diptera. Some midges, such as many Phlebotominae (sand fly) and <b>Simuliidae</b> (black fly), are vectors of various diseases. Many others play useful roles as prey items for insectivores, such as various frogs and swallows. Others are important as detritivores, participating in various nutrient cycles. The habits of midges vary greatly from species to species, though within any particular family, midges commonly have similar ecological roles.|$|E
5000|$|Since N. munitus is an {{opportunistic}} insectivore, {{like most}} of these fish, competition for food may {{be present in the}} ecology of the species. A diet analysis showed Bactidae nymphs (31%), Hydropsychidae larvae (20%), and <b>Simuliidae</b> larvae (20%) provided most of the food for N. munitus. [...] Consequently, in the long run, managing for N. munitus would also benefit other species. However, another reason for decline that should be assessed is predators, but predators were hard to find. Like all madtoms, they are known for their pectoral spines that contain saw-like teeth and a neurotoxin gland. These spines and toxins produce a painful sting when used, and indicate the presence of predators.|$|E
