40|$|Abstract: In 1963, {{blue crabs}} were 80 per cent less {{abundant}} in 10 -foot trawl samples than in 1961 and 15 per cent less abundant than in 1962. The sampling device {{best suited for}} sampling sub-adult crabs in 1963 was the bar-seine. The 60 -foot seine was least selective in terms of size. Female crabs of sub-adult and adult sizes outnumbered males by 14 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. Salinities have increased 75 per cent since 1961, and commercial crab landings have decreased 50 per cent. Objectives: To determine the population and seasonal abundance of the blue crab in the Aransas Bay System. Procedure: Sampling for blue crabs was conducted with minnow seine, otter trawl, and bar seine. All habitat types were sampled (Figure 1). Monthly collections were made up of four 20 -foot otter trawl samples, eight 10 -foot trawl samples, four minnow seine samples, and two bar seine samples. The minnow seine used was 60 feet long and 6 feet deep, with a bag near the center. The mesh was three-fourth of an inch stretched. The bar seine was 6 feet wide and constructed of one-half of an inch <b>stretch</b> <b>mesh.</b> The 20 -foot trawl was made of 1 1 / 2 inch <b>stretch</b> <b>mesh</b> and the 10 -foot trawl was. made of 1 1 / 4 inch <b>stretch</b> <b>mesh</b> with an inner liner of one-half of an inch <b>stretch</b> <b>mesh</b> in the cod end.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the numerical solution of discrete boundary integral equations on polyhedral surfaces in three dimensions. When the solution contains typical edge singularities, highly <b>stretched</b> <b>meshes</b> are preferred to uniform meshes, since they {{reduce the number of}} degrees of freedom needed to obtain a fixed accuracy. The classical panel-clustering method can still be applied in the presence of such highly <b>stretched</b> <b>meshes.</b> However, we will show that the savings in computation time and storage become suboptimal because the near field matrix arising in the panel-clustering algorithm is no longer as sparse {{as it is in the}} case of uniform meshes. Hence, a natural question arises as to whether a new enhanced panel-clustering algorithm can be designed which performs efficiently even in the presence of highly <b>stretched</b> <b>meshes.</b> The main result of this paper is to formulate such an enhanced version of the panel-clustering algorithm. The key features of the algorithm are (i) the employment of partial analytic integration in the direction of stretching, yielding a new kernel function on a one-dimensional manifold where the influence of high aspect ratios in the stretched elements is removed, and (ii) the introduction of a generalized admissibility condition with respect to the partially integrated kernel, which ensures that certain stretched clusters which are inadmissible in the classical sense now become admissible. In the context of a model problem, we prove that our algorithm yields an accurate (up to the discretization error) matrix-vector multiplication which requires O(Nlog(k) N) operations, where N is the number of degrees of freedom and k is small and independent of the aspect ratio. The generalized admissibility condition can be viewed as an addition to the classical method which may be useful in general when <b>stretched</b> <b>meshes</b> are present. We also have performed a numerical experiment which shows that the sparsity of the near field matrix for the enhanced panel-clustering method is not negatively affected by stretched elements, and the method will perform optimally...|$|R

Feeding rhythm of the fish was assessed based on samples collected in October 2001 over 24 -hour period at 4 -hour interval. Food items identified from stomach contents were analysed using the frequency of occurrence and the points methods. Macrophytes, detritus, blue greens, diatoms, green algae, Ceratium, Euglena and Phacus constituted food of plant origin whereas chironomid larvae, Copepoda, Cladocera, Rotifera, Nematoda, fish eggs and fish scales constituted food of animal origin. Furthermore, animal foods such as Ephemeroptera and molluscs were noted in the diet of adult fish. In adult T. zillii, macrophytes occurred {{in all of the}} stomachs examined and composed 86 % of the diet whereas 11 % was contributed by phytoplankton.

BIO-ENV process was used to estimate assemblage association with depth, temperature and salinity of surface and bottom waters.

For cell-centered discretizations on triangles, both the unweighted and weighted least-squares constructions fail to provide suitable gradient estimates for highly <b>stretched</b> curved <b>meshes.</b> Good overall flow solution accuracy can be retained in spite of poor gradient estimates, due to the presence of flow alignment in exactly the same regions where the poor gradient accuracy is observed.
