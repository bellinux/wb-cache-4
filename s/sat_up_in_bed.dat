25|$|Before {{he could}} be ordained a priest, Gabriel died in the retreat at Isola del Gran Sasso {{the early hours of}} February 27, 1862, in the {{presence}} of the community, holding close an image of Our Lady of Sorrows and smiling peacefully. Those who were with Gabriel when he died reported that at the moment of death, he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and his face became radiant as he reached out to an otherwise unseen figure that was entering the room. It was the opinion of Father Norbert that Saint Gabriel had seen the Virgin Mary at the very moment of his death.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Beveridge married Jessy Janet, {{daughter}} of William Philip and widow of David Mair, in 1942. He died {{at his home}} on 16 March 1963, aged 84, and was buried in Thockrington churchyard, on the Northumbrian moors. His barony became extinct upon his death. His last words, as he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> whilst still working on his 'History of Prices', were [...] "I have a thousand things to do".|$|E
60|$|Joe (his Christian {{name was}} Joe) <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> and looked around.|$|E
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed</b> and saw {{a figure}} {{advancing}} towards me. It was Oros, who bore a lamp in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Britling <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed</b> {{and beat}} at the bedclothes with his fists. He uttered uncompleted vows, [...] "From this hour forth ... from this hour forth...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What for?" [...] and Nat <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed</b> to {{look and}} listen, so {{interested}} was he in this man who cared for the poor so much.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman was}} silent, but not convinced. Presently she <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
60|$|His wife <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> listening. A loud knock resounded {{through the}} house.|$|E
60|$|Ngakura <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> {{and began}} to cry. The matting started to shake.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Dove {{shook his}} head, {{but his wife}} <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{suddenly}} <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> and plucked him by the sleeve, for she had been listening intently to everything that passed.|$|R
6000|$|In the evening, {{putting her}} cheek against her brother's {{shoulder}} {{as she was}} sitting by him, while he <b>sat</b> propped <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> under a new difficulty of breathing, she said-- ...|$|R
60|$|This {{was a very}} {{discreet}} remark, but it set Mrs. Kemp in {{a whirlwind}} of passion. She raised herself and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed,</b> flourishing her clenched fist at her daughter.|$|R
60|$|Louise {{glanced at}} her watch, <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> and turned reproachfully toward Aline.|$|E
60|$|The dazed girl <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and listened, {{while her}} heart almost stood still.|$|E
60|$|Tess <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> {{lost in a}} vague {{interspace}} {{between a}} dream and this information.|$|E
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{suddenly}} <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> {{and turned}} on the light. It was barely two o'clock by my watch, but I felt sure that I had not been mistaken. Some one had knocked at my door.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the great <b>bed</b> with his arms about his knees.|$|R
60|$|Mr Armstrong soon {{put an end}} to this dumb show, {{by walking}} into the bed-room, when the girl escaped, and he shut the door. Barry <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed,</b> rubbed his eyes, and stared at him, but he said nothing.|$|R
60|$|That evening Miriam <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> with a shawl {{about her}} {{shoulders}} and discoursed to her brother.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{continued}} to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> and was interested at once.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the oldest}} Rover boy awoke with a start. He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> {{wondering}} what had thus awakened him.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> stiffly <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> Seconds passed {{while he}} {{interpreted}} his strange surroundings. He wasn't {{in his own}} home, of course. This {{was out in the}} country. It was colder than it should be and there was green at the window.|$|R
6000|$|... "What about Miss Puffle? I haven't heard a word. What about Miss Puffle?" [...] He {{had been}} {{thinking}} that moment of Miss Puffle,--of how she would be superior to Miss Thoroughbung in many ways,--so that he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed,</b> holding the untasted tea in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... “You see, sir, that I {{have the}} rheumatism, and cannot move,” said the lady, looking uncommonly ghastly as she <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her <b>bed,</b> where however {{she had had}} her cheeks painted, and a new cap put on, so that she might at least look her best when the {{officers}} came.|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> {{tingling}} {{with excitement}} at the developments which already I saw arising from his last night's imprudence.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Scutts looked thoughtful. He ate his tea in silence, {{and after}} he had {{finished}} lit his pipe and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> smoking.|$|E
60|$|Some time in {{the middle}} of the night, or maybe towards the early morning, Dolly, who was Mrs. X.'s sister, <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and listened.|$|E
60|$|About {{six o'clock}} Margaret <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{suddenly}} <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> with {{the conviction that}} she had slept in. To her this was to ravel the day: a dire thing. The last time it happened Gavin, softened by her distress, had condensed morning worship into a sentence that she might make up on the clock.|$|R
6000|$|The figure glided {{towards him}} and stopped. He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed</b> still fast asleep, for {{his eyes were}} shut. He {{stretched}} out his arms, as though seeking one whom he would embrace, and spoke again in a low and passionate voice--"Ayesha, through life and death I have sought thee long. Come to me, my goddess, my desired." ...|$|R
60|$|Peter slept on. The light guttered [burned to edges] {{and went}} out, leaving the {{tenement}} in darkness; {{but still he}} slept. It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed,</b> wakened by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping {{on the door of}} his tree.|$|R
6000|$|Amy <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> and put {{her arms}} round her mother's neck. 'Then he is happy again,' she whispered. 'I should like to hear all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, he took {{it pretty}} well; he was civil enough. Where are you, Loo?' He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and kissed her. 'Good night, my dear, good night.' ...|$|E
60|$|His sobs woke Wendy, and she <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> She was not alarmed {{to see a}} {{stranger}} crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly interested.|$|E
6000|$|The morning advanced. There were {{footsteps}} in the house. He {{heard the}} blinds drawn up, and shutters opened; {{and now and}} then a stealthy tread outside his own door. He tried to call out, more than once, but his mouth was dry {{as if it had been}} filled with sand. At last he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed,</b> and cried: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{suddenly}} <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her <b>bed,</b> her great, thick rope {{of brown}} hair falling over her white shoulders, and flung her arms about me, {{and burst into}} tears on my old breast. I petted and soothed her, and said not a word; and, after a while, she stopped crying; but she still sat with her head so that I couldn't see her face.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, however, amid this monotony, came a sound which startled him at once. It was {{a female}} shriek. He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed</b> to listen, then remembered he was in Alsatia, where brawls of every sort were current among the unruly inhabitants. But another scream, and another, and another, succeeded so close, that he was certain, though the noise was remote and sounded stifled, it {{must be in the}} same house with himself.|$|R
