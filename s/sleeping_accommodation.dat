The ground floor and second floor had fireplaces, with the first and second floors also having garderobes. The ground floor may have formed a dining area, with the floors above being used for military purposes and <b>sleeping</b> <b>accommodation.</b> The walls of the ground floor have chasing and sockets cut into them. It is unclear what these were: theories include that they contained timbers to support brickwork that in turn supported the first floor; that they were held timbers that supported the joists of the first floor; or they are the remains of an ammunition store, retrofitted in the tower in the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The Fire Precautions Act 1971 {{came into}} force in 1972, when hotels and {{boarding}} houses {{were the first}} class of premises to be designated.

25|$|Homelessness is the {{condition}} of people without a permanent dwelling, such as a house or apartment. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing. The legal definition of homeless varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region. The term homeless may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a homeless shelter, a domestic violence shelter, long-term residence in a motel, a vehicle, squatting, cardboard boxes, a tent city, tarpaulins, shanty town structures made of discarded building materials or other ad hoc housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, a home {{is not just a}} physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, a sense of belonging and a place of emotional wellbeing. American government homeless enumeration studies also include people who sleep in a public or private place not designed for use as a regular <b>sleeping</b> <b>accommodation</b> for human beings. There are a number of organizations who provide help for the homeless.|$|E
25|$|The re-organisation of {{railways}} in India into regional zones {{began in}} 1951. On 14 April 1951, Southern Railway was created. On 5 November, Central Railway and Western Railway were created. In the same year,the post of Chief Commissioner of Railways was abolished and the Railway Board adopted {{the practice of}} making the seniormost member Chairman of the board. In the same year, the government of West Bengal entered into {{an agreement with the}} Calcutta Tramways Co. to take over its administrative functions. On 14 April 1952, Northern Railway, Eastern Railway and North-Eastern Railway were created. In the same year, fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in all classes of passenger accommodation and <b>sleeping</b> <b>accommodation</b> was introduced in coaches. On 1 August 1955, Eastern Railway was split to form new South-Eastern Railway. In 1956, divisional system of administration was set up for the various regional zones. Also in 1956, the first fully air-conditioned train was introduced between Howrah and Delhi. In 1957, after successful trials in France, SNCF proposed 25kV AC electrification for railways. Railways took a decision to adopt 25kV AC electrification and chose SNCF as technical consultant. An organisation, Main Line Electrification Project (which later became the Railway Electrification Project and still later the Central Organization for Railway Electrification) was established in the same year. In 1958, the North-Eastern Railway split to form a new Northeast Frontier Railway. In 1959, the Raj Kharswan - Dongoposi section became the first section to be electrified with 25kV AC traction. The first scheduled train using 25kV AC traction ran on Raj Kharswan - Dongoposi section on 11 August 1960. In 1966, first containerized freight services were started, between Bombay and Ahmedabad. In the same year, electrification of several suburban tracks around Delhi, Madras and Calcutta was completed with the 25 kV AC system. In 1979, Main Line Electrification Project was reconstituted into Central Organization for Railway Electrification (CORE).|$|E

2500|$|The valleys {{between the}} {{individual}} plateaux [...] were used as drove roads by cattle drovers who built rough protective shelters for their arduous journeys.

This route has a total ascent of about [...] between habitation at Coylumbridge in Speyside and Linn of Dee. At {{about the same time}} that droving was dying out {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, deer stalking estates were flourishing and so the shelters were developed into bothies to provide improved, though still primitive, accommodation for gamekeepers. In modern times these bothies have been taken over by the Mountain Bothies Association for use by trekkers and climbers to provide shelter and rough <b>sleeping</b> <b>accommodation.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The terms {{unsheltered}} and unhoused {{refer to}} that segment of a homeless community {{who do not have}} ordinary lawful access to buildings in which to sleep; the latter term is defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as describing persons occupying [...] "place not designed for ... <b>sleeping</b> <b>accommodation</b> for human beings". [...] Such persons frequently prefer the term houseless to the term homeless. Recent homeless enumeration survey documentation utilizes the term unsheltered homeless. The common colloquial term street people does not fully encompass all unsheltered people, in that many such persons do not spend their time in urban street environments. Many shun such locales, because homeless people in urban environments may face the risk of being robbed or beaten up. Some people convert unoccupied or abandoned buildings ("squatting"), or inhabit mountainous areas or, more often, lowland meadows, creek banks and beaches. Many jurisdictions have developed programs to provide short-term emergency shelter during particularly cold spells, often in churches or other institutional properties. These are referred to as warming centers, and are credited by their advocates as lifesaving.|$|E
2500|$|Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 4 August 1914 and the government {{took control of the}} railways under the Regulation of the Forces Act 1871. Day-to-day operations were left in the control of local management, but movements necessary for the war were coordinated by a committee of general managers. The Navy established a base at Scapa Flow, in the Orkneys, and this was serviced from Scrabster Harbour, [...] from the Highland station at Thurso. A repair base for ship was built at Invergordon, including housing for 4000 workers. Defence works at Scapa Flow and Invergordon required large amounts of timber {{at the same time the}} demand from the south for pit-timber increased; by 1918 the Highland was transporting ten times the amount of timber it had shipped before the war. Coal, which before the war was carried by coastal steamers, now had to be shipped by rail. To cope with the irregular flow of officers and men to and from London a special train was arranged between London and Thurso. This ran between 1917–19, leaving London Euston at 6pm (3pm in the winter) to arrive in Thurso hours later; the return journey left at 11:45am and took hours. The train was composed of 14 carriages of corridor stock, policed by a travelling master-at-arms; officers were given <b>sleeping</b> <b>accommodation.</b> The train stopped for 30 minutes at Inverness so a meal could be provided by the station hotel; some days nearly 1,000 meals were provided.|$|E

Many day boats {{are used for}} scuba-divers and also for other marine tourism activities such as fishing and whale-watching. In general, divers or passengers will spend only the daylight hours on a day boat, and do not sleep in them overnight. Dive boats which provide <b>sleeping</b> <b>accommodation</b> are generally referred to as [...] "live-aboard" [...] boats. Generally a professional crew operate the boat. The boat provides shelter from the weather {{and is likely to}} have various facilities such as a toilet (called the [...] "head") and a small kitchen (called a [...] "galley"), to cater for the guests and crew. Day-boats may have a saloon where divers can relax on upholstered benches, and one or more dining tables. Many day boats also have an uncovered sun-deck, and a shaded area, for divers wishing {{to be out in the}} open air. The boat will usually have a diving air compressor, oxygen first aid, a VHF radio, a GPS and possibly gas blending facilities. A day boat would generally be used to transport divers to multiple dive-sites (typically between one and three sites) during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them.|$|E

2500|$|The Low German house first emerged {{towards the}} end of the Middle Ages. Only a few years ago a Hallehuis was {{discovered}} in the Dutch province of Drenthe, the frame of which can be dated to 1386. In 2012 a [...] "hallehuis" [...] was discovered in Best, in the Dutch provincie of North Brabant, which dates back to 1262 and is still in use as a stable. The living part of the farm itself is built in recent times, in 1640 at the earliest, but probably around 1680. The farm is an official monument. The oldest surviving houses of this type in Germany date to the late 15th century (e.g. in Schwinde, Winsen Elbe Marsh 1494/95). Regional differences arose due to the need to adapt to local farming and climatic conditions. [...] The design also changed over time and was appropriate to its owner's social class. From the outset, and for a long time thereafter, people and animals were accommodated in different areas within a large room. Gradually the living quarters were separated from the working area and animals. The first improvements were separate sleeping quarters for the farmer and his family at the rear of the farmhouse. <b>Sleeping</b> <b>accommodation</b> for farmhands and maids was created above (in Westphalia) or next to (in Lower Saxony and Holstein) the livestock stalls at the sides. Finished linen, destined for sale, was also stored in a special room. As the demand for comfort and status increased, one or more rooms would be heated. Finally the stove was moved into an enclosed kitchen rather than being in a Flett or open hearth at the end of the hall.|$|E
