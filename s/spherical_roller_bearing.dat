50|$|CARB {{bearings}} are toroidal {{roller bearings}} and similar to spherical roller bearings, but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearings</b> use {{asymmetrical}} <b>rollers</b> of <b>spherical</b> shape, rolling {{inside a}} house washer with a raceway with spherical inner shape. They can accommodate combined radial and axial loads and also accommodate misalignment of the shafts. They {{are often used}} together with radial <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearings</b> offer the highest load rating density of all thrust bearings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> have {{an outer}} ring with an {{internal}} <b>spherical</b> shape. The <b>rollers</b> are thicker {{in the middle}} and thinner at the ends. <b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> can thus accommodate both static and dynamic misalignment. However, <b>spherical</b> <b>rollers</b> are difficult to produce and thus expensive, and the bearings have higher friction than an ideal cylindrical or tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> since there will be a certain amount of sliding between rolling elements and rings.|$|R

50|$|The <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> {{was invented}} by {{engineer}} Arvid Palmgren and was introduced on the market 1919 by SKF. The design of the bearing that Arvid Palmgren invented {{is similar to the}} design that is still in use in modern machines.|$|E
50|$|Common roller {{bearings}} use cylinders of slightly greater length than diameter. Roller bearings typically have higher radial load capacity than ball bearings, but a lower capacity and higher friction under axial loads. If {{the inner and}} outer races are misaligned, the bearing capacity often drops quickly compared to either a ball bearing or a <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> is a {{rolling-element bearing}} that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore {{of the inner}} ring that may be misaligned in respect to the outer ring. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape {{of the outer ring}} and spherical rollers.Despite what their name may imply, spherical roller bearings are not truly spherical in shape. The rolling elements of spherical roller bearings are mainly cylindrical in shape, but have a profile that makes them appear like cylinders that have been slightly over-inflated.|$|E

40|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> have {{typically}} {{been used in}} applications with speeds limited to about 5000 rpm and loads limited for operation at less than about 0. 25 million DN. However, <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are now being designed for high load and high speed applications including aerospace applications. A computer program, SASHBEAN, was developed to provide an analytical tool to design, analyze, and predict the performance of high speed, single row, angular contact (including zero contact angle), <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> The material presented is the mathematical formulation and analytical methods used to develop computer program SASHBEAN. For a given set of operating conditions, the program calculates the bearings ring deflections (axial and radial), roller deflections, contact areas stresses, depth and magnitude of maximum shear stresses, axial thrust, rolling element and cage rotational speeds, lubrication parameters, fatigue lives, and rates of heat generation. Centrifugal forces and gyroscopic moments are fully considered. The program is also capable of performing steady-state and time-transient thermal analyses of the bearing system...|$|R
50|$|Self-aligning ball bearings, {{such as the}} Wingquist bearing {{shown in}} the picture, are {{constructed}} with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway. This construction allows the bearing to tolerate a small angular misalignment resulting from shaft or housing deflections or improper mounting. The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories.One drawback of the self-aligning ball bearings is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius). This led to {{the invention of the}} <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> which has a similar design, but use rollers instead of balls. Also the spherical roller thrust bearing is an invention that derives from the findings by Wingquist.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Combat" [...] {{engine was}} {{released}} in January 1972, with a twin roller bearing crank, 10:1 compression and developing [...] at 6,500 rpm. Reliability immediately suffered, with frequent and early crank-shaft main-bearing failures, sometimes leading to broken crankshafts. Older engines had used one ball-bearing main bearing and one roller bearing main bearing but the Combat engine featured two roller bearings in a mistaken belief this would strengthen the bottom-end {{to cope with the}} higher power-output. Instead the resultant crank-bending caused the rollers to [...] "dig-in" [...] to the races, causing rapid failure. This fragility was particularly obvious when measured against the reliability of contemporary Japanese machines. This problem was solved by specifying a heavier duty type of <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> of 'superblend' fame, later in the 1972 production year.|$|E

40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} {{are essential}} components of rotating machinery. The <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> (SRB) is one variant seeing increasing use, {{because it is}} self-aligning and can support high loads. It is becoming increasingly important {{to understand how the}} SRB responds dynamically under a variety of conditions. This doctoral dissertation introduces a computationally efficient, three-degree-of-freedom, SRB model that was developed to predict the transient dynamic behaviors of a rotor-SRB system. In the model, bearing forces and deflections were calculated as a function of contact deformation and bearing geometry parameters according to nonlinear Hertzian contact theory. The results reveal how some of the more important parameters; such as diametral clearance, the number of rollers, and osculation number; influence ultimate bearing performance. Distributed defects, such as the waviness of the inner and outer ring, and localized defects, such as inner and outer ring defects, are taken into consideration in the proposed model. Simulation results were verified with results obtained by applying the formula for the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> radial deflection and the commercial bearing analysis software. Following model verification, a numerical simulation was carried out successfully for a full rotor-bearing system to demonstrate the application of this newly developed SRB model in a typical real world analysis. Accuracy of the model was verified by comparing measured to predicted behaviors for equivalent systems...|$|E

Specifically, a tester was designed to accurately reproduce semiconductor contactor operating environments while measuring contact resistance in-situ, thereby effecting the study of operating temperature, test current, cleaning method, and cleaning interval on contactor life. To manipulate the continuous media while preserving exact constraint, novel web handling machine elements were devised. Universal joints and beam type flexible couplings were employed for gimballing and castering axes, both at standard caster radii and at roller center. A kinematic edge constraint was designed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{condition}} monitoring and failure diagnostics of <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> on adapter sleeve running in high technology Chemical industry machines. Two {{methods have been}} used: low frequency mechanical vibration (up to 1000 Hz) and high frequency mechanical vibration (up to 16000 Hz) monitoring method and a shock pulse method (SPM, frequency 32000 Hz). Machines have been tested in at free run and fully loaded. Results have been applied to in-crease reliability of diagnostic methods in a case when radial clearances inside a bearing are too small {{and there is no}} enough lubricant oil supply to bearings. Radial clearances and relative vibra-tion displacements of rotor shafts have been measured using proximity probes. The low frequency vibration excitation method is not efficient enough in failure diagnostics of bearings in comparison to high frequency and shock pulse methods.
