5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory was not <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money {{in one of two}} outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E

25|$|As a result, SSB {{transmissions}} use {{the available}} amplifier energy more efficiently, providing longer-range transmission {{with little or}} no additional cost. Receivers normally select one of the two sidebands to amplify anyway, so implementing SSB in the receiver is <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of allowing it to choose which sideband to amplify on reception, rather than simply choosing one or the other in the design stage.|$|E
25|$|Every {{mission was}} {{conducted}} either to congratulate a new shogun on his succession or {{in connection with}} the accession of a new king of Ryūkyū. In the latter case, approval and formal recognition of the new king would be formally requested of both the Shimazu clan lords of Satsuma and of the shogunate, but the request was essentially <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of ritual, and none were ever denied.|$|E
25|$|Unit {{conversion}} for temperature {{differences is}} <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of multiplying by, e.g., 1°F / 1 K (although the ratio {{is not a}} constant value). But because some of these scales have origins that do not correspond to absolute zero, conversion from one temperature scale to another requires accounting for that. As a result, simple dimensional analysis can lead to errors if it is ambiguous whether 1 K means the absolute temperature equal to −273.15°C, or the temperature difference equal to 1°C.|$|E

There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures - different civilizations, if you like - that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era.|$|R
25|$|Most often, a {{character}} {{will be used}} for both sound and meaning, and it is <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of choosing the correct reading based on which word it represents. In other cases, {{a character}} is used only for sound (ateji). In this case, pronunciation is still based on a standard reading, or used only for meaning (broadly a form of ateji, narrowly jukujikun). Therefore, only the full compound—not the individual character—has a reading. There are also special cases where the reading is completely different, often based on an historical or traditional reading.|$|E
25|$|Mystical {{experience}} is not <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> between the mystic and God, but is often shaped by cultural issues. For instance, Caroline Bynum has shown how, in the late Middle Ages, miracles attending the taking of the Eucharist were not simply symbolic of the Passion story, but served as vindication of the mystic's theological orthodoxy by proving that the mystic had not fallen prey to heretical ideas, such as the Cathar rejection of the material world as evil, contrary to orthodox teaching that God took on human flesh and remained sinless. Thus, the nature of mystical experience could be tailored to the particular cultural and theological issues of the time.|$|E
25|$|However, {{some species}} of Drosophila are {{difficult}} to culture in the laboratory, often because they breed on a single specific host in the wild. For some, {{it can be done}} with particular recipes for rearing media, or by introducing chemicals such as sterols that are found in the natural host; for others, it is (so far) impossible. In some cases, the larvae can develop on normal Drosophila lab medium, but the female will not lay eggs; for these it is often <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of putting in a small piece of the natural host to receive the eggs. The , located at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, maintains cultures of hundreds of species for researchers.|$|E
50|$|In many partner dances (e.g., ballroom dance) {{the male}} dancer {{typically}} assumes {{the role of}} lead and provides guidance to his typically female partner, the follower.

25|$|The items used in {{decoration}} {{may also}} have been darker and heavier than those used today, <b>simply</b> as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of practicality. London was noisy and its air was full of soot from countless coal fires. Hence those who could afford it draped their windows in heavy, sound-muffling curtains, and chose colours that didn't show soot quickly. When all washing was done by hand, curtains were not washed as frequently as they might be today.|$|R

25|$|Yet law was not <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of {{codes and}} procedures. Law was {{understood}} {{to reflect the}} moral universe, and a criminal or civil offense would throw that universe out of balance {{in a way that}} only just punishment could restore. The official Five Punishments (wu xing) prescribed under the Qing Code included beating with the light bamboo, beating with the heavy bamboo, penal servitude, exile, and execution. In calibrating punishment, the magistrate had to take into account not only the nature of the offense but the relation between the guilty party and the victim. An offense by a son against a father was far more serious than one by a father against a son, likewise an offense by a wife or other member of the family.|$|E
25|$|Slătineanu {{was still}} part of the {{university}} senate in 1928-1929 and in 1933. He also became head of the Iași hygiene institute in 1930, {{and set up a}} tuberculosis sanatorium in nearby Erbiceni. He served as general secretary under Health Minister Cantacuzino, between 1931 and 1933. He wrote articles arguing that the high mortality rate in Romania's rural areas was not <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of health, but had to do with lack of education, poverty, malnutrition, with political and administrative causes. Still a socialist, Slătineanu believed the 1923 land reform entrenched a form of neo-serfdom that did not address other issues plaguing the peasantry. He organized a model health system in Tomești plasă where he introduced various methods of health education. One of these consisted of a garden where the local peasants would learn how to cultivate vegetables with a rational system of nutrition in mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} of Lower Germany, A. Vitellius, was soon proclaimed emperor by his troops, and in Rome, the Praetorian Guard proclaimed M. Salvius Otho emperor. In January 69, Galba was assassinated, {{and the senate}} proclaimed Otho emperor. Otho took an army to Germany to defeat Vitellius, but was himself defeated by Vitellius. He committed suicide, and Vitellius was proclaimed emperor by the senate. Another general, Vespasian, soon defeated Vitellius. Vitellius was executed, and Vespasian was named Augustus, elected Consul, and given Tribunician powers. The result of these events illustrated a key weakness in Augustus' constitution. The method of succession was in part based on heredity, and if a dead emperor's next-of-kin {{had the support of}} the Praetorian Guard, then his installation as emperor was reasonably assured. However, with Nero's death, the Julian line had been extinguished. Thus, the events of 69 showed that the armies in the provinces were the ultimate 'electoral bodies', and that any successful general could legitimately claim a right to the throne. It also became apparent that, while the senate might acquiesce to the installation of a new emperor, such acquiescence was <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of form. This flaw would contribute to the ultimate fall of the Roman Empire.|$|E

Each town has seven basic creatures, each {{of which can be}} upgraded to a more powerful variant. Each town also features two associated hero types: one that leans more toward might (combat), and one that leans more toward magic. Some towns have a predisposition toward might or magic, and the leanings of the hero classes may <b>simply</b> be <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of degrees.|$|R

500|$|Wanting to do {{more than}} just {{represent}} life and death as an opposition, and instead to show the way in which each is inevitably and profoundly involved with the other, Kiarostami has devised a cinema that does more than just present the viewer with the documentable [...] "facts," [...] but neither is it <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of artifice. Because [...] "existence" [...] means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly fictive element, but in this [...] "being more than" [...] life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving an interpretation of Kiarostami's statement that lying is the only way to truth.|$|E
500|$|During {{the era of}} the kingdom, the Roman King {{appointed}} new senators, {{but after}} the overthrow of the kingdom, the Consuls acquired this power. Around the middle of the 4th century BC, however, the Plebeian Council enacted the [...] "Ovinian Plebiscite" [...] (plebiscitum Ovinium), which gave the power to appoint new senators to the Roman Censors. It also codified a commonplace practice, which all but required the Censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate. By this point, Plebeians were already holding a significant number of magisterial offices, and so the number of Plebeian senators probably increased quickly. It was, in all likelihood, <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before the Plebeians came to dominate the senate.|$|E
500|$|After [...] is measured, the {{distinction}} between redshift and blueshift is <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of whether [...] is positive or negative. See the formula section below for some basic interpretations that follow when either a redshift or blueshift is observed. For example, Doppler effect blueshifts (...) are associated with objects approaching (moving closer to) the observer with the light shifting to greater energies. Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts (...) are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Likewise, gravitational blueshifts are associated with light emitted from a source residing within a weaker gravitational field as observed from within a stronger gravitational field, while gravitational redshifting implies the opposite conditions.|$|E

500|$|Achebe's novels {{approach}} {{a variety of}} themes. In his early writing, a depiction of the Igbo culture itself is paramount. Critic Nahem Yousaf {{highlights the importance of}} these depictions: [...] "Around the tragic stories of Okonkwo and Ezeulu, Achebe sets about textualising Igbo cultural identity". The portrayal of indigenous life is not <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of literary background, he adds: [...] "Achebe seeks to produce the effect of a precolonial reality as an Igbo-centric response to a Eurocentrically constructed imperial 'reality'". Certain elements of Achebe's depiction of Igbo life in Things Fall Apart match those in Olaudah Equiano's autobiographical Narrative. Responding to charges that Equiano was not actually born in Africa, Achebe wrote in 1975: [...] "Equiano was an Igbo, I believe, from the village of Iseke in the Orlu division of Nigeria".|$|E
500|$|In Outliers, Gladwell {{interviews}} Gates, {{who says}} that unique access to a computer {{at a time when}} they were not commonplace helped him succeed. Without that access, Gladwell states that Gates would still be [...] "a highly intelligent, driven, charming person and a successful professional", but that he might not be worth US$50billion. Gladwell chooses his words carefully to never mention that Gates' mother was on the board of directors of IBM with access to the whole of IBM, and not just an ordinary daughter of wealthy businessmen as he says. Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 years. He also notes that he himself took exactly 10 years to meet the 10,000-Hour Rule, during his brief tenure at The American Spectator and his more recent job at The Washington Post.|$|E
500|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} {{ratification of the}} Fifteenth Amendment, both Stanton and Anthony increasingly took the position, first advocated by Victoria Woodhull, that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments actually did give women the right to vote. They argued that the Fourteenth Amendment, which defined citizens as [...] "all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," [...] included women and that the Fifteenth Amendment provided all citizens {{with the right to}} vote. Using this logic, they asserted that women now had the constitutional right to vote and that it was <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of claiming that right. This constitution-based argument, which came to be called [...] "the new departure" [...] in women's rights circles because of its divergence from earlier attempts to change voting laws on a state-by-state basis, led to first Anthony (in 1872), and later Stanton (in 1880), going to the polls and demanding to vote. Despite this, and similar attempts made by hundreds of other women, it would be nearly 50 years before women obtained the right to vote throughout the United States.|$|E
