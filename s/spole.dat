50|$|As a youth player Šteinbors was {{a member}} of the Skonto Riga youth academy. He was taken to the first team in 2001. Even though he stayed in the club until 2004, due to high {{competition}} for the first keeper's place alongside that time Latvian international Andrejs Piedels, Šteinbors was unable to get a place in the usual starting line-up. In January 2004 Pāvels joined another Latvian Higher League club FK Jūrmala, where he could finally settle down. Youngster showed some high-class performances and was regarded as one of the most talanted Latvian youngsters. In December 2007 Šteinbors went on trial with the Football League Championship side Blackpool, impressing the coaching staff. On 16 January 2008 the German 2. Bundesliga club Augsburg reported that Šteinbors was on trial with them in their training camp in Faro, Portugal. However, on 31 January 2008 Pāvels signed a loan deal with Blackpool until the end of the 2007-08 season with an option to extend it for another year. The loan was then extended and Šteinbors joined his countryman and current Latvian international Kaspars Gorkšs at Bloomfield Road. During his loan spell Šteinbors regularly played in the reserve team, but didn't make an appearance for the first team. After the end of the loan contract player returned to the Latvian Higher League, moving to FK Liepājas Metalurgs in 2009. During the 2009 and 2010 seasons he was the back-up keeper for the team behind experienced Viktors <b>Spole.</b> In 2011 Šteinbors finally claimed the first keeper's place, showing great performance and being included in the sportacents.com team of the season. All in all he played 53 league matches for Metalurgs. On 15 July 2012 Šteinbors moved to the South African Premier Soccer League club Golden Arrows for the 2012-13 season. He started the season as the club's first keeper, but lost his place in the line-up in midseason, with the team struggling to show good results. In July 2013 Šteinbors moved to the Polish Ekstraklasa, signing a two-year contract with Górnik Zabrze after a successful trial period. He made his debut for the club on 17 August 2013 in a Polish Cup match against GKS Bełchatów, playing 90 minutes and keeping a clean-sheet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} our recent {{progress}} in the generation of resonant behavior in unitarized meson-meson scattering amplitudes obtained from Chiral Perturbation Theory. These amplitudes provide simultaneously a remarkable description of the resonance region up to 1. 2 GeV {{as well as the}} low energy region, since they respect the chiral symmetry expansion. By studying the position of the poles in these amplitudes it is possible to determine the mass and width of the associated resonances, as well as to get a hint on possible classification schemes, that could be of interest for the spectroscopy of the scalar sector. THE LIGHT MESON PUZZLE In this work we review our recent progress in determining the position of the poles [1] that appear associated to resonant behavior in meson-meson scattering amplitudes, obtained from unitarized one-loop Chiral Perturbation Theory [2]. This apparently formal interest is motivated by the spectroscopy of light mesons, whose present status is somewhat controversial. Poles in the second Riemann sheet of partial wave scattering amplitudes are of relevance because when they are close to the real, physical values of the center of mass energy √ s, we can neglect all other terms in the partial wave and simply write RR t(s) = s − <b>spole</b> s −(Re √ <b>spole)</b> 2 −(Im √ <b>spole)</b> 2 − i 2 Re √ <b>spole</b> Im √ spol...|$|E
40|$|Recently, by reanalyzing {{the phase}} shift data of I = 0 ππ and of I = 1 / 2 Kπ scatterings, we showed the evidences for {{existence}} of light scalar mesons, σ(600) and κ(900), respectively, {{which had been}} sought but missing for a long time. The σ(600) and κ(900) together with the established resonances, a 0 (980) and f 0 (980), are shown to be consistently classified as {{the members of a}} single scalar σ-nonet, appearing in the SU(3) linear σ-model. Especially the mass value of the iso-singlet flavor-octet member satisfies, together with those of κ(900) and a 0 (980), the Gell-Mann Okubo mass formula. The repulsive background phase shift δBG, which was essential to lead the σ/κ-existence in our phase shift analyses, is also shown to be quantitatively describable in the framework of linear σ model. Thus, the origin of δBG is reduced to the “compensating λφ 4 -interaction, ” necessary from the viewpoint of chiral symmetry. 1 ππ/Kπ phase shift analyses and existence of σ(600) /κ(900) We have recently made reanalyses of ππ and Kπ phase shifts and found strong evidences for existence of I = 0 σ meson and I = 1 / 2 κ meson, respectively, which had been sought but missing for a long time. For detailed analyses, see ref. [1]. Through the analyses the masses and widths of σ and κ, and their pole positions are determined with the values (in MeV), mσ = 585 ± 20 (535 ∼ 675), Γσ = 385 ± 70, √ <b>spole</b> = 602 ± 26 − i(196 ± 27), mκ = 905 + 65 − 30, Γκ = 545 + 235 − 110, √ <b>spole</b> = 875 ± 75 − i(335 ± 110).

40|$|We {{show the}} results for the {{scattering}} poles associated to the ρ, f 0, a 0, K ∗, σ and κ resonances in meson-meson scattering. Our amplitudes are obtained from the complete one-loop meson-meson scattering amplitudes from Chiral Perturbation Theory. Once unitarized with the Inverse Amplitude Method, they describe remarkably well the data simultaneously in the low energy and resonance regions up to 1. 2 GeV, using low energy parameters compatible with present determinations. We report on our progress [1] on determining the poles that appear in the recent description [2] of meson-meson scattering by means of unitarized one-loop Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT). The interest of these poles is that, at least when they are close to the real axis, they are associated to Breit-Wigner resonances whose mass MR and width ΓR is related to the pole position as √ <b>spole</b> ≃ MR − ΓR/ 2. When they are not so close to the real axis, their interpretation is much less clear. Starting from one-loop Chiral Perturbation Theory [3] our unitarized amplitudes respect the spontaneous chiral symmetry pattern of QCD up to fourth order in the chira...|$|E

With {{regard to}} the novel I would like to {{conclude}} this analysis of David Lean's film pointing out that his A Passage to India as an adaptation is a personal interpretation of the literary work, and therefore is unable to correspond with other interpretations and to satisfy the expectation of all viewers familiar with the film. Looking for an explanation {{of what happened in}} the caves Lean decided it to be a hallucination of a haunted mind and had to restructure the preceding events of the plot and picture Adela as muddle-headed 'young girl fresh from England' coming to terms with her own repressed sexuality {{in order to be able}} to reach this conclusion. Some hold it against him that he falsified the protagonists and manipulated them in his own way to produce a more flattering picture of the British, however, I believe that most of the modifications he has undertaken were to serve the purpose of making a logically coherent story, not to express his own or current political attitudes. As in the case of all adaptations, the choice of actors, depiction of setting and focus on details as a part of interpretation must necessarily lead into certain modification.
