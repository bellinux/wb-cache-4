40|$|The {{plight of}} the marine {{fisheries}} is attracting increasing attention as unsustainably high exploitation levels, exacerbated by more extreme climatic conditions, are driving stocks {{to the point of}} collapse. The North Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a species which until recently formed a major component of the demersal fisheries, has undergone significant declines across its range. The North Sea stock is typical of many, with a spawning stock biomass that has remained below the <b>safe</b> <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> since 2000 and recruitment levels near the lowest on record. Cod within the North Sea are currently managed as a single stock, and yet mounting empirical evidence supports the existence of a metapopulation of regionally variable, genetically distinct, sub-stocks. Applying the same management strategies to multiple stocks that differ in their resilience to exploitation inevitably results in the overfishing and likely collapse of the weaker components. Indeed, recent studies have identified two North Sea spawning stocks that have undergone disproportionally large collapses with very substantial reductions in egg production. Similarly affected cod stocks in the northwest Atlantic have shown little evidence of recovery, despite fishery closures. The possible implications of ignoring sub-structuring within management units for biocomplexity, local adaptation and ecosystem stability are considered...|$|R

40|$|For 17 {{stocks in}} the North Sea. the {{performance}} and effectiveness of management advice using precautionary reference points was evaluated. Three criteria were used to identify whether a stock was within safe biological limits: SSB F-pa, or SSB F-pa. Four scenarios were considered, comparing the advice in the assessment year with what is retrospectively (2002 assessment) known to be {{the status of the}} stock at that time: (1) stock outside <b>safe</b> <b>biological</b> <b>limits,</b> advice to reduce fishing: (2) stock outside <b>safe</b> <b>biological</b> <b>limits,</b> advice for status quo harvesting: (3) stock within <b>safe</b> <b>biological</b> <b>limits,</b> advice to reduce fishing: and (4) stock within <b>safe</b> <b>biological</b> <b>limits,</b> advice for status quo (or increased) harvesting. Signal Detection Theory was applied to these scenarios, and the proportion of Hits (1 and 4), Misses (2), and False Alarms (3) were determined for each year as the proportion of the stocks for which the respective scenarios applied. Using both B-pa and F-pa was deemed the approach with the lowest error rate, and it resulted in about the same proportion of Hits in management advice as when B-pa alone was used (62 %), but the proportion of Misses was slightly lower (24 % vs. 26 %). Therefore, the suggested EcoQ element would be the proportion of commercial fish stocks within <b>safe</b> <b>biological</b> <b>limits</b> (i. e. SSB > B-pa, F 60 %. A possible explanation is that most of these stocks (e. g. flatfish and roundfish) are caught in a mixed fishery, for which TAC management is less effective.

40|$|Dissertação de mest., Aquacultura e Pescas, Faculdade de Ciências do Mar e Ambiente, Universidade do Algarve, 2009 Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) {{is mainly}} caught off the South and Southwest coasts of Portugal, using two {{different}} types of gear, bottom trawling and creels. Trawling is the traditional fishing method, where Nephrops can be either a target species or by-catch of shrimp trawling. Creels are only used in areas unavailable to trawlers, either due to legislative restrictions on access or to unsuitable seabed. Creels have Nephrops as the only target species, but the fleet uses other gears to target other species. During the lasts decades, the modernisation of the trawling fleet with the resulting technological improvements, has lead to an increase in fishing effort. Nowadays, the two populations on the South and SW coast are considered outside <b>biological</b> <b>safe</b> <b>limits,</b> and a recovery plan is underway. Two typical vessels, in each fleet (trawling and creels), were selected to collect biological and economic data. Results show that the size composition of the catches is very different for the two gears used. Trawl catches are composed of small individuals usually in bad condition, while creel catches are composed of large and alive individuals (very high commercial value). It is assumed that the size composition obtained with creels results from the selectivity of the creel and the fact that these populations are exploited at much lower fishing levels. An assessment was made of the lobster fishery in order to evaluate its economic potencial. Results suggest that creels should be the only gear used, as it represents a very selective gear that could help the recovery of Nephrops stocks and allows a good economic return for the vessels involved. Thus, transference of fishing effort from trawling to creels is recommended...|$|R

In general, under deterministic analyses, management strategies are recommended that improve those matrix transitions that are most sensitive or elastic {{with respect to the}} asymptotic population growth rate, λ. These recommendations usually ignore the <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> for these transitions. In this paper we use the endangered Serengeti cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) as a case study to illustrate that ignoring <b>biological</b> <b>limits</b> leads to a recommendation that will not always achieve the desired goal of an asymptotic population growth rate, λ ≥ 1. We estimate the survivorships of adult cheetahs in captivity using cheetah studbook data, which is a conservative estimate of the <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> for the adult survivorship of wild cheetahs. Our analysis suggests that adult survival sharply decreases after 8. 5 years. In addition, captive cheetahs older than 18 years do not reproduce. We modify a previously published population projection matrix to include the effect of senescence on survival and fecundity. Our model suggests that increasing adult survivorship alone is not sufficient to reverse population decline. However, an additional small increase in newborn survival is likely to result in a viable cheetah population. We show these conclusions hold even in the presence of relatively large parameter perturbations...|$|R

30|$|Freshwater eels are {{important}} animals {{because they have}} a unique catadromous life history and are used as food resources. European, American and Japanese eel populations now are considered to be outside the <b>safe</b> <b>biological</b> <b>limits</b> and are seriously threatened with extinction. Therefore, the European eel was recently categorised as critically endangered by the European Union and the United Nations. One {{of the reasons for the}} drastic decline in eel populations is overfishing, which has caused a high demand for eel aquaculture; eel aquaculture completely depends on wild juveniles, and in contrast to animals, artificial propagation has not yet succeeded for the eels. Therefore, commercial eel industries are now considering tropical eels as possible replacement for European and Japanese eels to compensate for declining stocks. In this study, I attempt to examine the present status of the biology and stock of tropical eels. However, useful scientific research and information on the biology and stock assessments of tropical eels are lacking, a situation quite different from that for other temperate freshwater eels, which have been well studied for several decades with trends and recruitment patterns being on record. Nevertheless, the present tropical eel catch has been reported as being less than half that of 20  years ago. The present trends in eel stocks and utilization for human consumption suggest that all eel populations will decline to numbers that fall outside <b>safe</b> <b>biological</b> <b>limits</b> and will be seriously threatened with extinction without protection and conservation from strict enforcement of local and international laws.|$|E

As for (i), in 45 % of the examined stocks, the official value for SSBpa was below the consensus estimates determined from three different methods. With respect to (ii), the official estimates of Fmsy exceeded natural mortality M in 76 % of the stocks, although M {{is widely regarded as}} natural upper limit for Fmsy. And regarding (iii), the age at first capture was below the age at maturity in 74 % of the stocks. No official estimates of the stock size (SSBmsy) that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) are available for the north-east Atlantic. An analysis of stocks from other areas confirmed that twice SSBpa provides a reasonable preliminary estimate. Comparing stock sizes in 2013 against this proxy showed that 88 % were below the level that can produce MSY. Also, 52 % of the stocks were outside of <b>safe</b> <b>biological</b> <b>limits,</b> and 12 % were severely depleted.
