The page of history becomes a long crescendo of battle. The main body of the British-Indian air-fleet perished upon a pyre of blazing antagonists in Burmah; the Germans were scattered in the great battle of the Carpathians; the vast peninsula of India burst into insurrection and civil war from end to end, and from Gobi to Morocco rose the standards of the [...] "Jehad."

Under the stresses of the war their endurance reached the breaking point, the whole of China rose in incoherent revolt, and the practical destruction of the central government at Pekin by a handful of British and German airships that had escaped from the main battles rendered that revolt invincible. In Yokohama appeared barricades, the black flag and the social revolution. With that the whole world became a welter of conflict.|$|R

In 1962, the Congo District was divided in the Zaire and Uige districts and that of Bié-Cuando-Cubando in the Bié and Cuando-Cubango districts. In 1970, the Cunene District was also created by {{the separation of the}} southern part of the Huíla District. Each was headed by a district governor, assisted by a district board. Following the Portuguese model of local government, the districts were made of municipalities (concelhos) and these were subdivided in civil parishes (freguesias), each administered by local council (respectively câmara municipal and junta de freguesia). In the regions where the necessary social and economical development had not yet been achieved, the municipalities and civil parishes were transitorily replaced, respectively, by administrative circles (circunscrições) and posts (postos), each of these governed by an official appointed by the Government, who had wide administrative powers, performing local government, <b>police,</b> <b>sanitary,</b> economical, tributary and even judicial roles. The circle administrators and the chiefs of administrative posts directed the local native auxiliary police officers known as [...] "sepoys" [...] (cipaios). In these regions, the traditional authorities - including native kings, rulers and tribal chiefs - were kept and integrated in the administrative system, serving as intermediaries between the provincial authorities and the local native populations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{south bank}} of the Irk is here very steep and between fifteen and thirty feet high. On this declivitous {{hillside}} there are planted three rows of houses, of which the lowest rise directly out of the river, while the front walls of the highest stand {{on the crest of}} the hill in Long Millgate. Among them are mills on the river, in short, the method of construction is as crowded and disorderly here as in the lower part of Long Millgate. Right and left a multitude of covered passages lead from the main street into numerous courts, and he who turns in thither gets into a filth and disgusting grime, the equal of which is not to be found - especially in the courts which lead down to the Irk, and which contain unqualifiedly the most horrible dwellings which I have yet beheld. In one of these courts there stands directly at the entrance, at the end of the covered passage, a privy without a door, so dirty that the inhabitants can pass into and out of the court only by passing through foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement. This is the first court on the Irk above Ducie Bridge - in case any one should care to look into it. Below it on the river there are several tanneries which fill the whole neighbourhood with the stench of animal putrefaction. Below Ducie Bridge the only entrance to most of the houses is by means of narrow, dirty stairs and over heaps of refuse and filth. The first court below Ducie Bridge, known as Allen's Court, was in such a state at the time of the cholera that the <b>sanitary</b> <b>police</b> ordered it evacuated, swept and disinfected with chloride of lime. Dr. Kay gives a terrible description of the state of this court at that time. Since then, it seems to have been partially torn away and rebuilt; at least looking down from Ducie Bridge, the passer-by sees several ruined walls and heaps of debris with some newer houses. The view from this bridge, mercifully concealed from mortals of small stature by a parapet as high as a man, is characteristic for the whole district. At the bottom flows, or rather stagnates, the Irk, a narrow, coal-black, foul-smelling stream, full of debris and refuse, which it deposits on the shallower right bank. The river has since been culverted as it reaches the city centre. It disappears beneath Manchester Victoria railway station into a brick tunnel at Ducie Bridge and empties into the Irwell beneath a railway viaduct.|$|E

40|$|A auto-hemoterapia é uma prática de uso clínico crescente, mas com potencial risco à saúde dos indivíduos, uma vez que se trata de procedimento terapêutico sem comprovação científica. Até o momento não existem estudos clínicos que comprovem a eficácia e a segurança deste procedimento; apenas pesquisas experimentais com resultados questionáveis, tanto em seres humanos quanto em animais. Nos últimos anos, a área de Vigilância Sanitária (VS) do Ministério da Saúde ampliou suas ações preventivas e de controle de riscos tanto no âmbito privado como coletivo. As ações da VS têm, muitas vezes, como base o poder legal de polícia administrativa que a legislação lhe confere. Esse poder é entendido como a faculdade que dispõe a Administração Pública para condicionar e restringir o uso e gozo de bens, atividades e direitos individuais, em benefício da coletividade ou do próprio Estado. Recentemente, o Estado, por meio do poder de polícia da VS, interveio na prática da auto-hemoterapia no Brasil. O presente estudo analisa e defende a ação interventiva da VS na prática clínica da auto-hemoterapia no país, tendo como base de sustentação argumentativa os "Quatro Pês" desenvolvidos pela chamada "Bioética de Intervenção" - prevenção, proteção, precaução e prudência. The {{increasingly}} frequent {{practice of}} autohemotherapy entails a potential {{risk to the}} health of individuals since it is scientifically unproven. There are practically no clinical studies showing the efficacy and safety of this procedure; only experimental research with questionable results from studies on human beings and animals. Over the last years, the sanitary surveillance area has expanded its preventive and risk control actions based upon a precautionary philosophy in the private as well as the public sphere. By observing the theoretical and practical reference points of the "four Ps" (prevention, protection, precaution and prudence), in accordance with the epistemology developed within Intervention Bioethics, sanitary surveillance actions are based upon legal administrative policing powers. These powers are understood to be the Public Administration's competence to set conditions on and restrict the use and benefit of goods, activities and individual rights, on behalf of the common well being of people or the State itself. The Brazilian State, through its <b>sanitary</b> surveillance <b>policing</b> powers at the three levels of government, has intervened in the practice of autohemotherapy. Considering the responsible State intervention in situations of collective interest, vulnerability and susceptibility, the present study proposed to analyze the practice of autohemotherapy in the light of sanitary surveillance actions and their relationship with the "four Ps" of Intervention Bioethics...|$|R
