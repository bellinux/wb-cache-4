5|$|Cold <b>shock</b> <b>response</b> is the {{physiological}} response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
40|$|Key pecking of pigeons under a fixed-ratio 100, grain {{reinforcer}} {{schedule was}} followed by electric shock occurring once in each sequence of 100 <b>responses</b> with the <b>shocked</b> <b>response</b> varying irregularly in successive sequences.

40|$|Sch B (schisandrin B), {{the most}} {{abundant}} dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan in Fructus schisandrae, can induce glutathione antioxidant and heat <b>shock</b> <b>responses,</b> as well as protect against oxidant-induced injury in various tissues, including the liver in rodents and AML 12 (alpha mouse liver 12) hepatocytes. (-) Sch B is the most potent stereoisomer of Sch B in its cytoprotective action on AML 12 hepatocytes. To define the role of ROS (reactive oxygen species) arising from CYP (cytochrome P 450) -catalysed metabolism of (-) Sch B in triggering glutathione antioxidant and heat <b>shock</b> <b>responses,</b> {{the effects of a}} CYP inhibitor [ABT (aminobenzotriazole) ] and antioxidants [DMTU (dimethylthiouracil) and TAX (trolox) ] on (-) Sch B-induced ROS production and associated increases in cellular GSH level, as well as Hsp 25 / 70 (heat-shock protein 25 / 70) production, were investigated in AML 12 hepatocytes. The results indicated that () Sch B causes a dose dependent and sustained increase in ROS production over 6 h in AML 12 hepatocytes, which was completely suppressed by pre-/co-treatment with ABT or DTMU/TRX. Incubation with (-) Sch B for 6 h caused optimal and dose-dependent increases in cellular GSH level and Hsp 25 / 70 production at 16 h post-drug exposure in AML 12 hepatocytes. These cellular responses were associated with protection against menadione-induced apoptosis. Pre-/co-treatment with ABT or antioxidants completely abrogated the (-) Sch B-induced glutathione antioxidant and heat <b>shock</b> <b>responses,</b> as well as protection against menadione-induced apoptosis. Experimental evidence obtained thus far supports the causal role of ROS arising from the CYP-catalysed metabolism of (-) Sch B in eliciting glutathione antioxidant and heat <b>shock</b> <b>responses</b> in AML 12 hepatocytes...|$|R

5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation.

Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental <b>shock</b> <b>response</b> {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells.

25|$|More {{prolonged}} moderate heating to temperatures just a {{few degrees}} above normal (39.5°C) can cause more subtle changes. A mild heat treatment combined with other stresses can cause cell death by apoptosis. There are many biochemical consequences to the heat <b>shock</b> <b>response</b> within the cell, including slowed cell division and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation therapy. The purpose of overheating the tumor cells {{is to create a}} lack of oxygen so that the heated cells become overacidified, which leads to a lack of nutrients in the tumor. This in turn disrupts the metabolism of the cells so that cell death (apoptosis) can set in. In certain cases chemotherapy or radiation that has previously not had any effect can be made effective. Hyperthermia alters the cell walls by means of so-called heat shock proteins. The cancer cells then react very much more effectively to the cytostatics and radiation. If hyperthermia is used conscientiously it has no serious side effects.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of labor taxation in determining the sensitivity of an economy to macroeconomic shocks. We construct a New Keynesian business cycle model with matching frictions of the labor market, where sluggish employment adjustment implies a key role for labor markets in determining shock propagation. We consider three policy instruments to analyze the steady state and dynamic effects of tax reforms: the marginal tax rate and replacement ratio amplify <b>shock</b> <b>responses</b> whereas employment subsidies weaken them. The tax instruments affect {{the degree to which}} the wage absorbs shocks. We show that the relative effects of the tax instruments and thus the effects of tax progression are sensitive to the initial degree of tax progression in the economy. Increasing tax progression when taxation is initially progressive is harmful for steady state employment and output, and amplifies the sesitivity of macroeconomic variables to shocks. When taxation is initially proportional, increasing progression is beneficial for output and employment and dampens <b>shock</b> <b>responses</b> of macroeconomic variablesMatching, Income taxation, Wage, Business cycles...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunofluorescence}} {{patterns for}} actin, myosin, calmodulin and tubulin {{were observed in}} Euglena gracilis Klebs strain Z during the biological clock-controlled shape changes observed with division-synchronized cells, and during two <b>shock</b> <b>responses</b> that induce cell rounding. The fluorescence patterns for actin, myosin, calmodulin and tubulin show {{a high degree of}} coincidence and are visualized as lines running parallel to, and having the same spacing as, the pellicle strips beneath the plasma membrane. The fluorescence patterns remain intact during the daily shape changes, implying that the shape changes do not result from cycles of polymerization and depolymerization of the microtubules and microfilamenta. Resuspension of cells in Ca 2 +-free medium induces cell rounding of many of the cells. The actin and calmodulin patterns are partially disrupted by the Ca 2 +-free resuspension, while the myosin pattern is almost totally disrupted. Microtubules are unaffected by this treatment. Prior exposure of cells to the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine or to the microfilament-stabilizing peptide phalloidin stabilize the actin, myosin and calmodulin patterns against disruption by the Ca-free resuspension and other <b>shock</b> <b>responses.</b> The possibility of an actomyosin contractile system controlled by calmodulin is discussed...|$|R
