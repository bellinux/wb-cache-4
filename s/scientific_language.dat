25|$|Magical language, {{according}} to C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards's (1923) categories of speech, {{is distinct from}} <b>scientific</b> <b>language</b> because it is emotive and it converts words into symbols for emotions. On the other hand, in <b>scientific</b> <b>language,</b> words are tied to specific meanings and refer to an objective external reality. Magical language is therefore particularly adept at constructing metaphors that establish symbols and link magical rituals to the world.|$|E

The common clear message from these comparisons is that chemical intuition may pave the way for mathematical concepts just as chemical concepts may gain from mathematical precising. Along this line, significant improvements in chemical research and engineering have already been possible – and can be further expected in the future from the dialogue between the two <b>scientific</b> <b>languages...</b>|$|R

40|$|According to the {{accepted}} translation-failure interpretation, {{the problem of}} incommensurability involves {{the nature of the}} meaning-referential relation between <b>scientific</b> <b>languages.</b> The incommensurability thesis is that some competing <b>scientific</b> <b>languages</b> are mutually untranslatable due to the radical variance of meaning or/and reference of the terms they employ. I argue that this interpretation faces many difficulties and cannot give us a tenable, coherent, and integrated notion of incommensurability. It has to be rejected. ^ On the basis of two case studies, I find that the confrontations between many classical incommensurable languages are not confrontations between two untranslatable languages with different distribution of truth values, but rather the confrontations between incompatible fundamental presuppositions at the ontological level. We can always identify a truth-value gap between two incommensurable languages. Such a truth-value gap indicates a communication breakdown between the two language communities on the one hand, and is caused by the incompatible fundamental presuppositions underlying them on the other. ^ I thereby identify the truth-value functional relationship between sentences, instead of the meaning-referential relationship between terms, as the dominant semantic relation between two incommensurable languages. According to my presuppositional interpretation of incommensurability, the real secret of incommensurability lies in the ontological setup of two competing presuppositional languages. When two presuppositional languages with incompatible factual commitments encounter with each other, the confrontation leads to a truth-value gap, and consequently a communication breakdown between them. Formally put, two <b>scientific</b> <b>languages</b> are incommensurable when core sentences of one language, which have truth values when considered within its own context, lack truth values when considered {{within the context of the}} other due to an ontological gap between them. ^ The presuppositional interpretation makes many significant contributions to the discussion of the issue of incommensurability and the related metaphysical and epistemological issues: (a) It confirms the existence of the phenomenon of incommensurability and makes it metaphysically and epistemologically significant. (b) It establishes the tenability and integrity of the notion of incommensurability. (c) It avoids many alleged unattractive epistemological and metaphysical consequences of the translation-failure interpretation. ...|$|R

25|$|Up to this point, the Emu {{had been}} the only serial {{publication}} produced by the RAOU for all members, and was by far the biggest financial cost to the organisation. For a majority of members the receipt of the journal was the only direct contact they had with the RAOU. Yet the content of Emu was being assailed from both the 'scientists' who wanted more rigour and less in-house material, and from the 'amateurs' who disliked the <b>scientific</b> <b>language</b> of many papers. The long-term solution would be to cater separately for both groups. The start of this process came with the decision by the RAOU Council in 1968 to allow for a type of membership without a subscription to Emu. The next step was when Jack Hyett resigned as editor of Emu in 1968, the ACT Branch nominated Stephen Marchant for the editorship, and he was elected unopposed. Marchant was editor for the next twelve years and he transformed Emu into the lean and rigorous journal the 'scientists' wanted.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{the wide}} {{understanding}} of culture brought about by cultural anthropology, archeology and biology, Mosterín has developed a new philosophical understanding of what culture is, where it is localized and how it evolves in time. Human nature is information, and so is human culture, but both are distinguished by their different means of transmission: whereas nature is transmitted genetically and is encoded in the genome, culture is transmitted through social learning and is encoded in the brain. Only individuals have a brain, and only they have a culture. Talk of collective cultures has {{to be understood as}} a statistical artifact for talking about a plurality of individual cultures. The set of elementary chunks of culture (variously known as memes, cultural variants or cultural traits) codified as neuronal circuits in the long term memory of the individual make up that individual’s culture. Corresponding to the different uses of ‘culture’ in ordinary and <b>scientific</b> <b>language,</b> Mosterín defines several notions of collective culture, going from the cultural pool (the union of the cultures of all individuals of the group) to the unanimous culture (the intersection of all those cultures). In 2009 he has completed a thoroughgoing analysis of the forces driving cultural change, paying special attention to the role of Internet and other factors of information technology. He considers that preserving the freedom and efficiency of Internet is crucial for the future thriving of human culture.|$|E

[...] Theoretical laws would be reduced to empirical laws, while theoretical terms would garner meaning from observational terms via correspondence rules. [...] Mathematics in physics would reduce to symbolic logic via logicism, while rational reconstruction would convert ordinary language into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a logical syntax. [...] A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a logical calculus or empirical operation could verify its falsity or truth.|$|E

[...] "Inner space", a term originally coined by J.B. Priestley, was also used to describe the focus of the stories Moorcock printed, in contrast to traditional science fiction's focus on outer space, and James regards the term as [...] "the watchword of the British New Wave, and the shibboleth by which one recognized those who had abandoned Gernsback and Campbell." [...] The methods and interests of these writers were quite different from those of traditional science fiction: the concern was with internal rather than external reality, and experimental techniques, unusual juxtapositions of material, and a focus on psychological concerns were the norm.|$|E
