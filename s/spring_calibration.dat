The normal and abnormal mechanical properties of a given cell type can be established {{with the aid of}} an atomic force microscope (AFM), nonetheless, consistency {{in the area of the}} tip has been a mayor limitation of using the AFM for quantitative measurements of mechanical properties. This project attempts to overcome this limitation by using materials with a known elastic modulus, which resembles the one of the cell, to create force-deformation curves to calculate the area of indentation by means of Hooke s Law (sigma = E(epsilon)), which states that stress (sigma) is proportional to the strain (epsilon) where the constant of proportionality, E, is called the Young s modulus, also referred as the elastic modulus. Hook s Law can be rearranged to find the area of indentation (Area= Force/ E(epsilon)), where the indentation force is defined by the means of the added mass <b>spring</b> <b>calibration</b> method...|$|E

40|$|A {{simple but}} {{effective}} method for estimating the spring constant of commercially available {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) cantilevers is presented, based on estimating the cantilever thickness from knowledge of its length, width, resonant frequency and {{the presence or absence}} of an added mass, such as a colloid probe at the cantilever apex, or a thin film of deposited material. The spring constant of the cantilever can then be estimated using standard equations for cantilever beams.

40|$|A {{simplified}} method for calibrating {{atomic force microscope}} cantilevers was recently proposed by Sader et al. [Rev. Sci. Instrum. 83, 103705 (2012); Sec. III D] that relies solely on the resonant frequency and quality factor of the cantilever in fluid (typically air). This method eliminates the need to measure the hydrodynamic function of the cantilever, which can be time consuming given {{the wide range of}} cantilevers now available. Using laser Doppler vibrometry, we rigorously assess the accuracy of this method for a series of commercially available cantilevers and explore its performance under non-ideal conditions. This shows that the {{simplified method}} is highly accurate and can be easily implemented to perform fast, robust, and non-invasive <b>spring</b> constant <b>calibration.</b> Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPiezoresistive microcantilevers {{are widely}} applied to {{measurements}} of low forces, masses and viscosity [1]. After surface functionalization {{they might be}} used as a biochemical sensors being capable of the intermolecular force investigation. The problem is that such sensors change its mechanical properties in the environment they operate. Therefore {{there is a need for}} a high accuracy technique being capable of measuring of mechanical properties of functionalized cantilevers operating in the target environment. We suppose that such conditions meet the analysis of thermomechanical oscillation noise. In this paper the analysis of two types of cantilevers, that might be used in bioelectrochemical measurements, was performed. We determined the cantilever deflection and force sensitivity. The spring constant was measured by three different methods: the Cleveland methods [2] and the thermomechanical noise analysis. The obtained results indicate that analysis of thermomechanical excitation noise is the simplest and the most reliable method for <b>spring</b> constant <b>calibration</b> of piezoresistive cantilever based sensors...|$|R
30|$|Whereas, the {{application}} of MEMS probes {{are known to be}} superior in characterizing local force response of any interested cell (Figure 3 C). Being divided into two major groups, one dimensional (1 D) and two dimensional (2 D) cell probes have been used in the past in order to determine mechanical properties of single cell. The device as reported by Yang and Saif consists of a suspended probe of a pairs of compliant beam of known stiffness. As the piezoelectric actuator approaches the cell, the deflections of the beams were observed. Later, the applied force is calculated using the spring constant of the beams [45],[46]. This technique can be further improved with a coat of fibronectin to promote adhesion permits the observation of cell stretching [46]. Retrospectively, it is obvious that MEMS probes surpass the traditional AFM method in terms of reduced complexity and operates at lower cost although this technique bound to the uncertainties produced from the beam <b>spring</b> constant <b>calibration.</b> Some researchers proved that {{the application}}s towards investigation of cell morphology with respect to mechanical perturbations were made possible [35].|$|R

Standard <b>spring</b> constant <b>calibration</b> {{methods are}} compared {{when applied to}} higher eigenmodes of cantilevers used in dynamic atomic force microscopy (dAFM). Analysis shows that Sader's original method (Sader et al 1999 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 70 3967 – 9), which relies on a priori knowledge of the eigenmode shape, is poorly suited for the calibration of higher eigenmodes. On the other hand, the thermal noise method (Hutter and Bechhoefer 1993 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 64 1868 – 73) does not require knowledge of the eigenmode and remains valid for higher eigenmodes of the dAFM probe.

40|$|Measurement {{of force}} on a micro- or nano-Newton scale is {{important}} when exploring the mechanical {{properties of materials}} in the biophysics and nanomechanical fields. The atomic force microscope (AFM) is widely used in microforce measurement. The cantilever probe works as an AFM force sensor, and the spring constant of the cantilever is of great significance {{to the accuracy of}} the measurement results. This paper presents a normal <b>spring</b> constant <b>calibration</b> method with the combined use of an electromagnetic balance and a homemade AFM head. When the cantilever presses the balance, its deflection is detected through an optical lever integrated in the AFM head. Meanwhile, the corresponding bending force is recorded by the balance. Then the spring constant can be simply calculated using Hooke’s law. During the calibration, a feedback loop is applied to control the deflection of the cantilever. Errors that may affect the stability of the cantilever could be compensated rapidly. Five types of commercial cantilevers with different shapes, stiffness, and operating modes were chosen to evaluate the performance of our system. Based on the uncertainty analysis, the expanded relative standard uncertainties of the normal spring constant of most measured cantilevers are believed to be better than 2 %...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{stiffness}} characterization of microfabricated tri-layer conducting polymer (PPy) actuators. The rectangular, polypyrrole microactuators, which could operate both in aqueous and non-aqueous media, were fabricated using an excimer laser ablation technique that provided high throughput production and did not require cleanroom facilities. The microactuators were fixed at one end with electrical contacts {{and the other was}} end free to act as an electroactive microcantilever beam. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to measure the microactuator deflection under a range of normal forces applied by the AFM cantilever. A modified reference <b>spring</b> constant <b>calibration</b> method was employed to determine the stiffness constants of the microactuators. The stiffness of the microactuators in the electroactive (electrically stimulated) and passive state (no stimulation) were evaluated separately and compared. In doing so, the study presents results leading to the stiffness characterization of the first air-operated polymer microactuators and implementation of a simple, reliable and effective method for directly measuring the spring constant of polymer microactuators. This method is an alternative to the use of mechanical modeling methods, which can be difficult to implement for multi-layer (composite) polymer actuators. Importantly, our results highlight several requirements for using the reference spring method to accurately determine stiffness values of any microcantilever generally fabricated from soft, deformable materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{primary gas}} flow {{standard}} {{was designed and}} developed in <b>SPRING</b> for the <b>calibration</b> of gas flow meters or leak rate standard at nano-flow rate range of 10 - 6 to 10 - 12 mol/s. It {{is also used to}} generate very low gas flow for SPRING’s continuous expansion vacuum primary standard. The primary standard consists of two piston-cylinder flow units with diameters of 10 mm and 25 mm, which provide wider measurement ranges. A stepping motor is used to drive the piston moving at precise speed via a digital micrometer. Two methods, constant pressure method and constant volume method[1][2], are used for the measurement of flow rate. Flow meters can be calibrated automatically using a software program developed at SPRING. The expanded measurement uncertainty of the primary gas flow standard is estimated to be 1 % of the readings...|$|R

40|$|Process-based models (PBM) for {{simulation}} of weather dependent grass growth can assist farmers and plant breeders {{in addressing the}} challenges of climate change by simulating alternative roads of adaptation. They can also provide management decision support under current conditions. A drawback of existing grass models {{is that they do}} {{not take into account the}} effect of winter stresses, limiting their use for full-year simulations in areas where winter survival is a key factor for yield security. Here, we present a novel full-year PBM for grassland named BASGRA. It was developed by combining the LINGRA grassland model (Van Oijen et al., 2005 a) with models for cold hardening and soil physical winter processes. We present the model and show how it was parameterized for timothy (Phleum pratense L.), the most important forage grass in Scandinavia and parts of North America and Asia. Uniquely, BASGRA simulates the processes taking place in the sward during the transition from summer to winter, including growth cessation and gradual cold hardening, and functions for simulating plant injury due to low temperatures, snow and ice affecting regrowth in <b>spring.</b> For the <b>calibration,</b> we used detailed data from five different locations in Norway, covering a wide range of agroclimatic regions, day lengths (latitudes from 59 ◦ to 70 ◦ N) and soil conditions. The total dataset included 11 variables, notably above-ground dry matter, leaf area index, tiller density, content of C reserves, and frost tolerance. All data were used in the calibration. When BASGRA was run with the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) parameter vector from the single, Bayesian calibration, nearly all measured variables were simulated to an overall normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) < 0. 5. For many site × experiment combinations, NRMSE was < 0. 3. The temporal dynamics were captured well for most variables, as evaluated by comparing simulated time courses versus data for the individual sites. The results may suggest that BASGRA is a reasonably robust model, allowing for {{simulation of}} growth and several important underlying processes with acceptable accuracy for a range of agroclimatic conditions. However, the robustness of the model needs to be tested further using independent data from a wide range of growing conditions. Finally we show an example of application of the model, comparing overwintering risks in two climatically different sites, and discuss future model applications. Further development work should include improved simulation of the dynamics of C reserves, and validation of winter tiller dynamics against independent data...|$|R
