500|$|Lyrically, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] talks the {{strength}} {{that comes in}} letting go, and it was considered [...] "a sort of sonic sister to 'Frozen'", since both deal with themes of a heart closed towards love. This is emphasized in the lyrics, [...] "Your heart is not open <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> go" [...] as well as [...] "Freedom comes when you learn to let go, Creation comes when you learn to say no". The idea for using detachment as {{the inspiration for the}} song stemmed from Madonna's interest in Buddhist philosophy, as well as practicing Yoga. Nowels described the lyrics as [...] "stunning" [...] and commended its confessional nature. He also described the track as a [...] "meditation" [...] and [...] "a beautiful poem". Australian music critic and friend of Madonna, Molly Meldrum, claimed the lyrics were about the singer's former husband Sean Penn. The lyrical content was also compared to literary works of William Shakespeare, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton.|$|E
500|$|Ball then {{requested}} {{a few days}} off but, to his dismay, was temporarily reassigned to aerial reconnaissance duty with No.8 Squadron, where he flew B.E.2s from 18 July until 14 August. During this posting, Ball undertook an unusual mission. On the evening of 28 July, he flew a French espionage agent across enemy lines. Dodging an attack by three German fighters, as well as anti-aircraft fire, he landed in a deserted field, only to find that the agent refused {{to get out of the}} aircraft. While he was on reconnaissance duties with No. 8 Squadron, the London Gazette announced that he had been awarded the Military Cross [...] "for conspicuous skill and gallantry on many occasions," [...] particularly for [...] "one occasion [...] he attacked six in one flight". This was not unusual; throughout his career, Ball generally attacked on sight and heedless of the odds. He professed no hatred for his opponents, writing to his parents [...] "I only scrap because it is my duty... Nothing makes me feel more rotten than to see them go down, but you see it is either them or me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> do my duty best to make it a case of them".|$|E

2500|$|By 1932, the Nazi {{party was}} in ascendancy. [...] Litten's mother and friends were {{urging him to}} leave Germany, but he stayed. He said, [...] "The {{millions}} of workers can't leave here, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> stay too". Hitler's hatred for Litten was not forgotten {{and in the early}} hours of 28 February 1933, the night of the Reichstag fire, he was rousted from his bed, arrested and taken into protective custody. Litten's colleagues Ludwig Barbasch and Professor [...] were also arrested.|$|E
2500|$|Browning {{responded to}} Irving's claim that because Browning had done {{work for the}} Yad Vashem center in Jerusalem that made him an [...] "Israeli agent" [...] and thereby {{compromised}} his scholarly abilities by stating: [...] "If that was the case, then since I {{had been at the}} [...] Holocaust Museum, I would also have been an agent of the American government, and since I have received scholarships in Germany, I would be an agent of the German government, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> be a very duplicitous fellow to be able to follow these regimes." [...] Irving seemed anxious for Browning's approval, and Browning later recalled that Irving behaved as if {{the two of them were}} on [...] "a joint journey of exploration and discovery." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2017, Dave Meltzer {{wrote that}} WWE's push of Reigns [...] "will never end. Isn't that obvious by now". A month later, Meltzer {{reported}} that WWE's long term plans ("which obviously could change") for 2018's WrestleMania 34 was to [...] "once again build {{for a year}} and have the big coronation" [...] for Reigns, who would be a babyface (the heroic character) [...] "between now and then" [...] and beat Brock Lesnar for the WWE Universal title [...] "to fully replace John Cena as the lead babyface of the company". In a 2017 ESPN interview, Anoa'i said he did not view his boos [...] "as a negative", but as [...] "motivation". Anoa'i elaborated, [...] " [...] thousands of people are screaming, booing {{at the top of their}} lungs, and I'm the center of attention, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> be doing something right". In September 2017 on Raw, both (storyline) general manager Kurt Angle and commentator Corey Graves described Reigns as a wrestling [...] "icon".|$|E
