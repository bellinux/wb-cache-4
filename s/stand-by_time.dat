Prior {{to the introduction of}} the Working Time Regulations 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 zero-hour contracts were sometimes used to [...] "clock-off" [...] staff during quiet periods while retaining them on site so they could be returned to paid work should the need arise. The National Minimum Wage Regulations now require that employers pay the national minimum wage for the time workers are required to be at the workplace even if there is no [...] "work" [...] to do. In the past, some employees working on a zero-hour contract have [...] been told that they are required to obtain permission of their employer before accepting other work but this practise has now been banned under UK legislation enacted in May 2015. In , the UK Supreme Court delivered a groundbreaking judgment on workers who were on a zero hour contract. Lord Clarke held, at paragraph 35, that in employment relations which are characterised by inequality of bargaining power, the written terms of a contract may not in truth represent what was the contract in law. In 2013, the reasoning in Autoclenz was applied by Supperstone J in the Employment Appeal Tribunal to hold that a security guard who was given a zero hours contract was entitled to a stable working pattern: the contract's written terms were invalid. Together, this indicates that all zero hours contracts may be unlawful, and workers may be entitled to sue their employers for an unlawful deduction of wages if they are willing and able to work.|$|E

Data were also collected on baseline conditions and from a nearby well site to provide data on recovery ten years after discharge.

Die Grundlage einer solchen Bewertung bilden detaillierte Kenntnisse des Abrufverhaltens positiver Minutenreserve. Deshalb wird die Inanspruchnahme positiver Minutenreserve untersucht und als stochastischer Prozess modelliert. Auf dieser Basis erfolgen Betrachtungen zur Dimensionierung der Wärmespeicher, zum Netzbetrieb mit hoher Dichte dezentraler Klein-KWK-Anlagen und zur Wirtschaftlichkeit eines solchen Konzeptes. Die abschließende ganzheitliche Betrachtung liefert Hinweise zur optimalen Betriebsweise der Klein-KWK-Anlagen. From the {{technical}} point of view, virtual power plants consisting of small decentralized co-generation plants {{are able to}} provide positive tertiary reserve power for the European electricity transmission grid. For serious analyses, detailed knowledge about the load-characteristic of called reserve power is essentially. In order to examine grid operation, heat storage capacity and optimized power plant operation, the switch-on times of co-generation plants and the co-generated heat during reserve power provision have to be estimated. Aiming this, the called positive tertiary reserve power in Germany is analyzed and a mathematical model of the call-characteristic is synthesized. Furthermore, the results of examining grid operation, optimizing heat storage capacity and power plant operation are given. Calls of positive tertiary reserve power usually occur suddenly, non-scheduled and jumpy. Sometimes, there are single calls. Usually, calls occur clustered, i. e. one call is directly followed by further calls. Positive reserve power is much higher frequented under peak-load conditions than under base-load conditions. The characteristic of calling positive tertiary reserve power deeply depends on the control area. From the mathematical point of view, a Poisson-process fits non-scheduled and jumpy occurring events. Each jump marks a call date of positive tertiary reserve power. The values of the called power fit a logarithmical normal distribution. The lengths of the call-clusters satisfactorily fit a geometrical distribution. The expected value of called reserve energy is modeled dependent {{from the time of}} the day. The model is essential for simulating all combinations of switch-on times of co-generation plants and of co-generated heat volumes that might occur during providing reserve power. Aiming to optimize the installed heat storage capacity, the quote of heat use has to be examined. From both technical and ecological point of view, installing large heat storages is desirable in order to use all co-generated heat. From the economical point of view, installing any heat storage is not sensible. The solution of this trade-off is installing a heat storage that guarantees less or equal CO 2 -emissions than a conventional power plant fired with natural gas. The results of this thesis lead to 1 kWh heat storage capacity per 1 kW installed electrical power as rule of thumb. Concerning grid operation in steady state, a much higher density of co-generation plants than expected is technically installable. A general rule for extending the installable decentralized power cannot be deducted. Examining economics, decentalized co-genertation plants are desired to provide balancing power during their <b>stand-by</b> <b>times.</b> Building a virtual power plant only in order to provide reserve power is not economically sensible. From the power plant owners' view, providing positive tertiary reserve power by small decentralized co-generation plants is generally sustainable...|$|R

These devices, e. g. smart cards, do not contain an integrated power supply and often provide only limited resources. Such devices can be designed with traditional methods due to their low complexity, but integrated HW/SW co-design methodologies enable the gain of system-level optimization. This paper presents the abstraction of smart card designs to optimize system architecture and memory system.

40|$|Methods of {{increasing}} the performance of radionuclide generators used in nuclear medicine radiotherapy and SPECT/PET imaging were developed and detailed for 99 Mo/ 99 mTc and 68 Ge/ 68 Ga radionuclide generators as the cases. Optimisation methods of the daughter nuclide build-up versus <b>stand-by</b> <b>time</b> and/or specific activity using mean progress functions were developed for increasing the performance of radionuclide generators. As {{a result of this}} optimisation, the separation of the daughter nuclide from its parent one should be performed at a defined optimal time to avoid the deterioration in specific activity of the daughter nuclide and wasting <b>stand-by</b> <b>time</b> of the generator, while the daughter nuclide yield is maintained to a reasonably high extent. A new characteristic parameter of the formation-decay kinetics of parent/daughter nuclide system was found and effectively used in the practice of the generator production and utilisation. A method of “early elution schedule” was also developed for increasing the daughter nuclide production yield and specific radioactivity, thus saving the cost of the generator and improving the quality of the daughter radionuclide solution. These newly developed optimisation methods in combination with an integrated elution-purification-concentration system of radionuclide generators recently developed is the most suitable way to operate the generator effectively on the basis of economic use and improvement of purposely suitable quality and specific activity of the produced daughter radionuclides. All these features benefit the economic use of the generator, the improved quality of labelling/scan, and the lowered cost of nuclear medicine procedure. Besides, a new method of quality control protocol set-up for post-delivery test of radionuclidic purity has been developed based on the relationship between gamma ray spectrometric detection limit, required limit of impure radionuclide activity and its measurement certainty with respect to optimising decay/measurement time and product sample activity used for QC quality control. The optimisation ensures a certainty of measurement of the specific impure radionuclide and avoids wasting the useful amount of valuable purified/concentrated daughter nuclide product. This process is important for the spectrometric measurement of very low activity of impure radionuclide contamination in the radioisotope products of much higher activity used in medical imaging and targeted radiotherapy...|$|E

Almost all of the research and development requires specific and in some cases real-time visualization of the simulation. HLRS visualization department support scientists and engineers with visual analysis of the simulated data computed by high performance computers. With time the complexity and size of the simulated data set is increasing and in order {{to keep up with the}} technology, new and state of the art techniques are being utilized for data visualization. Currently the visualization department is working on a 3 D virtual reality environment called CAVE which allows to simulate data sets intuitively. This virtual reality environment need some kind of control and navigation capability form humans and for this purpose a prototype of a remote device is being developed. This remote device is used to control and navigate scenes and simulation models within the virtual reality environment of CAVE. The first prototype of this remote device consists of AVR atmega micro-controller and a RF module operating at 2. 4 GHz. The same set of devices is present on the receiver side as an AVR controller and a RF module which is then connected to the CAVE via USB. The main objective of this thesis work is to implement a reliable, robust and low-latency bi-directional communication protocol between multiple remote devices and a receiver device inside CAVE.

40|$|International audienceSolid {{electrodes}} such as glassy {{carbon and}} platinum modified by "palladization" (galvanostatic deposits from acidic solutions of Pd 2 +) may exhibit exceptional catalytic capabilities, {{especially in the}} cathodic cleavage of alkyl bromides when achieved {{in the presence of}} traces of iodide ions. The use of such chemically modified surfaces leads to important potential shifts compared to the use of glassy carbon or smooth palladium in the absence of iodide. The catalytic behaviour is assigned to a nucleophilic-like displacement at the adsorbed state, between the organic bromide and iodide ion. Thus palladium surfaces can be successfully employed for cleaving carbon-halogen bonds at very moderate negative potentials. Preliminarily results have revealed that all palladized electrodes give an adsorption-like peak assigned to the corresponding alkyl iodide adsorbed on (or reacting with) the surface. The influence of different parameters like the organic substrate and the iodide concentration, the thickness of the palladium deposit, and the <b>stand-by</b> <b>time</b> before reduction are preliminarily presented.

40|$|Reducing power {{consumption}} {{has become increasingly}} important. For portable systems, low-power means longer battery life, thus service time. The environmental impact of {{power consumption}} from electronic systems has raised serious concern. Furthermore, excessive heat dissipation is a major obstacle in improving performance. Many powerreduction techniques have been proposed, such as clock gating, variable voltage, and power management. Power management puts unused (also called idle) components or subsystems into sleeping states (also called <b>stand-by)</b> at run <b>time</b> to save power. Some systems contain subsystems that are not always needed. Most systems do not always operate at their peak performance. Power management exploits these opportunities to save power. These subsystems can sleep during idleness and wake up latter when necessary. Power-state changes may have energy and time overhead; therefore, state changes should occur only when the overhead can be justified. Previous power management techniques observe requests and predict the length of future idleness to determine appropriate power states. They implicitly assume {{the existence of a}} single requester. In reality, requests may be generated by different requesters (programs); for instance, requests for a network card may come fromftp,telnet, or a web browser.

State-of-the-art applications for passenger vehicles consist of double-wall cylindrical tanks that hold a hydrogen storage mass {{of up to}} 10 kg.

The space between the inner and outer vessel is mainly used for thermal super-insulation purposes. Several layers of insulation foils and high vacuums of 10 - 3 Pa reduce the heat entry.

As {{with the proliferation of}} services in incumbents ’ portfolios, leading to a number of coexisting so-called ‘stove-pipes’, we see an isomorphic phenomenon evolving in multimodal mobile devices, leading to an inefficient development of vertical stack technical solutions for each different mode. For the first time we found the optimal technical and commercial fit, i. e. between the internal device solution and the external service provider solution respectively, with tremendous benefits for the end user. Migration from vertical towards horizontal solutions, with tilting on device level, not only decreases costs but also hugely increases the flexibility for the introduction of new customised solutions. This article outlines a unique technology called XAS that enables automatic access selection for a requested service, based on qualifiers such as available bandwidth, QoS offered and connection costs.

This concept incurs considerable power losses compared to other storage technologies. Besides, it has a long start time and a long stand-by recovery time that need to be studied. Graphical and numerical approaches have been developed for power optimization. A first graphical approach is presented. Then a numerical approach will facilitate more targetedresponses to the problems experienced with the graphical one. This work acknowledges losses of the rectifier AC (alternating current) to DC (direct current), of the inverter (DC to AC), of the charging and the discharging process. This work proposes a new approach of Pinch Analysis Method for the optimization of Power-to -gas storage of a hybrid power system using intermittent and renewable energy.

Through Total E&P Nigeria, and with {{collaboration with the}} international SERPENT project {{as well as with}} local universities and research organisations, industrial remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) were used to carry out high-resolution imaging surveys and make specimen collections in this deep-water region during periods of <b>stand-by</b> <b>time.</b> The first phase of the work was to characterise the deep-water megabenthic assemblages found in the Usan region for the first time using fully quantitative ROV imaging. This was carried out during a visit to Usan in July 2009 on the ROV support vessel Bourbon Diamond. Because the Usan field contains a diverse series of seabed habitats we were also able to assess in more detail the effect of the variable seabed slope on the seafloor animal assemblage particularly with regard to the number and diversity of organisms. A total of 24 invertebrate species were observed at Usan from six phyla. Echinoderms, such as sea stars and sea cucumbers, were dominant with 10 species found representing 64 % of the animals observed. The sea urchin, Phormosoma placenta, was the most common animal which accounted for over half of the animals observed. Eight cnidarian species, particularly anemones, were identified but they only represented 4 % of the total density. Crustaceans, such as crabs, were numerically important (31 % total fauna) but only represented by three taxa and only one of these, a squat lobster, accounted {{for the vast majority of}} the faunal numbers. Ten species of fish were observed at Usan. Slope had a major impact on faunal density with a clear and significant linear negative relationship found between total density and slope. Deposit feeders make up the majority of the animals observed display a strong negative linear relationship with slope. Densities of suspension feeders are very low except in the highest slope site, even here mean densities are less than half that of deposit feeders. Slope also has a significant effect on the number of species found. Maximum observed water temperature was 27. 6 °C and minimum 4. 8 °C. Salinities ranged between 26. 58 and 36. 63 (average 34. 8) with the lowest salinities only found in the immediate surface waters during rainy periods. The deepest reading was taken at 815 m water depth (5. 20 ° C temperature; 34. 76 salinity). The thermocline depth varied from 41 to 92 m during the survey. The average thermocline depth observed here is greater than suggested in the literature by about 20 m. Seasonal fluctuations in temperature are large in the Gulf of Guinea and the period of survey is a transitional time for water mass properties in the area, where climatic data are variable. A total of 23 species of phytoplankton were captured. Of these most (14 species) were diatoms, 8 species were blue-green algae and 1 species was a desmid single-celled alga.

Identifying different use-case scenarios to optimize for is a strategy that has been used for a long time. Lately, another kind of scenario-based strategy has emerged; so-called System scenarios. Instead of classifying the behavior of a system through several use-cases, the actual costs of the system is considered, like resource usage or quality requirements. By thoroughly characterizing and analyzing the system behavior at design-time, the different system scenarios can be recognized at run-time without much overhead. The system can then be tailored to the identified scenario by employing the optimal settings that have been determined at design-time. It must however be enough exploitable dynamism present in the application to make up for the system scenario overhead. The system scenario research field has well described theoretical design methodologies, even considering multiple cost dimensions. It can however be a long distance between the theoretical methodologies and an actual design process, especially when the dynamic cost is multi-dimensional. There is a considerable increase in the design complexity from adding just one more cost dimension to the design, motivating the need for a precise and concrete methodology. This thesis presents methods for detecting and exploiting dynamism in applications through profiling and code inspection, and the results from applying these methods on four applications, where three of them are a subset of the SPEC CPU 2006 integer benchmarks. The focus is on exploring both memory and CPU dynamism. Identifying the dynamism in an application can become very complex when considering multi-dimensional dynamism. An extension to the system scenario methodology which addresses this problem is therefore suggested. The scenario identification step of the original methodology is split into several smaller steps and executed separately for each of the considered dynamisms. This way the designer does not have to keep the entire design space in mind, but can focus on each kind of dynamism separately. Sub-scenarios are identified for each kind of dynamism, and then combined to form a scenario set where the total dynamism is exploited. The methodology is targeted at simple single-core platforms. Several papers present promising results of the system scenario methodology when only considering CPU optimizations such as Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). For applications requiring much memory however, DVFS can become infeasible as it means longer <b>stand-by</b> <b>time</b> for the memory. Memory typically contributes significantly to the total energy consumption, which motivates the recent introduction of memory system scenarios with dynamically reconfigurable memories. In this work, the dynamism in applications that are both memory and computationally intensive are exploited by combining DVFS and memory reconfigurations. Much CPU and memory dynamism is identified in the considered benchmark applications, and up to 31 % of the total energy is saved by applying the modified system scenario methodology. Up to 47 % is saved for some of the low-workload situations. Characteristics of an Intel Pentium processor and CACTI memory models are used to estimate the energy savings...|$|E
