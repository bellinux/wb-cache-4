50|$|The graphic is {{a summary}} of maps of the area since 1832. These {{demonstrate}} {{the growth of the}} town to its current extent from a large number of disconnected dwellings to a large <b>settlement</b> <b>spreading</b> from the New Kirk area. The relative size of houses (and corresponding affluence of households) tends to increase with age, {{but this is not a}} strict rule.|$|E
50|$|Townsville {{continued}} to expand with <b>settlement</b> <b>spreading</b> along the new, south western {{road to the}} goldfields at Ravenswood and Charters Towers. Commercial development along Charters Towers Road meant that West End {{was no longer a}} centre of business. Suburban development did not spread beyond West End until after World War II although the hotel {{continued to}} provide a service for travellers reaching town from the west and north west.|$|E
50|$|Quarino was {{a runaway}} African slave on the Island of New Providence in the Bahamas in 1734. He hid {{himself in the}} bushes, {{allegedly}} travelling from settlement to <b>settlement</b> <b>spreading</b> the message of revolt against their white oppressors. On one of these missions he was spotted by a soldier who sounded the alarm, he killed {{one of the soldiers}} with his knife but was later overpowered and questioned. During this time he revealed a plot among the Blacks of New Providence to kill all the white inhabitants starting with the Governor Fitzwilliam and {{to take control of the}} island.|$|E

50|$|In {{the central}} Great Plains, the {{meridian}} roughly marks the western {{boundary of the}} normal reach of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, and the approximate boundary (although some areas do push the boundary slightly farther east) between the semi-arid climate {{to the west and}} the humid continental (north of about 37°N) and humid subtropical (south of about 37°N) climates to the east. The type of agriculture west of the meridian typically relies heavily on irrigation. Historically the meridian has often been taken as a rough boundary between the eastern and western United States. White <b>settlement,</b> <b>spreading</b> westward after the American Civil War, settled the area around this meridian during the 1870s.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{models for}} the {{explanation}} of settlement processes pay {{little attention to the}} interactions between <b>settlement</b> <b>spreading</b> and road networks. On the basis of a dielectric breakdown model in combination with cellular automata, we present a method to steer precisely the generation of settlement structures with regard to their global and local density as well as the size and number of forming clusters. The resulting structures depend on the logic of how the dependence of the settlements and the road network is implemented to the simulation model. After analysing {{the state of the art}} we begin with a discussion of the mutual dependence of roads and land development. Next, we elaborate a model that permits the precise control of permeability in the developing structure as well as the settlement density, using the fewest necessary control parameters. On the basis of different characteristic values, possible settlement structures are analysed and compared with each other. Finally, we reflect on the theoretical contribution of the model with regard to the context of urban dynamics. ...|$|E
40|$|Brief review {{has been}} {{presented}} in the introduction on the related foreign researches, of the greater holiday resorts concentration, which are situated on the attractive localities, within {{the reach of the}} usual trip-recreational movements of the urban population, from many industrial European centers. It has also been underlined that along the coastal part of our Danube-Basin following Grocka-Kladovo direction, 49 localities are to be found on the already formed settlements for holiday and recreation. The very same are, in that area, considerably unbalanced territorial distribution, since that they are present in an uneven number at the outskirts of the municipal territories that touch the coastal Danube line. They are much further from its coastal zone. The exception is the locality of Petrovo Selo which is located in the north-western territory part of the municipality of Kladovo. Three clearly close holiday resorts ("Dobra Voda", "Bare" and "Poljana") have been gathered spatially on relatively low (400 - 450 m altitude), north-eastern slopes of mountain Miroc. Thus they make the region of Miroc very attractive for resort and recreation, which is being treated mainly from the aspect of important geographical touristic characteristics. They are consisting of different number recently built and previously inhabited old houses, which have been refurbished (remodeled). They are also distinctive regarding their spatial disposition, considering its particular <b>settlement</b> <b>spreading.</b> Therefore they are mutually differentiated as by their chronological characteristics of building, general spatial physiognomy so in the respect of morpho-typological modification in the sub-mountain terrain of mountain Miroc...|$|E
50|$|Freemasonry {{spread from}} New South Wales into Queensland in {{individual}} lodges. The first Freemason's lodge in Queensland {{was established in}} 1859, shortly before Separation from New South Wales. New lodges were formed as <b>settlement</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R
25|$|Southern Carolina prospered {{from the}} {{fertility}} of the Low Country and the harbors, {{such as that}} at Charleston.

50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Moreton Bay Penal Colony at the site of what is now the Brisbane central business district in 1825, and the opening up of the area to free settlers in 1842, European <b>settlement</b> <b>spread</b> from that site.|$|R
50|$|European <b>settlement</b> <b>spread</b> {{to other}} parts of the region in the 1830s, as a result of Afrikaner dissatisfaction with British rule.

50|$|Once {{news of the}} {{successful}} <b>settlement</b> <b>spread,</b> additional settlers arrived from the nearby towns of El Peñol, Marinilla, and El Santuario. By 1878, the town had constructed its first church, a central park and was integrated as {{a segment of the}} municipality of San Carlos.|$|R
50|$|The Kvens, a {{minority}} in Northern Norway, helped Finnish <b>settlements</b> <b>spread,</b> especially in the 1860s. The Academic Karelia Society and the Finnish Heritage Association worked actively with the Kvens from 1927-1934, and the Finnish media spread pan-Fennicist propaganda through various channels. Activity slowed down from 1931-1934.|$|R
50|$|The {{first human}} {{settlements}} in the area date {{back as far as}} 1800 BCE, found in Ixpuichiapan and the Cerro de las Tres Marías. Between 1300 and 800 BCE <b>settlements</b> <b>spread</b> to the Nixcongo, Exhacienda de Monte de Pozoa and the Texpoxtepec area, showing Olmec influence.|$|R
5000|$|Shards {{dating from}} the Late Bronze Age {{have been found in}} a shelter at a place called the Lèque, {{confirming}} the existence of human settlement in the Alpilles since prehistoric times.

50|$|Early <b>settlement</b> in Townsville <b>spread</b> {{along the}} beach in the present North Ward area, with the {{commercial}} centre located along the bank of Ross Creek (Flinders Street). As the town developed, <b>settlement</b> <b>spread</b> further along Flinders Street to the area which became known as West End. By 1868 the West End Cemetery had been established {{in the area and}} by 1878 the Carriers Arms Hotel, a soap works, a foundry, commercial buildings and a large estate held by Frederick Ashton, were located at West End.|$|R
50|$|Elderslie Homestead is {{important}} in demonstrating how European <b>settlement</b> <b>spread</b> in remote parts of Queensland through exploration and pastoral usage, followed by closer settlement {{and the growth of}} service towns. The town of Winton is located near the site of the original homestead and may well have affected the choice of location for the homestead complex.|$|R
50|$|The {{local area}} was settled in prehistoric times, as {{witnessed}} {{by the many}} barrows, mainly in neighbouring municipalities. This is also true of the Gallo-Roman epoch, which also left its traces behind. An extensive Gallo-Roman <b>settlement</b> <b>spread</b> out just across the state boundary in the Heidenbösch in Bubach, an outlying {{centre of the town}} of Sankt Wendel.|$|R
25|$|Colonial St. Mary's City was {{actually}} only a town {{and at its}} peak had between 500 and 600 residents. However, as the colony quickly expanded and <b>settlements</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the Eastern {{part of what is}} now Maryland, the town remained the capital and representatives would travel from all over the colony to participate in the Maryland General Assembly, the colony's first legislative body.|$|R
25|$|After several failed {{attempts}} at colonization of {{the portion of}} the New World now known as the United States, the Spanish succeeded in 1565 with the establishment of St. Augustine, the first city in the United States.

50|$|Like other plains zebras, Burchell's zebras {{must have}} {{populated}} the African plains in impressive numbers. Associations of thousands have been reported. The wild herds {{were thought to}} have disappeared by 1910, and the last known captive individual died in the Berlin Zoo in 1918. As European <b>settlement</b> <b>spread</b> northward from the Cape to colonial southern Rhodesia, this subspecies was {{thought to have been}} hunted to extinction.|$|R
50|$|Remnants of the Old Bowen Downs Road are {{significant}} {{as evidence of}} the early establishment of vital road networks in rural Queensland {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century.

50|$|The <b>settlement</b> <b>spread</b> in {{the area}} of the present Seinäjoki during the first half of the 16th century. During the 1550s, there is said to have been three houses in Seinäjoki: the houses of Marttila, Jouppi and Uppa. The house of Jouppila, which {{separated}} from the house of Jouppi, was established during the same century. All of the houses were located on the shore of the river.|$|R
50|$|The <b>{{settlement}}</b> <b>spreads</b> {{from the}} central street, the Boulevard of Liebration, which starts in central Belgrade (the Slavija square). As the settlement was growing, it spread to the south reaching the major road in the southern outskirts of Belgrade, the Kružni put.

50|$|The Votadini were a {{tribe in}} Lothian and their chief, Cunedda, {{was sent by}} the Saxon leader, Vortigern, to {{establish}} settlements in order to resist Picto-Scottish sea raids in the south west of Scotland. These <b>settlements</b> <b>spread</b> down the west coast as far as Wales. Cunedda is rendered as Cinneidgh in the Celtic language, meaning ugly or grim-headed. The name became associated with the district of Carrick, Scotland.|$|R
50|$|The Oregon Provisional Legislature created Polk County from Yamhill District on December 22, 1845, {{granting}} to it {{the entire}} southwestern portion of present-day Oregon to the California border.
