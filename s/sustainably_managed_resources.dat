Paper versions also available for check out or consultation in the University of Oregon's library under the call number: K 3884. S 74 2006 In the anarchical structure of international politics, relative treaty effectiveness {{has proven to}} be a difficult task to accomplish concerning environmental issues. Not only do the authors of these agreements face the challenge of negotiating a functional structure of rules and regulations amongst diversified interests, but they are also confronted with the undertakings of implementation and compliance. As each environmental issue varies in scope and urgency, the number of actors, the kinds of obligations, the type of monitoring, and their related responses fluctuate according to the distinct individual situation. Because of this oscillation, evaluating the overall effectiveness of these environmental treaties proves to be extremely complicated, as no two treaties are the same. Theory on successful regimes, thus, can only be achieved through the comparison of different agreements with similar treaty mechanisms. Through this type of analysis, political scientists hope to develop an increasingly comprehensive model for treaty effectiveness pertaining to environmental issues. The International Tropical Timber Agreements of 1983 and 1994 were established with the hopes of lowering the deforestation rate of tropical timber without encumbering the market growth of developing member nations. This objective would be achieved through forest conservation and management efforts that would produce a growing market of timber from sustainably managed sources. After careful examination of these two treaties, one can conclude that the 1983 and 1994 Tropical Timber Agreements were both effective in altering m(,nber state behavior in the pursuance of decreased deforestation levels and increased sustainability in timber products. While the increased market transparency promoted in both agreements was successful in reducing member exports of tropical timber, the Bali Fund, established in the successor agreement, 1 encouraged the increased exportation of resources from only <b>sustainably</b> <b>managed</b> <b>resources</b> by the year 2000 through enhanced financial assistance. Together, the two International Tropical Timber Agreements gave consuming and producing parties strong incentive to decrease the rate of tropical timber deforestation...|$|E

40|$|Depletion {{of fossil}} fuel {{resources}} and stringent environmental laws have forced researchers to develop methods to <b>sustainably</b> <b>manage</b> <b>resources.</b> Focus has been gradually shifting towards energy recovery from waste materials which can solve both the problems. One of the major wastes in the automobile sector is automobile tyres. These have an adverse {{impact on the environment}} if they are not disposed o properly. Further, tyres are a source of high grade energy hence its improper disposal means wastage of energy. Several methods have been developed to extract energy from waste tyres. One of them is pyrolysis of tyres which produces Tyre Pyrolysis Oil (TPO) by thermal decomposition of tyres. The properties of TPO blends with diesel were analysed and compared with diesel and found that it can also be used as a fuel in compression ignition engine. Experiments were carried out on a single cylinder, four stroke, air-cooled, diesel engine running with dierent blends of TPO from 5 % to 20 % on volume basis. Experimental results indicated that TPO of 20 % blend gave better performance. The Performance and emission characteristics are reported in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Justice in the Global Commons: A Framework of Moral Duties for Common-Pool ResourcesByK. Violet McKeonDoctor of Philosophy in PhilosophyUniversity of California, Irvine, 2015 Professor A. James, ChairWe live in {{an unjust}} world. While one might agree with this statement, {{presently}} {{there is no consensus}} about what justice in a global context requires. In my dissertation, I argue for a pluralistic conception of justice that can, in the relevant cases, be “grounded” in shared vital resources, like clean drinking water and a stable climate system. I develop a framework of moral and political duties that all humans have when we share a common plight in virtue of these resources, justified given a general moral contractualism like that proposed by Scanlon. The framework implies that many of the reasons presently given for failing to stabilize or conserve resources that people depend upon, or to enact policies that will do so, are not only immoral but also unjust, even in ungoverned contexts. It offers guidance for many (if not most) situations of shared vital resources, without having to appeal to any independent justifications of “rights. ” One notable consequence of supplying a moral mechanism by which present people are obligated to <b>sustainably</b> <b>manage</b> <b>resources</b> on an ongoing basis is that future people will also have the resources they need...|$|R

40|$|One way of {{improving}} natural resource regimes would be through a more careful and consistent identification of rights-holders, with more explicit attention {{for the relationship}} between the rights of indigenous peoples and other local nonindigenous communities. This argument is illustrated with a critical analysis of the protected areas legislation in Peru, focusing on the right to consultation prior to the establishment of a protected area, and the rights to use and <b>sustainably</b> <b>manage</b> natural <b>resources</b> within protected areas. On the basis of both international human rights law and empirical data, it is suggested that limiting subsistence-related rights in protected areas to indigenous peoples could endanger the enjoyment of the right to food of the local non-indigenous population.
