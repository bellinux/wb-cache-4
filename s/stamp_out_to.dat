Several aspects of the disease lack scientific information, which has hampered the management of some recent crises. Millions of animals have died, and concern is growing {{over the loss of}} human lives and management of the pandemic potential. On the basis of data generated in recent outbreaks and in light of new OIE regulations and maintenance of animal welfare, we review the available control methods for avian influenza infections in poultry, from <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> prevention through emergency and prophylactic vaccination. Avian influenza (AI), which emerged from the animal reservoir, represents one of the greatest recent concerns for public health.

40|$|Congress {{enacted the}} Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to combat an {{epidemic}} of illicit payments by U. S. businesses and individuals to foreign officials. The FCPA prohibits any bribe to a foreign official to influence any official act, induce unlawful action, or obtain or retain business. The FCPA, however, carves out an exception for facilitating grease payments made to foreign officials to expedite or secure performance of routine government actions. This exception allows for modest payments to low-ranking officials to expedite non-discretionary clerical activities. The FCPA fails to provide a monetary threshold for what constitutes a permissible grease payment. This Note explains that the carve-out for grease payments impedes the Congressional goal of <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> corruption. <b>To</b> alleviate {{the problems associated with}} grease payments, this Note advocates for Congressional repeal, or amendment of, the statute; DOJ promulgation of guidelines defining permissible grease payments; corporate activism; and institutional reform...|$|R
40|$|Using as-yet-unpublished material, {{the article}} {{considers}} {{the interaction of}} the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) with the “bribe culture” that surrounds international arms deals. It finds evidence of two phases. The first, which lasted until 1976, may be characterized as “in-house involvement;” the second, following the United States’ Lockheed scandal in 1975 - 76, as “subcontracted” corruption. In the latter phase, the MoD is seen to have tried to avoid acquiring knowledge of corrupt practices, to have avoided asking awkward questions, and to have left bribes on government-to-government deals to be paid by U. K. companies. In doing this, they are shown to have misled Parliament, and rather than taking any meaningful steps <b>to</b> try and <b>stamp</b> <b>out</b> corruption, <b>to</b> have let corruption continue unimpeded. The U. K. government has actively promoted arms exports for forty years and has always denied being complicit in bribery by arms companies. This article questions such denials and finds them wanting.

40|$|MBA - WBSWhen the Kenyan {{government}} abolished {{primary school}} fees in 2003, {{it was hoped}} that low enrolment and high dropout rates would be reversed. However, soon after its introduction, the classrooms were overflowing with new entrants, significantly exacerbating teacher: pupil ratio. The quality of education in the public schools has diminished and enrolment rates are dropping with the number of years spent in school. Some children of school-going age are still out of school. There is still marked shortage of schools, classrooms, teachers and learning materials, despite the fact that parents, donors and government have pulled together resources for the free primary education programme. Using a rich source of literature and secondary information from the Ministry of Education and Planning as well as information from the World Bank Library, this study sought to determine financing options for the free primary education in Kenya. It found out that there are still inadequate schools and classrooms that call for additional funding from government, donor community and households. It further found out that there are micro-factors such as poverty, gender, community and rural specific disadvantages that still keep children from these backgrounds out of school. Moreover, corruption and inefficiency of funds allocation at the Ministry of Education lead to leakages of funds that would otherwise have been put to better use. It recommended that the government and the donor community should continue to fund the construction of schools, training and employment of more teachers as well as devoting some funds to specific schools and households that are severely deprived. It further recommended that corruption at the Ministry of Education should be <b>stamped</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> recover some funds for the programm...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAvian {{influenza}} is an OIE listed {{disease that}} has become a disease of great importance both for animal and human health. The increased relevance of AI in the fields of animal and human health, has highlighted the lack of scientific information on several aspects of the disease, which has hampered the adequate management of some of the recent crises. Millions of animals have died, and there is growing concern over the loss of human lives and over the management of the pandemic potential. The present paper aims to identify areas of knowledge of veterinary competence that need to be improved in order to generate information to support the global AI crisis and highlights the major changes in AI legislation, including regulations related to trade. It also reviews the human health implications of AI, including the mechanisms by which a human pandemic virus may be generated and the food safety issues related to this infection. The application of control policies, ranging from <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> emergency and prophylactic vaccination are discussed on the basis of data generated in recent outbreaks and in the light of new regulations, also in view of the maintenance of good animal welfare. Poultry veterinarians working for the industry or for the public sector represent the first line of defence against the pandemic threat and for the prevention and control of this infection in poultry and in wild birds. However, given the current situation, it is imperative that close collaboration is sought and achieved by public health officials involved in the veterinary, agricultural and medical aspects of the disease. Only through the exchange of data, experiences, views and information will it be possible to combat this zoonosis which represents a major threat to public health and animal wellbeing...|$|R
5|$|Claims {{that the}} NEP had retarded {{economic}} growth were dismissed; it was posited that the NEP {{had managed to}} avert further racial rioting, which would have hurt economic growth more than the NEP.

The overall Malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50% at independence to 7%.

Although many of the NEP's goals were restated by the NDP, the new policy appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation, as opposed to simple redistribution.

He created grand Battle strategies of a New Push westward, to crush the Bolshevik movement, and tried to centre White command around himself, trying to get the disparate commanders who were attempting defence against the Bolsheviks to unite and move east. These plans, of course, failed, and the White Movement began losing more and more ground to the rising star of the Bolsheviks. By the summer of 1921, Soviet forces began the Mass invasion of Mongolia, pushing in from Transbaikal.

The results suggests {{that in the case of}} no disease occurrence, the optimal time to sell ducks is at week 10 of the production cycle when ducks reach the age of 8 weeks. Maximum profit gained is US$ 805 for a producer with an average flock size of 794 ducks. However, the producer would suffer serious losses once the disease occurs. The expected investment loss is far higher than the maximum profit received at each production cycle and is estimated to be 3 times higher (US$ 2665. 19 expected loss vs. US$ 805 maximum profit) ...|$|R

Faecal samples were aseptically and randomly collected from the ani of 101 pigs between April and July, 2013. The samples were preserved using 10 % formalin pending the analysis. At the end of collections, they were subjected to laboratory faecal analysis for ova and oocysts/cysts. All data collected were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics for prevalence determination. The results showed that 33 (32. 67 %) out of 101 pigs were infested by gastrointestinal parasites. The prevalence also revealed that boars 17 (17 %) had higher prevalence than sows 16 (16 %). The four species of parasites identified showed prevalences of 20. 79 %, 9. 90 %, 0. 99 % and 0. 99 % for Isospora suis, Oesophagostomum dentatum, Trichuris suis and Metastrongylus salini respectively. The results also showed a sex prevalence of 16. 83 % (17 boars) and 15. 84 % (16 sows) which was not statistically different (P> 0. 05).
