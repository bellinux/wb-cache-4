On May 26, 2006 Mexico {{requested}} consultations with the United States {{about a number of}} final anti-dumping judgments made by the US Department of Commerce. The judgments concerned the imports of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>strips</b> from Mexico, which were supposedly illegal dumping {{through the use of a}} [...] "Zeroing" [...] technique by the US Department of Commerce. Mexico believed that some of the laws, regulations, administrative practices and methodologies implemented by the US impaired and nullified the benefits added to Mexico, directly or indirectly, under the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation, and that the anti-dumping laws were unwarranted. The consultations were held to discuss activities carried on between January 1999 and June 2004. This led to a panel being established in December 2006, the proceedings of which continued until May 2013, with a mutually agreeable solution being reached. Japan asked to join the consultation in June 2006.|$|R
40|$|Shape {{is a key}} {{characteristic}} {{to determine}} the quality of outgoing flat-rolled products in the steel industry. It is greatly influenced by flatness, a feature to describe how {{the surface of a}} rolled product approaches a plane. Flatness is of the utmost importance in steelmaking, since it is used by most downstream processes and customers for the acceptance or rejection of rolled products. Flatness sensors compute flatness measurements based on comparing the length of several longitudinal fibers of the surface of the product under inspection. Two main different approaches are commonly used. On the one hand, most mechanical sensors measure the tensile stress across the width of the rolled product, while manufacturing and estimating the fiber lengths from this stress. On the other hand, optical sensors measure the length of the fibers by means of light patterns projected onto the product surface. In this paper, we review the techniques and the main sensors used in the steelmaking industry to measure and quantify flatness defects in <b>steel</b> plates, <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>strips.</b> Most of these techniques and sensors can be used in other industries involving rolling mills or continuous production lines, such as aluminum, copper and paper, to name a few. Encompassed in the special issue, State-of-the-Art Sensors Technology in Spain 2013, this paper also reviews the most important flatness sensors designed and developed for the steelmaking industry in Spain...|$|R

Numerical simulation is made to the composite slab in the whole process from initial loading to loading failure with reasonable Stimulation material and constitutive relations. The result of the calculation shows that promoting {{the strength of the}} concrete can largely promote the bearing capacity of the concrete, and the influence of the strength grade of the profiled <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> to the bearing capacity of the composite slab is smaller. The experimental result and test result accord well, testifying the reasonability of the established finite element and provide new method and way for simulating the load bearing process of composite slab. The <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> profiled <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> concrete composite slab system connects the steel beam <b>and</b> profiled <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> concrete composite slab with shear connectors, forming a new type building slab system that bears the load in the whole and with deformation compatibility.

Using a process map approach, the heat-treatability of <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> was studied theoretically focusing on carbon diffusion and cooling time characteristics. For validation purposes, 2 mm thick DP 590 <b>and</b> boron <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were laser-hardened using four types of heat sink: stainless steel, steel, copper, and no heat sink. Surface hardness, hardening width and depth were measured and analyzed over a wide range of process parameters. From this study, it was revealed that, when a heat sink is used, both cooling and carbon diffusion characteristics become roughly on par with those of the thick plate case, but the heat treatable region remains {{similar to that of the}} no heat sink case. The use of a heat sink was found to be an effective way of enhancing the hardenability of <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> the amount of enhancement is largely proportional to the heat sink thermal conductivity. close 1...|$|R
40|$|The damage onset and {{evolution}} are of significant {{importance in the}} forming processes of high strength steels. These two features and their influence on fracture have challenged the predictive capability of the conventional damage mechanics models. The present thesis contributes to the accurate fracture prediction of both high strength <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> heavy plates by proposing a new generalised hybrid damage mechanics model. A dual-phase <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> (DP 600) <b>and</b> a {{high strength low alloy}} steel plate (S 355 J 2 +N), which show very different relation patterns between damage and fracture, are investigated. For both steels, an easy and systematic material parameter calibration procedure with different experiments is designed. Good prediction applying the model to Nakajima tests for the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> to bending tests for the heavy plate is achieved. This validates the generalised transferability and flexibility of the proposed model for high strength steels with complex damage-fracture relation under various stress states. As the model is formulated in a phenomenological sense, it also suffers from two drawbacks: having a large number of material parameters and a weak link to the material microstructure. Therefore, two approaches are provided to overcome these shortcomings: justified simplification of the model formulation for specific applications and linking the microstructure to the phenomenological material parameters by multiscale modelling...|$|R

40|$|Currently, most cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> {{designs for}} {{composite}} slabs incorporate a repeating pattern of embossments {{along the entire}} length of the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> ribs. Their function is to hinder the longitudinal slipping, similarly to the corrugation of the rods in reinforced concrete, so that the longitudinal shear forces are transferred between steel and concrete. However, in composite slabs, the wedge effect of the embossments transforms the relative slipping of the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> concrete into forces acting on the interface, causing the transversal bending of the <b>sheet,</b> the separation <b>and</b> relative slipping between steel and concrete and, eventually, the complete detachment and the resistance drop. This paper is presenting the experimental results of a new bonding system, under patent by the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), ensuring the full connection between <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> concrete, applied to composite slabs. The system consists in producing a series of many small crown-shaped breakages on the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet,</b> which are oriented towards the side of the sheet that will remain in contact with the concrete. When fresh concrete is poured, the projections of the mentioned breakages are embedded therein; once the concrete is set, their function is to resist the shearing forces and separating forces generated between both materials when the composite steel-concrete element is loaded.
