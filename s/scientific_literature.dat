5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the <b>scientific</b> <b>literature</b> by Carl Linnaeus under the name Hydnum auriscalpium in his 1753 Species Plantarum. Linnaeus placed three other tooth fungi in the genus Hydnum: H.imbricatum, H.repandum, and H.tomentosum. In 1821, Samuel Frederick Gray considered H.auriscalpium to be sufficiently distinct from the other Hydnum species to warrant {{the creation of a}} new genus, Auriscalpium, to contain it. In the process, its name was changed to Auriscalpium vulgare.|$|E
5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896. Marsh had a long-time rivalry with Cope {{that was made}} famous in the Bone Wars of the late 19th century, {{in which the two}} tried to out-compete one another in the field and in <b>scientific</b> <b>literature.</b> Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also {{recognized}} Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes to belong to phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsia {{was coined}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890 to include dinosaurs {{possessing}} certain characteristic features, including horns, a rostral bone, teeth with two roots, fused neck vertebrae, and a forward-oriented pubis. Marsh considered the group distinct {{enough to warrant}} its own suborder within Ornithischia. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek κερας/keras meaning 'horn' and οψις/opsis meaning 'face'. As early as the 1960s, it was noted that the name Ceratopsia is actually incorrect linguistically and that it should be Ceratopia. However, this spelling, while technically correct, has been used only rarely in the <b>scientific</b> <b>literature,</b> {{and the vast majority of}} paleontologists continue to use Ceratopsia. As the ICZN does not govern taxa above the level of superfamily, this is unlikely to change.|$|E
30|$|Technological level {{assessment}} {{has been}} conducted by different assessors for various technologies, yet through similar methods, whereupon it has the following limitations. First, technological level was assessed via qualitative methods such as Delphi or the focus group interview. Although the qualitative methods are easy to conduct, often these methods are susceptible to methodological approaches, per se (KISTEP 2011). Consequently, results may be impacted per how an experimental group is composed. Second, the existing quantitative assessments, using <b>scientific</b> <b>literatures</b> and patent statistics, did not compute technological obsolescence caused by lapse of time. In practice, however, a technology has been obsolescent over time and become less valuable in the end, warranting the novel definition to account for this. In the current study, therefore this technological obsolescence was quantitatively computed utilizing the CHL (i.e., the period during which cumulative citation frequency reaches 50  %), and then, reflected for the assessment. Further, to compensate erstwhile defects, this study focused on technological <b>scientific</b> <b>literatures</b> and patents to which bibliometrics can be applied. The composite index of technological levels was calculated with literatures and patent indexes, weighted through principal component analysis (PCA) whilst technological obsolescence was assessed through the term, CHL.|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{progress}} of biological research, great demands are proposed for integrative knowledge-sharing systems to efficiently support collaboration of biological researchers from various fields. To fulfill such requirements, {{we have developed}} a data-centric knowledge-sharing platform WebLab for biologists to fetch, analyze, manipulate and share data under an intuitive web interface. Dedicated space is provided for users to store their input data and analysis results. Users can upload local data or fetch public data from remote databases, and then perform analysis using more than 260 integrated bioinformatic tools. These tools can be further organized as customized analysis workflows to accomplish complex tasks automatically. In addition to conventional biological data, WebLab also provides rich supports for <b>scientific</b> <b>literatures,</b> such as searching against full text of uploaded literatures and exporting citations into various well-known citation managers such as EndNote and BibTex. To facilitate team work among colleagues, WebLab provides a powerful and flexible sharing mechanism, which allows users to share input data, analysis results, <b>scientific</b> <b>literatures</b> and customized workflows to specified users or groups with sophisticated privilege settings.

5|$|No gamma-ray {{burst from}} {{within our own}} galaxy, the Milky Way, has been observed, and the {{question}} of whether one has ever occurred remains unresolved. In light of evolving understanding of gamma-ray bursts and their progenitors, the <b>scientific</b> <b>literature</b> records a growing number of local, past, and future GRB candidates. Long duration GRBs are related to superluminous supernovae, or hypernovae, and most luminous blue variables (LBVs), and rapidly spinning Wolf–Rayet stars are believed to end their life cycles in core-collapse supernovae with an associated long-duration GRB. Knowledge of GRBs, however, is from metal-poor galaxies of former epochs of the universe's evolution, and it is impossible to directly extrapolate to encompass more evolved galaxies and stellar environments with a higher metallicity, such as the Milky Way.|$|E

The type species of the genus Sarcoscypha, S.coccinea has been known by many names since its first appearance in the <b>scientific</b> <b>literature</b> in 1772. Phylogenetic analysis shows the species to be most closely related to other Sarcoscypha species that contain numerous small oil droplets in their spores, such as the North Atlantic island species S.macaronesica. Due to similar physical appearances and sometimes overlapping distributions, S.coccinea has often been confused with S.occidentalis, S.austriaca, and S.dudleyi.|$|E
