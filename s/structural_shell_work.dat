40|$|The Ten Thousand Islands (TTI) {{region of}} {{southwest}} Florida contains extensive prehistoric shell middens and mounds called <b>shell</b> <b>works.</b> Though <b>shell</b> <b>work</b> sites comprise {{some of the}} largest and most complicated prehistoric shell constructions in the world, prior to this study, none had been thoroughly examined in their spatial, temporal and functional contexts, and <b>shell</b> <b>work</b> sites remain very poorly understood. This thesis aims to define the archaeological characteristics of <b>shell</b> <b>work</b> sites within the TTI region, including their spatial patterns, function, geographic extent, and temporal affiliation. Though <b>shell</b> <b>work</b> sites are complex, complicated sites that are analogous to palimpsests, I argue that <b>shell</b> <b>work</b> sites are more than just large shell midden accumulations, amalgamations of shell mounds, or assemblages of features; they are distinct, socially constructed prehistoric landscapes. In order to understand these complex histories, I contend that they need to be examined on several complementary temporal and spatial scales, and I incorporate a multi-scalar landscape approach. This includes examining <b>shell</b> <b>work</b> sites as individually constructed features and sites, as human centered social landscapes, and within a larger, regional settlement pattern context. Central to my thesis is the hypothesis that <b>shell</b> <b>work</b> sites reflect changes in social complexity. I posit that <b>shell</b> <b>work</b> sites throughout the region are arranged in spatially similar patterns, ranging from small, simple shell midden rings, to massive islands completely constructed out of complex arrangements of shell. I test the theory that similarity or diversity in site layouts, and the presence or absence of certain architectural features reflects changes in community and social organization over time, and thus, social complexity.

50|$|The {{southwest}} {{coast of}} Florida has many large artificial structures known as <b>shell</b> <b>works,</b> made of <b>shells</b> piled up by human activity. <b>Shell</b> <b>works</b> are found from Charlotte Harbor southward through the Ten Thousand Islands. Many of the <b>shell</b> <b>works</b> {{are surrounded by}} water, forming artificial islands, often called keys. The <b>shell</b> <b>works</b> were the sites of villages, occupied by people who depended primarily on fishing, but also hunted and gathered wild foods. <b>Shells</b> <b>works</b> have complex structures, apparently designed to separate spaces by use; domestic, public and sacred. The {{northern part of the}} range in which <b>shell</b> <b>works</b> are found, from Charlotte Harbor through Estero Bay, was occupied by people of the Caloosahatchee culture. The southern part of the range, including Marco Island and the Ten Thousand Islands, was occupied by people of the Ten Thousand Islands region of the Glades culture. Both the Caloosahatchee culture area and the Ten Thousand Islands region of the Glades culture area were occupied by the Calusa people at the time of first contact with Europeans. Archaeological evidence indicates that artifacts in the Ten Thousand Islands region changed from resembling those of the Glades culture to resembling those of the Caloosahatchee culture around 1300, indicating absorption by or strong influence from the Calusa. Schwadron notes that many of the <b>shell</b> <b>works</b> sites in the Ten Thousand Islands appear to have been abandoned shortly before 1300, and suggests that the people of those sites may have migrated into Calusa territory.|$|R

40|$|The ARIES-CS study {{focusing}} on the conceptual de-sign and assessment of a compact stellarator power plant identified the important advantages and key issues asso-ciated with such a design. The coil configuration and structural support approach represent key design chal-lenges, with the final design and material choices af-fected {{by a number of}} material and geometry constraints. This paper describes the design configuration and analy-sis and material choices for the ARIES-CS magnets and its structure. To meet aggressive cost and assembly/ maintenance goals, the magnets are designed as lifetime components. Due to the very complex geometry, {{one of the goals of}} the study was to provide a robust operational design. This decision has significant implications on cost and manufacturing requirements. Concepts with both con-ventional and advanced superconductors have been ex-plored.

The coil <b>structural</b> <b>shells</b> are then bolted together to form a strong <b>structural</b> <b>shell</b> to react the net radial forces.

As the customization is focused primary in the joints of the structure, standard dimension, locally sourced structural members can be used. By embedding assembly information onto the physical joints, the system has the capacity to simplify the construction of complex shell structures by workers with basic construction skills. Flat-packed joints can be shipped to remote sites without heavy structural members thereby reducing transportation costs and the overall embodied energy. By lowering cost and simplifying construction of large span structures, the project is intended to extend the benefits of digitally driven design to rural, remote or under-privileged communities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the design and}} fabrication of non-uniform <b>structural</b> <b>shell</b> systems. <b>Structural</b> <b>shells,</b> particularly gridshells, {{have a long history}} but due to their complexity and the accompanying high cost of construction, their application has been limited. The research proposes a method for integrating the design and fabrication processes such that complex double curved reticulated frames can be constructed efficiently, from prefabricated components, requiring significantly less formwork than is typical. A significant aspect of the method has been the development of software tools that allow for both algorithmic form-finding and the direct control of robotic fabrication equipment from within the same modelling package. A recent case-study is examined where the methodology has been applied to construct a reticulated shell structure {{in the form of a}} partial vault. Components were prefabricated using 6 -axis robotic fabrication equipment. Individual parts are designed such that the assembly of components guides the form of the vault, requiring no centring to create the desired shape. Algorithmically generated machine instructions controlled a sequence of three tool changes for each part, using a single modular fixture, greatly increasing accuracy. The complete integration of computational design techniques and fabrication methodologies now enables the economical deployment of non-uniform structurally optimised reticulated frames...|$|R
