5|$|Brown {{appointed}} {{a group of}} insurance experts to study the state's policies and put them out for bid, ultimately saving $2 million. He also required competitive bids from banks where <b>state</b> <b>funds</b> were deposited; the extra interest generated by this process generated an additional $50 million in revenue to the general fund. He opened communications and contacts with Japan, {{setting the stage for}} future economic relations between that country and Kentucky. Among his other accomplishments as governor were the implementation of competitive bidding for government contracts and passage of a weight-distance tax on trucks.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{resource}} allocation models are important tools that serve to maximise efficient utilisation of <b>state</b> <b>funding</b> and {{of human resources}} in times {{of economic and social}} change. The focus of this paper is on universities in developing countries and the University of Botswana in particular. Faced with diminishing revenue support from <b>state</b> <b>funding</b> and the demands of global competitiveness associated with knowledge production there is pressure for <b>state</b> <b>funded</b> universities to attract <b>funding</b> from the <b>state</b> <b>funding</b> models and other international organisations through their performance in programme and research offerings.

40|$|Fellow {{members of}} the Academic Planning Committee and others here today, I am {{appearing}} before you to speak about three proposed cuts to the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources budget.

40|$|As {{the cost}} of college {{continues}} to increase, <b>state</b> <b>funding</b> for higher education is decreasing. Students now face a growing burden to finance their education. As a result, <b>state</b> <b>funded</b> student grant programs, including need and nonneed based programs, are becoming increasingly important to improving the accessibility of higher education. Using data presented by the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs’ Annual Survey Reports on State-Sponsored Student Financial Aid for 2002 - 2003, 2006 - 2007, and 2011 - 2012, this paper seeks to understand what factors best predict the structure and outcomes of <b>state</b> <b>funded</b> grant programs. These factors include state educational attainment levels, income inequality, and a multidimensional measure of state partisanship. While I find some correlation between <b>state</b> <b>funding</b> for student grant programs and the independent variables of state income inequality and state educational attainment levels, there is no relationship found between political factors and <b>state</b> <b>funding</b> for student grant programs. I conclude less numerically observable variables within the states and within legislatures {{play a role in}} determining <b>funding</b> allocations for <b>state</b> <b>funded</b> student grant programs...|$|R

5|$|Though he had {{formally}} {{retired as}} a teacher to join the Daily Governance Body, from the 1960s Soeman was involved with several education foundations.

He also maintained ties with the provincial government; in 1966, he formally became part of the Regional Representatives' Council, and in 1976, at the recommendation of Governor Arifin Achmad, he went on the hajj using <b>state</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E
5|$|A fire on {{the night}} of 6November 1995 {{destroyed}} or damaged all the structures within the Rova complex shortly before it was due to be inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Although officially declared an accident, rumours persist that politically motivated arson may have been the actual cause of the fire. The chapel and tombs, as well as Besakana and Mahitsielafanjaka, have since been fully restored with bilateral government donations, <b>state</b> <b>funds</b> and grants from intergovernmental and private donors. Completion of the reconstruction of the Manjakamiadana exterior is estimated for 2012, while interior restoration work will continue until at least 2013. Once the building is fully restored, Manjakamiadana will serve as a museum showcasing royal artefacts saved from destruction in the fire.|$|E
5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most of the road was paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} <b>state</b> <b>funds</b> procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city on a voluntary basis. <b>State</b> <b>funds</b> were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for white students from the county to voluntarily attend city magnet schools, {{in an effort to}} desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent of black students in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.|$|E

5|$|The EES had sizable {{and growing}} {{support from the}} state of Georgia and its Industrial Development Council, which {{developed}} products and methods and provided technical assistance for Georgia industry. However, due in part to efforts made by Boyd and previous station director Gerald Rosselot, the station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from the federal government. In 1971, funding to both Georgia Tech's academic units and the EES began to suffer due to a sharp decline in <b>state</b> <b>funds</b> combined with cuts to federal science, research, and education funding {{after the end of the}} Space Race funding boom. Similar institutions, such as the Battelle Memorial Institute, Stanford Research Institute, and the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute had weathered this storm by becoming exceedingly good at obtaining research contracts.|$|E

The Defenders opposed any pupil assignment plan as too moderate a response. Accommodating this extremist sentiment, the pupil assignment plan approved at the July 2 meeting was fairly weak.
