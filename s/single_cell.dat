The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> organism to one of many cells.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} part of M. xanthus behavior {{is its ability to}} move on a solid surface by a mechanism called [...] "gliding". Gliding Motility is a method of locomotion that allows for movement, without the help of a flagella, on a solid surface. Gliding Motility is separated into two groups for the M. xanthus: A-motility (adventurous) and S-motility (social). In A motility, <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> move, resulting in a distribution with many <b>single</b> <b>cells.</b> In S motility, <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> do not move, but cells that are close to one another move. This leads to a spatial distribution of cells with lots of clusters and few isolated <b>single</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportion}} of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different small molecules might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a <b>single</b> <b>cell.</b> Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{buckling}} nanoneedle {{as a force}} sensor for stiffness characterization of <b>single</b> <b>cells.</b> The buckling nanoneedle was easily fabricated by using focused ion beam etching from a commercialized atomic force microscope cantilever. There are notable advantages of using buckling nanoneedle for <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> stiffness characterizations. First, severe cell damage from an excessive indentation force could be prevented. Second, large variations in <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> stiffness property could be easily detected either from the dented mark on the cell surface after the indentation and/or by comparing the buckling length of the nanoneedle during the indentation. The calibrations of the buckling nanoneedle were done experimentally and numerically. The calibration results from both methods showed a good agreement. The calibration data show {{the relationship between the}} indentation force and the buckling length of the nanoneedle. This relationship was used for obtaining force data during a nanoindentation experiment between a buckling nanoneedle and <b>single</b> <b>cells.</b> We performed in situ measurements of mechanical properties of individual W 303 wild-type yeast cells by using a buckling nanoneedle inside an integrated SEM (ESEM) -nanomanipulator system.

5|$|This complex {{scenario}} {{leads to}} the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient {{in the course of}} one day. This variability is compounded when a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping {{back and forth between the}} two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells {{on the outside and}} another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness {{of the differences between the}} groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E
5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In asexually reproducing organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually reproducing organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid, or contain only one copy of each gene. The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> that has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father.|$|E

40|$|When freshly {{isolated}} porcine thyroid {{cells are}} stimulated with thyrotropin (TSH) they organize to form functional follicles in conventional substrate-adherent culture. Cell aggregation {{is essential for}} follicular reorganization {{and is likely to}} be influenced by the balance between cell-cell adhesion (promoting aggregation) and cell-substrate adhesion (favoring spreading and monolayer formation). Recently we observed that TSH potentiated cell-cell adhesion and in the present study we have sought evidence that TSH might also regulate cell-substrate adhesion. Two parameters of cell-substrate adhesion, namely, cell attachment to collagen and cell spreading upon collagen, were measured using preparations of isolated <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> and of multicellular aggregates. TSH had no effect upon the attachment or spreading of <b>single</b> <b>cells,</b> but inhibited aggregate spreading without affecting aggregate attachment. The possibility that cell-cell contact modulated the response to TSH in aggregates, but not in <b>single</b> <b>cells,</b> was confirmed using a cell-free membrane preparation which inhibited the spreading of <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> but not their rate of attachment. Moreover, TSH potentiated the inhibitory effect of membranes on the spreading of <b>single</b> <b>cells.</b> Heparin also specifically inhibited the spreading of both <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> and cell aggregates, suggesting that a heparin-sensitive adhesive mechanism might be recruited as thyroid cells spread. We conclude that thyroid cell-substrate adhesion is regulated by a synergistic interaction between cell-cell contact and TSH which preferentially inhibited cell spreading but not attachment. Such contact-dependent inhibition of cell spreading is predicted to preserve cell aggregates and hence contribute to the maintenance of thyroid follicular differentiation in vitro...|$|R

5|$|The {{root system}} and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually non{{photosynthetic}} root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system. Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots. Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots. Roots that spread out close to the surface, {{such as those of}} willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, {{as is the case with}} Saintpaulia, or even a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> – which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a <b>single</b> <b>cell.</b> The males emerge first, and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E

5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each individual animal is distinctly male or female. The breeding season starts in late November and continues until early March. After internal fertilization the female produces and spawns a long, gelatinous tubular structure containing multiple eggs. This structure then coils itself and compacts, forming a creamy-white egg mass. Each egg mass may contain 50,000–70,000 eggs; the females usually lay them on seagrass, where they remain attached. In about 110–130 hours the embryo of L.canarium grows from a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> to a veliger (a larval form common to marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) and then hatches. The hatching process takes 12–15 hours. After hatching, the larvae can be assigned to four distinct developmental stages throughout their short planktonic life (based on morphological features and other characteristics). Usually, larvae up to 3 days old are Stage I veligers; 4–8-day-old larvae are Stage II; 9–16-day-old larvae are Stage III, and larvae from 17 days to metamorphosis are Stage IV. L.canarium larvae develop faster compared to other species in the same family, including the West Indian fighting conch (Strombus pugilis) and the milk conch (Lobatus costatus). Larval development may be highly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and the quality and availability of food. Metamorphosis in L.canarium can be recognised by loss of the larval velar lobes {{and the development of}} the typical leaping motion of juvenile true conches.|$|E
