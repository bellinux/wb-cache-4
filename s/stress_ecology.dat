Van Straalen (2003), in particular, argued that the field had diversified to become <b>Stress</b> <b>Ecology</b> and that, as the effects of anthropogenic toxicants compound existing, natural stressors, exclusive study of their effects in an ecological context was nonsensical. Whilst this proposal is well argued, it is odd of Van Straalen to have specified solely [...] "ecology" [...] as the field when the original field of ecotoxicology was intended to cover all levels of biological organisation from molecular-level causes to ecosystem-level effects.

40|$|We {{have little}} idea if silicon {{has a large}} or small role in {{alleviating}} plant <b>stress</b> in <b>ecology.</b> Using predominantly agricultural taxa, hundreds of single-species studies have demonstrated the facility of silicon (Si) to alleviate diverse abiotic stresses in plants. Knowledge of the mechanisms of Si-mediated stress alleviation is progressing, but a quantitative assessment of the alleviative capacity of Si, which could elucidate plant Si function more broadly, was lacking. We combined the results of 145 experiments to statistically assess the responses of stressed plants to Si supply across multiple plant families and abiotic stresses. We interrogated our database to determine whether stressed plants increased in dry mass and net assimilation rate, oxidative stress markers were reduced, antioxidant responses were increased and whether element uptake showed consistent changes when supplied with Si. Similarities in responses across families provide strong support for a role of Si in the alleviation of abiotic stress in natural systems.

40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} is traditionally classified as either localized or diffuse. Local pollution {{comes from a}} point source that emits a well-defined cocktail of chemicals, distributed in the environment {{in the form of}} a gradient around the source. Diffuse pollution comes from many sources, small and large, that cause an erratic distribution of chemicals, interacting with those from other sources into a complex mixture of low to moderate concentrations over a large area. There is no good method for ecological risk assessment of such types of pollution. We argue that effects of diffuse contamination in the field must be analysed in the wider framework of <b>stress</b> <b>ecology.</b> A multivariate approach can be applied to filter effects of contaminants from the many interacting factors at the ecosystem level. Four case studies are discussed (1) functional and structural properties of terrestrial model ecosystems, (2) physiological profiles of microbial communities, (3) detritivores in reedfield litter, and (4) benthic invertebrates in canal sediment. In each of these cases the data were analysed by multivariate statistics and associations between ecological variables and the levels of contamination were established.

If frequency prevents the variable’s return to similar pre-event dynamics and drives or shifts it to a new trajectory, then we are facing stress.

We exposed 1 -day-old mummies (dead aphids containing the parasitoid pupa) for 4 weeks to combinations of two low temperatures (4 and 0 ◦C, 0 ◦C being the most stressful) and two thermal regimes (constant and fluctuating, constant being the most stressful), representing four stress levels. 3. The present results showed that resistant individuals occurred only in the most stressful treatment (0 ◦C, constant temperature), which induced a higher mortality rate. These resistant individuals performed almost as well as those of the control, but showed a reduction in their size. The fluctuating regimes, at both temperatures, presented a high emergence rate, but at the expense of higher lipid consumption. Unexpectedly, the fluctuating regime associated with the presumably more stressful temperature (0 ◦C) produced individuals without any decrease in the measured fitness traits, in contrast to the treatment expected to be less stressful (4 ◦C, fluctuating temperature). 4.

40|$|It is {{critical}} to search for, and to apply, robust generalizations in conservation biology as species-specific data on endangered species are often limited. While generalizations are common in conservation genetics, where processes are treated {{on the scale of}} generations, the unique population dynamics of species are often <b>stressed</b> in <b>ecology</b> and conservation management. Is the apparent uniqueness of population attributes partly an artefact of measurement scale? One facet of this debate is the question of whether extinction risk scales better to years or to generations. To resolve this issue, the extinction risk of 100 well-studied vertebrate taxa was estimated using stochastic computer projections and analyses conducted to determine whether risk related better to years or generations. Relative strengths of evidence for alternative hypotheses were assessed using information theory. Extinction risk, assessed as the population size required for a 90 % probability of persistence for 100 years, was strongly related to generation length. Conversely, when extinction risk was assessed for a fixed number of generations, there was no support for a relationship between risk and years. This finding has ramifications for assessing and reporting extinction risk because it shows that (1) crucial signals for the effective management of threatened species may not be detected when risk is measured on a scale of years alone; (2) correcting for generation length will allow data from a wider range of species to be used as defaults for species with limited data; (3) generational-scale tests of factors affecting extinction risk are more powerful than year-based ones.

Identification of yield-limiting constraints in the plant–soil–atmosphere continuum {{are the key to}} improved management of plant water <b>stress.</b> Crop <b>ecology</b> provides a systematic approach for this purpose integrating soil hydrology and plant physiology into the context of crop production. We review main climate, soil and plant properties and processes that determine yield in different water-limited environments. From this analysis, management measures for cropping systems under specific drought conditions are derived. Major findings from literature analysis are as follows. (1) Unproductive water losses such as evaporation and runoff increase from continental in-season rainfall climates to storage-dependent winter rainfall climates. Highest losses occur under tropical residual moisture regimes with short intense rainy season. (2) Sites with a climatic dry season require adaptation via phenology and water saving to ensure stable yields. Intermittent droughts can be buffered via the root system, which is still largely underutilised for better stress resistance. (3) At short-term better management options such as mulching and date of seeding allow to adjust cropping systems to site constraints. Adapted cultivars can improve the synchronisation between crop water demand and soil supply. At long term, soil hydraulic and plant physiological constraints can be overcome by changing tillage systems and breeding new varieties with higher stress resistance. (4) Interactions between plant and soil, particularly in the rhizosphere, are a way towards better crop water supply. Targeted management of such plant–soil interactions is still at infancy.

40|$|Mechanistic {{models are}} {{essential}} tools for interpreting and predicting {{the consequences of}} a changing environment and stressors such as pollution on the life histories of marine organisms. Here, we apply the simple and generic energy-budget model DEBkiss to the life history of the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Model modifications were needed to accommodate the copepod life cycle, which deviates in several respects from most other animals (e. g., a sudden stop of growth after the final moult). We identified an acceleration of growth in the early copepodite stages, which could be linked to an increase in the specific feeding rate of the animals. Lipid storage, an essential element of C. finmarchicus biology, was successfully captured with the reproduction buffer of the DEBkiss model. The resulting model was fitted to a detailed data set from the literature and was able to explain growth, development and lipid storage from egg to adult, at different temperatures and food availabilities, within a single consistent framework. The parameterised model could subsequently be used to elucidate the energetic constraints on gonad maturation and reproduction. Interestingly, the overhead costs for egg production seem to be substantially higher than the default value applied in DEB-based studies. The current model provides a solid basis for applications in <b>stress</b> <b>ecology,</b> although our model analysis also identified several knowledge gaps.

We first provide a comprehensive review of the genus as an ecological model including what is currently known about the major lineages of Fucus species with respect to hybridization, ecotypic differentiation and speciation; as well as life history, population structure and geographic distribution. We then review our current understanding of both extrinsic (abiotic/biotic) and intrinsic (genetic) stress(es) on Fucus species and how they interact with each other.

40|$|Background Providing {{the context}} for the {{evolution}} of life-history traits, habitat features constrain successful ecological and physiological strategies. In vertebrates, a key response to life’s challenges is the activation of the Stress (HPA) and Gonadal (HPG) axes. Much of the interest in <b>stress</b> <b>ecology</b> is motivated by the desire to understand the physiological mechanisms in which the environment affects fitness. As reported in the literature, several intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect variability in hormone levels. In both social and non-social animals, the frequency and type of interaction with conspecifics, as well as the status in social species, can affect HPA axis activity, resulting in changes in the reproductive success of animals. We predicted that a social environment can affect both guanaco axes by increasing the secretion of testosterone (T) and Glucocorticoid (GCs) in response to individual social interactions and the energetic demands of breeding. Assuming that prolonged elevated levels of GCs over time can be harmful to individuals, it is predicted that the HPA axis suppresses the HPG axis and causes T levels to decrease, as GCs increase. Methods All of the data for individuals were collected by non-invasive methods (fecal samples) to address hormonal activities. This is a novel approach in physiological ecology because feces are easily obtained through non-invasive sampling in animal populations. Results As expected, there was a marked adrenal (p-value =. 3. 4 e− 12) and gonadal (p-value = 0. 002656) response due to seasonal variation in Lama guanicoe. No significant differences were found in fecal GCs metabolites between males/females*season for the entire study period (p-value = 0. 2839). Despite the seasonal activity variation in the hormonal profiles, our results show a positive correlation (p-value = 1. 952 e− 11, COR = 0. 50) between the adrenal and gonadal system. The marked endocrine (r 2  =  0. 806) and gonad (r 2  =  0. 7231) response due to seasonal variation in male guanaco individuals highlights the individual’s energetic demands according to life-history strategies. This is a remarkable result because no inhibition was found between the axes as theory suggests. Finally, the dataset was used to build a reactive scope model for guanacos. Discussion Guanacos cope with the trade-off between sociability and reproductive benefits and costs, by regulating their GCs and T levels on a seasonal basis, suggesting an adaptive role of both axes to different habitat pressures. The results presented here highlight the functional role of stress and gonad axes on a critical phase of a male mammal’s life—the mating period—when all of the resources are at the disposal of the male and must be used to maximize the chances for reproductive success...|$|E

Consequently, researchers have adopted portable clinical analysers that were developed for the analysis of human blood characteristics, but often without thoroughly validating these systems for their use on fish. The aim of our study was to test the suitability of the i-STAT system, the most commonly used portable clinical analyser in studies on fish, for analysing blood gases and acid–base status in elasmobranchs, over a broad range of conditions and using the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) as a model organism. Our results indicate that the i-STAT system can generate useful {{measurements of}} whole blood pH, and the use of appropriate correction factors may increase the accuracy of results. The i-STAT system was, however, unable to generate reliable results for measurements of partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2) and the derived parameter of haemoglobin O 2 saturation. This is probably due to the effect of a closed-system temperature change on PO 2 within the i-STAT cartridge {{and the fact that the}} temperature correction algorithms used by i-STAT assume a human temperature dependency of haemoglobin–O 2 binding; in many ectotherms, this assumption will lead to equivocal i-STAT PO 2 results. The in vivo partial pressure of CO 2 (PCO 2) in resting sandbar sharks is probably below the detection limit for PCO 2 in the i-STAT system, and the measurement of higher PCO 2 tensions was associated with a large measurement error. In agreement with previous work, our results indicate that the i-STAT system can generate useful data on whole blood pH in fishes, but not blood gases...|$|R
40|$|If {{academics}} and intellectuals are {{to play a}} meaningful part in addressing the urgent issues that humanity faces in the twenty-first century—those of war and peace, social justice, democracy, cultural diversity, and ecological sus-tainability—it is incumbent upon us to gain an analytical understanding of globalization as the underlying structural dynamic that drives social, political, economic, and cultural processes around the world. My colleague Richard Appelbaum and I recently put out a call for a critical globalization studies (henceforth, CGS) : We believe that the dual objective of understanding globalization and engaging in global social activism can best be expressed {{in the idea of}} a critical globalization studies. We believe that as scholars it is incumbent upon us to explore the relevance of academic research to the burning political issues and social struggles of our epoch, to the many conflicts, hardships, and hopes bound up with globalization. More directly stated, we are not indifferent observers studying globalization as a sort of detached academic exercise. Rather, we are passionately concerned with the adverse impact of globalization on billions of people as well as our increasingly <b>stressed</b> planetary <b>ecology.</b> Moreover, we believe that it is our obligation as scholars to place an understanding of the multifaceted processes of globalization in the ser-vice of those individuals and organizations that are dedicated to fighting its harsh edges. We are not anti-globalists, but we are staunchly opposed to the highly preda-tory forms that globalization has assumed throughout history, and particularly dur-ing the past quarter century.

40|$|The use of {{biomarkers}} {{is considered}} a promising alternative, or complement, to traditional ecotoxicological assays. Toxic effects are often initially manifested at the molecular or biochemical level, biomarkers are therefore used as sensitive indicators of toxic exposure. Ideally, biomarkers would also indicate reduced fitness and possible later effects at the individual or population levels. However, implementing biomarkers in ecotoxicology is challenging and few biomarkers have an established connection to reduced individual fitness. The aim of this thesis was to increase the value and improve the interpretation of biomarker responses in ecotoxicological studies by examining the impact of confounding factors {{and the relationship between}} oxidative biomarkers and reproductive effects in crustaceans. The sensitivity of biomarkers was confirmed in paper I as toxic effects of pharmaceuticals with conserved drug target orthologs were observed at the molecular and biochemical levels both earlier and at lower concentrations than effects on mortality and reproduction. No toxic effects were observed for the pharmaceutical without identified drug target orthologs, thus stressing the importance of considering toxic mechanisms and being aware of the most likely target when evaluating toxic effects also in non-target species. Many xenobiotics and environmental stressors interfere with oxidative processes, making oxidative biomarkers interesting to study in ecotoxicology and <b>stress</b> <b>ecology.</b> Still, feeding rate was identified as a confounding factor for antioxidant capacity (assayed as oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and lipid peroxidation in ecotoxicological studies (paper II). However, ORAC normalized to protein was independent of altered feeding rates, hence it can be applied as a suitable exposure biomarker without considering alterations and effects of feeding rate. The connection between reproduction and oxidative stress is dual, as reproduction both can be inhibited by oxidative stress and induce pro-oxidative processes. Further, a positive association was found between ORAC and the occurrence of embryo aberrations in the benthic amphipod Monoporeia affinis (paper III). An association between antioxidant defense and reproduction was also observed for Daphnia magna (paper IV). Threshold values for identification of exposed individuals and prediction of possible later reproductive effects were established for ORAC. This thesis has contributed to diminishing some of the knowledge gaps limiting the use of oxidative biomarkers in ecotoxicology, by contributing to increased understanding of how oxidative biomarkers relate to important life-traits. Moreover, ORAC has been identified as a suitable biomarker of not only exposure, but also reproductive effects. Future research should continue to establish connections between biomarker responses and effects at higher levels, and focus on providing defined threshold values to enable predictions about later effects.    At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Manuscript.

40|$|Coral reef {{ecosystems}} {{around the}} world face a number of threats, including ocean acidification, increased ocean temperatures due to anthropogenic global warming (AGW), increased disease outbreaks, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, terrestrial sedimentation, eutrophication, pollution, and fishing pressure. At the same time, coral reef ecosystems provide valuable direct and indirect economic and social benefits {{to millions of people}} worldwide. However, the intensity and spatial distribution of threats are likely to change with increasing human population and economic development, and thus understanding how multiple stressors may interact and affect coral reefs – particularly in the face of incomplete knowledge about these stressors – is an issue of pressing importance. This thesis aims to explore and advance the understanding of interactions between multiple stressors and their effects as they pertain to coral reefs generally and the Great Barrier Reef specifically. I review several of the components that are integral to this issue, including: stressors and <b>stress</b> <b>ecology,</b> research to date on the issue of multiple stressors and coral reefs, the multiple threats from climate change to coral reefs, and approaches to modelling and managing multiple stressors. The overall aim of this thesis is to quantitatively evaluate the importance of multiple stressor interactions to coral reef ecosystems and to assess alternative management approaches to mitigating the effects of potentially increased prevalence and severity of these stressors. I do this through both assessing the state of existing knowledge as well as by using new approaches to model stressors and stressor effects {{within the context of the}} GBR. In addition, I seek to provide an example of how these effects can be conceptualized and managed more effectively in the face of uncertain knowledge and incomplete data. The specific research objectives of my thesis are as follows: 1. To synthesize the available knowledge of multiple stressors on coral reefs; 2. To use the occurrence of bleaching and disease in the GBR as a case study to determine the spatial and temporal overlap of these stressors; 3. To use expert knowledge to identify key uncertainties and knowledge gap(s) regarding multiple stressor interactions on coral reef systems; 4. To apply expert-elicited knowledge about stressors and stressor interactions on the GBR to map potential threats to reefs under a variety of different climate change and management scenarios. Chapter 2 addresses research objective 1 by using a formal literature search to provide the foundation for a qualitative and selected quantitative meta-analysis of multiple-stressors as they pertains to coral reef ecosystems, and by examining the evidence for the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions between stressors. Here I investigate stressor interactions in two ways: first by examining stressor interactions with other stressors, and secondly by looking at potentially synergistic effects between two or more stressors on a response variable (where stressors interact to produce an effect that is greater than purely additive). For stressor-stressor interactions, I found 176 studies that examined interactions between at least two stressors. Applying network analysis to analyse relationships between stressors, I found that pathogens were exacerbated by more co-stressors than any other stressor, while sedimentation, storms, and water temperature directly affected the largest number of other stressors. Pathogens, nutrients, and crown-of-thorns starfish were the most-influenced stressors. In terms of responses to multiple stressors, I found 187 studies that examined the effects of two or more stressors on a third dependent variable. The interaction of irradiance and temperature on corals has been the subject of more research than any other combination of stressors, with many studies reporting a synergistic effect on coral symbiont photosynthetic performance. Second, I performed a quantitative meta-analysis of existing literature on the interaction between temperature and irradiance. Although the sample size was small, I found that the mean effect size of combined treatments was statistically indistinguishable from a purely additive interaction. This chapter provides evidence that considerable gaps remain in our knowledge regarding numerous stressor interactions and effects, and that the available evidence is inconclusive on whether synergistic effects are widespread in coral reef systems. Chapter 3 addresses research objective 2 by using data from the AIMS Long-term Monitoring Program (LTMP) to examine the spatial and temporal overlap of bleaching and disease in the GBR. Coral bleaching and disease have often been hypothesized to be mutually reinforcing or co-occurring, but much of the research supporting this has only drawn an implicit connection through common environmental predictors. I examine whether an explicit relationship between white syndrome and bleaching exists using assemblage-level monitoring data from up to 112 sites on the reef slopes spread throughout the GBR over 11 years of monitoring. None of the temperature metrics commonly used to predict mass bleaching performed strongly when applied to these data, and the inclusion of bleaching as a predictor did not improve model in predicting white syndrome outbreaks. Conversely, the inclusion of white syndrome as a predictor did not improve models of bleaching. Evidence for spatial co-occurrence of bleaching and white syndrome at the assemblage level in this dataset was also very weak. These results suggest the hypothesized relationship between bleaching and disease events may be weaker than previously thought, and more likely to be driven by common responses to environmental stressors, rather than directly facilitating one another. Chapter 4 addresses research objective 3 by exploring the use of Bayesian Belief Networks (hereafter BBNs) in conjunction with expert elicitation to determine the degree of expert consensus about the greatest threats to the GBR, and assessing the degree of confidence that experts have about the effects of various stressors both alone and in combination. BBNs are finding increasing application in adaptive ecosystem management where data are limited and uncertainty is high. I used a formal expert-elicitation process to obtain estimates of outcomes associated with a variety of scenarios in the GBR that combined stressors both within and outside the control of local managers. Among consulted experts, there was much stronger consensus about certain stressor effects - such as between temperature anomalies and bleaching – than others, such as the relationship between water quality and coral health. In general, models generated from the mean responses from experts predicted that climate change effects could potentially overshadow the mitigating effects of management actions to reduce local stressors. Chapter 5 addresses research objective 4 by implementing the model developed in Chapter 4 in a spatial way through the use of several scenarios. Coral reefs are one example of an ecosystem where management of local stressors may be a way of mitigating or delaying the effects of climate change. In this chapter, I use a combination of an expert-elicited BBN and empirical, spatial environmental data to examine how hypothetical scenarios of climate change and local management would result in different outcomes for coral reefs on the GBR. I also assess whether reefs within the existing protected area network differ in their predicted probability of decline from reefs outside the protected area network. Parameterizing the BBN using the mean responses from my expert pool resulted in predictions of limited efficacy of local management in combating the effects of climate change; however, there was considerable variability in expert responses; thus, I also examine the effect that using optimistic versus pessimistic expert responses has on the model predictions of coral cover decline on the GBR. Many reefs within the central GBR appear to be at risk of further decline, but further parameterization of the model as data and knowledge become available will improve predictive power. This approach serves as a proof of concept for subsequent work that can fine-tune parameters and explore uncertainties in predictions of responses to management. My thesis thus addresses two critical elements that are often missing from studies examining the conservation implications of multiple stressors (especially on coral reefs) : interactions between stressor/stressor effects and assessing the effect of different management options on these interactions...|$|E
40|$|Breeding pigs has {{had many}} {{problems}} at present. Due to them {{number and the}} range of breeds have been decreasing significantly. Therefore the import of pork to the Czech market seems to be a very probable consequence of this state. This may substantially harm Czech producers. At the same time the solution of the specialist questions in the field of reproduction, solved by the workplaces of the Czech Republic, may be made more complicated. Problems that appear in this field have had a relatively long history. Their accumulation leads to serious thinking about how to reasonably proceed in the field of the research of the reproduction potential of a pig. The complexity of this process is multiplied by the different physiology of both animal sexotypes. The imbalance in these physiological processes has developed in a dissociated way which increases the entropy in a present view of the problem solution. The revision of the state shows that greater chances exist in the case of influencing the reproduction of boars than that of sows. It also shows that the main role is played by the selection of animals for breeding with possible application of additives of natural origin which do not play the role of medicaments. Hormonal interventions in the form of medicaments administered in an exogenic way have not been considered realistic at present. It is being proved that these additives should comprise a wider group of compounds influencing not only the reproduction system but also other physiological functions (<b>stress,</b> colon <b>ecology).</b> This, together with breeding interventions, can significantly contribute to the improvement of reproduction parameters. At the same time it has to be considered that the application of natural substances in pig breeding is new and has not been described yet. Therefore there is no other choice than to use the knowledge from the closest suitable area – human application (Opletal, Šimerda 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|ReefBase {{provides}} {{access to}} data and information on coral reefs and associated shallow tropical habitats. The site consists of three main sections: Reef Status, a Database, and the Users Area. Reef Status presents a compilation of summary reports pertaining to and indexed by global, regional, and national scales. Common topics in the reports include: reef benthos, reef fish, natural and anthropogenic threats, climate change impacts, marine protected areas, monitoring and management capacity, government policy, laws, and regulations, and author conclusions and recommendations for reef conservation. The Database provides for two sequential levels of searching: after {{a country or region}} is chosen, an overview provides general reef related information on that locale. The user can then further his/her search using one of three additional menus: Coral Reef, Protected Area, and Image/Map. The Coral Reef option currently returns basic information on nearly 10, 000 reefs; in the future, additional information will address <b>ecology,</b> <b>stresses,</b> exploitation and management. The Protected Area option returns protections information largely compiled by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre. The third search option, Image/Map, returns visuals according to four criteria: Type (e. g., aerial, maps, underwater); Author; Stress (e. g., coastal development, oil pollution, siltation); or Lifeform (e. g., coralline algae, sea urchin, submassive). In addition, GIS data will soon be made available under this option. The final section on the site, the Users Area, provides both contact information and means of contributing to the site's contents.

Urinary based enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) and radio-immunoassay (RIA) have enabled the rapid quantification of reproductive and stress hormones in amphibians (Anura: Amphibia). These methods {{can be used}} to assess the ovarian and testicular endocrine functions, and physiological stress in captive and free-living populations with minimal disturbances. Non-invasive endocrine monitoring has therefore greatly advanced our knowledge of the functioning of the stress endocrine system - the hypothalamo-pituitary interrenal [HPI] axis and the reproductive endocrine system - the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal [HPG] axis in amphibian physiological <b>stress</b> response, reproductive <b>ecology,</b> health & welfare and survival. Biological (physiological) validation is necessary for obtaining the excretory lag-time of hormone metabolites. Urinary based EIA for the major reproductive hormones, estradiol and progesterone in females and testosterone in males, {{can be used to}} track the reproductive hormone profiles in relation to reproductive behavior and environmental data in free-living anurans. Urinary based corticosterone metabolite EIA can be used to assess the sub-lethal impacts of biological stressors (such as invasive species and pathogenic diseases) as well as anthropogenic induced environmental stressors (e. g. extreme temperatures) on free-living populations. Non-invasive endocrine methods can also assist in the diagnosis of success or failure of captive breeding programmes by measuring the longitudinal patterns of changes in reproductive hormones and corticosterone within captive anurans and comparing the endocrine profiles with health records and reproductive behavior. This review paper focuses on the reproductive and the stress endocrinology of anurans and demonstrates the uses of non-invasive endocrinology for advancing amphibian conservation physiology. It also provides key technical considerations for future research that will increase the data accuracy and reliability, and the value of non-invasive endocrinology within the conceptual framework of conservation physiology.

40|$|The Ems estuary has {{constantly}} {{changed over}} the past centuries both from man-made and natural influences. On the time scale of thousands of years, sea level rise has created the estuary and dynamically changed its boundaries. More recently, storm surges created the Dollard sub-basin in the 14 th - 15 th centuries. Beginning in the 16 th century, diking and reclamation of land has greatly altered the surface area of the Ems estuary, particularly in the Dollard. These natural and anthropogenic changes to the surface area of the Ems altered the flow patterns of water, the tidal characteristics, and the patterns of sediment deposition and erosion. Since 1945, reclamation of land has halted and {{the borders of the}} Ems estuary have changed little. Sea level rise has continued, and over the past 40 years the rate of increase in mean high water (MHW) along the German coast has accelerated to 40 cm/ century. Climate has varied on a decadal time scale due to long-term variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which controls precipitation, temperature, and the direction and magnitude of winds. Between 1960 and 1990 the most intense variation in the NAO index on record was observed. As a result the magnitude and frequency of storm surges increased, and mean wave heights increased at 1 - 2 cm/year. Currently the NAO index—and therefore storminess—is trending downwards. Over the longer term, global warming models predict an average temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius over the next century. A doubling of CO 2 is expected to increase sea level by 30 cm, while the significant wind speed and wave heights in the North Sea are predicted to increase by 50 cm/s and 50 cm, respectively. Beginning in the late 1950 ’s, dredging activity and construction measures in harbours and shipping channels greatly altered the physical processes in the Ems. Deepening and streamlining the Ems River and shipping channel between the 1960 s and 1990 s decreased the hydraulic roughness and increased the tidal range in the river above Emden by as much as 1. 5 m. At the turbidity maximum between Emden and Papenburg, concentrations of sediment are currently between 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than in the 1950 ’s, and fluid mud layers of several meters thickness occur. Other man-made changes, such as gas pipelines and the expansion of harbours, have often caused significant, but more localized, changes to the estuary. Between the mid 19 th century and the 1970 ’s, dumping of organic waste—agricultural, industrial, and human—severely <b>stressed</b> the <b>ecology</b> of the Dollard sub-basin in particular. Since then the input of organic waste has been greatly reduced and anoxic conditions eliminated. However, the increase in turbidity at the turbidity maximum has caused depleted oxygen concentrations and periodic anoxia between Pogum and Papenburg during the summer months (personal communication, H. Juergens; Talke et al, 2005). The Ems is a relatively well studied estuary. Significant research projects have included the BOEDE project in the 1970 ’s [...] 1980 ’s and the BOA and INTRAMUD projects in the 1990 ’s. These projects and other efforts have amassed a deep literature in the knowledge of tidal flats, fluid mud and flocculation, and mixing and dispersion processes. Projects currently underway are focusing on tidal dynamics and the affects of dredging in the high turbidity zone between Emden and Herbrum. Optimal management of the estuary is the goal of the HARBASINS project. Many analytical and numerical models have been applied to the Ems estuary to estimate tidal range, storm surges, wave fields, sediment transport, and mixing and dispersion processes. Analytical models to estimate mixing of scalars and sediment fluxes (Sediment Trend Analysis) have been extensively used. Numerical models such as WAQUA, unTRIM, MIKE 3, Telemac 2 D, SWAN, Delft 3 D –Sed, and others have been applied to the Ems. While reasonable results are found for short term processes (order of days), long-term morphological change cannot yet be predicted. For the Ems catchement basin, the numerical models REGFLUD and FLUMAGIS are used to estimate nutrient inputs from diffuse sources and to visualize and evaluate the effects of land-use change...|$|R
