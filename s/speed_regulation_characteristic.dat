In order to research the <b>speed</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>characteristics</b> and the inner flow mechanism of the centrifugal pump, numerical method of solving the unsteady fluid flow around the accelerating blade was established.

And the evolution of the internal flow rate present strong transient performance in the regulating process.

40|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>regulation</b> {{of motor}} {{vehicles}} has widely affected the living environment and standard of residents in urban areas. It {{is believed that}} lower speed of motor vehicles could decrease the traffic accident rate on roads. However, lower speeds may cause many problems indirectly to social development {{and the health of}} residents. The average speed of motor vehicles in urban areas in China may be among the lowest in the world due to its mixed traffic environment and vehicle properties. In most central areas of large Chinese cities, the average speed of motor vehicles has been lower than 25 km/h. However, this does not mean a safer system for transportation. For example, the death toll of transportation systems in China has exceeded 70, 000 every year and is {{among the highest in the}} world. This paper analyses the general situation of various <b>speed</b> <b>regulations</b> on motor vehicles in China. A brief review on the relationship between speed and safety on urban transport has been described. Authors believe that the most important factor to menace transport safety is the coordination of motor vehicles with bicycles and pedestrians especially in urban areas. A quantitative assessment on indirect effects of <b>speed</b> <b>regulation</b> has then been discussed. The assessment covers four aspects. Firstly, it estimates the additional emissions resulted from <b>speed</b> <b>regulation.</b> Secondly, it calculates the contribution to road traffic density of extra stay of vehicles caused by speed change. Thirdly, it analyses the change of passenger journey time caused by <b>speed</b> <b>regulation</b> in urban areas.

It concludes that higher speed of motor vehicles is of better sustainability in the current situation of Chinese urban areas. Some suggestions on <b>speed</b> <b>regulation</b> for different situations in China have also been presented.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} the <b>speed</b> <b>regulation</b> problem in air traffic management. Because global air traffic volume is continuously increasing, improvement in {{air traffic control}} has become a priority. During this decade, European and United States initiatives have been launched to design the future of air traffic management. One of their objectives is to increase air traffic density and optimize flight route plans. This can be achieved through en route deconfliction. Air conflicts {{have the potential to}} occur when two or more aircraft are predicted to be below a separation norm in the near future. Such situations affect air traffic controllers' workload; thus, these situations limit controllers' capacity to deal with large numbers of aircraft and induce flight delay. Reducing air traffic controllers' potential workload through <b>speed</b> <b>regulation</b> has been investigated in the En Route Air Traffic Soft Management Ultimate System project.
