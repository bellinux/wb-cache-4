25|$|Since September 1998, KTVT {{has served}} as the {{official}} television partner of the Dallas Cowboys, holding rights to air various team-related programs during the regular season (including the Cowboys Postgame Show, Special Edition with Jerry Jones and the head coach's weekly analysis program The Jason Garrett Show, along with specials such as the Making of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders Calendar and postseason team reviews) as well as preseason games that are not televised nationally on broadcast or cable television. Through CBS' contract with the National Football League (NFL), under which it holds primary broadcast rights to the American Football Conference, Cowboys game telecasts on KTVT during the regular season are limited to interconference games against AFC teams played at AT Stadium (including those held every other year on Thanksgiving Day) and, since 2014, cross-flexed games originally scheduled to air on Fox against its fellow teams in the National Football Conference (NFC). Most other regular season games televised over-the-air locally air on KDFW, which {{has served as}} the Cowboys' primary local broadcaster since 1962 (with the exception of a one-season absence due to the transfer of NFC television rights to Fox in 1994, in the precursor to the affiliation <b>switch),</b> <b>through</b> Fox's rights to the NFC; KXAS-TV also carries certain regular season Cowboys games in which the team is a participant via NBC's rights to the Sunday Night Football package.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to advertising, Nintendo had planned several ways for players {{to try the}} system before its release through various [...] "sampling events". Kimishima {{felt that it was}} important, particularly for [...] "career gamers", for Nintendo to get the Switch into players' hands, so that players could understand how the system differs from Nintendo's previous offerings. Kimishima also said that the company was [...] "running a guerrilla marketing program where we're just dashing around and trying to have as many events as possible and get it in the hands of players so they can experience the difference." [...] The North American and European press had special events on January 13, 2017, following the Tokyo presentation. Various Switch demonstration events were run in North America, Europe, and Japan during January and February 2017. Nintendo offered demonstrations of the Switch at gaming conferences including PAX South, South by Southwest, and RTX. Nintendo also promoted the <b>Switch</b> <b>through</b> an [...] "Unexpected Places" [...] campaign in February 2017, temporarily setting up living-room style spaces in three United States locations and inviting fans and players, including John Cena, to try out the unit.|$|E

50|$|In a {{very simple}} example, a switch with three ports A, B, and C has a normal node {{connected}} to port A while ports B and C are connected {{to each other in}} a loop. All ports have the same link speed and run in full duplex mode. Now, when a broadcast frame enters the <b>switch</b> <b>through</b> port A, this frame is forwarded to all ports but the source port, i.e. ports B and C. Both frames exiting ports B and C traverse the loop in opposite directions and reenter the <b>switch</b> <b>through</b> their counterpart port. The frame received on port B is then forwarded to ports A and C, the frame received on port C to ports A and B. So, the node on port A receives two copies of its own broadcast frame while the other two copies produced by the loop continue to cycle. Likewise, each broadcast frame entering the system continues to cycle through the loop in both directions, rebroadcasting back to the network in each loop, and broadcasts accumulate. Eventually, the accumulated broadcasts exhaust the egress capacity of the links, the switch begins dropping frames, and communication across the switch becomes unreliable or even impossible.|$|E
40|$|Safe {{operation}} of electric motor drives is of prime research interest in various industrial applications. This paper presents a new fault diagnosis system for open circuit switch faults in three phases Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) drive {{of the permanent}} magnet Brushless DC (BLDC) motors. The proposed fault diagnosis system is capable of detecting as well as identifying the faulty switch in the voltage source inverters. Faults diagnosis is based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) analysis of the BLDC motor line voltages. Behaviour of the BLDC motor is analysed under open circuit faults of inverter <b>switches</b> <b>through</b> a validated simulation model. A knowledge based table is developed to identify the faulty switch by analysing the simulation results under various fault conditions. Performance of the BLDC motor is also investigated under open circuit faults of VSI <b>switches</b> <b>through</b> the experimental test rig.

40|$|Heavy metal/ferromagnetic layers with {{perpendicular}} {{magnetic anisotropy}} (PMA) have potential applications for high-density information storage in racetrack memories and nonvolatile magnetic random access memories. Writing and erasing {{of information in}} these devices are carried out by domain wall (DW) motion and deterministic magnetization switching via electric current generated spin orbital torques (SOTs) with an assistance of in-plane bias field to break the symmetry. Improvements in energy efficiency could be obtained when the switching of perpendicular magnetization is controlled by an electric current generated SOTs without the in-plane bias fields. Here, we report on reversible electric-current-driven magnetization <b>switching</b> <b>through</b> DW motion in Pt/Co/Cr trilayers with PMA at room temperature due {{to the formation of}} homochiral Neel-type domain, in which an in-plane effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction field exists. Fully deterministic magnetic magnetization switching in this trilayers is based on the enhancement of SOTs from a dedicated design of Pt/Co/Cr structures with two heavy metals Pt and Cr which show the opposite sign of spin Hall angles. We also demonstrated that the simultaneously accompanying Joule heating effect also plays a key role for field-free magnetization <b>switching</b> <b>through</b> the decrease of the propagation field.
