His sons Manuel and John had participated in the revolt, and the leaders of the conspiracy were in contact with him. Andronikos sent many letters of his own to his nephew, the young Alexios II, to the Patriarch Theodosios, and others, bemoaning the usurpation of the young emperor's rights by the prōtosebastos, and the impropriety of the latter's alleged relationship with the Empress-regent. Relying on his oath to Emperor Manuel to uphold the rule of both Manuel and Alexios II—an oath occasioned more by his own, well-known ambitions—he even claimed to have been charged by the late Manuel to safeguard the rule of his son. Following the suppression of the uprising, his daughter Maria hastened to him at Sinope, bearing news; and soon more letters came from the capital urging him to intervene. In autumn 1181, Andronikos began his march against Constantinople, proceeding slowly so as to give the impression of a large and cumbersome force, and giving time for his propaganda to have an impact. Only the city of Nicaea under John Doukas and the Theme of Thrace, under the megas domestikos John Komnenos Vatatzes, rejected his claims and resisted his advance. Choniates accuses the prōtosebastos of lethargy and neglect ("he was unmanly and not only spent the early morning in <b>sound</b> <b>sleep</b> but also wasted most of the day sleeping") in dealing with Andronikos, but these accusations are not repeated by Skoutariotes and are dismissed by modern scholars.|$|E
2500|$|According to God Speaks, in the {{evolution}} of consciousness, before the Soul has any consciousness of anything or itself, there is an infinite, impressionless unconscious tranquil state. Meher Baba calls this state [...] the Eternal Beyond-Beyond State of God (or Paratpar Paramatma), which has no experience of Self, nor of any of its Infinite latent attributes. Latent in this Infinite state is the undifferentiated and unmanifested Everything. Meher Baba says that the state of the man's consciousness during <b>sound</b> <b>sleep</b> is literally the same original divine <b>sound</b> <b>sleep</b> state of God. Synopsizing this concept in God Speaks biographer Charles Purdom writes, [...] "In the beginningless beginning, in the beyond the beyond, God Is in absolute sound sleep." ...|$|E
