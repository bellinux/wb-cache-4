40|$|Health inequalities are {{the most}} {{important}} inequalities of all. In the US and the UK these inequalities have now reached an extent not seen for over a century. Most people’s health is much better now than then, but the gaps in life expectancy between regions, between cities, and between neighbourhoods within cities now surpass the worst measures over the last hundred years. In almost all other affluent countries, inequalities in health are lower and people live longer. In his new book, academic and writer Danny Dorling describes the current extent of inequalities in health as the scandal of our times. He provides nine new chapters and updates a wide <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> highly influential <b>writings</b> on health, including international-peer reviewed studies, annotated lectures, newspaper articles, and interview transcripts, to create an accessible collection that is both contemporary and authoritative. As a whole the book shows conclusively that inequalities in health are the scandal of our times in the most unequal of rich nations and calls for immediate action to reduce these inequalities in the near future...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{critical}} analysis of the foundational historiography of ancient Egypt, focused on the scholarship of James Henry Breasted (1865 - 1935), the first American professor of Egyptology. Breasted wrote prolifically and broadly during his thirty-year career. His work is a reference point from which to investigate the effects of political, cultural, and economic variables on the historical narratives of ancient Egypt during his generation. My aim is to establish the political and cultural context in which he worked, examining {{the degree to which}} the social discourse of the era influenced the interpretation of ancient Egyptian history. Primary source material includes four of Breasted’s major academic works, a <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shorter <b>writings,</b> and archival material from the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago and the Rockefeller Archive Center. Breasted’s written work has been the subject of very little critical analysis despite its long standing as fundamental scholarship in the discipline. Intending to establish a new, scientific Egyptology in America, he wrote A History of Egypt (1905) as a popular demonstration of the type of history that could be produced using <b>his</b> methods <b>of</b> meticulous textual research. I argue that <b>his</b> interpretation <b>of</b> the Egyptian past was heavily influenced by both evolutionary and diffusionist theories of social change, and he was an important disseminator of these ideas for the popular audience. From 1914 onward, Breasted’s writing exhibits an increasing tendency to explicate the forces which drive civilization and to trace them to their origin; the intersecting axes of geography, chronology and race became guiding concerns <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. Amidst early twentieth century political and social upheaval, he constructs an image of an ordered world in which imperialism, economic exploitation and industrialism were necessary to human advancement. Concern for processes of cultural evolution continues with <b>his</b> interpretations <b>of</b> ancient Egyptian religion, in which he correlates industrial development and imperial expansion with spiritual growth. <b>His</b> explanation <b>of</b> religious development is best understood when it is seen as in dialogue with <b>his</b> understandings <b>of</b> socio-economic class, environment, and morality...|$|R
