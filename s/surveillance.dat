40|$|The final {{audit report}} for {{remedial}} action at the Gunnison, Colorado Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) Project site consists of {{a summary of the}} radiological surveillances/audits, quality assurance (QA) in-process <b>surveillances,</b> and QA remedial action close-out inspections performed by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Technical Assistance Contractor (TAC); and on-site construction reviews (OSCR) performed by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Two radiological <b>surveillances</b> and four radiological audits were performed at the Gunnison site. The <b>surveillances</b> were performed on 16 to 19 September 1992 and 28 June to 1 July 1993. The radiological audits were performed on 4 to 7 October 1993; 13 to 16 June 1994; 19 to 22 September 1994 and 10 to 12 July 1995. The <b>surveillances</b> and audits resulted in 79 observations. Thirty-four of the observations raised DOE concerns that were resolved on the site or through subsequent corrective action. All outstanding issues were closed on 12 July 1995. The radiological <b>surveillances</b> and audits are discussed in Section 2. 0 of this report. Ten QA in-process <b>surveillances</b> were performed at the Gunnison UMTRA Project site. The <b>surveillances</b> were performed on 24 to 25 September 1992, 7 to 9 July 1993, 29 October 1993, 27 to 28 June 1994, 31 October to 1 November 1994, 19 to 20 June 1 995, 20 to 21 July 1995, 17 to 18 August 1995, 20 September 1995, and 11 to 13 October 1995. The <b>surveillances</b> resulted in 100 observations. Six observations contained recommendations that required responses from the Remedial Action Contractor (RAC). Ninety-five observations contained a recommendation that required no response. All outstanding issues were closed on 8 January 1996. The QA in-process <b>surveillances</b> are discussed in Section 3. 0 of this report...|$|R

This study aimed to examine trends in HIV seroprevalence among pregnant and parturient women between 2002 and 2006. Methods We analysed HIV seroprevalence trends from two Lusaka sources: (i) antenatal {{data from a}} city-wide programme to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, and (ii) delivery data from two anonymous unlinked cord-blood <b>surveillances</b> performed in 2003 and again in 2005 – 2006, where specimens from> 97 % of public-sector births in each period were obtained and analysed. Findings Between July 2002 and December 2006, the Lusaka district tested 243 302 antenatal women for HIV; 54 853 (22. 5 %) were HIV infected. Over this period, the HIV seroprevalence among antenatal attendees who were tested declined steadily from 24. 5 % {{in the third quarter}} of 2002 to 21. 4 % in the last quarter of 2006 (P < 0. 001).
