50|$|AN {{is highly}} hygroscopic, readily {{absorbing}} water from air. In humid environments, absorbed water interferes with its explosive function. AN is fully water-soluble; as such, it cannot be loaded into boreholes that contain <b>standing</b> <b>water.</b> When used in wet mining conditions, considerable effort {{must be taken}} to remove <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> and install a liner in the borehole; it is generally more productive to instead use a water-resistant explosive such as emulsion.|$|R

40|$|Intensive {{mosquito}} collections {{were carried}} out in two villages in subdistrict of Padangcermin during 1992 - 1993. The method of mosquito collections consisted of night landing on man indoor and outdoor, night resting indoor and outdoor around cattle shelters, light trap in cattle shelters, daytime resting indoor and outdoor, as well as larvae collections to identify anophelines breeding sites. Sixteen anophelines i. e. Anopheles sundaicus, An. subpictus, An. vagus, An. indefinitus, An. nigerrimus, An. peditaeniatus, An. kochi, An. barbirostris, An. bambumbrosus, An. annularis, An. separatus, An. tesselatus, An. aconitus, An. umbrosus, An. leucosphyrus and An. letifer were collected. Among these mosquitos, An. sundaicus was found predominant, followed by An. vagus and An. subpictus. Other species were collected in small numbers. The behavior of Anopheles sundaicus, An. subpictus and An. vagus were exophagic and endophilic. The larvae of An. sundaicus was found only in brackish <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> such as abandoned shrimp ponds, An. subpictus in brackish <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> as well as fresh <b>standing</b> <b>water,</b> while An. vagus was found only in fresh <b>standing</b> <b>water.</b> Breeding sites of An. sundaicus was characterized by pond with floating algae while An. subpictus and An. vagus were not depending on vegetation. </p...|$|R
