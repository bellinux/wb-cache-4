40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} nucleus {{is surrounded}} by a protective nuclear envelope, which is perforated by trafficking machines termed nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The NPCs are the <b>sole</b> mediators <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Small molecules pass through the NPCs unchallenged; however, large macro-molecules are excluded unless chaperoned across by transport factors. Here, we suggest a model, termed ‘virtual gating’, to explain the mechanism of this rapid and selective macromolecular trafficking. In eukaryotes, the double-membraned nuclear envelope (NE) separates the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic com-partments, sequestering the genetic material in the nucleus. This provides the cell with the opportunity to control access to its DNA, a defining feature of eukaryotes...|$|R

40|$|Consider an {{exchange}} mechanism which accepts diversified offers of various commodities and redistributes everything it receives. We impose certain conditions {{of fairness and}} convenience on such a mechanism and show that it admits unique prices, which equalize the value of offers and returns for each individual. We next define the complexity of a mechanism in terms of certain integers τ_ij,π_ij and k_i that represent {{the time required to}} exchange i for j, the difficulty in determining the exchange ratio, and the dimension of the message space. We show that there are a finite number of minimally complex mechanisms, in each of which all trade is conducted through markets for commodity pairs. Finally we consider minimal mechanisms with smallest worst-case complexities τ=τ_ij and π=π_ij. For m> 3 commodities, there are precisely three such mechanisms, one of which has a distinguished commodity [...] the money [...] that serves as the <b>sole</b> medium <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> As m→∞ the money mechanism is the only one with bounded (π,τ).

40|$|This paper {{explicitly}} considers strategic {{interaction between}} governments to study currency competition {{and its effects}} on the circulation of currencies and welfare in a two-country, two-currency search theoretic model. Each government uses seigniorage to provide public goods. Agents consume private goods, and the public goods of their own country. We have several findings. The negative impact of a country's inflationary policy on the realm of circulation of its currency imposes an inflation discipline: the more open a country is, the stronger is the discipline. The worldwide circulation of a currency increases seigniorage and welfare and decreases the inflation rate of the issuing country compared to autarky. The other country, since the tax base is reduced due to the use of foreign currency, raises its inflation rate. However, there is a limit on the rate beyond which it cannot maintain the circulation of national money. Under strategic interaction between governments in selecting equilibrium, the larger country would try to lower the inflation rate to make its currency circulate abroad, while the other country may also lower the inflation rate to sustain its national currency as the <b>sole</b> medium <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> ...|$|R

In the Standard Model (SM) all its couplings are determined in terms of a single parameter, its mass mh. By taking mh around 100 GeV, all the ElectroWeak Precision Tests (EWPT) are successfully accounted for. With the inclusion of the Higgs boson the electroweak interactions are consistently described u...|$|R

On June 6, 2014, Westgate himself left the program, and also CNBC Europe, {{and was replaced by}} Julia Chatterley. Newly hired anchor Wilfred Frost (son of David Frost) joined as co-anchor on September 1, 2014 and Seema Mody (formerly of CNBC TV18 and CNBC US) joined the program on September 15 (later to leave during September 2015 when she returned to the US headquarters of CNBC). In June 2015, Carolin Roth (previously CNBC Europe's Zurich correspondent and also, Europe anchor of Capital Connection) joined the program. She replaced Julia Chatterley (who then returned to her previous role as a correspondent) and became a permanent co-anchor. On September 4, 2015, Mody left Worldwide Exchange to rejoin CNBC US and less than a week later, on September 10, Susan Li, who was previously a co-anchor of Asia Squawk Box on sister network CNBC Asia, joined the program in the same capacity.|$|R

40|$|<b>Exchange</b> <b>of</b> ATP and ADP across {{mitochondrial}} membrane replenishes the cytoplasm with newly synthesized ATP {{and provides the}} mitochondria with the substrate ADP for oxidative phosphorylation. The <b>sole</b> means <b>of</b> this <b>exchange</b> is the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), a membrane protein that is suggested to cycle between two conformationally distinct states, cytosolic-open (c-state) and matrix-open (m-state), thereby shuttling nucleotides across the inner {{mitochondrial membrane}}. However, the c-state is the only structurally resolved state, and the binding site of ADP remains elusive. Here, we present ≈ 0. 3 μs of all-atom MD simulations of the c-state revealing rapid, spontaneous binding of ADP to deeply positioned binding sites within the AAC lumen. To our knowledge, a complete ligand-binding event has heretofore not been described in full atomic detail in unbiased simulations. The identified ADP-bound state and additional simulations shed light on key structural elements and the initial steps involved in conversion to the m-state. Electrostatic analysis of trajectories reveals {{the presence of an}} unusually strong positive electrostatic potential in the lumen of AAC that appears to be the main driving force for the observed spontaneous binding of ADP. We provide evidence that the positive electrostatic potential is likely a common attribute among the entire family of mitochondrial carriers. In addition to playing a key role in substrate recruitment and translocation, the electropositivity of mitochondrial carriers might also be critical for their binding to the negatively charged environment of the inner mitochondrial membrane...|$|R
