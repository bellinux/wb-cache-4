5000|$|There are {{two ways}} to convert this split. The first is to strike either pin and have it bounce out of the pit area and strike the {{remaining}} pin. This not only requires substantial ball speed but the pin must be struck in the right spot. Additionally, a pin flying out from the pit is a fairly rare occurrence. This is made more difficult by variation of the pit design according to the pinsetter system, with the Brunswick A-2 being more prone to bounce-outs than recent machines. Bouncing out on a Brunswick GS-series pinsetter is exceedingly difficult due to a moving curtain {{at the back of the}} pit which absorbs the impact, while AMF pinsetters have a higher chance of bouncing out the pin facing away from the ball return of a lane pair. The second method is to strike either pin on the inside with enough velocity to bounce it off the side wall (kickback plate) and rebound onto and across the deck into the other <b>pin.</b> <b>Sliding</b> the <b>pin</b> directly will not work since the ball will fall off the lane before it gets far enough aside the 7 or 10 <b>pin</b> to <b>slide</b> it directly across. Despite this fact, many television shows and movies over the years have depicted the 7-10 split being converted by directly <b>sliding</b> one <b>pin</b> into another. In each case, the [...] "conversion" [...] was rigged by either moving the <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> over on a deck without pin spots (giving the ball extra room to <b>slide</b> the <b>pin</b> sideways and making it look like the pin was spotted correctly) or by having some help (human or mechanical) from the pit to [...] "slide" [...] the pin over. Barring such [...] "Hollywood magic" [...] in real life, a freak bounce out of the pit or a side wall rebound are the only realistic ways to convert a 7-10 split.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{intended}} to use torpedoes containing 400 lb (180 kg) of black powder; but those actually employed by it contained 60 lb (27 kg) of fine powder of the kind known in the American service as No. 7. The [...] "obstruction shells" [...] have each an air space left round the powder, so as to allow the free expansion of the gases, and the torpedoes intended for use against vessels are of slightly less specific gravity than water, so that when released from the holder they rise slowly until they come against {{the bottom of the}} vessel under which they are placed. As will be seen by the section, Fig. 2, the powder is so placed in the torpedo that, when the later is released, it floats nearly upright with its point downwards. Within the torpedo case, on one side, is placed a tube, {{at the lower end of}} which is a percussion fuse in communication with the powder. At the upper end of the tube is a ball, which is held from falling upon the percussion fuse by a <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> placed beneath it. This pin passes out through the torpedo case, and has an eye formed at its outer end, as shown in Fig. 2. When the torpedo is placed in the casing at the end of the projecting tube, that side of the torpedo through which the <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> just mentioned projects is placed downwards, and one end of a cord is attached to the eye of the pin, and the other end to another eye fixed to the casing at the end of the projecting tube. The length of this cord is regulated according to the distance at which it is desired to fire the torpedo - the length generally employed being about 20 ft (6 m) — and it acts in the following manner: When the torpedo has been projected by means of the tube and released, the tube is of course drawn back, and as this movement takes place the cord is tightened, and the <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> is withdrawn from the torpedo case, this movement releasing the ball and allowing it to fall upon the percussion fuse, and explode the torpedo.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} VTEC-E implementation is {{a variation}} of SOHC VTEC {{which is used to}} increase combustion efficiency at low RPM while maintaining the mid range performance of non-vtec engines. VTEC-E is the first version of VTEC to employ the use of roller rocker arms and because of that, it forgoes the need for having 3 intake lobes for actuating the two valves—two lobes for non-VTEC operation(one small and one medium-sized lobe) and one lobe for VTEC operation(the biggest lobe). Instead, there are two different intake cam profiles per cylinder—a very mild cam lobe with little lift and a normal cam lobe with moderate lift. Because of this, at low RPM, when VTEC is not engaged, one of the two intake valves is allowed to open only a very small amount due to the mild cam lobe, forcing most of the intake charge through the other open intake valve with the normal cam lobe. This induces swirl of the intake charge which improves air/fuel atomization in the cylinder and allows for a leaner fuel mixture to be used. As the engine's speed and load increase, both valves are needed to supply a sufficient mixture. When engaging VTEC mode, a pre-defined threshold for MPH (must be moving), RPM and load must be met before the computer actuates a solenoid which directs pressurized oil into a <b>sliding</b> <b>pin,</b> just like with the original VTEC. This <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> connects the intake rocker arm followers together so that, now, both intake valves are following the [...] "normal" [...] camshaft lobe instead of just one of them. When in VTEC, since the [...] "normal" [...] cam lobe has the same timing and lift as the intake cam lobes of the SOHC non-VTEC engines, both engines have identical performance in the upper powerband assuming everything else is the same.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{temperature}} of the steel tube of a CFT column rises rapidly upon a fire causing the deterioration of its strength, while the concrete inside of the tube having large heat capacity provides fire-resistance performance. In order to employ CFT columns as fire-resistant structure, {{it is necessary to}} conduct studies on the factors exerting influence on structural capacities and the influence associated with each condition. Concrete’s compressive strength, cross-sectional size, axial load ratio and boundary condition are the major factors which are influential in fire-resistance performance. In particular, boundary condition between columns and beams {{is one of the major}} factors which decide fire-resistance performance because it exerts influence on load carrying capacity. The result of the test conducted in this study showed that fire-resistance time of 106 minutes was secured in the specimens with clamped ends and that of 89 minutes in those with <b>pinned</b> <b>ends</b> when cross-sectional size was 360 by 360.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formulation for the modeling of a single-link flexible beam that is undergoing slewing motion at an actively controlled <b>pinned</b> <b>end,</b> {{where the other}} end of the beam is free. This <b>pinned</b> <b>end,</b> or slewing axis, is of fixed orientation such that the beam rotates in the horizontal plane. A geared dc electric motor is connected to the beam at the slewing axis. A position and a velocity sensor are placed at this hinged location, and their proportional feedback provides a position control system about the slewing axis. The motor characteristics, gear ratio, and the position feedback constant determine an equivalent rotational spring constant, often called the servo stiffness. This paper generalizes the structure's boundary conditions at the slewing axis to include the effects of the servo system. It is shown that the clamped-free beam assumption for the dynamics of the structure is a valid assumption if the ratio of the servo stiffness to beam flexibility is high. However, for moderate or low values of this ratio, the clamped-free beam leads to erroneous system models so that it becomes necessary to consider the effects of the driving servo on the dynamics of the flexible beam...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a systematic {{study of the}} influence of certain parameters on the fire resistance of compressed steel elements with restrained thermal elongation. The parameters studied were: the slenderness of the element, the stiffness of the surrounding structure and the eccentricity of the loading. Nearly 190 tests were performed on small <b>pin</b> <b>ended</b> steel bars and 18 tests on small built in steel bars. For the <b>pin</b> <b>ended</b> bars, four different slenderness values (319, 199, 133 and 80), two eccentricities of the compression load (1 mm and another equal to the thickness of the bar) and six values of restraint to axial elongation (0, 1, 10, 24, 42 and 98 kN/mm) were tested. For the built in bars, two slenderness values (80 and 32) and three values of restraint to axial elongation (1, 10 and 98 kN/mm) were tested.

5000|$|Another {{common design}} uses a hammer fixed {{directly}} onto the input shaft, {{with a pair of}} pins acting as clutches. When the hammer rotates past the anvil, a ball ramp pushes the pins outwards against a spring, extending them to where they will hit the anvil and deliver the impact, then release and spring back into the hammer, usually by having the balls [...] "fall off" [...] {{the other side of the}} ramp at the instant the hammer hits. Since the ramp need only have one peak around the shaft, and the engagement of the hammer with the anvil is not based on a number of teeth between them, this design allows the hammer to accelerate for a full revolution before contacting the anvil, giving it more time to accelerate and delivering a stronger impact. The disadvantages are that the <b>sliding</b> <b>pins</b> must handle very high impacts, and often cause the early failure of tool.|$|R

This bias encourages competitors {{to move to the}} <b>pin</b> <b>end</b> of the line as it is further up the wind towards the top mark.

With many competitors moving to the <b>pin</b> or port <b>end</b> of the line to be further to windward, there is room for the other competitors to form up along the line, and although they may be further down the wind from the top mark, they are more easily able to tack onto port tack should the wind shift or to get clear air. If there is no bias favouring the <b>pin</b> <b>end,</b> or more particularly if the starboard (committee boat) end is favoured (further to windward), competitors will be encouraged to avoid being on the line away from the committee boat and so the committee boat area becomes very congested and most competitors are not on the start line and do not start until some time after the starting signal as they have been queued up in the area to starboard of the starboard end of the line.
