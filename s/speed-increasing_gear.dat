40|$|Abstract A lumped-parameter {{dynamic model}} for gear train set in wind turbine is {{proposed}} {{to investigate the}} dynamics of the <b>speed-increasing</b> <b>gear</b> box. The proposed model is developed in a universal Cartesian coordinate, which includes transversal and torsional deflections of each component, time-varying mesh stiffness, gear profile errors and external excitations. By solving the dynamic model, a modal analysis is performed. The results indicate that the modal properties of the multi-stage gear train in wind turbine {{are similar to those of}} a single-stage planetary gear set. A harmonic balance method (HBM) is used to obtain the dynamic responses of the gearing system. The responses give insight into the impact of excitations on the vibrations...|$|E

In the past, as this type of application of large inverters, it has been possible to apply variable {{speed inverter}} motors to larger compressor trains. The power sources of the inverters have various frequency fluctuations depending on the inverter type. These torque fluctuations may cause torsional vibration on the shafts. Most centrifugal compressor trains that are driven by variable speed inverter motors use <b>speed-increasing</b> <b>gears.</b> Since the gear meshing force induced by the torsional vibrations also causes lateral vibrations in the compressor trains. This torsional and lateral coupled vibration model shows {{a difference in the}} rotordynamic characteristics apart from the results obtained from independent torsional and lateral studies. Therefore, a rotordynamic analysis that considers a coupled torsional and lateral vibration system is effective in evaluating torsional vibrations. This paper introduces a rotordynamic analysis method that is based on a coupled torsional and lateral vibration system, and its application results of actual machines shown...|$|R

There are some recommendations to choose tooth zone parameters {{from the standpoint of}} magnetic pulsations and noise suppression. Improvement of shapes of output voltage and current is also taken into consideration. Harmonical analysis of longitudinal magnetic flux pulsations is given. Experimental work has been done. Generator can be used in independent wind-power-plants of low-and mean-power with <b>speed-increasing</b> reducing <b>gear.</b> It is possible to apply the generator to supply transport, aviation and welding installations...|$|R
40|$|There {{is almost}} no water left {{on earth that}} is safe to drink without {{purification}} after 20 - 25 years from today. This is a seemingly bold statement, but it is unfortunately true. Only 1 % of Earthâ€™s water is in a fresh, liquid state, and nearly {{all of this is}} polluted by both diseases and toxic chemicals. For this reason, purification of water supplies is extremely important. Keeping these things in mind, we have designed a model which will convert the dirty/saline water into pure/ potable water using the renewable source of energy (i. e., Human power). The machine consists of a human-powered flywheel motor using a bicycle-drive mechanism with <b>speed-increasing</b> <b>gearing</b> and a flywheel, which drive the process unit though a spiral jaw clutch and torque increasing gearing. The operator puts energy into the flywheel at a convenient power level for about one minute. After enough energy is stored, pedaling is stopped and the energy in the flywheel is made available to the process unit. Pedal power is the transfer of energy from a human source {{through the use of a}} foot pedal and crank system. This technology is most commonly used for transportation and has been used to propel bicycles. Less commonly pedal power is used to power agricultural and hand tools and even to generate electricity by using the generator. This electricity is used for distillation of water in evaporator. The basic mode of the heat transfer involved is convection and The results are obtained by evaporation of the dirty/ saline water and fetching it out as pure/drinkable water. The designed model produces 1. 5 litres of pure water from 14 litres of dirty water during six hours. The efficiency of plant is 64. 37 %...|$|R
