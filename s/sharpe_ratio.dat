500|$|Risk parity (or risk premia parity) is an {{approach}} to investment portfolio management which focuses on allocation of risk, usually defined as volatility, rather than allocation of capital.

Therefore, all portfolios should have a <b>Sharpe</b> <b>ratio</b> {{less than or equal to}} the market's.

50|$|The <b>Sharpe</b> <b>ratio</b> characterizes {{how well}} the return of an asset {{compensates}} the investor for the risk taken. When comparing two assets versus a common benchmark, the one with a higher <b>Sharpe</b> <b>ratio</b> provides better return for the same risk (or, equivalently, the same return for lower risk). However, like any other mathematical model, it relies on the data being correct.
