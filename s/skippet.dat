[...] The die is also currently on display at the National Archives. [...] Masi's company made most of the skippets for almost twenty years, after which the State Department switched to nearly identical versions made by Samuel Lewis. [...] At least one 1871 treaty seal was actually made using a Lewis <b>skippet</b> mold instead of the Masi die, meaning it too is technically an official die.|$|E
