2500|$|The Confederate attack {{continued}} on June 27 and Reynolds, exhausted from the Battle of Gaines' Mill {{and two days}} without sleep, was captured in Boatswain's Swamp, Virginia. Thinking {{he was in a}} place of relative safety, he fell asleep and was not aware that his retreating troops left him behind. He was extremely embarrassed when brought before the Confederate general of the capturing troops; D.H. Hill was an Army friend and colleague from before the war. Hill allegedly told him, [...] "Reynolds, do not feel <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> your capture, it is the fate of wars."

500|$|Reception of the single-player aspect varied. Yin-Poole {{wrote that}} while the cliffhanger ending of Halo 2 was disappointing, the {{campaign}} of Halo 3 was much more satisfying. Gerstmann, GameSpy's Gabe Graziani, and Goldstein maintained that the campaign was too short, especially on easier difficulty levels or with three additional players in co-op. Goldstein was {{highly critical of the}} eighth level, stating [...] "the penultimate chapter is <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> just thinking <b>about</b> it puts a rotten taste in my mouth." [...] The New York Times Charles Herold said the game had a [...] "throwaway" [...] plot and Total Video Games judged the single-player aspect ultimately disappointing. Goldstein and Steve West of Cinema Blend thought a part of the game's story was lost by not having the Arbiter featuring as prominently as the character was in Halo 2.|$|R
50|$|She goes to London and fetches Henrietta Belfield. Because {{she is now}} {{old enough}} to have her fortune, she buys a quiet house in her {{neighborhood}} and lives there with her. She is shocked by Mortimer’s sudden visit there, and finds out that Mrs. Delvile has said that if she will give up her fortune (then Mortimer will not be Mr. Beverley, but Mr. Delvile), she can marry her son. Mortimer happily says that they can just marry with her personal fortune. Cecilia, horrified, tells him that she has none of her personal fortune left, having lent most of it to Mr. Harrel, and using the rest for other things, such as helping the Hills. Cecilia also finds out that somebody told a half true version of this already to Mr. Delvile. She begins to suspect Mr. Monckton. Mrs. Delvile agrees to the marriage, but Mr. Delvile says <b>so</b> many <b>bad</b> things <b>about</b> Cecilia that they argue, and separate. Cecilia and Mortimer marry quietly and happily.|$|R

He and she were an astonishing and satisfying contrast; in the midst of your amazement you felt the divine propriety of a woman like her wanting just such a wiry, smoky-complexioned, black-browed, black-bearded, bald-headed little man as he was. Before he sat down where she was going to put him, he stood stoopingly, and frowned at the waters of the cove lifting from the foot of the lawn that sloped to it before the house.

5000|$|Turner Classic Movies {{described}} the critical response to <b>So</b> Young, <b>So</b> <b>Bad</b> as [...] "tepid" [...] because independent film-making techniques {{were not as}} appreciated in the 1950s {{as they were in}} later eras. Many critics made jokes out of the title. Some critics accused <b>So</b> Young, <b>So</b> <b>Bad</b> of taking ideas from Caged. The two films were released one day apart. <b>So</b> Young, <b>So</b> <b>Bad</b> profited in the United States and received an international distribution agreement. Henreid, ignoring the warnings of his agent, placed a 50 percent stake in the film. Henreid said that <b>So</b> Young, <b>So</b> <b>Bad</b> made more money for him than any other film.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't think I {{was crying}} because I was really so {{very fond of}} him," [...] {{reflected}} Anne. [...] "I just cried because all the others did. It was Ruby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr. Phillips, but {{just as soon as}} he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other. I tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips made me sit with Gil--with a, boy; and the time he spelled my name without an e on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he had been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, Marilla, and I just had to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she'd never shed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because she hadn't brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh, Marilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning, 'The time has come for us to part.' It was very affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I'd talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy. I can tell you I wished I'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She hadn't anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from school. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, 'The time has come for us to part,' and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one can't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months' vacation before them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Phillips going away I couldn't help taking a little interest in a new minister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely, of course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the minister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses. Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark, Marilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides, she's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should make allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready." ...|$|E
