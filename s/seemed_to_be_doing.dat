5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take {{the sting out of}} his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich was one of his {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin {{in the eyes of the}} world. They initially <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Jackson was {{finishing}} The Frighteners and considered The Lord of the Rings {{as a new}} project, wondering [...] "why nobody else <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> anything about it". With the new developments in computer-generated imagery following Jurassic Park, Jackson set about planning a fantasy film that would be relatively serious and feel real. By October, {{he and his partner}} Fran Walsh teamed up with Miramax Films boss Harvey Weinstein to negotiate with Saul Zaentz who had held the rights to the book since the early 1970s, pitching an adaptation of The Hobbit and two films based on The Lord of the Rings. Negotiations then stalled when Universal Studios offered Jackson a remake of King Kong. Weinstein was furious, and further problems arose when it turned out Zaentz did not have distribution rights to The Hobbit; United Artists, which was in the market, did. By April 1996, the rights question was still not resolved.|$|E

60|$|Poor Paul! he {{was doing}} his best to eat the portion of the feast that had been set aside as his, but, hungry as he had been, he found it {{difficult}} to swallow because of the lump in his throat, that kept growing larger and larger every moment, and which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> its best to force the tears from his eyes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{till after}} she had left us, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> well in another place; but {{unfortunately}} she was allowed to have a holiday in the race week, and {{a day at the}} course seems to have done the mischief. Susan can tell you all about it, if you want to know. She was as broken-hearted as if Fanny had been her own child--much more than the old mother herself, I fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That’s {{what they}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing,</b> but I’ve had my suspicions about it since. If they caught anything, {{it would be}} a long way from a market, and, though they were dirty and ragged enough, two of them hadn’t the look of regular fishermen. One rather amusing fellow was very much of the kind you’d meet at a {{sporting}} club, and the other had the stamp of a navy or first-class mailboat man. He was English.” ...|$|E
60|$|A wild cheer {{of delight}} ensued, {{for now it}} was {{recognised}} that in all probability the race would lie between these two. As, however, all this occurred {{in the third round}} of the course, and all the other runners <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> their work with steady resolution, there was still the possibility of one or more of them proving themselves, by endurance perhaps, more than a match for the swift-footed. The excitement, therefore, became intense, and, as round after round of the course was completed the relative position of the various men changed considerably.|$|E

60|$|The father--a {{learned and}} busy man--was so {{occupied}} by the duties of his large parish, or so absorbed in the abstruse studies to which his brief leisure was devoted, {{that he had no}} time left for his children. Polly took good care of him and the house, and the boys <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> well, so he went his way in peace, quite unconscious that his eldest son needed all a father's care to keep him from the temptations to which a social nature, not evil propensities, exposed him.|$|E
60|$|George, waking {{next morning}} with a heavy heart, made this {{discovery}} before the day was an hour old. The sun was shining, and birds sang merrily, but this did not disturb him. Nature is ever callous to human woes, laughing while we weep; and we grow to take her callousness for granted. What jarred upon George was the infernal cheerfulness of his fellow men. They <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> it on purpose--triumphing over him--glorying in the fact that, however Fate might have shattered him, they were all right.|$|E
60|$|They {{did their}} job well. Especially lately, {{with the new}} designs coming up. Now they {{repaired}} themselves. They were on their own. Radiation tabs protected the UN troops, but if a man lost his tab he was fair game for the claws, no matter what his uniform. Down below the surface automatic machinery stamped them out. Human beings stayed a long way off. It was too risky; nobody wanted to be around them. They were left to themselves. And they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> all right. The new designs were faster, more complex. More efficient.|$|E
6000|$|... "They <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> a big business," [...] he remarked. [...] "It {{looks as}} if that boat had stopped discharging, but she must have landed a large {{quantity}} of coal." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{impatient}} Simon {{sank into}} a chair by {{the door and said}} briefly: [...] "The head and shoulders were cut about in a queer way. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> after death." ...|$|R

60|$|The stern of {{the vessel}} shot by, dropping, as it did so, into a hollow between the waves; and I {{caught a glimpse of}} a man {{standing}} at the wheel, and of another man who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> little else than smoke a cigar. I saw the smoke issuing from his lips as he slowly turned his head and glanced out over the water in my direction. It was a careless, unpremeditated glance, one of those haphazard things men do when they have no immediate call to do anything in particular, but act because they are alive and must do something.|$|E
60|$|How {{much his}} father knew of this {{employment}} might be doubted. He took much forethought for the boy's future, seeing {{he was like}} to be left so poorly, and would sometimes assist at his lessons, sighing heavily, yawning deep, and now and again patting Francie on the shoulder if he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> ill, by way of a private, kind encouragement. But a great part of the day was passed in aimless wanderings with his eyes sealed, or in his cabinet sitting bemused over the particulars of the coming bankruptcy; and the boy would be absent a dozen times for once that his father would observe it.|$|E
60|$|I {{was not in}} a {{condition}} to argue. Beyond a fleeting feeling that a liberty was being taken with me and that I was being treated unjustly, I do not remember resenting the command. I had no notion who the speaker might be, and no curiosity. Breathing just then had all the glamour of a difficult feat cleverly performed. I concentrated my whole attention upon it. I was pleased, and surprised, to find myself getting on so well. I remember having much the same sensation when I first learned to ride a bicycle--a kind of dazed feeling that I <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> it, but Heaven alone knew how.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks." [...] She smiled. [...] "You <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> all right, too. Commander Gross {{tells me}} that you're {{responsible}} for this project, Operation Head, as they call it. Whose head have you decided on?" ...|$|R

60|$|For {{the first}} time in his life he felt the need for advice--the {{stimulus}} of sympathy. Yet for hours that note remained unwritten. He was unable to account for his hesitation. The man whom he was about to summon would approve of all that he had done. He was sure of that. Yet he was oppressed by the shadow of some nameless fear, some instinct that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> its utmost to warn him against this course which, from any ordinary point of view, was both natural and advisable. Afterward those hours of hesitation ranked as history with him. At the time he was ashamed of them.|$|E
6000|$|Oliver Goldsmith {{was born}} on the 10th of November, 1728, at the hamlet of Pallas, or Pallasmore, county of Longford, in Ireland. He sprang from a respectable, {{but by no means}} a thrifty stock. Some {{families}} seem to inherit kindliness and incompetency, and to hand down virtue and poverty from generation to generation. Such {{was the case with the}} Goldsmiths. [...] "They were always," [...] according to their own accounts, [...] "a strange family; they rarely acted like other people; their hearts were in the right place, but their heads <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> anything but what they ought."--"They were remarkable," [...] says another statement, [...] "for their worth, but of no cleverness in the ways of the world." [...] Oliver Goldsmith will be found faithfully to inherit the virtues and weaknesses of his race.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} just fit in. She would run down {{and spend a}} few quiet days at Liverpool. In her old {{familiar}} room where the moon peeped in {{over the tops of}} the tall pines {{she would be able to}} reason things out. Perhaps her father would be able to help her. She had lost her childish conception of him as of someone prim and proper, with cut and dried formulas for all occasions. That glimpse he had shown her of himself had established a fellowship between them. He, too, had wrestled with life's riddles, not sure of his own answers. She found him suffering from his old heart trouble, but more cheerful than she had known him for years. Arthur <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> wonders with the men. They were coming to trust him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, that's sensible, at any rate," [...] said Mrs. Sewell. [...] "I {{really think}} you've done quite enough, David, {{and now he}} can <b>be</b> left <b>to</b> manage for himself, {{especially}} as he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> well." ...|$|R
