5|$|High {{potassium}} levels {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe rhabdomyolysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E

5|$|San Martín did {{not mention}} Escalada in his first battle report, leading initial historians to infer that they stayed within the convent during the battle.

5|$|The MCC team which toured Australia in 1907—08, {{like that}} which toured South Africa, faced {{questions}} about its strength. Because {{at least four}} first-choice players chose not to tour, and another was not selected despite strong claims, the team was less representative than usual for an Ashes series. The tourists lost the Tests 4–1, although Wisden suggested that the series was more competitive than <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> results.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} frigates contained {{more than}} 200 cannon, which were being transported to Trieste, {{a city in}} north-east Italy {{on the border of}} the Balkan States.

5|$|The name {{darmstadtium}} (Ds) was <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> GSI team {{in honor}} of the city of Darmstadt, where the element was discovered. The GSI team originally also considered naming the element wixhausium, after the suburb of Darmstadt known as Wixhausen where the element was discovered, but eventually decided on darmstadtium.

5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Harry {{obtained}} a place at Liverpool's College of Art at 68 Hope Street. After studying typography and page layouts, he borrowed the college's duplicating machine and published a newspaper called Jazz in 1958, which reported concerts at the Liverpool Jazz Society club, the Temple Jazz Club and the Cavern Club. He also worked as assistant editor on University of Liverpool's charity magazine, Pantosphinx, and on a music newsletter for Frank Hessy's musical instruments store called Frank Comments. The title was <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> owner, Frank Hesselberg, as a play on his own comments, but was abandoned after a few issues.|$|E

5|$|Between 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, {{film and}} stage {{productions}} appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It {{has long been}} said that a Hollywood adaptation was first <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written {{in collaboration with the}} English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been}} found across the globe in North America, Europe, Africa, Japan, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Madagascar, Argentina, and Antarctica, with fossilized teeth giving {{credence}} {{to the possibility that}} they inhabited Australia as well. They first appeared in the mid-Jurassic Period (late Bathonian stage, about 167 million years ago) and survived {{until the end of the}} Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, 66 ma), existing until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The presence of dromaeosaurids as early as the Middle Jurassic has been <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> discovery of isolated fossil teeth, though no dromaeosaurid body fossils {{have been found}} from this period.|$|E
5|$|Former Boston Bruins' coach Harry Sinden, who {{had been}} out of hockey since leaving the Bruins in 1970, was <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> media as a good {{candidate}} for the job of Team Canada's coach. Ron Brown, a sportswriter from Kingston, Ontario called Sinden and in the interview, Sinden admitted that he was available and willing to take the position. After a phone call from Sinden to Alan Eagleson, it was arranged for Sinden to have an interview with Hockey Canada's steering committee for the series in June. After the one interview, Hockey Canada selected Sinden for the position. Sinden selected former player John Ferguson as his assistant coach, after initially trying to recruit Ferguson as a player.|$|E
