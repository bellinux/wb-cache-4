5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air <b>supply</b> <b>hose</b> from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
25|$|A {{main supply}} valve with {{non-return}} valve, which supplies gas {{to the main}} gas <b>supply</b> <b>hose</b> of the umbilical. This is usually a quarter-turn valve, as it must be quick to operate and obvious whether it is open or closed.|$|E
25|$|This {{system is}} unusual in that it used a single stage single hose demand valve in a {{full-face}} mask. The high pressure <b>supply</b> <b>hose</b> routes over the shoulder, but from an inverted cylinder, which allows the user to easily reach the valve.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{functionality}} can {{be provided}} for masks without an integral bailout block, by mounting an external bailout block at a convenient place on the diver's harness. Surface supply and bailout <b>supply</b> <b>hoses</b> are connected to this block, which works {{exactly the same way}} as the integral block.|$|R

50|$|Fleuss's {{apparatus}} {{was first}} used under operational conditions in November 1880 by Alexander Lambert, lead diver of the Severn Tunnel construction project. Trained by Fleuss, {{he was able to}} close a submerged sluice door in the tunnel which had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air <b>supply</b> <b>hoses</b> becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings.|$|R
25|$|The pneumofathometer line on {{a surface}} {{supplied}} umbilical {{is a valuable}} backup supply in case of damage to the main <b>supply</b> <b>hose,</b> or if a diver needs to supply air to another diver on surface supply, as the usual configurations of helmet and full face mask do not allow buddy breathing of the conventional kind. The Pneumo line can be tucked into the neck dam or under the skirt of a full face mask, and provided the helmet or mask is not leaking heavily, will supply adequate air for an assisted ascent.|$|E
25|$|Mounting options: The bailout {{cylinder}} may {{be mounted}} with the valve {{at the top}} or at the bottom, depending on local codes of practice. A generally used arrangement is to mount the cylinder with the valve up, as this is better protected while kitting up, and the cylinder valve is left fully open while the diver is in the water. This means that the regulator and <b>supply</b> <b>hose</b> to the bailout block will be pressurised during the dive, and ready for immediate use by opening the bailout valve on the harness or helmet.|$|E
25|$|A problem {{mostly of}} {{historical}} interest, but still relevant to surface supplied divers who dive with the helmet sealed {{to the dry}} suit. If the air <b>supply</b> <b>hose</b> is ruptured near or above the surface, the pressure difference between the water around the diver and {{the air in the}} hose can be several bar. The non-return valve at the connection to the helmet will prevent backflow if it is working correctly, but if absent, as {{in the early days of}} helmet diving, or if it fails, the pressure difference will tend to squeeze the diver into the rigid helmet, which can result in severe trauma. The same effect can result from a large and rapid increase in depth if the air supply is insufficient to keep up with the increase in ambient pressure.|$|E
50|$|His {{apparatus}} {{was first}} used under operational conditions in 1880 by the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, {{who was able to}} travel 1000 feet in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air <b>supply</b> <b>hoses</b> becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings.|$|R

25|$|Diving helmet squeeze: Helmet squeeze {{will occur}} if the gas <b>supply</b> <b>hose</b> is severed above the diver and the {{non-return}} valve at the helmet gas inlet fails {{or is not}} fitted. Severity {{will depend on the}} hydrostatic pressure difference. A very rapid descent, usually by accident, may exceed {{the rate at which the}} breathing gas supply can equalise the pressure causing a temporary squeeze. The introduction of the non-return valve and high maximum gas supply flow rates have all but eliminated both these risks. In helmets fitted with a neck dam, the dam will admit water into the helmet if the internal pressure gets too low; this is less of a problem than helmet squeeze but the diver may drown if the gas supply is not reinstated quickly. This form of barotrauma is avoidable by controlled descent rate, which is standard practice for commercial divers, who will use shotlines, diving stages and wet bells to control descent and ascent rates.|$|E
500|$|It uses suction gaskets. [...] Gaskets in {{standard}} fire hose ("pressure gaskets") {{are designed to}} minimize the water leaking out between couplings. [...] The gaskets connecting hard suction hose sections, pump, and strainer must instead prevent air from entering at the coupling, since that would spoil the vacuum and allow air into the pump intake. Large diameter ( [...] or greater) hard suction hose will typically use Storz fittings, which are genderless. [...] or smaller hard suction hose will typically use threaded fittings. [...] In each case, the hard suction hose connection will match the fittings of the pump intake and <b>supply</b> <b>hose,</b> so that hard suction hose {{can be used in}} place of <b>supply</b> <b>hose</b> as appropriate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of the twin hose regulator is packaged in a usually circular metal housing mounted on the cylinder valve behind the diver's neck. The demand valve component of a two-stage twin hose regulator is thus mounted in the same housing as the first stage regulator, {{and in order to}} prevent free-flow, the exhaust valve must be located at the same depth as the diaphragm, and the only reliable place to do this is in the same housing. The air flows through a pair of corrugated rubber hoses to and from the mouthpiece. The <b>supply</b> <b>hose</b> is connected {{to one side of the}} regulator body and supplies air to the mouthpiece through a non-return valve, and the exhaled air is returned to the regulator housing on the outside of the diaphragm, also through a non-return valve on the other side of the mouthpiece and usually through another non-return exhaust valve in the regulator housing - often a [...] "duckbill" [...] type.|$|E
