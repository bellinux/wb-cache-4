There are many different PTF methods, however, they all attempt to determine soil properties, such as hydraulic conductivity, given several measured soil properties, such as <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size, and bulk density.|$|E
2500|$|Geotechnical {{engineers}} classify the <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> types {{by performing}} tests on disturbed (dried, passed through sieves, and remolded) {{samples of the}} soil. [...] This provides information about {{the characteristics of the}} soil grains themselves. It should be noted that classification of the types of grains present in a soil does not account for important effects of the structure or fabric of the soil, terms that describe compactness of the particles and patterns in the arrangement of particles in a load carrying framework as well as the pore size and pore fluid distributions. [...] Engineering geologists also classify soils based on their genesis and depositional history.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrodynamic dispersivity (αL, αT) is an {{empirical}} factor which quantifies how much contaminants stray {{away from the}} path of the groundwater which is carrying it. Some of the contaminants will be [...] "behind" [...] or [...] "ahead" [...] the mean groundwater, giving rise to a longitudinal dispersivity (αL), and some will be [...] "to the sides of" [...] the pure advective groundwater flow, leading to a transverse dispersivity (αT). Dispersion in groundwater arises because each water [...] "particle", passing beyond a <b>soil</b> <b>particle,</b> must choose where to go, whether left or right or up or down, so that the water [...] "particles" [...] (and their solute) are gradually spread in all directions around the mean path. This is the [...] "microscopic" [...] mechanism, on the scale of soil particles. More important, on long distances, can be the macroscopic inhomogeneities of the aquifer, which can have regions of larger or smaller permeability, so that some water can find a preferential path in one direction, some other in a different direction, so that the contaminant can be spread in a completely irregular way, like in a (three-dimensional) delta of a river.|$|E
50|$|In healthy, well-structured <b>soils,</b> <b>particles</b> {{interact}} with each other forming soil aggregates. The resulting soil structure increases in stability with the number of interactions between <b>soil</b> <b>particles.</b> Water and air fills the voids between <b>soil</b> <b>particles,</b> where water interacts with <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> forming a thin layer around them. This layer can shield particle-particle interaction thus reducing the stability of soil structure.|$|R

5|$|Atmospheric curium {{compounds}} {{are poorly}} soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to <b>soil</b> <b>particles.</b> <b>Soil</b> analysis revealed about 4,000 times higher concentration of curium at the sandy <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> than in water {{present in the}} soil pores.

5000|$|Susceptibility of soil to {{compaction}} {{depends on}} several factors, which influence <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> interactions: ...|$|E
50|$|The same intermolecular {{forces that}} cause premelting at {{surfaces}} contribute to frost heaving at the particle scale {{on the bottom}} side of the forming ice lens. When ice surrounds a fine <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> as it premelts, the <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> will be displaced downward towards the warm direction within the thermal gradient due to melting and refreezing of the thin film of water that surrounds the particle. The thickness of such a film is temperature dependent and is thinner on the colder side of the particle.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>particle</b> {{density is}} {{typically}} 2.60 to 2.75 grams per cm3 {{and is usually}} unchanging for a given soil. <b>Soil</b> <b>particle</b> density is lower for soils with high organic matter content, and is higher for soils with high iron-oxides content. Soil bulk density {{is equal to the}} dry mass of the soil divided by the volume of the soil; i.e., it includes air space and organic materials of the soil volume. The soil bulk density of cultivated loam is about 1.1 to 1.4 g/cm3 (for comparison water is 1.0 g/cm3). [...] Soil bulk density is highly variable for a given soil. A lower bulk density by itself does not indicate suitability for plant growth due to the influence of soil texture and structure. A high bulk density is indicative of either soil compaction or high sand content. Soil bulk density is inherently always less than the <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> density.|$|E
40|$|Wind erosion {{is defined}} as the {{movement}} of <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> resulting from strong turbulent winds. The movement of <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> can be categorized as suspension, saltation, or surface creep. Fine <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> can be suspended in the atmosphere and carried for great distances. Particles too large to be suspended move in a jumping action along the soil surface, known as saltation. Heavier particles have a rolling movement along the surface and this type of erosion is surface creep. ...|$|R

50|$|In splash erosion, {{the impact}} of a falling {{raindrop}} creates a small crater in the <b>soil,</b> ejecting <b>soil</b> <b>particles.</b> The distance these <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> travel can be as much as 0.6 m (two feet) vertically and 1.5 m (five feet) horizontally on level ground.|$|R
50|$|Mechanic {{pressure}} {{applied to}} the soil is counterbalanced by an increase of <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> interactions. This implies a reduction in soil volume by reducing the voids in between soil particles.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{temperature}} {{is a key}} parameter affecting the degree of treatment of organic components. The required treatment temperature depends upon the specific types of petroleum contamination in the soil.

25|$|While binding of a metal to the {{surfaces}} of the <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> can prevent its movement through a layer of soil, {{it is possible for}} the <b>particles</b> of <b>soil</b> which bear the radioactive metal can migrate as colloidal <b>particles</b> through <b>soil.</b> This has been shown to occur using <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> labeled with 134Cs, these {{have been shown to be}} able to move through cracks in the soil.Cs bearing <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> in arid soils: implications for plutonium redistribution", Journal of Environmental Radioactivity, 2006, 88, 171–188.|$|R

50|$|Most soils have a {{dry bulk}} density (density of soil taking into account voids when dry) between 1.1 and 1.6 g/cm3, while the <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> density is much higher, {{in the range of}} 2.6 to 2.7 g/cm3. Little of the soil of planet Earth is older than the Pleistocene and none is older than the Cenozoic, {{although}} fossilized soils are preserved from {{as far back as the}} Archean.|$|E

50|$|The {{degree of}} {{compaction}} of a soil can be measured by its dry unit weight, γd. When water {{is added to the}} soil, it functions as a softening agent on the soil particles, causing them to slide between one another more easily. At first, the dry unit weight after compaction increases as the moisture content (ω) increases, but after the optimum moisture content (ωopt) percentage is exceeded, any added water will result in a reduction in dry unit weight because the pore water pressure (pressure of water in-between each <b>soil</b> <b>particle)</b> will be pushing the soil particles apart, decreasing the friction between them.|$|E
40|$|Methods for {{recovery}} of P. herpotrichoides spores from rain-splash were tested, initially with pure spore suspensions {{and then with}} field samples. Provided surfactant was added and samples were processed immediately, centrifugation gave good recovery or spores from field samples which contained few <b>soil</b> <b>particles.</b> Foam-flotation, glycerol and sucrose methods for separation of spores from <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> were not satisfactory for P. herpotrichoides spores. A paraffin oil method {{proved to be the}} most reliable because it gave good recovery of P. herpotrichoides spores from field samples containing many <b>soil</b> <b>particles...</b>|$|R
30|$|The initial {{water content}} of soil, {{affected}} by climate, temperature and humidity, has important {{influence on the}} stability of aggregates and slope runoff. The initial water content correlates to the thickness of hydrated films surrounding the <b>soil</b> <b>particles,</b> namely the diffusion layer. The diffusion layer has a weakening effect on the suction among the <b>soil</b> <b>particles,</b> which means the increase of initial water content will weaken the matrix suction among the <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> and reduce the infiltration of water. In addition, the diffusion layer will weaken the structural links among <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> or micro–aggregates, causing the micro–aggregates to be more susceptible to external force. In addition, the increase of initial water content will decrease the effective void ratio, thereby narrowing the seepage space and weakening the intrusion effects.|$|R
50|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>particles</b> {{picked up}} during wind erosion of soil {{are a major}} source of air pollution, in the form of {{airborne}} particulates—"dust". These airborne <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> are often contaminated with toxic chemicals such as pesticides or petroleum fuels, posing ecological and public health hazards when they later land, or are inhaled/ingested.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1920s and 1930s {{scientists}} have been creating mathematical models for understanding the mechanisms of soil erosion and resulting sediment surface runoff, including an early paper by Albert Einstein applying Baer's law. These models have addressed both gully and sheet erosion. Earliest models were a simple set of linked equations which could be employed by manual calculation. By the 1970s the models had expanded to complex computer models addressing nonpoint source pollution with thousands of lines of computer code. The more complex models were able to address nuances in micrometerology, <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distributions and micro-terrain variation.|$|E
5000|$|Nutrient {{leaching}} occurs {{more readily}} in a sand-based system because sand has {{a relatively low}} cation exchange capacity (CEC). This refers to the sand's ability to retain nutrient particles. <b>Soil</b> <b>particle</b> [...] "hold on" [...] to positively charged nutrient particles because they are negatively charged. The opposite charges cause the nutrients to adhere to soil particles which can then be taken up by plants. Sand has virtually no CEC, whereas clay and organic matter have relatively high CEC. This means that the higher the clay and organic matter of a soil, the more nutrients it will hold.|$|E
50|$|Cation-exchange {{capacity}} (CEC) is {{a measure}} of how many cations can be retained on <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> surfaces. Negative charges on the surfaces of soil particles bind positively-charged atoms or molecules (cations), but allow these to exchange with other cations in the surrounding soil water. This is {{one of the ways that}} solid materials in soil alter the chemistry of the soil water. CEC affects many aspects of soil chemistry, and is used as a measure of soil fertility, as it indicates the capacity of the soil to retain several nutrients (e.g. K+, NH4+, Ca2+) in plant-available form. It also indicates the capacity to retain pollutant cations (e.g. Pb2+).|$|E
5|$|In other regions, {{the average}} {{radioactivity}} of surface soil due to residual americium {{is only about}} 0.01picocuries/g (0.37mBq/g). Atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to <b>soil</b> <b>particles.</b> <b>Soil</b> analysis revealed about 1,900 times higher concentration of americium inside sandy <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in loam soils.|$|R

30|$|The Sakiyamawan–Amitoriwan nature {{conservation}} area, which was {{designated as a}} {{nature conservation}} area in 2015 (Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan 2015 a), critically requires an immediate environmental impact assessment of the coastal marine ecosystems, such as those containing reef-building corals and E. acoroides. As basic information to the analysis, we provided transport properties of <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> in the region in this study. Here, we conducted atmosphere–ocean–river observations and numerical simulations for the area to understand the transport properties of <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> {{in the study area}} and the exchange of <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> between the Sakiyama and Amitori bays during summer and winter.|$|R
50|$|Another major {{determinant}} is the <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size. Clay {{particles are}} some of the smallest particles commonly found in soils. Due to their structure the spaces between individual clay particles is small and already restricts the passage of water, reducing infiltration and hence drainage. Soils with a high clay content are also easily compacted and affected by man-made discharges. Clay particles have a strong negative electrostatic charge and will readily bond to positively charged ions dissolved in the soil-water matrix. Common salts such as sodium ions contained in wastewater can fulfil this role and lead to a localized hardpan in some soil types. This is a common cause of septic system failure due to the prevention of proper drainage in field.|$|E
50|$|The biomantle {{includes}} the topsoil, or A horizon of soils, and also, any underlying lighter-colored (E) horizon {{that may be}} present. For midlatitude and subtropical soils that have typical A-E-B-C horizons and profiles, the biomantle is normally that part above the B horizon. In gravelly parent materials where <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> biosorting by animals {{has led to the}} formation of a stonelayer horizon (SL), the base of the stonelayer (SL) defines the base of the biomantle. Biomantles with basal stonelayers are two-layered biomantles that form in parent materials with heterogeneous particle sizes (mixtures of fines and gravels); those lacking stonelayers are one-layered biomantles that form in homogeneous materials (either sands, loess, or gravels of approximately uniform size). If two-layered, the soil profile horizon notations in midlatitude and some subtropical soils are: A-E-SL-B-C, where the A-E-SL horizons constitute the biomantle.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{has a lower}} {{thermodynamic}} {{free energy}} when in bulk ice than when in the supercooled liquid state. Therefore, there is a continuous replenishment of water flowing from the warm side to the cold side of the particle, and continuous melting to re-establish the thicker film on the warm side. The particle migrates downwards toward the warmer soil {{in a process that}} Faraday called [...] "thermal regelation." [...] This effect purifies the ice lenses as they form by repelling fine soil particles. Thus a 10-nanometer film of unfrozen water around each micrometer-sized <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> can move it 10 micrometers/day in a thermal gradient of as low as 1 °C m−1. As ice lenses grow, they lift the soil above, and segregate soil particles below, while drawing water to the freezing face of the ice lens via capillary action.|$|E
