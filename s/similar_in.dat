5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a better chance of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> stature to Robinson.

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{excavations}} at Gedi during the 1950s, concurrent excavations also {{took place at}} similar sites along the Swahili Coast. Wilson's 1982 survey of the 116 sites along the coast found 34 isolated ruins, which he concluded likely contained possible settlements or isolated dwellings. Although smaller settlements were studied, larger sites received the most attention. Other than Gedi, the site most intensively excavated was Ungwana {{at the mouth of}} the Tana River, which was <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> size to Gedi. However, compared to sites <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> size, Gedi had one of the more densely populated urban centers.|$|E

5|$|Antrodia serialiformis is <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but {{the latter has}} larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm).
