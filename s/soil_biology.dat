2500|$|The warmer {{atmospheric}} temperatures observed {{over the}} past decades are expected {{to lead to a}} more vigorous hydrological cycle, including more extreme rainfall events. [...] Erosion and soil degradation is more likely to occur. [...] Soil fertility would also be affected by global warming. However, because the ratio of soil organic carbon to nitrogen is mediated by <b>soil</b> <b>biology</b> such that it maintains a narrow range, a doubling of soil organic carbon is likely to imply a doubling in the storage of nitrogen in soils as organic nitrogen, thus providing higher available nutrient levels for plants, supporting higher yield potential. The demand for imported fertilizer nitrogen could decrease, and provide the opportunity for changing costly fertilisation strategies.|$|E

The decomposition of organic matter by soil organisms has an immense influence on soil fertility, plant growth, soil structure, and carbon storage.
