5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding <b>system</b> <b>requirements.</b> The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|Black & White {{received}} universal acclaim on release; reviewers {{praised the}} artificial intelligence, uniqueness, and depth, although the <b>system</b> <b>requirements</b> and bugs were criticised. Black & White won awards from several organisations, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Guinness World Record for {{the complexity of}} the artificial intelligence, selling over two million copies. Later re-reviews of the game considered it to have been over-rated at the time. An expansion, , and sequel, Black & White 2, followed.|$|E

5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several {{challenges for}} the developers. LucasArts requested the game to be produced for both DOS and Macintosh with the same <b>system</b> <b>requirements,</b> specifically the random-access memory (RAM). The Mac OS runs a graphical user interface which uses up RAM while DOS does not, meaning the Macintosh version has less RAM available for Dark Forces to use. Aaron Giles, who was the Macintosh programmer for Dark Forces, explained that to resolve this problem the memory had to be managed more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{designer}} Peter James described Flight Unlimited IIIs {{development as}} a struggle, thanks {{to a lack of}} interest from Electronic Arts and from Looking Glass's management. Placed in direct competition with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 and Fly!, the game failed to capture sufficient market share. It became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops, with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the company's closure in 2000. The game was well received by critics, who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather. Its simulated physics were lauded by several reviewers, but others felt that the physics were imprecise, and that the game's <b>system</b> <b>requirements</b> were extremely high.|$|E
5|$|Most critics gave Ultima Underworld II {{positive}} {{reviews and}} lauded its graphics, design and nonlinearity. Complaints focused on its high <b>system</b> <b>requirements</b> and unrefined pacing. It {{has been placed}} on numerous hall of fame lists since its release. In reaction to the game's difficult development, Looking Glass altered its design approach: they streamlined ideas from the Ultima Underworld series to create System Shock. The team pitched a sequel to Ultima Underworld II multiple times, but Origin Systems rejected the idea. Arkane Studios' Arx Fatalis (2002) is a spiritual successor to the franchise originally pitched as a sequel. OtherSide Entertainment's upcoming Underworld Ascendant will be the first officially licensed entry in the series in over 23 years.|$|E

Belfiore {{noted that the}} update would lower the minimum <b>system</b> <b>requirements</b> for Windows, {{so it can be}} installed on devices with as little as 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Unlike Windows 8.1 itself, this cumulative update is distributed through Windows Update, and must be installed in order to receive any further patches for Windows 8.1.|$|E

The firewall now blocks access to malicious sites using a blacklist updated by Symantec. To prevent attackers from leveraging insecurities in the Mac or installed software, exploit protection was introduced in this release. Phishing protection was introduced in this release as well. Operating <b>system</b> <b>requirements</b> call for Mac OS X 10.4.11 or higher. A PowerPC or Intel Core processor, 256 MB of RAM and 150 MB of free space are required.|$|E

5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum <b>system</b> <b>requirements</b> were an IBM compatible 486â€“25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E
5|$|The macOS client debuted on June 23, 2015 to {{coincide}} with the release of the first expansion pack. The port was handled by TransGaming. Unlike console and Microsoft Windows PC versions of the expansion, the Mac release is only available in a two-in-one bundle containing the base game and the Heavensward expansion, titled Final Fantasy XIV Online. Current players of other versions of the game, including Mac players running the PC version via Boot Camp, are required to purchase this bundle in order to play using the native Mac client. On July 3, 2015, Square Enix suspended sales of the Mac version because of widespread reports of poor technical performance and offered refunds to those who purchased it. Yoshida observed that the performance issues could be attributed to difficulties in transposing the game from Microsoft's proprietary DirectX graphical rendering libraries to OpenGL as well as a clerical error resulting in publishing the wrong minimum <b>system</b> <b>requirements,</b> both compounded by the hectic work schedule demanded by the release of an expansion pack. After new rounds of testing and optimization, sales of the Mac version resumed on February 23, 2016, accompanying the release of Patch 3.2.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep, now {{formally}} established as id Software, {{used some of}} these to prototype ideas for their own games. Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with 3D computer graphics, which until then was largely the purview of flight simulation games such as Wing Commander (1990). Carmack found that this was {{largely due to the}} limitations of personal computers of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast action game in 3D due to the number of surfaces it needed to calculate. During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through ray casting, in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D game engine that used animated 2D sprites for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game Hovertank 3D, in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters. In the fall of 1991, after the teamâ€”sans Wilburâ€”had relocated to Madison, Wisconsin, and he had largely finished the engine work for Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy, Carmack learned about , a role-playing game in development by Blue Sky Productions. Ultima Underworld was planned to display texture-mapped 3D graphics without Hovertanks restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting. Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's speed or greatly increasing the <b>system</b> <b>requirements</b> as Underworld was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from Hovertank 3D for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 Catacomb 3-D. Upon seeing it, Scott Miller of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.|$|E
