25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a <b>spotting</b> <b>drill</b> bit (or a <b>spot</b> <b>drill</b> bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.).

40|$|Abstract — Several factors {{influence}} {{the accuracy of}} drilled holes. The most obvious ones are the cutting conditions (cutting speed and feed rate) and cutting configurations (tool material, diameter, and geometry). As such, most previous studies have concentrated on these factors. However, in CNC drilling operations, choosing to use canned cycles may have significant effect on drilled hole quality. The objective of this project is to explore this possibility in detail. This paper presents experimental and analytical results of {{an investigation into the}} dimensional accuracy and surface finish of drilled holes using different canned cycles. A traditional analysis, the Pareto ANOVA, and the Taguchi S/N ratio are employed {{to determine the effects of}} the three major input parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and canned cycle) on three key accuracy characteristics of drilled holes (diameter error, circularity, and surface roughness), as well as to obtain an optimal combination of the input parameters. The work and tool materials selected are aluminum 6061 and high-speed steel (HSS), respectively. The results indicate that the canned cycle has a profound effect on drilled hole quality, and, in general, canned cycle <b>spot</b> <b>drilling</b> produces the best results.

40|$|Application {{of laser}} ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass {{spectrometry}} (LA-ICP-MS) {{has been studied}} {{as an alternative to}} radioluminography (RLG) for assessing the distribution of a novel anti-tuberculosis compound containing bromine as a "hetero-element" and its metabolites over the body compartments of rat, used as a test animal. In contrast to RLG, LA-ICP-MS does not require labeling of the drug compound with a radionuclide. After administration of the Br-containing drug and a sufficient delay time to allow drug uptake and distribution, the sacrificed animal was frozen and embedded in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), after which thin sections were obtained using a microtome. For quantification purposes, hardened gelatin films on a glass support were used as "matrix-matched" Br standards. The limit of detection (LOD) for Br estimated using one of these in-house made standards was 0. 1 mu g g(- 1), which is sufficiently low to allow visualization of Br in the main organ of interest (lung). LA-ICP-MS analysis via single <b>spot</b> <b>drilling</b> with a wider laser beam diameter on the organ of interest was performed as well. In this case, quantification was accomplished via external calibration versus droplets of standards containing the pure drug that were co-embedded with the rat. Figures of merit achievable with LA-ICP-MS were critically evaluated and compared to those typical for the traditional technique, based on the use of radionuclides...|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a <b>spotting</b> <b>drill</b> bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.|$|R
25|$|Center drill bits, {{occasionally}} {{known as}} Slocombe drill bits, {{are used in}} metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation {{in the end of}} a workpiece in which to mount a lathe center.

However, the true purpose of a center drill bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a <b>spotting</b> <b>drill</b> bit (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center drill bits combined-drill-and-countersinks {{in order to make it}} unambiguously clear what product is being ordered.

We argue that the conjugate Aptian salt basins are post-breakup, not pre-breakup; they were separated from the start by a mid-oceanic ridge; distal salt accumulated on proto-oceanic crust, not rift basins. This hypothesis is supported by: seismic stratigraphy and structure; magnetic anomalies; plate reconstructions; and hydrothermal potash evaporites.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of permeability fields from geophysical data in highly heterogeneous aquifers is proposed. It stems from the known relations between soil electric resistivity and permeability. The method is specific for VLF-Resistivity methods. In order to obtain classes of permeability several cutoffs are made to electric resistivity probability distribution. These cutoffs are heuristic estimates about what classes of values of one variable should relate to what classes of values of the other. The estimation method of the permeability fields is dependent of a prior identification of the transition probabilities. The permeability fields {{may be used in}} the development of conceptual models; autocorrelation distances (integer scales) obtained on the permeability fields may used as input to macrodispersivity models. The method was applied to the Karst aquifer of the Escarpão, in central Algarve, Portugal. The images obtained fitted well the geologic structures identified by field works. The results of this method may be useful for the selection of new <b>drilling</b> <b>spots,</b> as input to flow and solute transport models, for the a priori determination of macrodispersivity parameters, and of the fractal behaviour of permeability distribution.

This unique approach offers the opportunity to study in situ and at high spatial resolution both the mixing of different target lithologies and the variation of the major and trace element budget during the alteration process. In addition, two-dimensional element distribution maps reveal important geochemical information beyond the capabilities of single <b>spot</b> laser <b>drilling.</b> Glasses from two localities in opposite quadrants from the source crater were studied. At the Beloc locality (Haiti), the glass population {{is dominated by the}} presence of yellow high-Ca glass and black andesitic glass formed by admixture of carbonate/dolomite/anhydrite platform lithologies with crystalline basement. These glasses alter according to the well-established hydration-palagonitization model postulated for mafic volcanic glasses. REEs become progressively leached from the glass to below the detection limit for the applied spot size, while immobile Zr, Hf, Nb, and Ta passively accumulate in the process exhibiting both inter-element ratios and absolute concentrations similar to those for the original glass. In contrast, The Arroyo El Mimbral locality (NE Mexico) is characterized by abundant green glass fragments high in Si, Al and alkalis, and low in Mg, Ca, Fe. Low Si black glass is less abundant though similar in composition to the black glass variety at Beloc. The alteration pattern of high-Si, Al green glass at the Mimbral locality is more complex, including numerous competing reaction processes (ion-exchange, hydration, dissolution, and secondary mineral precipitation) generally controlled by the pH and composition of the surrounding fluid. All green, high-Si, Al glasses are hydrated and variably enriched in Sr, Ba, and Cs, indicating preferred adsorption from seawater during hydration. Despite the onset of ion-exchange reactions, which only seem to have affected the alkalis, the trace element composition of the green high-Si, Al glass is still largely representative of the original melt composition. Refining the geochemical signature of (altered) melt lithologies may advance our current understanding of glass stability in the natural environment and provide insight into the origin and emplacement of ejecta material during crater formation...|$|R

The goal of the work presented here is to maximize the science return from existing and future datasets. Chapter 2 uses multiple orbital datasets to characterize Gale Crater, with a focus on the northwestern crater floor and lower mound. This work played a role in the selection of Gale Crater as the landing site for Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). It was not possible to conclusively determine the origin of the lower mound, but we interpret features on the upper mound as aeolian cross-beds. Chapters 3 and 4 investigate methods for improving the accuracy of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). In Chapter 3, the accuracy of partial least squares (PLS) and two types of neural network are compared, using several pre-processing methods including automated feature selection. We find that partial least squares without averaging typically gives the best results. Chapter 3 also investigates the influence of grain size on the accuracy of analyses, showing that > 20 analysis spots may be required for heterogeneous targets. In Chapter 4, we test the hypothesis that clustering the dataset before analysis leads to improved accuracy. We observe modest improvements for five k-means clusters and with iterative application of clustering and PLS.

40|$|Ethiopia {{was hit by}} an El Nino induced drought during 2015 / 2016 {{that left}} {{millions}} across the country without access to adequate water supply. More than 220 districts throughout the country faced water supply emergencies. These areas are characterized by frequent shortage/shifting of rainy season and resulting water supply problems. During normal rainy years, the communities in these areas rely on rainwater harvesting, traditional ponds, hand dug wells excavated along wadis and a few shallow groundwater wells. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has a programme of rural water supply and is also the Emergency WASH cluster lead in Ethiopia. Hence it supports the government and other partners in the rehabilitation, maintenance and construction of new water supply systems {{in response to the}} drought. This report presents the first part of a joint hydrogeological study of UNICEF and the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) in nine selected woredas in the lowland areas of Afar, Somali, SNNPR, and Oromia regions in Ethiopia. The study aims to improve groundwater sector knowledge and the access to safe water in these woredas. Specifically, the main goal of the project is to locate drilling sites with a substantial increase in drilling success rate. In order to improve the success rate, it is vital to undertake reliable groundwater investigations. However, conventional methods to generate detailed hydrogeological maps require a huge amount of time, manpower, logistical and financial resources. Besides hydrogeological field studies, remote sensing (RS) based analysis can be carried out to identify the most feasible sites for drilling. The advantage of using RS data is their large spatial coverage and homogeneous data acquisition. Although there is no satellite-based sensor to measure the occurrence and amount of groundwater directly, different RS-based parameters (e. g., elevation, precipitation, evapotranspiration, vegetation) can be utilized in the assessment of groundwater potential as several studies have demonstrated that spatial variability in groundwater levels is controlled by surface and subsurface topography, vegetation, soil- and bedrock properties. The use of RS data does not eliminate or exclude the in situ data collection, which is needed to verify the accuracy of RS data and to aid their interpretation, but RS data helps to minimize field data collection. A combined approach was therefore applied in this study aiming to use all available information to increase the rate of successful drilling. The approach consists of three phases: 1) Remote sensing and overlay analysis, 2) Hydrogeological and geophysical field surveys, and 3) Drilling of productive test wells. The present report covers the first phase that comprised two main steps: a) data acquisition, processing & RS analysis, and b) overlay analysis. The RS analysis aims to generate thematic maps from RS-based products that are potentially relevant for the assessment of groundwater occurrence. Different RS datasets have been used to generate maps of the study woredas related to topography, geological structures (lineaments), climate (precipitation and evapotranspiration), vegetation, and hydrology. Information derived from these RS-based maps and other sources (e. g. geological maps) are then combined in a weighted overlay analysis to derive maps indicating the probability of groundwater occurrence (groundwater potential). Parameters assumed {{to be related to the}} main factors for the occurrence of groundwater (namely permeability of the geological unit, lineament density, slope, and recharge) were directly integrated in the overlay analysis that resulted in the generation of a groundwater potential map. Senior professionals from the Ethiopian groundwater sector were consulted for the weighting process. Other parameters (like NDVI, TWI, river network) and existing water point information were then utilised to check the plausibility of the map and to determine target areas for further analysis. Since the interest was also in deep groundwater exploration, the groundwater potential maps were adapted for deep groundwater using conceptual models and deep well data wherever the information was available. Afterwards, ground-truthing work, including the identification and prioritization of permanent settlements and villages with critical water supply problems and the collection of additional local hydrogeological information was undertaken in the target areas and the surroundings to check the results of the overlay analysis. The results of the ground-truthing revealed that the selected target areas for further analysis were appropriate. In the next steps, detailed hydrogeological and geophysical investigations will be conducted for the siting of <b>drilling</b> <b>spots</b> over the selected target areas. Similarly, based on the evaluation of the drilling results, the methodology will be up-scaled for further application to other areas. A precursor methodology was previously applied in selected woredas of Afar and Tigray. The results from this and actual drilling results obtained, as well as the present field verifications indicate that the method can certainly add value to the conventional hydrogeological investigation methods to improve drilling success rates. The applied approach allowed us with relatively low cost to identify areas with a high groundwater potential and therefore reduced the expenses for field work. Drilling results of about seven boreholes drilled within Afar and Tigray have been productive. Therefore, we recommend this approach should be encouraged and expanded to a larger scale over the country, continuing the successful partnership between UNICEF and JRC. JRC.
