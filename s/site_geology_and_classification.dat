40|$|In this paper, a {{fuzzy rating}} tool was {{developed}} for river-type hydropower plant projects, and risk assessment and expert judgments were utilized instead of probabilistic reasoning. The methodology is a multi-criteria decision analysis, which provides a flexible and easily understood way to analyze project risks.

A total of eleven classes of risk factors were determined based on the expert interviews, field studies and literature review as follows: <b>site</b> <b>geology,</b> land use, environmental issues, grid connection, social acceptance, macroeconomic, natural hazards, change of laws and regulations, terrorism, access to infrastructure and revenue. The relative importance of risk factors was determined from the survey results. The survey was conducted with the experts that have experience in the construction of river-type hydropower schemes. The survey results revealed that the <b>site</b> <b>geology</b> <b>and</b> environmental issues were considered as the most important risks.

40|$|Since 2006, a {{broadcasting}} {{tower and}} ancillary {{buildings on the}} top of a hill adjacent to a large, active limestone quarry, in northern Italy near the village of Valcava, has been heavily damaged by ground deformation due to slope instability. In 2005, the quarry began to work the slope toward the broadcasting plant, releasing bedding planes that affected the tower site: a number of fractures occurred in the warehouse and in the ground around it, that grew particularly during significant rainfalls. In October 2006 a landslide occurred in the quarry area, close to the broadcasting site. In order to understand what induced the fracture process in the buildings and define a support system to stabilize the broadcasting site, a detailed geotechnical survey and a number of numerical slope stability analyses were carried out. One of the main goals of the paper is to underline the effectiveness of the numerical analyses to understand the instability phenomena when they are particularly complex.

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} to stabilize slopes and landslides using driven, geotextile wick drains rather than drilled polyvinyl chloride or steel drains. Compared to drilled horizontal drains, wick drains can be significantly deformed without ruptur-ing. They resist clogging, {{and they can be}} installed quickly and economically by workers with no pre-vious training. Since 1998, more than 170 drains, totaling more than 2, 600 m (8, 600 ft) in length, have been installed at eight sites in Missouri, Colorado, and Indiana. At three of the sites, drains were installed at a density and layout considered to be appropriate for full-scale stabilization: 27 to 44 drains were driven at each site, averaging 15 to 20 m (50 – 70 ft) in length. A method was developed to accurately estimate the groundwater-table profile after drain installation, and computer slope-stability analysis using this method showed significant in-creases (10 – 40 percent) in factors of safety after drain installation. The limitations of the methodology should be recognized: it may be applied in specific situations requiring relatively short (< 30 – 45 m, or < 100 – 150 ft) drains in materials ranging from soft to very stiff (up to 30 blows/ft in standard penetra-tion tests).

Regulations promulgated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as amended (RCRA) are evaluated as applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs) for remediation of the FEMP. Historically, joint CERCLA-RCRA guidance dictated that hazardous waste could not be treated, or {{moved out of the}} designated area of contiguous contamination (AOC), without triggering land disposal restrictions (LDRs) or minimum technology requirements (MTRs). To avoid invoking these stringent requirements, in situ capping was chosen as the lower cost remedy at many sites, although on-site disposal and/or treatment of hazardous wastes would have been more protective.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} the effects of {{hydrodynamic}} functioning of hard-rock aquifers on microbial communities. In hard-rock aquifers, the heterogeneous hydrologic circulation strongly constrains groundwater residence time, hydrochemistry, and nutrient supply. Here, residence time and a wide range of environmental factors were used to test the influence of groundwater circulation on active microbial community composition, assessed by high throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA. Groundwater of different ages was sampled along hydrogeologic paths or loops, in three contrasting hard-rock aquifers in Brittany (France). Microbial community composition was driven by groundwater residence time and hydrogeologic loop position. In recent groundwater, in the upper section of the aquifers or in their recharge zone, surface water inputs caused high nitrate concentration and the predominance of putative denitrifiers. Although denitrification does not seem to fully decrease nitrate concentrations due to low dissolved organic carbon concentrations, nitrate input has a major effect on microbial communities. The occurrence of taxa possibly associated with the application of organic fertilizers was also noticed. In ancient isolated groundwater, an ecosystem based on Fe(II) /Fe(III) and S/SO 4 redox cycling was observed down to several 100 of meters below the surface. In this depth section, microbial communities were dominated by iron oxidizing bacteria belonging to Gallionellaceae. The latter were associated to old groundwater with high Fe concentrations mixed to a small but not null percentage of recent groundwater inducing oxygen concentrations below 2. 5 mg/L. These two types of microbial community were observed in the three sites, independently of <b>site</b> <b>geology</b> <b>and</b> aquifer geometry, indicating hydrogeologic circulation exercises a major control on microbial communities...|$|R
