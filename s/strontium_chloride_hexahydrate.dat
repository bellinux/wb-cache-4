40|$|The way {{in which}} <b>strontium</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> {{prevents}} the supercooling of latent heat storage systems based on calcium chloride hexahydrate was investigated. It can be established from the ternary equilibrium system CaCl 2 [...] -SrCl 2 [...] -H 2 O and proved also experimentally that crystals of <b>strontium</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> separated from one another are unsuitable {{for the prevention of}} the supercooling of calcium chloride hexahydrate melts, because of the dehydrating properties of the melt. Cohering agglomerates (of 2 - 3 cm) of microcrystals, containing adhering water, preserve for a much longer time their nucleating property, because concentration conditions established in the interior of the aggregation differ from the composition needed for the melt. The life of the nucleating agent depends on the length of time for which this concentration gradient is equalized by diffusion processes. ...|$|E

Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate different aluminium test preparations regarding an optimal compound and an optimal test concentration. Methods. Six different aluminium compounds and an empty Finn Chamber® were used to patch test 21 patients with aluminium contact allergy. Aluminium <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> in saline was used for intracutaneous injection of 19 patients. Results: One test preparation, aluminium lactate 2. 4 %, was found to show significantly more positive patch test reactions than aluminium <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> 2. 0 % (p = 0. 03). Aluminium <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> at 10. 0 % pet. gave the highest number of positive reactions to aluminium [14 / 21 (67 %) ].

The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine the cytotoxic and/or proliferative effects of strontium chloride on fibroblast cell culture. Method. A mouse connective tissue fibroblast cell line, L 929 (ATCC cell line, NCTC clone 929) was cultured. Fibroblast cell lines were examined with 20 %, 10 %, 5 %, 2. 5 %, 1. 25 %, 0. 6 %, and 0. 3 % (w/v) concentrations of <b>Strontium</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> (SrCl 2. 6 H 2 O).

40|$|Growth {{rates of}} the Argentinean wedge clam Donax hanleyanus were {{estimated}} comparing two different methods in the intertidal of the exposed sandy beach Mar de las Pampas: (i) results of a relatively shortly (49 days) tagging-recapture experiment using the in situ fluorescent marking (IFM) method and subsequent size-increment analyses were compared with results from (ii) length-frequency distributions (LFD) analysis originating from a time consuming 25 month quantitative sampling. Residuals, derived from IFM method and LFD analysis, were of similar magnitude and distribution, indicating that both methods are equally appropriate to estimate growth of D. hanleyanus. Comparing overall growth performance indices (OGPs) of several Donax species from different climate areas it resulted that growth of temperate bivalves can be estimated well by carrying out a relatively short-time tagging-recapture experiment using IFM but it is recommended to use both, the IFM {{as well as the}} LFD method to determine growth of tropical bivalves. Furthermore, an in vitro suitability test of the three stains <b>strontium</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate,</b> alizarin red and calcein resulted that the latter is useful as non-lethal growth marker for D. hanleyanus, emitting a bright green fluorescence band under blue light...|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the effects of fluoride, strontium, theobromine and their combinations on caries lesion rehardening and fluoridation (EFU) under pH cycling conditions. Design Human enamel specimens were demineralized at 37 °C for 24 h using a pH 5. 0 solution containing 50 mM lactic acid and 0. 2 % Carbopol 907 which was 50 % saturated with respect to hydroxyapatite. Lesions were assigned to nine treatment groups (n = 16) based on Knoop surface microhardness indentation length. Treatment aqueous solutions were: placebo, 11. 9 mM sodium fluoride (F), 23. 8 mM sodium fluoride (2 × F), 1. 1 mM <b>strontium</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> (Sr), 1. 1 mM F theobromine, Sr + theobromine, F + Sr, F + theobromine, F + Sr + theobromine. Lesions were pH cycled for 5 d (daily protocol: 3 × 1 min-treatment; 2 × 60 min-demineralization; 4 × 60 min & overnight-artificial saliva). Knoop indentation length was measured again and%surface microhardness recovery (%SMHr) calculated. EFU was determined using the acid-etch technique. Data were analysed using ANOVA. Results Model showed fluoride dose-response for both variables (2 × F > F > placebo). For%SMHr, F + Sr+/−theobromine resulted in more rehardening than F, however less than 2 × F. F + theobromine was similar to F. For EFU, F + Sr was inferior to F, F + theobromine and F + Sr + theobromine which were similar and inferior to 2 × F. In absence of fluoride, Sr, theobromine or Sr + theobromine were virtually indistinguishable from placebo and inferior to F. Conclusions It can be concluded that a) strontium aids rehardening but not EFU and only in presence of fluoride; b) theobromine does not appear to offer any anti-caries benefits in this model; c) there are no synergistic effects between strontium and theobromine in {{the presence or absence of}} fluoride...|$|E

40|$|Different stains {{are used}} to {{internally}} mark calcified structures of mollusc shells in growth experiments. Because of interspecific variations in marking success, an assessment of suitability for each species is necessary. The potential of calcein, alizarin red, and <b>strontium</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> (strontium chloride) was investigated for the Chilean abalone Concholepas concholepas and the surf clam Mesodesma donacium, two molluscs of commercial importance in Chile. Wild specimens from Northern Chile were marked using different concentrations and immersion periods of the three stains. Animals were reared for 20 days to allow growth, mortality, body condition index (BCI), and growth rate was measured to assess {{the effects of the}} treatments. To detect marks, individuals were culled and shell sections analyzed using scanning electron microscopy for strontium chloride and fluorescence microscopy for calcein and alizarin red, respectively. Strontium chloride produced narrow bright bands only at concentrations of 2, 880 [mg x [l. sup. - 1] and 24 h exposure. Calcein markings produced fluorescent bands detectable in all treatments (50 and 100 mg x [l. sup. - 1], 3 and 6 h) whereas alizarin red only yielded irregular bands with 50 - 100 mg x [l. sup. - 1] and 6 h exposure. Our results show that growth rates of C. concholepas are significantly affected by the stains factor: Strontium chloride showed the lowest growth rates whereas that of alizarin red and calcein was similar to the control group. High concentrations of strontium chloride negatively affected (P < 0. 05) the body condition of the gastropod. Although no statistical differences were found, BCI of M. donacium followed the same trend as observed for C. concholepas. In conclusion, calcein was the best growth marker for both species because it produced bright, long-lasting bands even at low concentrations and immersion times without detectable lethal or sublethal effects...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} strontium chloride {{could be used to}} create a trans-generational otolith mark in steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss). I completed two strontium injection trials and a survey of juvenile steelhead from various steelhead hatcheries. The two trials measured Sr:Ca ratios in otoliths in response to injections and the survey measured the natural variation in Sr:Ca ratios in otoliths of juvenile hatchery steelhead in response to the natural variation. In 2003, adult female Wallowa River, Oregon O. mykiss, were captured at the hatchery and evenly divided between a control group and two treatment groups. These females received an intraperitoneal injection of 1 cc/ 500 g of body weight of a physiologically isotonic solution (0. 9 % saline) containing concentrations of 0 (control), 1000, or 5000 parts per million (ppm) of <b>strontium</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> (SrCl{sub 2 }* 6 H{sub 2 }O). Females were housed in a single outdoor tank until spawned artificially, and a distinct external tag identified each female within each treatment group. In 2004, female steelhead were captured throughout the duration of the adult returns to the Umatilla River basin and injected with 0, 1000, 5000, or 20, 000 -ppm strontium. In both trials, progeny of fish treated with strontium had significantly higher Sr:Ca ratios in the primordial region of their otoliths as measured using an electron wavelength dispersive microprobe. There was no difference in fertilization rates of eggs and survival rates of fry among treatment groups. Progeny from treated mothers were on average larger than progeny of untreated mothers. The Sr:Ca ratios in otoliths collected from various populations of steelhead were greater than the control values measured in both injections studies. This study suggests that the marking technique works and the utility for such a technique could be used for empirical observations in determining the relative fitness of progeny of adult hatchery origin fish that spawn naturally. The variation in Sr:Ca ratios found among steelhead hatcheries suggests that care must be taken if the technique is employed where fish from more than one hatchery could potentially be involved...|$|E
