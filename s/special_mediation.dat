40|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} {{approaches to the}} analysis of conflict situations and ways of developing mediation or negotiation procedures. In general, we can distinguish between socio-political approaches, procedures for mediation and negotiation which have developed historically through political experience, and systems-analytical, mathematical approaches, which rely on various branches of decision and game theory or on computerized simulation or gaming models. While the socio-political approaches must remain the basis of any analysis of conflict situations, they can usefully be supplemented by more-formalized approaches; both approaches, when used separately, have their limitations. This paper, after a short review of existing systems-analytical and mathematical approaches, proposes new concepts and methods for the mathematical analysis of conflict processes. The proposed approach attempts {{to bridge the gap between}} simulation gaming models and experiments and more formal game-theoretical analysis by taking certain ideas from interactive decision supported gaming, assuming that the players have multiple objectives that they wish to satisfice (not optimize), and introducing <b>special</b> <b>mediation</b> procedures as an element of decision support during the game. The mathematical concepts used are the selection of satisficing game equilibria, the definition of constructive and destructive behavior (on the part of the players), and a formalization of conflict escalation and de-escalation processes...|$|E

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to a more adequate understanding of the adoption of modern audiovisual mass media by contemporary religious groups. It does so by examining Pentecostal-charismatic churches as well as the Christian mass culture instigated by its popularity, and so-called traditional religion in Ghana, which develop markedly different attitudes towards audiovisual mass media and assume different positions in the public sphere. Taking into account the complicated entanglement of traditional religion and Pentecostalism, approaching both religions from a perspective of mediation which regards media as intrinsic to religion, and seeking to avoid the pitfall of overestimating the power of modern mass media to determine the world, this article seeks to move beyond an unproductive recurrence to oppositions such as tradition and modernity, or religion and technology. It is argued that instead of taking as a point of departure more or less set ideas about the nexus of vision and modernity, the adoption of new mass media by religious groups needs to be analyzed by a detailed ethnographic investigation of how these new media transform existing practices of religious <b>mediation.</b> <b>Special</b> emphasis is placed on the tension between the possibilities of gaining public presence through new media, and the difficulty in authorizing these media, and the experiences they induce, as authentic.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to {{research}} parental mediation of 5 - 7 year-old children’s media use. It is important to research parents so we could understand how parents see their part and role of their children media decisions. Through ten interviews we can see how 5 - 7 year-old children use the media through their mothers and fathers eyes. There were three main questions for what the research tried to answer: How parents describe their children’s media usage habits; What kind of parental mediation parents can see to have themselves through their opinion; What kind of strategies parents use to guide their children’s media usage. As a result parents {{feel that they have}} an influence for their children and that mostly they have the power to guide their children. Mostly they know what kind of TV-programs and internet games their children watch or play. They claim to say, what kind of media children should use and as a result they know exactly what their children do. Although the program, that kids watch is not always suitable for them. Even though parents admit that their children watch TV or play behind computer quite a long hours, they do not see the reason for using some special steps or strategies for limiting children media usage. The {{reason for this is that}} they feel that they know what their children are doing in the internet and what they watch from the TV so they do not need any <b>special</b> parental <b>mediation</b> strategy’s at the moment. As children grow they watch what kind of rules they should use or what kind of parental mediation to apply. As parents describe their children media usage, we can see, that they know if the program is not suitable for children but they do not think it is something bad or that it has some bad consequences. Kikas (2008) has pointed out, that things the children see from TV or internet has a great physiological and psychological impact for their understandings. Parents see their role as being part of development of children media usage and media interest. They want to guide and supervise their children to understand what kind of show is good for a kid. Parents want to feel needed and important – being part of their children development.

The most important feature of this alumni network, ganaa (German African Network of Alumni and Alumnae) is its thematic focus on theoretical and practical aspects of multilingualism and language policies in Africa (and, comparatively, in Europe). The network is innovative in several ways, specifically also through its special emphasis on second and foreign language instruction and by taking into <b>special</b> account the <b>mediation</b> of the respective "other" cultures. This was achieved through a trialogue between Germany/Europe, Arabic/Islamic North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. Although the thematic focus might in the first place interest linguists and language mediators – especially researchers in the fields of sociolinguistics, Arabic Studies, African Languages and Linguistics, German Studies (the latter specifically including specialists in German as a Foreign Language) – and possibly also educators and social scientists, in principle the network aims to address all researchers and practitioners whose professions confront them with the daily routines of practised multilingualism in Africa. The latter range from researchers in the education and media sectors to teachers of mathematics and ministerial officers in State departments, from research oriented political advisers to those directly and politically responsible for implementation of policy. The ganaa-network is open to all of them because, on the one hand, they can be regarded as "alumni/alumnae" (i. e. they actually have an academic and/or professional affiliation with a university in Germany) and, on the other hand, they are interested, for whatever reason, in exploring multilingualism and language policies in Africa (and, comparatively, in Europe).

40|$|In today's largest open environment, the World Wide Web, human-to-computer {{interactions}} are predominant. The natural evolution envisioned {{by many people}} is towards a Web in which the majority of interactions will be computer-to-computer. This has certain benefits but also raises significant research challenges. For addressing some of these challenges, we use the concept of service to model computer-to-computer interactions. A service is delivered by a provider upon request from a consumer. In this thesis, we address research {{issues related to the}} discovery of services, their composition as workflows, and the optimal execution of these workflows with respect to given cost measures. In addressing these research issues, we concentrate on those aspects specific to open environments, in particular the large number of possible services. This is taken into account for both discovery and composition. Prevailing approaches to composition assume all services to be known a prior, whereas in our case services are incrementally retrieved from a directory. The composer uses the current search state to iteratively generate new queries to the directory. As these queries can be quite complex, the directory supports an expressive formalism both for the description of the service request and for the control of the discovery process. As the result set of a query can be potentially large, guiding the discovery process is key to speed up the composition process. This is achieved by user-specified selection and ranking functions that encode algorithm-specific heuristics. In order for the discovery process to be efficient, we have designed our directory as a search tree where service descriptions are numerically represented as sets of intervals. Inner nodes in the search tree provide bounds regarding potential results in each sub-tree. These bounds are used for guiding the search process in a best-first manner. We reconcile flexibility with efficiency by making the internal organization of the directory completely transparent to the client. The original query is transformed into a relaxed version that is used for evaluating internal nodes of the directory. As in open environments directories are accessed by multiple clients, consistency of the directory is ensured through a technique based on multiversion concurrency control, well integrated with the internals of the directory system. In our case, a version represents a complete read-only search tree. Our composition engine uses type-related constraints between services in order to automatically generate workflows. In addition to completely matching services, our system also accommodates partially matching services. In this case, the composition engine integrates several services using a switch, although each service taken alone may fail type compatibility. Based on runtime values, the appropriate service is used such that type-compatibility is ensured. Composed services formulated as workflows can be optimally executed according to given cost metrics. For this purpose, we introduce a <b>special</b> execution <b>mediation</b> layer, formed by execution sites, each situated in the proximity of one ore more services. Parts of the workflow are optimally distributed across execution sites...|$|R
40|$|For {{over half}} a century now section 2 (a) of the Arbitration Act 42 of 1965 has {{prohibited}} arbitration in respect of matrimonial and related matters. In this article, it will be illustrated that this prohibition is clearly incompatible with present-day demands. Today {{there is a strong}} tendency in public policy towards alternative dispute resolution processes such as arbitration. As any recommendations that arbitration should be applied to family law disputes must be anchored in an analysis of the specific character of the arbitral remedy, the article begins by giving a broad overview of the nature of arbitration. This is followed by a discussion of the present-day demand for family arbitration, which examines the problems experienced with the adversarial system of litigation in resolving family law disputes, party-autonomy, the development of alternative dispute resolution processes such as mediation and arbitration, the <b>special</b> synergy between <b>mediation</b> and arbitration, the success of arbitration in other fields of law and possible forerunners for family arbitration in South Africa. Inherent in the demand for family law arbitration are the many advantages of arbitration which are also touched upon. Thirdly, current trends in England, Australia, the United States of America, Canada and India are analysed so as to identify a suitable family law arbitration model for South Africa. Special attention is paid to the matters that should be referred to arbitration – for example, should it be confined to matrimonial property and financial disputes or extended to all matters incidental to divorce or family breakdown, including children’s issues? Other questions examined include whether family arbitration should comply with substantive law only, who should act as arbitrators, whether family arbitration should be voluntary or compulsory, what the court’s role in the family arbitration process should be, and whether family law arbitration should be regulated by the existing Arbitration Act or by a separate statute with specialised rules for family matters. Lastly, it is concluded that although family arbitration will not have universal appeal or common application, it should be encouraged and enforceable for those who choose this private alternative dispute settlement technique to resolve their family disputes.

Highlight also that the agreement takes procedural efficiency so it will be taken into account by the judge who handed down resolution in the case, approving it as a procedural exception (art. 1816 CC). In terms of the need to use such an instrument, we can observe as the jurisprudence of way reiterated at the heart of the conflicts of divorce and separation is pronounced to please attend this conciliation mechanism, as well as the doctrine, and even the which justifies the need for such an instrument to attend mediator, showing in - 56 - the table appearing in the work the differences between attending the consensual way and contentious via, and the advantages that derive from the first 86. Following the exhibition of the work, we can see that the procedures listed to follow in the procedure taking into account, as it indicates the Supreme Court which points out the importance of such an instrument to prevent conflicts that could affect third parties, especially to the children, "all decisions of importance for the child to be taken in a consensual way, resorting to mediation procedures in case of disagreement 87. We can affirm according with the mediation that is a form of collaboration of the citizens in the administration of Justice, by participating in the solution of its problems and is carried out with a staff of trained acting in the process by facilitating the adoption of an agreement by the parties. Such a process, cited in a schematic way is characterized by the following features according to Fabrega Ruiz, C. F. and M. Heredia Puente, M. 88 : Referral to mediation, it is said by the Court that the request to the parties to attend an information session and according to the doctrine in certain matters such as marital conflicts with minors and it should be compulsory (art. 158. 6 CC). The second is the phase of session informative, that is used to explain the benefits and rules of mediation to the parties, which can appear assisted by their lawyers and, ultimately, if they wish to continue will sign an informed consent. Then, the parts can continue the process, suspending the course of orders for the period provided for sixty days or by deriving a measurement without such suspension, but after the deadline, the parties must be able to request an extension to continue mediation (art. 19 LEC). The next phase in the process is the communication in which each party must send to the mediator their perception of the problem and can participate the other party always that do not interrupt and hold a position of active listening, which can come the lawyers. 86 URIA ETXEBARRIA, M. «Intrajudicial mediation… », cit., p. 50 - 53. 87 F. J. Tercero, STS. TS Sala 1 ª, núm. 579 / 2011, 22 de julio de 2011. 88 FABREGA RUIZ, C. F, «Intrajudicial mediation… », cit., p. 7 - 8. - 57 - The phase of negotiation continues, which may also consist of several sessions and in which the parties can contact directly the word or discuss under the control and direction of the mediator, trying to propose solutions. The other phase of the agreement, it is in which aims at the adoption of specific agreements which the mediator writes and delivers to the parties and their lawyers so they formulate proposals and counterproposals relevant. The phase of ratification of the agreement is the following, which is held separately with the corresponding period of reflection and consultation for the parties. The other phase, is the execution or voluntary compliance with what has been agreed, is that is then. In last place we can sign the monitoring process of which is the agreement to adapt to every circumstance of the parties. After the completion of phases, can happen different situations, as outlined in the work: If the agreement is not achieved, stands the suspension of the process at the request of either party and resumes the orders in the procedure in which it is located, still recommended that such matters have priority in the signs in order to compensate for the delay which the mediational attempt to generate. In the event that the agreement is partial, the parties must notify the Court to continue the procedure with respect to issues not agreed in the exposed form and issued final resolution, auto or judgment, collected reached measures and resolved in that there is a discrepancy. But, in the case of the agreement is complete, the judge approved it and will give the same the value of executable judicial resolution via the forced to comply voluntarily. On the other hand, the work explores the organs facilitators of the agreement, which are mediators. Besides, there is a consideration intrajudicial family mediation services, formed by mediators that should comply with the principles cited in the work by referring to the mediation agreement In this regard, which it can be can observed in the CGPJ’s notes 89. - 58 - Such bodies have improved their performance over time and they have provided that the conflicting parties, whether they are in a situation of divorce as separation become to reach a satisfactory agreement, given the advantages that arise as pointed out by the doctrine and jurisprudence to study this question. In the next place, we can indicate that it is the team of mediators, which must meet a series of features like the experience, training and professionalism and that must be entered in the register of mediators in Spain, as continues by pointing out the guide of the CGPJ. In this regard it is provided the possibility of exercising the work of mediation by more than one person jointly; pointing out that "can be effect through the intervention of one or more persons mediating, who will act in a coordinated way, depending on the complexity of the subject or the convenience of the parties to the same. When there will be more than one mediator, one of them must act as a coordinating mediator" (art. 11 LMACM). According with the standard, it is stipulated the number of members, even though they have to act more to help adopt the solution most relevant to the case and in such a situation, they must act together, being a person if it was necessary, which should serve as coordinator of the different measures to adopt as well as between the parties, to help them to solve the case of the more timely manner both to persons who have dependants. The rule also says that several people will be who participate as mediators if so require the specific issue concerning or according to the convenience of the parties, thus excluding the possibility that such a measure is applied widely in all situations. Also the standard provides the possibility of proposition of lawyers by the mediators in the mediation sessions. The third basic element is the collaboration agreement, which will be signed by the judge or court and the team of mediators. Once formulated the agreement, everything it should be communicated to the CGPJ, the main member of Government of the High Court of Justice, The Director of 89 URIA ETXEBARRIA, M. «Intrajudicial mediation… », cit., p. 41 - 45. - 59 - Public Prosecutions of the Court of Justice, deans of colleges of lawyers and social services of the municipalities, according to the guide of the CGPJ. Next to the previous basic elements, the following elements of the procedure are: First, the Secretary and the judicial office, guarantee information, summon the parties and the administrative control. Second, the psychosocial team that is important because its function is to establish the benefits and advantages that mediation produces depending on the case, and thus causing towards the staff of the courts the conviction of what best suits. Finally, the public prosecutor's Office is essential to intervene in the protection of the minor children and for divorce or separation in which can be affected the minors rights, because this organ has the function of Act on the protection of children, and there is that of power start mediation when the prosecutor considers that it is more satisfactory for the minors, according to the law 50 / 1981 which regulates the Organic Statute of the public prosecutor and his functions. In the next place, we can observe the autonomic rules pay more attention to the set of laws of family mediation which have been enacted in the autonomous communities, and also, the mediation organs. It’s necessary stressing that the mediators specialize in the work after completing a Bachelor's degree which provides that "the professional of family mediation, unless the specific qualification which enable to carry out such activity, provided by legal regulations must have university training in the disciplines of law Psychology or Social work, Social education or Social graduate, … in order to register in the mediating family’s register” (art. 7 LMACM). The training of mediators is regulated both at the national level, by the laws of the different autonomous communities which refer to them, lacking in some regions, like the Navarre of such regulation. In addition, the same one also appears stipulated in standards at Community level, as shown by the Directive 2008 / 52 and the Forum European standards of training in family mediation, made up of more than 60 associations from eight European countries, including Spain, which has established as minimum standard of training in family mediation of 180 hours of theoretical and practical training, which includes legal notions especially in family law, tax basic knowledge, such as the preparation of budgets, interview techniques and others. - 60 - Referring to the proposal of improvements, point out that they indicated which is considered necessary to adopt in the system Spanish given that the Directive 2008 / 52 leaves without addressing matters concerning mediation, although Member States have full legislative autonomy to such work. In addition, in which they have a federal or autonomous system, they also involved territorial entities, as in the Spanish system which has been made by the majority of the autonomous communities, focusing on administrative, procedural aspects and others matters which are professional mediators configuration, the legal regime that will be of application and in particular the responsibility that may be payable, according to Ortuño Muñoz, P 90. Also, the definition of the "models" of mediation following the basic principles of the directive, will be at the discretion of the States or, where appropriate, of the different schools of mediators without being enforceable by the Board a unique model. As well as the effectiveness of the terms of submission to mediation, the same can be inserted in contracts and agreements and the scope and intensity of the judicial or administrative referrals to mediation, and the obligatory nature of such practices. In the next place, there are measures to improve the guarantees of the procedure, consideration of the <b>special</b> nature of <b>mediation</b> agreements and agreements of impugn regime. Finally, we must do allusion also to the conclusions, that component last part of work, in which we can observe that the work has sought to expose the legal regulation of mediation within the national and regional normative framework agreement, on the basis of Community rules in the existing connection, which has been transposed int...|$|R
