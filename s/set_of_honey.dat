50|$|A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bees, called swarm, can {{successfully}} accomplish tasks through social cooperation. In the ABC algorithm, {{there are three}} types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The employed bees search food around the food source in their memory; meanwhile they share the information of these food sources to the onlooker bees. The onlooker bees tend to select good food sources from those found by the employed bees. The food source that has higher quality (fitness) will have a large chance to be selected by the onlooker bees than the one of lower quality. The scout bees are translated from a few employed bees, which abandon their food sources and search new ones.|$|E

In this work the potential of zNose(TM), a surface acoustic wave-based sensor, was tested for honey quality assessment. Buckwheat honey was purposely adulterated with different levels of beet and cane invert sugar, and its aroma profile was measured after different periods of headspace equilibration. PCA using the relative peak areas {{as well as the}} full zNose(TM) spectra resulted in a clear separation between honey, and beet and cane invert sugar adulterants in the mixtures. PLS models were developed for quantitative estimation of adulterants using the entire spectra as well as the relative peak areas.

A correlation of validation of 0. 98 was obtained between predicted and measured percentage of adulteration.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if imidacloprid, provided in sub-lethal doses, could influence honey bee behaviour in the laboratory. Imidacloprid (supplied as Confidor®) was offered to bees in 50 % sucrose solution at two different concentrations (100 ppb and 500 ppb of active ingredient). Each dose was administered both as single dose and ad libitum, to three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> 10 <b>honey</b> bee fora-gers. Bees fed with 50 % sucrose solution were used as a control. Feeding occurred in holding cages in an incubator in complete darkness. After administration, in each treatment, the behaviour of the bees was recorded with an IR camera, and then analysed with “The Observer ” computer program. In each treatment bees were significantly less active (in terms of mobility) than bees in the untreated control. Furthermore, in the treated bees, the communicative capacity seemed to be impaired, and this could cause a decline in the social behaviour. Never-theless, the negative effects appeared only after a certain period of time following administration (30 - 60 minutes) and vanished after several hours. Imidacloprid therefore has an inhibiting, even though transitory, effect on honey bees. We assume that the period of time in which honey bee behaviour is altered could negatively affect both the individual and the entire colony.

Evaluating the suitability <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> for the detection of the viral disease by simultaneous testing of live, dead bees, and honey from the same hive, it was shown that the honey can be successfully used for the detection of BQCV. Since, as of yet, there has been no evidence of KBV circulation in Serbia, after its detection in imported honey, there is a substantial risk of its introduction and consequently the need for its surveillance. Therefore, the programs of bee diseases screening {{should be included in the}} regular control procedures for the international trade.
