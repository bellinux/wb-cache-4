40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{implementation}} of effective risk-based anti-money laundering (AML) /combating the financing <b>of</b> terrorism (CFT) <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in order to properly address the risks facing the financial services industry. It seeks to argue that most <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> currently in place are ineffective and bureaucratic and do not address the real risks. Design/methodology/approach – The paper outlines the recent history of AML/CFT measures and the underlying reasons for their adoption. It then argues that if risk-based is to be adopted a methodology to address the risks must first be designed. The paper outlines the pre-requisites for the design <b>of</b> such a <b>system</b> and the factors that need to be considered for implementation. The paper highlights the need for regulators to fall in line with the risk-based approach and to pass back to senior management responsibility for the implementation <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> which are appropriate and proportionate. Findings – Most <b>of</b> the current <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in AML/CFT are driven by regulatory requirements and not an understanding of the risk facing the firm. Originality/value – The paper is original work of the Financial Services Commission in its entirety.

25|$|The Board of Punishments handled {{all legal}} matters, {{including}} {{the supervision of}} various law courts and prisons. The Qing legal framework was relatively weak compared to modern day legal systems, as there was no separation of executive and legislative branches of government. The legal system could be inconsistent, and, at times, arbitrary, because the emperor ruled by decree and had final say on all judicial outcomes. Emperors could (and did) overturn judgements of lower courts from time to time. Fairness of treatment was also an issue under the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> practised by the Manchu government over the Han Chinese majority. To counter these inadequacies and keep the population in line, the Qing government maintained a very harsh penal code towards the Han populace, {{but it was no}} more severe than previous Chinese dynasties.|$|E

Bostock was not consulted about the decision and fully expected to see Australian aircraft as he watched for the Allied formations from a US warship during the battle. He later said that he would have thankfully [...] "fallen through a crack in the boards on the deck" [...] when he saw only American aircraft flying overhead, and had to apologise to Kenney for the RAAF's absence. Over all, the dual <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and the tension between its two senior officers confused the RAAF's efforts in the field and reduced its influence on Allied strategy in the Pacific.|$|E
500|$|On 23 October 1940, White Eagles members massed {{outside the}} campus of the University of Belgrade. University {{president}} Petar Micić was a Zbor sympathizer. The Belgrade police, who were alleged to have had foreknowledge of the riots, withdrew from the area before violence erupted. The White Eagles members then threatened faculty and students with pistols and knives, stabbed some of them, hailed Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini as their heroes and shouted [...] "down with the Jews!" [...] Members of Slovenski Jug (Slavic South), a Serbian nationalist movement, participated in the riots, which were orchestrated by Ljotić to provoke martial law and bring about a more centralized <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in the university. The Serbian public responded to the riots with outrage. On 24 October, the Yugoslav government revoked Zbor's legal status. On 2 November, the Ministry of Interior sent a list of Zbor members to all municipal administrators in Serbia. The government cracked down on Zbor by detaining several hundred members, forcing Ljotić into hiding. One of the only public figures in Serbia to speak in favour of Ljotić during this period was Serbian Orthodox Bishop Nikolaj Velimirović, who praised his [...] "faith in God" [...] and [...] "good character". Although a government investigation found that Zbor was guilty of high treason for accepting German funds, the authorities were careful not to arrest Ljotić in order to not provoke the Germans. Ljotić was placed under government surveillance but authorities quickly lost track of him. He hid with friends in Belgrade and remained in contact with Nedić and Velimirović. On 6 November, Nedić resigned from his post to protest the government crackdown on Zbor. Additional issues of Bilten continued to be printed despite his resignation. These supported a pro-Axis Yugoslav foreign policy, criticized the government's tolerance of Jews and Freemasons and attacked pro-British members of the government for their opposition to Yugoslavia signing the Tripartite Pact. Ljotić remained in hiding until April 1941.|$|E

2500|$|Ginsberg used Solomon as {{an example}} of all those ground down by the machine of [...] "Moloch". Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a Levantine god to whom {{children}} were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem [...] "Thou Shalt Not Kill", a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg's heroes, Dylan Thomas. Moloch is mentioned a few times in the Torah and references to Ginsberg's Jewish background are frequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by peyote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it {{as a symbol of the}} city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Lang's film Metropolis (1927) and of the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward. Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> including the conformist society of post–World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms.|$|E
2500|$|The carrs to {{the north}} {{remained}} flooded, although a number of channels were cut through them by the monks from Meaux Abbey. These ran in an east-west direction and were primarily to aid transport by boat, rather than for drainage, although their large size tended to have some affect on the land. A move towards a more comprehensive <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> occurred in 1532, {{with the passing of}} the Stature of Sewers. This created Commissioners of Sewers in the main areas of England and Wales which had significant areas of marshland. They had considerable powers, which were exercised through Courts of Sewers. Two such Courts were created in the Hull valley. One was based at Beverley, with separate juries for North, Middle and South Holderness and three other areas, while the second was based at Hull. They were initially only concerned with existing banks and drains, but in 1580 they organised {{the construction of a new}} drain to link Monkdike to Forthdike, providing a more southerly outlet for the water, where the level of the Hull was lower at low tide. An extensive survey of all the drains and banks was made between 1660 and 1662, with the details recorded in a book of pains, now held by the East Riding Record Office. Pains was the term used for records of the size of such structures, the intervals at which they had to be repaired or scoured, and the penalties for failing to carry out the repairs.|$|E
2500|$|The French {{had been}} able to use the {{undamaged}} railways behind their front to move troops more quickly than the Germans, who had to take long detours, wait for repairs to damaged tracks and replace rolling stock. The French IV Corps moved from Lorraine on 2 September in [...] and assembled by 6 September. The French {{had been able}} to move troops in up to [...] per day and use hundreds of motor-vehicles, which were co-ordinated by two staff officers, Commandant Gérard and Captain Doumenc. The French could also use Belgian and captured German rail wagons and the domestic telephone and telegraph systems. The initiative held by the Germans in August was not recovered and the troop movements to the right flank were piecemeal. Until the end of the Siege of Maubeuge [...] only the single line from Trier to Liège, Brussels, Valenciennes and Cambrai was available and had to be used to supply the German armies on the right as the 6th Army travelled in the opposite direction, limiting the army to forty trains a day, taking four days to move a corps. Information on German troop movements from wireless interception, enabled the French to forestall German moves but the Germans had to rely on reports from spies, which were frequently wrong. The French resorted to more cautious infantry tactics, using cover to reduce casualties and a centralised <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> as the German army commanders followed contradictory plans. The French did not need quickly to obtain a decisive result and could concentrate on conserving the French army.|$|E
