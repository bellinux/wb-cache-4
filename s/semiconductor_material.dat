40|$|The use of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>materials</b> {{for solar}} fuel {{production}} and environmental remediation has attracted increasing {{attention in the}} past decades due to their potential to address important energy and environmental problems. Ion-exchangeable <b>semiconductor</b> <b>materials</b> represent one family of promising materials due to their unique crystal structures and structure-related photocatalytic activity. However, most of the ion-exchangeable <b>semiconductor</b> <b>materials</b> can only absorb UV light due to their wide band-gap.

25|$|The <b>semiconductor</b> <b>material</b> Gallium {{arsenide}} (GaAs) is {{also used}} for single-crystalline thin film solar cells. Although GaAs cells are very expensive, they hold the world's record in efficiency for a single-junction solar cell at 28.8%.

25|$|The dye {{molecules}} {{are quite}} small (nanometer sized), {{so in order}} to capture a reasonable amount of the incoming light the layer of dye molecules needs to be made fairly thick, much thicker than the molecules themselves. To address this problem, a nanomaterial is used as a scaffold to hold large numbers of the dye molecules in a 3-D matrix, increasing the number of molecules for any given surface area of cell. In existing designs, this scaffolding is provided by the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>material,</b> which serves double-duty.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an ongoing}} effort to {{increase}} the conversion efficiency of PV cells and modules, primarily for competitive advantage. In order {{to increase the efficiency}} of solar cells, it is important to choose a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>material</b> with an appropriate band gap that matches the solar spectrum. This will enhance the electrical and optical properties. Improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency. There are several groups of materials that are being developed. Ultrahigh-efficiency devices (>30%) are made by using GaAs and GaInP2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells. High-quality, single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency, low cost cells (>20%).|$|E
25|$|A diode is a two-terminal {{electronic}} component that conducts current primarily {{in one direction}} (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. A semiconductor diode, {{the most common type}} today, is a crystalline piece of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>material</b> with a p–n junction connected to two electrical terminals. A vacuum tube diode has two electrodes, a plate (anode) and a heated cathode. Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called cat's whisker diodes, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as galena. Today, most diodes are made of silicon, but other materials such as selenium and germanium are sometimes used.|$|E

25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this <b>semiconductor</b> <b>material</b> are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E
25|$|Photons {{hitting a}} thin film of alkali metal or <b>semiconductor</b> <b>material</b> such as gallium {{arsenide}} in an image intensifier tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an electrostatic field where they strike a phosphor coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by {{increasing the number of}} electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a micro-channel plate. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the vacuum level. This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the band gap model. Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band. In these materials, electrons that move to the conduction band are all of sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such, the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.|$|E
