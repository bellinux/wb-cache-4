5|$|From {{this point}} east the freeway is routed across a flat {{area between the}} Book Cliffs and the Colorado River, called Sagers Flat. Along the way it passes by the towns of Crescent Junction, Thompson <b>Springs</b> and <b>Cisco.</b> Natural {{features}} visible from this portion include Arches National Park and Castle Valley. Other listed attractions along the byway near this section include Canyonlands National Park and various areas with Morrison Formation, a layer of rock where dinosaur remains are common. I-70, US-6, and US-50 all enter Colorado concurrently. Where I-70 follows the Book Cliffs, it was built parallel to or on top of US-6/50.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cisco</b> <b>Springs</b> {{field is}} {{currently}} operated by Running Foxes Petroleum, Inc. a Denver, Colorado-based independent company. Running Foxes owns 100% of the field. The field at present primarily produces {{oil from the}} Dakota 1 sand located along the western flank of a northwest plunging anticline that is crosscut by northeast trending faults. Gas production has temporarily ceased due to low product prices.|$|R
50|$|In 1883 the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad {{main line}} was {{constructed}} across eastern Utah. The rail line {{did not pass}} through Moab, instead passing through the towns of Thompson <b>Springs</b> and <b>Cisco,</b> 40 mi to the north. Later, other places to cross the Colorado were constructed, such as Lee's Ferry, Navajo Bridge and Boulder Dam. These changes shifted the trade routes away from Moab. Moab farmers and merchants had to adapt from trading with passing travelers to shipping their goods to distant markets. Soon Moab's origins {{as one of the}} few natural crossings of the Colorado River were forgotten. Nevertheless, the U.S. military deemed the bridge over the Colorado River at Moab important enough to place it under guard as late as World War II.|$|R
50|$|After Spanish Fork, {{the rail}} line joins the U.S. Route 6 corridor, {{and the two}} follow each other towards Denver. Both routes follow the Spanish Fork River up a grade in the Wasatch Plateau, cresting at Soldier Summit. The western {{approach}} to Soldier Summit is known for the Gilluly loops, a series of horseshoe curves that allow the railroad to crest the mountains while maintaining grade that never exceeds 2.4%, unlike the highway, which was built using an older railroad grade, that features grades in excess of 5%. The railroad descends from Soldier Summit following the Price River until reaching the town of Helper, so named because {{in the era of}} steam locomotives, the railroad added or removed helper engines here for trains crossing Soldier Summit. Upon exiting the Wasatch Mountains, the train follows the southern rim of the Book Cliffs, in route serving the towns of Woodside, Green River (where the rail line crosses the Green River), Thompson <b>Springs</b> and <b>Cisco.</b> Near Cisco is where the rail line for the first time meets the Colorado River, which provides the path up the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. The rail line follows and crosses the river numerous times in Colorado while ascending the Rockies. Ruby Canyon is where the rail line reaches the state line.|$|R

Mysis relicta {{is a major}} prey item for many fish species in Lake Superior, However, its importance to an entire fish {{community as a whole}} has not been quantified. We describe seasonal prey selection of the major fish species collected across 18 sites in Lake Superior, and again at five locations in western Lake Superior in 2006 using a selection index (Chesson's Alpha). We also used bioenergetics models to estimate the consumption of prey items by the fish community at the same locations. Additionally, we modeled the production of Mysis, to evaluate this prey resource in terms of demand and supply. We found that rainbow smelt, kiyi, and bloater selected for Mysis over other prey items during all seasons, while lake whitefish only selected for Mysis in the <b>spring</b> and summer. <b>Cisco</b> selected for large zooplankton, while all three sculpin species exhibited neutral selection of prey items. Burbot and siscowet selected for deepwater sculpin and Mysis during all seasons, with juveniles showing a stronger selection for Mysis than did adults. Mysis was the most consumed prey item lakewide, with higher annual consumption offshore than nearshore. Predation on Mysis was mainly from rainbow smelt, bloater, and lake whitefish nearshore, and deepwater sculpin and kiyi offshore. Our estimates of Mysis production (supply) were higher than the consumptive demand by the fish community at nearly all locations, with this balance indicating stability in the food web. Mysis relicta was found to be a sought after prey item by many fish species, and is directly responsible in supporting the fish communities both nearshore and offshore. Thus, Mysis plays a pivotal role in the structure and function of the Lake Superior fish community...|$|R
