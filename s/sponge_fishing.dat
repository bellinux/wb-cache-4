25|$|More than 8000 {{species of}} sea sponges live in oceanic and {{freshwater}} habitats. <b>Sponge</b> <b>fishing</b> historically {{has been an}} important and lucrative industry, with yearly catches from years 1913 to 1938 regularly exceeding 181 tonnes and generating over 1 million U.S. dollars. However, this demand for sea sponges has seen catch rates peak and in 2003 the demand for bath sponges was 2,127 tonnes, with global production from harvesting only meeting a quarter of that amount.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries (1841–1938), Greek spongers immigrated to Andros {{for the rich}} <b>sponge</b> <b>fishing</b> on the Great Bahama Bank off Andros' west coast. For a period of years, Andros {{sponging}} was the Bahamas' largest industry. In the 1930s, the sponges were wiped out by a Red Tide infestation. The sponging industry died, and the spongers left the island for Key West, and Tarpon Springs, Florida. Thousands of unemployed Bahamians moved {{to the village of}} Coconut Grove near Miami.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Civil War, this clause was one of the {{provisions}} upon which the Court relied in holding that the Confederation formed by the seceding States (the States that withdrew from membership in a federal union) could not be recognized as having any legal existence. Today, its practical significance lies in the limitations which it implies upon the power of the States to deal with matters having a bearing upon international relations. In the early case of Holmes v. Jennison, Chief Justice Taney invoked it as a reason for holding that a State had no power to deliver up a fugitive from justice to a foreign State. More recently, the kindred idea that the responsibility for the conduct of foreign relations rests exclusively with the Federal Government prompted the Court to hold that, since the oil under the three mile marginal belt along the California coast might well become the subject of international dispute and since the ocean, including this three mile belt, is of vital consequence to the nation in its desire to engage in commerce and to live in peace with the world, the Federal Government has paramount rights in and power over that belt, including full dominion over the resources of the soil under the water area. In Skiriotes v. Florida, the Court, on the other hand, ruled that this clause did not disable Florida from regulating the manner in which its own citizens may engage in <b>sponge</b> <b>fishing</b> outside its territorial waters. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Hughes declared: “When its action does not conflict with federal legislation, the sovereign authority of the State over the conduct of its citizens upon the high seas is analogous to the sovereign authority of the United States over its citizens in like circumstances.” ...|$|E

50|$|Coral reefs have intense biodiversity-rich {{ecosystems}} {{which provides}} habitat {{for millions of}} aquatic species such as <b>sponges,</b> star <b>fish,</b> jellyfish, sea turtles, etc. Unfortunately, reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to chemical, temperature, and population changes. There has been an increasing disappearance of large predators such as barracuda, Nassau groupers, and sharks This makes the reefs more vulnerable to invasion by non-native species.|$|R
50|$|The Port of Latakia (Arabic: ميناء اللاذقية) is {{the main}} seaport in Syria.Latakia has an {{extensive}} agricultural hinterland. Exports include bitumen (asphalt), cereals, cotton, fruits, eggs, vegetable oil, pottery, and tobacco.

50|$|The lower Jebel el-Akabah lies to {{the south}} and east of the Jebel Akhdar. The two {{highlands}} are separated by a depression. This eastern region, known in ancient times as Marmarica, is much drier than the Jebel Akhdar and here the Sahara extends to the coast. Historically, salt-collecting and <b>sponge</b> <b>fishing</b> were more important than agriculture. Bomba and Tobruk have good harbors.|$|E

40|$|The Research on ???Coral Coverage in Baranglompo Island and Bone Batang Island Based on Reef Check Method??? was {{conducted}} in April 2016. The aims {{of this study was}} to determine and to compare the condition of reefs in Baranglompo and Bone Batang Islands based on the percentage of life coral cover by using Reef Check methods. This study also aims to determine which factors that most affect the percentage of coral cover on each island i. e: abiotic factors (temperature, salinity and substrate in the form of rock, rubble, sand, silt/clay); biotic factors (soft coral, recent killed coral, algae, <b>sponges,</b> <b>fish</b> and invertebrates associate) and anthropogenic factors (garbage, ilegal fishing/bombs, stun, anchors, nets) were also investigated. Percentage of life coral cover obtained by Line Intercept Transect (LIT) along 100 meters at a depth of 3 meters and 10 meters. The results showed that the condition of coral reefs in Baranglompo was classified as moderate with an average percentage coral coverage of 42...|$|R

25|$|The {{ability to}} make and use tools was once {{considered}} a defining characteristic of the genus Homo. However, the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded {{the notion of the}} use of technology as unique to humans. For example, researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging: some of the tools used include leaf <b>sponges,</b> termite <b>fishing</b> probes, pestles and levers. West African chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts, as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista, Brazil.|$|R
50|$|The Bahamian Rhyming Spiritual is a {{religious}} genre of music found in the Bahamas, and also the songs, usually spirituals, and vocal-style within that genre. Rhyming does not refer to rhyme but to verse, the rhymer, or lead-singer, singing the couplets of the verses against the sung background of the repeated chorus. Rhyming was most popular during the <b>sponge</b> <b>fishing</b> of the 1930s (the sponges having been killed by a fungus), and Peter Elliot is considered the best rhymer.|$|E

50|$|In Kalymnos, only 18% of {{the steep}} {{volcanic}} land could be cultivated, so the main occupations were trading, boat building and <b>sponge</b> <b>fishing,</b> which perhaps {{was the oldest}} occupation on the island. Diving for sponges brought social and economical development to the island: the free-diving method was used. Kalymnos was the main centre of production in the Aegean, and is still a traditional albeit less common occupation of the Greeks on the Island with related exhibitions, along with other local folklore, and three museums about the occupation.|$|E

50|$|Throckmorton {{came to know}} Captain Kemal of the Mandlinci, a <b>sponge</b> <b>fishing</b> boat. The captain told Throckmorton that he knew of many ancients {{sites that}} were lying on the seabed, one of which he planned to {{dynamite}} the following year. Throckmorton urged him to preserve the site and convinced the Captain to draw a map, allegedly {{on the back of}} a napkin. He would return in 1958 under the flag of the Explorers' Club, with filmmaker Stan Waterman among others. They set out to visit a number of underwater archaeological sites and finally arrived at Cape Gelidonya, where they spent most of their time trying to identify the site. Finally, on the last day, they located the site on one of the small islands off the Cape.|$|E
50|$|Explorations of the Kodiak - Bowie Seamount chain {{have shown}} that {{despite the fact that}} most of the seamounts were created by the Bowie hotspot, all are unique in their size, shape, and {{volcanic}} features. The seamounts teem with deep-sea corals, <b>sponges,</b> and <b>fish.</b> Recent expeditions to these seamounts using manned submersibles and ROVs have discovered many marine species and have greatly expanded the knowledge of the range of deep sea corals in this region. For example, the Bowie Seamount is a biologically rich area with a dynamic and productive ecosystem. Because of this unique biological rich area, Bowie Seamount was declared a Pilot Marine Protected Area on December 8, 1998.|$|R
