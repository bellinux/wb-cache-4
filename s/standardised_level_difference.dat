40|$|BACKGROUND: Newly {{diagnosed}} {{patients with}} cancer require education about the disease, the available treatments and potential consequences of treatment. Greater understanding of cancer risk {{has been found}} to be associated with greater health-related quality of life, improved psychological adjustment and greater health-related behaviours. The aim of this sytematic review was to assess the effectiveness of educational interventions in improving subjective cancer risk perception and to appraise the quality of the studies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies. Eligible studies were identified via Medline, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL and Embase databases. After screening titles and abstracts, two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of 206 full-text articles. RESULTS: Forty papers were included in the review; the majority of studies were conducted among breast cancer patients (n[*]=[*] 29) and evaluated the effect of genetic counselling on personal perceived risk (n[*]=[*] 25). Pooled results from RCTs (n[*]=[*] 12) showed that, both in the short and long term, educational interventions did not significantly influence risk perception <b>level</b> (<b>standardised</b> mean <b>difference</b> 0. 05, 95...|$|R

The center frequencies were 750, 1500, and 3000 Hz and noise bandwidths from 5 to 1620 Hz were used. The level of the reference pure tone was 30, 50, or 70 dB. For all center frequencies and reference levels, the level at equal loudness was close to 0 dB for the narrowest bandwidth, increased with bandwidth for bandwidths smaller than the critical bandwidth, and decreased for bandwidths larger than the critical bandwidth. For bandwidths considerably larger than the critical bandwidth, the <b>level</b> <b>difference</b> was negative.

Statins influence haemostatic factors, but {{their effect on}} plasma D-dimer levels is controversial. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between statin therapy and plasma D-dimer levels. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus and EMBASE (up to September 25, 2014) to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of statin therapy on plasma D-dimer levels. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods and outcomes. Meta-analysis of data from nine RCTs with 1, 165 participants showed a significant effect of statin therapy in reducing plasma D-dimer <b>levels</b> (<b>standardised</b> mean <b>difference</b> [SMD]: - 0. 988 µg/ml, 95 [*]% confidence interval [CI]: - 1. 590 - - 0. 385, p= 0. 001). The effect size was robust in sensitivity analysis and omission of no single study significantly changed the overall estimated effect size. In the subgroup analysis, the effect of statins on plasma D-dimer levels was significant only in the subsets of studies with treatment duration ≥[*] 12 weeks (SMD: - 0. 761 µg/ml, 95 [*]%CI: - 1. 163 - - 0. 360; p <[*] 0. 001), and for lipophilic statins (atorvastatin and simvastatin) (SMD: - 1. 364 µg/ml, 95 [*]% CI: - 2. 202 - - 0. 526; p= 0. 001). Hydrophilic statins (pravastatin and rosuvastatin) did not significantly reduce plasma D-dimer levels (SMD: - 0. 237 µg/ml, 95 [*]%CI: - 1. 140 - 0. 665, p= 0. 606). This meta-analysis of RCTs suggests a decrease of plasma D-dimer levels after three months of statin therapy, and especially after treatment with lipophilic statins.
