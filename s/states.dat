5|$|Differences {{of opinion}} over social order between {{northern}} and southern <b>states</b> in early United <b>States</b> society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, <b>states</b> entering the Union alternated between slave and free <b>states,</b> keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free <b>states</b> outstripped slave <b>states</b> in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil <b>states,</b> tensions between slave and free <b>states</b> mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E
