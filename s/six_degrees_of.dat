5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters {{in that it}} allows the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We are {{developing}} an autonomous mobile robotic system to emulate <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom relative spacecraft motion during proximity operations. A mobile omni-directional base robot provides x, y, and yaw planar motion with moderate accuracy through six independently driven motors. With a <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom micro-positioning Stewart platform {{on top of}} the moving base, <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom spacecraft motion can be emulated with high accuracy. This paper presents our approach to dynamic modeling, control, and simulation for the overall system. Compared with other simulations that introduced significant simplifications, we believe that our rigorous modeling approach is crucial for the high fidelity hardware in-the-loop emulation.

40|$|AbstractThe goal is {{to control}} the {{trajectory}} of the flight path <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom flying body model using fractional PID. The design of fractional PID controller for the <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom flying body is described.

In the optimization process, various objective functions were considered and investigated to reflect both improved dynamics of the missile system and reduced chattering in the control signal of the controller...|$|R
5|$|Unlike in {{standard}} first-person shooters, the player must control a flying ship {{that has a}} <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom movement scheme, allowing the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. In addition to a single-player campaign mode, Descent 3 features an online multiplayer mode where numerous players can compete {{against each other in}} eight different game types. The game features both indoor and outdoor environments, made possible {{with the use of a}} hybrid engine that combines the capabilities of a portal rendering engine with those of a flight simulator-like terrain engine.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles {{made it impossible for}} riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E

40|$|An amended <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom {{helicopter}} {{stability and}} control derivative model {{was developed in}} which body acceleration and control rate derivatives {{were included in the}} Taylor series expansion. These additional derivatives were derived from consideration {{of the effects of the}} higher order rotor flapping dynamics, which are known to be inadequately represented in the conventional <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom, quasistatic stability derivative model. The amended model was a substantial improvement over the conventional model, effectively doubling the unsable bandwidth and providing a more accurate representation of the short period and cross axis characteristics. Further investigations assessed the applicability of the two stability derivative model structures for flight test parameter identification. Parameters were identified using simulation data generated from a higher order base line model having sixth order rotor tip path plane dynamics. Three lower order models were identified: one using the conventional stability derivative model structure, a second using the amended <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom model structure, and a third model having eight <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom that included a simplified rotor tip path plane tilt representation...|$|R

40|$|A {{specialised}} {{hybrid controller}} is {{applied for the}} control of motorised space tether spin-up coupled with an axial oscillation phenomenon. A <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom dynamic model of a motorised momentum exchange tether is {{used as the basis}} for interplanetary payload exchange in the context of control. The tether comprises a symmetrical double payload configuration, with an outrigger counter inertia and massive central facility. It is shown that including axial elasticity permits an enhanced level of performance prediction accuracy and a useful departure from the usual rigid body representations, particularly for accurate payload positioning at strategic points. A simulation with a given initial condition data has been devised in a connecting programme between control code written in MATLAB and dynamics simulation code constructed within MATHEMATICA. It is shown that there is an enhanced level of spin-up control for the <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom motorised momentum exchange tether system using the specialised hybrid controller...|$|R
40|$|A force {{reflecting}} hand controller {{based upon}} a <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom fully parallel mechanism, often termed a Stewart Platform, has been designed, constructed, and tested as an integrated system with a slave robot manipulator test bed. A force reflecting hand controller comprises a kinesthetic device capable of transmitting position and orientation commands to a slave robot manipulator while simultaneously representing the environmental interaction forces of the slave manipulator back to the operator through actuators driving the hand controller mechanism. The Stewart Platform was chosen as a novel approach to improve force reflecting teleoperation because of its inherently high ratio of load generation capability to system mass content and the correspondingly high dynamic bandwidth. An additional novelty {{of the program was}} to implement closed loop force and torque control about the hand controller mechanism by equipping the handgrip with a <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom force and torque measuring cell. The mechanical, electrical, computer, and control systems are discussed and system tests are presented...|$|R
