50|$|To {{strike the}} balance between the {{acceptable}} identification power, time and cost for the <b>strain</b> <b>typing,</b> about seven to eight house-keeping genes are commonly used in the laboratories. Quoting Staphylococcus aureus as an example, seven housekeeping genes are used in MLST typing. These genes include carbamate kinase (arcC), shikimate dehydrogenase (aroE), glycerol kinase (glpF), guanylate kinase (gmk), phosphate acetyltransferase (pta), triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) and acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase (yqiL) as specified by the MLST website. However, {{it is not uncommon}} for up to ten housekeeping genes to be used. For Vibrio vulnificus, the housekeeping genes used are glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (glp), DNA gyrase, subunit B (gyrB), malate-lactate dehydrogenase (mdh), methionyl-tRNA synthetase (metG), phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase (purM), threonine dehyrogenase (dtdS), diaminopimelate decarboxylase (lysA), transhydrogenase alpha subunit (pntA), dihydroorotase (pyrC) and tryptophanase (tnaA). Thus both the number and type of housekeeping genes interrogated by MLST may differ from species to species.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:  Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) by Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{is considered}} a serious global threat. METHODS:  In this nationwide study, we used MassARRAY iPLEX genotyping technology to examine the epidemiology of N. gonorrhoeae and associated AMR in the Australian population. All available N. gonorrhoeae isolates (n = 2452) received from Australian reference laboratories from January to June 2012 {{were included in the}} study. Genotypic data were combined with phenotypic AMR information to define <b>strain</b> <b>types.</b> RESULTS:  A total of 270 distinct <b>strain</b> <b>types</b> were observed. The 40 most common <b>strain</b> <b>types</b> accounted for over 80 % of isolates, and the 10 most common <b>strain</b> <b>types</b> accounted for almost half of all isolates. The high male to female ratios (> 94 % male) suggested that at least 22 of the top 40 <b>strain</b> <b>types</b> were primarily circulating within networks of {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM). Particular <b>strain</b> <b>types</b> were also concentrated among females: two <b>strain</b> <b>types</b> accounted for 37. 5 % of all isolates from females. Isolates harbouring the mosaic penicillin binding protein 2 (PBP 2) -considered a key mechanism for cephalosporin resistance-comprised 8. 9 % of all N. gonorrhoeae isolates and were primarily observed in males (95 %). CONCLUSIONS:  This large scale epidemiological investigation demonstrated that N. gonorrhoeae infections are dominated by relatively few <b>strain</b> <b>types.</b> The commonest <b>strain</b> <b>types</b> were concentrated in MSM in urban areas and Indigenous heterosexuals in remote areas, and we were able to confirm a resurgent epidemic in heterosexual networks in urban areas. The prevalence of mosaic PBP 2 harboring N. gonorrhoeae strains highlight the ability for new N. gonorrhoeae strains to spread and become established across populations...|$|R

The RAPD typing method was found to be reproducible and discriminatory, more sensitive than PCR ribotyping, and able to group epidemiologically related B. cepacia <b>strains</b> previously <b>typed</b> by both pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and conventional ribotyping.

50|$|For each {{of these}} {{housekeeping}} genes, the different sequences are assigned as alleles and the alleles at the loci provide an allelic profile. A series of profiles can then be the identification marker for <b>strain</b> <b>typing.</b> Sequences that differ at even a single nucleotide are assigned as different alleles and no weighting is given {{to take into account}} the number of nucleotide differences between alleles, as we cannot distinguish whether differences at multiple nucleotide sites are a result of multiple point mutations or a single recombinational exchange. The large number of potential alleles at each of the loci provides the ability to distinguish billions of different allelic profiles, and a strain with the most common allele at each locus would only be expected to occur by chance approximately once in 10,000 isolates. Despite MLST providing high discriminatory power, the accumulation of nucleotide changes in housekeeping genes is a relatively slow process and the allelic profile of a bacterial isolate is sufficiently stable over time for the method to be ideal for global epidemiology.|$|E

The disease is endemic {{in many parts of}} the world and responsible for considerable losses to the livestock and associated industries. Diagnosis and control are problematic, due mostly to the long incubation period of the disease when infected animals show no clinical signs and are difficult to detect, and the ability of the organism to survive and persist in the environment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{national}} tuberculosis <b>strain</b> <b>typing</b> service (TB-STS) {{was introduced}} in England in 2010. The TB-STS involves MIRU-VNTR typing of isolates from all TB patients for the prospective identification, reporting and investigation of TB <b>strain</b> <b>typing</b> clusters. As part of a mixed-method evaluation, we report on a repeated cross-sectional survey to illustrate the challenges surrounding the evaluation of a complex national public health intervention. METHODS: An online initial and follow-up questionnaire survey assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practices of public health staff, physicians and nurses working in TB control in November 2010 and March 2012. It included questions on the implementation, experience and uptake of the TB-STS. Participants that responded to both surveys {{were included in the}} analysis. RESULTS: 248 participants responded to the initial survey and 137 of these responded to the follow-up survey (56 % retention). Knowledge: A significant increase in knowledge was observed, including a rise in the proportion of respondents who had received training (28. 6 % to 67. 9 %, p = 0. 003), and the self-rated knowledge of how to use <b>strain</b> <b>typing</b> had improved ('no knowledge' decreased from 43. 2 % to 27. 4 %). Attitudes: The majority of respondents found <b>strain</b> <b>typing</b> useful; the proportion that reported <b>strain</b> <b>typing</b> to be useful was similar across the two surveys (95. 7 % to 94. 7 %, p = 0. 67). Practices: There were significant increases between the initial and follow-up surveys in the number of respondents who reported using <b>strain</b> <b>typing</b> (57. 0 % to 80. 5 %, p < 0. 001) and the proportion of time health protection staff spent on investigating TB (2. 74 % to 7. 08 %, p = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of a complex public health intervention is challenging. In this example, the immediate national roll-out of the TB-STS meant that a controlled survey design was not possible. This study informs the future development of the TB-STS by identifying the need for training to reach wider professional groups, and argues for its continuation based on service users' perception that it is useful.

The objective {{of this paper was}} to perform pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on field isolates of B. ovis to determine whether strain variations exist, whether sheep and deer are affected by the same strains, and to compare the performance of the rare-cutting restriction enzymes XbaI and SwaI. Ten B. ovis isolates from sheep and two from deer in New Zealand, as well as the <b>type</b> <b>strain,</b> were subjected to PFGE analysis using both XbaI and SwaI. PFGE of XbaI restriction fragments produced two banding patterns consisting of 27 - 28 bands, which were found to be 98 % similar by cluster analysis, and were named X 1 and X 1 a. PFGE of SwaI restriction fragments resulted in three banding patterns consisting of 13 - 15 bands each. Ten of the isolates had identical banding patterns and were named S 1. One isolate differed by one band, representing a subtype named S 1 a. Two isolates differed by six bands, representing a different <b>strain</b> <b>type</b> of B. ovis and this was named S 2. Cluster analysis showed S 2 to be 78 % similar to the S 1 /S 1 a cluster. Both <b>strain</b> <b>types</b> were isolated from both sheep and deer.

Results: Semi-structured interviews explored user experience. <b>Strain</b> <b>typing</b> identified 17 additional false positive diagnoses.

Mathematical modelling suggested increasing the proportion of infections detected would have little value in reducing TB incidence in the white UK-born population. However, in the non-white UK-born and non-UK-born populations, over 20 ?years, if detection of latent infection increases from 3 % to 13 % per year, then TB incidence would decrease by 11 %; reducing diagnostic delay by one?week could lead to 25 % reduction in incidence.

The current TB-STS was not predicted to be cost-effective over 20  years (£ 95   628 /quality-adjusted life-years). Interviews found people had mixed experiences, but identified broader benefits, of the TB-STS. To reduce costs, improve efficiency and increase effectiveness, we recommend changes to the TB-STS, including discontinuing routine cluster investigations and focusing on reducing diagnostic delay across the TB programme.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the relationship between}} <b>strain</b> <b>type,</b> clinical factors, and outcome in 128 patients with Clostridium dif-ficile infection. <b>Strain</b> <b>type</b> {{was not associated with}} any out-come measure. On multivariate analysis, ischemic heart dis-ease and hypoalbuminemia predicted death. Metronidazole treatment in severe disease was associated with a higher rate of treatment failure and death. The severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) appears to have increased as new strains—in particular, restriction en-donuclease (REA) type BI/ribotype 027 (North American pulse-field type 1) —have emerged [1, 2]. However, much of the evi-dence that BI/ 027 strains are more virulent comes from set-tings where BI/ 027 strains have emerged rapidly. Recent reports from settings where BI/ 027 strains are endemic have failed to demonstrate an association with severe disease, but the mor-tality rates in these studies were relatively low [3, 4]. We con-ducted a prospective cohort study of CDI cases to establish the relative importance of CDI <b>strain</b> <b>type,</b> compared with clinical and management factors, in CDI outcome. Methods.
