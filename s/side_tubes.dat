5000|$|IRBs {{are made}} of rubber and consist of four {{inflatable}} tubes - two <b>side</b> <b>tubes,</b> a bow tube and a keelson tube. This specific feature coupled with the obvious {{fact that they are}} used in the water, has coined the term [...] "rubber duck" [...] or simply [...] "duck" [...] to describe an IRB. Typically the rubber is coloured a shade of red termed 'Rescue Red' although a particular make of craft manufactured by Arancia come in a shade of orange.They have a rigid floor piece and a rigid transom for fitting an outboard motor (usually 25 hp).This motor is capable of providing a maximum drive speed of between 25-30 knots on flat water. 2-Stroke fuel is stored in a flexible fuel bladder and is secured by 4 clips to the floor in the bow. An IRB is crewed by two people - an IRB Operator/Driver and an IRB Crewman. The Operator sits on {{the lower half of the}} port side pontoon where he operates the outboard motor to control the boat. He has a single foot strap to help him stay in the boat. His left hand can hold on to a strap on the port side pontoon and his right hand operates the outboard motor by means of a tiller arm and throttle. The Crewman sits on the upper half of the starboard side pontoon. A handle is attached by a rope to the nose of the boat for him to hold with his left hand, while his right hand may hold a strap attached to the starboard pontoon. He balances the boat and allows it to go over large waves before they break without flipping. He also assists when going through a breaking wave, commonly referred to as [...] "punching-through". As of 2011 only one foot strap is available for a crew member.|$|E

40|$|A new three-tube pressure-probe is {{developed}} for measurement of flow direction, and dynamic and total pressure in two-dimensional separated flows. Unlike all earlier probes, it is asymmetric. The arrangement of <b>side</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{which is responsible}} for the asymmetry, allows it to be used in thin shear layers and close to wall, where earlier probes tended to be inaccurate. A pitching apparatus is designed to align the probe in the flow direction. Measurements with the new probe are compared with classical pitot tube measurements and well-known emperical laws in zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary-layer and fully developed pipe flow. The comparison shows that the new probe can be effectively used, with uniform flow calibration, in a shear flow outside a region of about two probe-tube diameter thickness from a wall. The capability of the new probe in surveying complex flow fields is demonstrated by measurements in wall-jet induced separation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the validation process for thermal hydraulic system codes and it presents in more detail the assessment and validation of the French code CATHARE for VVER calculations. Three assessment cases are presented: loop seal clearing, core reflooding and flow in a horizontal steam generator. The experience gained during these assessment and validation calculations has been used to analyze the behavior of the horizontal steam generator and the natural circulation in the geometry of the Loviisa nuclear power plant. The cases presented are not exhaustive, but they give a good overview of the work performed by the personnel of Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT). Large part of the work has been performed in co-operation with the CATHARE-team in Grenoble, France. The design of a Russian type pressurized water reactor, VVER, differs from that of a Western-type PWR. Most of thermal-hydraulic system codes are validated only for the Western-type PWRs. Thus, the codes should be assessed and validated also for VVER design in order to establish any weaknesses in the models. This information is needed before codes can be used for the safety analysis. Theresults of the assessment and validation calculations presented here show that the CATHARE code can be used also for the thermal-hydraulic safety studies for VVER type plants. However, some areas have been indicated which need to be reassessed after further experimental data become available. These areas are mostly connected to the horizontal stem generators, like condensation and phase separation in primary <b>side</b> <b>tubes.</b> The work presented in this thesis covers a large numberof the phenomena included in the CSNI code validation matrices for small and intermediate leaks and for transients. Also some of the phenomena included in the matrix for large break LOCAs are covered. The matrices for code validation for VVER applications should be used when future experimental programs are planned for code validation...|$|E
40|$|Freeze {{pre-concentration}} system, FPCS, {{with low}} lift reversible heat pump {{is designed for}} selective freezing of water from sugarcane juice. Â Two identical vented double wall tube-and-tube heat exchangers are used, to freeze water in the evaporator and melt ice in the condenser, alternately. Â They are sized based on cooling capacity offered by compressor, ice growth rate and velocity of juice inside the tube to reduce inclusion. Â Low lift heat pump is designed to operate at - 8 oC evaporator and 3 oC condenser saturation temperatures. Â Since, the condenser duty is higher than evaporator duty excess heat duty, {{in the form of}} superheat is utilized to heat pre-concentrated juice. Â Raw juice is precooled in a three stream Tube-and-Tube Heat Exchanger, TT_HE. Â Raw juice is precooled using cool concentrated juice and separated water. Â Freeze pre-concentration of sugarcane juice from 20 Â°Brix to 40 Â°Brix using a low lift reversible heat pump saves bagasse during initial 63 % water removal. Â Water is removed through the freezing process requires 335 kJ/kg heat removal, which is equivalent to 15 % of heat addition during evaporation at atmospheric pressure in open pan in jaggery making. Â Investigations on selection of refrigerant R 744, R 290 and R 22 for FPCS are presented. Â R 290 is identified as preferred refrigerant. Â It is natural refrigerant, no ODP and significantly lower operating pressures compared to R 744. Â R 290 charge of 360 g for 1. 5 TR compressor based system is managed by using small diameter refrigerant <b>side</b> <b>tubes.</b> Â It address safety related issues for modular small capacity systems. Â Superheat temperature of compressed refrigerant is 9 oC for R 290. Â It allows to size the identical LHEs with R 290 as a refrigerant. Â Flashing of refrigerant in evaporator is 7 % for R 290 and 10 % R 744. Â Generally, R 744 is preferred when high temperature heating is required. Â But, high superheat at compressor outlet and increased flashing at evaporator inlet reduces the performance of R 744 system making it less preferred as compared to R 290 and R 22. Â Theoretical cycle COPc calculated for R 290 based reversible heat pump works out to be 20, with compressor isentropic efficiency of 70 %. Â Overall system COPc is in the range of 10 to 13 after accounting for losses like cycling of thermal mass, heat gain from ambient, variation in freezing point depression and ice layer thickness. Â System Carnot efficiency is in the range of 41 to 54 %. Â Power required for 1. 5 TR FPCS is 0. 4 to 0. 6 kWe. Â Different juice side tube diameters are considered to find the optimal size, after accounting for effect of thermal mass of heat exchanger, heat pump switching time and inclusion on the energy consumption per unit water separated. Â Achievable energy consumption is in the range of 9 to 12 kWhe/m 3 of water separated...|$|E
