50|$|Transmission of a byte is {{accomplished}} by dividing it into two nibbles of four bits each. Each nibble is transmitted by setting the four data lines according to the four nibble bits and then toggling the acknowledge line. This toggle indicates the receiving host that the nibble {{is ready to be}} read. Once the receiving host has read the nibble, it toggles its <b>synchronization</b> <b>line</b> to tell the transmitter that the nibble has been read and that a new one may be sent. Both hosts use a toggle on their acknowledge lines to indicate that the read or write operation has been performed. As a result, each host has to wait for a toggle from the other host before proceeding with a new operation.|$|E

Each line of a field has 50.3 μs of video area {{that can be used for}} transmission, which results in 288 bits per line, or 36 bytes. Three bytes are used for {{hardware}} synchronization, another three for the packet address, two for sequencing information, and 28 for data and redundant forward error correction (FEC) information. In theory, the system can encode 262 lines of data per field, but in practice the data is instead [...] "hidden" [...] in lines that will not appear on a conventional television. Lines 1-9 are used for vertical <b>synchronization,</b> <b>line</b> 21 is used for Closed Captioning, and everything after 22 is the television picture. That leaves 10 lines, lines 10 to 20, that are useful for sending data. At 60 fields per second, those 10 lines at 288 bits each encode a total of 172,800 bit/s, although 20% of that is needed for signaling purposes, so rates of 115,200 for end-user data are more typical. Applications requiring less throughput can simply use fewer lines.|$|E

Drilled shaft foundation elements provide a cost-effective foundation alternative for the support of building and bridge superstructure loads. Bi-directional pile loading tests (BDPLTs) to evaluate the capacity of drilled shafts have become popular owing to their capacity to save time and effort as compared to the use of top-down loading tests. However, the use of BDPLTs requires that production shafts be post-grouted following testing in order to assure appropriate in-service performance. Commonly used single-acting loading cells and/or loading cell construction details can pose the potential for the development of voids following post-grouting due to their monotonic jacking action and large footprint. This paper described the development and use of high pressure bi-directional loading cells intended to minimize the possibility of post-test construction defects. First, a comparison was made between the single-acting and double-acting loading cells. Second, the results of laboratory calibrations on the pressurized loading cells were performed, as were component testing of the pumps, hoses, and hydraulic fluid <b>synchronization</b> <b>lines.</b> Then, the use of the new high pressure double-acting loading cells in production testing of instrumented shafts was described, and the efficacy of the new loading cells was illustrated. The new loading cells provided the profession with a load cell alternative for conducting BDLTs and should serve to help reduce the risk of post-test grouting defects in drilled shaft foundations...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in designing parallel programs that achieve a desired performance goal {{is the ability}} to exactly analyze program performance, given a specification of the process synchronization structure and the execution timings of all code segments. This paper presents a novel performance analysis method based on geometry. Given a definition of program state, an execution of a program can be represented by a timed execution sequence (TES). A TES is a sequence of states that the program passes through in an execution, along with the duration of time spent in each state. In some parallel programs, all TESs that can arise in any execution contain a suffix that consists of the repetition of a finite sequence of states, excluding deadlocks and nondeterministic behavior. The repeated sequence is termed the limit cycle execution sequence. This paper derives, for all possible process starting times, a representation of the set of all possible limit cycle execution sequences in which a process blocks. The paper makes two contributions. First, it employs a novel analysis method to derive TESs from a geometric program execution model, using timed progress graphs (TPGs). TPGs represent the progress of each process by an axis in a Cartesian graph; process <b>synchronization</b> by <b>line</b> segments; and a TES by a direct, continuous path that does not cross a segment.

30|$|The {{electromagnetic}} leakage {{emission reduction}} {{image is a}} periodic image that is actually {{a period of time}} because it is a static image. As a periodic repeat image, the general signal is relatively stable and the correlation is better. Additive noise is generally randomly changed, and the multi-frame averaging method can effectively improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Although the noise in a single frame is more serious, statistically speaking, the distribution of signals is regular, and the noise of each image can be considered to be randomly and evenly distributed. Therefore, the cumulative average of multiple images can suppress the noise, to enhance the signal. After the m images are accumulated and averaged, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by √(m). However, it is not like the more the number of images is accumulated, the better the results will be. This is because the imaging device cannot accurately capture the <b>line</b> <b>synchronization</b> and frame synchronization of the image to be received, so the images are offset between different frames. If the accumulated number of frames is too large, the average image may produce a relatively large edge blur that affects the resolution of the image detail [18].|$|R
