In July 2008, the 8th MP Brigade began its move into Iraq with a pre-deployment <b>site</b> <b>survey</b> to support the upcoming deployment into the country. The brigade headquarters was set to replace the 18th Military Police Brigade, which ended its deployment in fall of 2008.

Historian Janos de Szecsy began excavations at the ruins in January 1956. The remains of the city were excavated by Swiss-Guatemalan archaeologist George (Jorge) Guillemín from 1959-1972. Guillemín published his work in 1959, 1967 and 1969. The excavation and restoration of the ruins was funded by the Guatemalan Committee for Reconstruction of National Monuments until July 1961, after 1963 the investigations were funded by the Swiss National Foundation for Scientific Research. Guillemín died before his investigations could be completed and his full report published. His field notes were finally published in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|The 1–206th FA {{received}} an alert for mobilization {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom on 28 July 2003. The 1–206th was inducted into federal service 12 October 2003, at home stations. The battalion learned {{that it would be}} deployed {{along with the rest of}} the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States), as an element of the 1st Cavalry Division (United States). At this time the 1st Battalion adopted the nickname [...] "Aleutian" [...] as the unit's fixed call sign. The unit underwent training at Fort Hood, Texas for three months of intensive training in Force Protection, Convoy Security, Route Clearance and Urban Operations. The 1–206th FA became the first Army unit to field and conduct artillery live fire exercises with the new ANGYK-57 Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). Each battery conducted two days of artillery live fire training during post mobilization training. At this time the 1–206th FA received the attachment of Battery A, 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery, Rhode Island National Guard. The 1–206th FA had arrived at mobilization station approximately 80 soldiers short of its required strength, most vacancies being in the Fire Support Teams. The National Guard Bureau supplied this shortage by activating A/1-103rd and attaching it to 1–206th for deployment. A/1-103rd FA quickly became known as the [...] "Rhody" [...] Battery. While the 1–206th was at Fort Hood, the battalion commander, battalion operations officer, and three battery commanders accompanied the brigade staff and other battalion commanders and staff on a Pre-Deployment <b>Site</b> <b>Survey</b> (PDSS) to Iraq. The commanders spent 10 days traveling to the Baghdad Area of Operations, being hosted by the 16th Engineer Battalion, 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division. In late January 2004 the 1–206th FA moved to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana for a Mission Rehearsal Exercise to validate the brigade training for the deployment. While at Fort Polk the 39th Brigade staff was informed by the 1st Cavalry Division that due to a scheduling gap and the need to assume responsibility of the base defense operations center at Camp Taji, Iraq, the brigade would have to deploy one battalion approximately three weeks ahead of the rest of the brigade. The 39th Brigade selected the 1–206th to assume this mission and the battalion was prioritized on the brigade's movement plan. The advance party of the 1–206th FA departed Fort Polk on 28 February 2004. Due to a mechanical breakdown en route the advanced party arrived in Kuwait on 8 March 2004. By this time the 1–206th had been officially designated as the division main effort, with orders to conduct pre-combat checks and rehearsals and move to Camp Taji, Iraq via ground convoy as quickly as possible.|$|E
