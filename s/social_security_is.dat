5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitutionality}} of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> intricately {{linked to the}} evolving nature of Supreme Court jurisprudence on federal power (the 20th century saw {{a dramatic increase in}} allowed congressional action). When Social Security was first passed, there were significant questions over its constitutionality as the Court had found another pension scheme, the original Railroad Retirement Act, to violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Some, such as University of Chicago law professor Richard Epstein and Harvard University professor Robert Nozick, have argued that Social Security should be unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|The Social Security Administration's {{authority}} to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, i.e., redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities. Therefore, Social Security's ability to make full payments once annual benefits exceed revenues depends {{in part on the}} federal government's ability to make good on the bonds that it has issued to the Social Security trust funds. As with any other federal obligation, the federal government's ability to repay <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> based on its power to tax and borrow and the commitment of Congress to meet its obligations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the book}} How Social Security Picks Your Pocket other factors {{affecting}} Social Security net benefits are identified: Generally, {{people who work}} for more than 35 years get a lower net benefit – all other factors being equal. People who do not live long after retirement age get a much lower net benefit. Finally, people who derive a high percentage of income from non-wage sources get high Social Security net benefits because they appear to be poor, when they are not. The progressive benefit formula for <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> blind to the income a worker may have from non-wage sources, such as spousal support, dividends and interest, or rental income.|$|E
25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> funded {{primarily}} through payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). Tax deposits are {{collected by the}} Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are formally entrusted to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, the two Social Security Trust Funds. With a few exceptions, all salaried income, up to an amount specifically determined by law (see tax rate table below), {{is subject to the}} Social Security payroll tax. All income over said amount is not taxed. In 2017, the maximum amount of taxable earnings was $127,200.|$|E

25|$|Actuarial science, of {{the kind}} used to project the future {{solvency}} of <b>social</b> <b>security,</b> <b>is</b> by nature subject to uncertainty. The SSA actually makes three predictions: optimistic, midline, and pessimistic (until the late 1980s it made 4 projections). The Social Security crisis that was developing prior to the 1983 reforms resulted from midline projections {{that turned out to}} be too optimistic. It has been argued that the overly pessimistic projections of the mid to late 1990s were partly the result of the low economic growth (according to actuary David Langer) assumptions that resulted in pushing back the projected exhaustion date (from 2028 to 2042) with each successive Trustee's report. During the heavy-boom years of the 1990s, the midline projections were too pessimistic. Obviously, projecting out 75 years is a significant challenge and, as such, the actual situation might be much better or much worse than predicted.|$|E

2500|$|Bush {{has called}} for major changes in Social Security, {{identifying}} the system's projected insolvency as a priority early in his second term. From January through April 2005, he toured the country, stopping in over 50 cities across the nation warning of an impending [...] "crisis". Initially, President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest {{a portion of their}} Social Security Tax (FICA) into secured investments. The main advantage of personal accounts within <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> to allow workers to own the money they place into retirement that cannot be taken away by political whims.|$|E
2500|$|Political realities {{make major}} {{budgetary}} deals difficult to achieve. While Republicans argue conceptually for reductions in Medicare and Social Security, they {{are hesitant to}} actually vote to reduce the benefits from these popular programs. Democrats {{on the other hand}} argue conceptually for tax increases on the wealthy, yet may be hesitant to vote for them because of the effect on campaign donations from the wealthy. The so-called budgetary [...] "grand bargain" [...] of tax hikes on the rich and removal of some popular tax deductions in exchange for reductions to Medicare and <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> therefore elusive.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{compared to}} private pensions, {{the two systems}} are different {{in a number of}} respects. It has been argued that <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> an insurance plan as opposed to a retirement plan. Unlike a pension, for example, Social Security pays disability benefits. A private pension fund accumulates the money paid into it, eventually using those reserves to pay pensions to the workers who contributed to the fund; and a private system is not universal. Social Security cannot [...] "prefund" [...] by investing in marketable assets such as equities, because federal law prohibits it from investing in assets other than those backed by the U.S. government. As a result, its investments to date have been limited to special non-negotiable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, although some argue that debt issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association and other quasi-governmental organizations could meet legal standards. Social Security cannot by law invest in private equities, although some other countries (such as Canada) and some states permit their pension funds to invest in private equities. As a universal system, Social Security generally operates as a pipeline, through which current tax receipts from workers are used to pay current benefits to retirees, survivors, and the disabled. When there is an excess of taxes withheld over benefits paid, by law this excess is invested in Treasury securities (not in private equities) as described above.|$|E

2500|$|The {{analogy to}} insurance, however, is limitedSee also: Theda Skocpol, Social Policy in the United States: Future Possibilities in Historical Perspective, (Princeton University Press: 1995) p. 162: [...] "The {{ideology}} that Altmeyer and other Social Security administrators fashioned for the old-age security system was individualistic {{and based on}} a (technically quite false) analogy to private savings or insurance." [...] {{by the fact that}} paying FICA taxes creates no legal right to benefits and by the extent to which <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is,</b> in fact, funded by FICA taxes. During 2011 and 2012, for example, FICA tax revenue was insufficient to maintain Social Security's solvency without transfers from general revenues. These transfers added to the general budget deficit like general program spending.|$|E
2500|$|On May 13, 1998, Hovind and {{his wife}} filed a [...] "Power of Attorney and Revocation of Signature" [...] {{document}} in Escambia County which would nullify any of their promises, debts, or legal agreements made prior to April 15, 1998.

2500|$|Two broad {{categories}} of private pension plans are [...] "defined benefit pension plans" [...] and [...] "defined contribution pension plans." [...] Of these two, <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>is</b> {{more similar to}} a defined benefit pension plan. In a defined benefit pension plan, the benefits ultimately received are based {{on some sort of}} pre-determined formula (such as one based on years worked and highest salary earned). Defined benefit pension plans generally do not include separate accounts for each participant. By contrast, in a defined contribution pension plan each participant has a specific account with funds put into that account (by the employer or the participant, or both), and the ultimate benefit is based on the amount in that account at the time of retirement. Some have proposed that the Social Security system be modified to provide for the option of individual accounts (in effect, to make the system, at least in part, more like a defined contribution pension plan). Specifically, on February 2, 2005, President George W. Bush made Social Security a prominent theme of his State of the Union Address. He described the Social Security system as [...] "headed for bankruptcy", and outlined, in general terms, a proposal based on partial privatization. Critics responded that privatization would require huge new government borrowing to fund benefit payments during the transition years. See Social Security debate (United States).|$|E
