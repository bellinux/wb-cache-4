40|$|Against the {{background}} of the return of wolves into Germany the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) commissioned a synopsis and evaluation of large carnivore (LC) damage prevention methods that may work in Germany. The goal was to come up with recommendations for livestock protection measures, prevention- and compensation payment schemes based on experiences in Germany and other European countries. We summarized the German experience, reviewed the existing literature with a special focus on Europe, and send questionnaires to experts in European countries that face similar challenges like Germany. The results confirmed that there is no single livestock protection method providing 100 % safety. However, a couple of methods can reduce damages considerably and have already proved to be successful also under German conditions. Electric fences, when used correctly, are an effective measure for reducing predation on sheep or goats. In most cases electric <b>sheep</b> <b>nets</b> are sufficient as wolves rarely jump over fences. Most effective appears to be a combination of electric fences and livestock guarding dogs (LGD). However, it will be imperative to provide shepherds not only with dogs but also with expert advice on the raising and training of these dogs. When compensation is not coupled with prevention the incentive to use prevention measures accurately may beweak and thuswe highly recommend interlinking compensation payment with damage prevention. However, given the current low level of wolf predation on large stock, we presently recommend for Germany to request and consequently financially support only prevention measures for small livestock on a preemptive basis in the area of permanent wolf presence...|$|R

For each waste, viz., cow, buffalo, horse, donkey, sheep, goat and camel, five hatchlings per 100 g of waste were inoculated and monitored for biomass gain, mortality, sexual maturity, cocoons production periodically for 15 weeks. No mortality {{was observed in}} any waste. The earthworms grew rapidly in cow, sheep, and goat wastes. Maximum weight gain and highest growth rate were attained in <b>sheep</b> waste. <b>Net</b> biomass gain/earthworm in different animal wastes was in the order of: sheep> donkey> buffalo> goat ≈ cow ≈ horse> camel.

40|$|If fetal {{drinking}} {{activity is}} prevented {{and it is}} assumed that in the latter third of gestation the fetus is capable of maintaining itself in fluid balance, then the net amount of fluid gained across the placenta by the fetus is equal to the amount of fluid lost from the fetus, by routes other than the placenta, plus fluid deposited in growing tissues minus the amount of water produced as a result of oxidative metabolism. Net transplacental transfer of fluid to the fetus over a 3 h period was measured in eight chronically catheterized fetal sheep in which drinking activity was prevented by ligating the oesophagus. Urine and lung liquid flow rates were measured. In the latter third of gestation, these are the only significant sources of fluid loss from these fetuses during the 3 h experimental period. Water produced as a result of oxidative metabolism was calculated, as was the amount of fluid deposited in growing tissues {{during the course of the}} experiment. The weight of the fetus at the beginning of the experiment and the change in weight that occurred during the experiment was calculated by measuring the weight of the fetus at death (within 30 h) and applying an equation which describes the body weight-gestation age relationship for merino <b>sheep.</b> <b>Net</b> transplacental fluid transfer was 0. 40 +/- 0. 09 ml min- 1 kg- 1 (range 0. 30 - 0. 54 ml min- 1 kg- 1). Fetal urine flow rate averaged 0. 30 +/- 0. 11 ml min- 1 kg- 1. It was 72. 8 +/- 10. 0 % of the volumes used to calculate net transplacental fluid transfer to the fetus. Lung liquid flow rate was 0. 079 +/- 0. 039 ml min- 1 kg- 1. It was 20. 2 +/- 9. 2 % of the volumes used to calculate net fluid intake. The amount of fluid deposited as a result of tissue growth was 0. 023 +/- 0. 001 ml min- 1 kg- 1; it was 5. 94 +/- 1. 1 % of the volumes used in the equation, while the production of water as a result of metabolism was 3. 9 X 10 (- 3) ml min- 1 kg- 1 (Conrad & Faber, 1977) and constituted 1. 01 +/- 0. 22 % of the volumes used in the equation. This method of measuring net transplacental fluid transfer to the fetus can be used to measure fetal fluid intake over relatively short periods of time. It also means that the effects of disturbances in maternal fluid and electrolyte balance on fluid transfer to the fetus can be studied and quantitated...|$|R

40|$|The {{study has}} {{analysed}} the temporary migration of sheep {{as a response}} to the demand-supply disequilibrium of fodder and water and has explored its trends, determinants and constraints by using the data collected from rural areas of semi-arid Rajasthan. About 32 per cent of the farmers in the study area undertake temporary sheep migration. The migrating farmers have higher holding size of sheep, goat and buffaloes and are better in terms of adoption of improved sheep management practices than non-migrant farmers. The flock size, potential household labour supply and credit absorption behaviour have been reported to positively affect the odds of migration. The farmers face various en-route problems during migration, the major ones being increased morbidity, non-availability of veterinary medicines, resistance from local persons, theft and missing of <b>sheep.</b> The <b>net</b> return per animal per year has been found slightly higher in case of the non-migrant sheep flocks. The study has argued that migration of livestock is to be viewed as a method of production and adaptive mechanism evolved over the years. Efforts to sendentarise migrants without providing alternate fodder sources or productive assets of gainful employment may not be fruitful. In order to sustain the livelihood of the sheep farmers, institutional intervention to enhance accessibility to fodder and feed, veterinary services and strengthening of the extension services is needed.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Southern Zone of Tigray to evaluate body weight gain and carcass parameters of Sokota (Tigray Highland) sheep supplemented with Acacia seyal pods and wheat bran mix in hay based feeding. Twenty five Tigray Highland yearling rams with initial live body weight of 17. 5 ± 1. 7 kg (mean ± SD) were used. The experimental sheep were divided into five blocks of 5 rams each based on their initial body weight. The feeding trial consisted of grass hay (control), supplemented Acacia seyal pods, wheat bran and their mixture. A randomized complete block design was used to conduct the feeding trial. Carcass evaluation was done at the end of digestibility trial. Highest daily body weight gain was recorded in animals supplemented with Acacia seyal pods (51. 1 g/day. Acacia seyal pods is not recommended for fattening but to lessen the body weight fluctuation and uses as supplementation in the dry season and small average daily gain (28. 4 g/day) was also observed in sheep on the control treatments. There was significant difference (P< 0. 001) amongst treatments in rib eye area muscles. The Partial budget analysis of this study was based on the total variable costs, purchasing and selling prices of <b>sheep.</b> Best <b>net</b> income was gained in Tigray Highland rams supplemented with sole Acacia seyal pods and the value; of marginal rate of return (MRR) was found positive in all treatments except in treatment one...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanistic}} model that predicts nutrient requirements and biological values of feeds for <b>sheep</b> (Cornell <b>Net</b> Carbohydrate and Protein System; CNCPS-S) was {{expanded to include}} goats and the name was changed to the Small Ruminant Nutrition System (SRNS). The SRNS uses animal and environmental factors to predict metabolisable energy (ME) and protein, and Ca and P requirements. Requirements for goats in the SRNS are predicted based on the equations developed for CNCPS-S, modified to account for specific requirements of goats, including maintenance, lactation, and pregnancy requirements, and body reserves. Feed biological values are predicted based on carbohydrate and protein fractions and their ruminal fermentation rates, forage, concentrate and liquid passage rates, and microbial growth. For sheep, the SRNS accurately predicted gains and losses of shrunk body weight (SBW) of adult sheep (n = 15; mean bias (MB) = 5. 8 g/d and {{root mean square error}} of prediction (RMSPE) = 30 g/d; and r 2 = 0. 73) when diets were not deficient in ruminal nitrogen. Several evaluations indicated the SRNS had MB varying from 2. 4 to 18 g/d, RMSPE varying from 21. 4 to 41 g/d, and r 2 varying from 0. 70 to 0. 84 when predicting average daily gain (ADG) of growing lambs. For goats, the evaluation for lactating does indicated that predictions of ME intake (n = 21; MB = 0. 04 Mcal/d; RMSEP = 0. 24 Mcal/d; and r 2 = 0. 99) and energy balance (n = 21; MB = 0. 075 Mcal/d; RMSEP = 0. 20 Mcal/d; and r 2 = 0. 87) were adequate. Similarly, the SRNS accurately predicted ADG of kids (n = 31; MB = − 6. 4 g/d; RMSEP = 32. 5 g/d; and r 2 = 0. 85). In conclusion, the SRNS can accurately predict, ADG of growing lambs, and changes in SBW of mature sheep and ME intake and the energy balance of lactating and non-lactating adult goats and the ADG of kids of dairy, meat, and indigenous breeds.

40|$|This {{paper had}} been {{presented}} for promotion {{at the university}} of Khartoum. To get the full text please contact the other at osama elmotamedWe have studied the transport of acetate across the isolated epithelium of <b>sheep</b> omasum; no <b>net</b> transport was observed (Jms Jsm) under Ussing chamber conditions. Low mucosal pH (pH 6. 4) significantly enhanced Jms acetate and the transport rates of acetate increased linearly and significantly (r 2 = 0. 99) with the luminal acetate concentration. The presence of another short chain fatty acid (propionate) did not affect Jms acetate significantly. Neither addition of 1 mmol l 1 DIDS to the mucosal side nor HCO 3 replacement caused changes of Jms acetate; this does not support the assumption of acetate transport via anion exchange. Addition of 1 mmol l 1 amiloride to the mucosal side significantly decreased acetate fluxes at high mucosal acetate concentration (100 mmol l 1) and low pH (6. 4) indicating interaction between acetate uptake in the undissociated form, intracellular release of protons and activation of Na+/H+ exchange (NHE). However, the mutual interaction between Na transport via NHE and acetate transport is asymmetric. Stimulation or inhibition of Na transport via NHE is much more pronounced than the corresponding changes of acetate fluxes. Thus, the obtained results support the conclusion that acetate is transported via simple diffusion and probably predominantly in the protonated form, thereby explaining the positive and mutual interaction between Na transport and short chain fatty acid...|$|R
40|$|Sulphur {{amino acids}} (SAA) are {{important}} in the sheep industry because they appear in many instances, to limit wool protein synthesis. Experiments were carried out to study two methods {{with the potential to}} increase the absorption of SAA from the small intestine of sheep fed fresh forage diets. The first experiment evaluated the effects of condensed tannins (CT) in Lotus pedunculatus upon the following; (1) Rumen-S metabolism, and (2) the digestion of methionine and cystine. (3) The metabolism of plasma SAA and inorganic sulphate, and (4) The solubility and (5) degradation of protein in the rumen. The second experiment identified proteins that contained a high proportion of SAA, and assessed their potential for expression in the leaves of forage legumes using genetic engineering techniques. Two aspects were measured; (6) Rates of rumen degradation of ovalbumin and sunflower albumin 8 (SF 8) proteins in vitro, and (7) The expression of SF 8 protein from sunflower seeds in the leaves of transgenic tobacco. The nutritional consequences of CT in Lotus pedunculatus were assessed by infusing polyethylene glycol (PEG), into the rumen of one group of sheep (PEG sheep; CT not operating), whilst a separate group of sheep received an infusion of water (CONTROL sheep; CT operating). PEG selectively binds CT, preventing CT from binding plant proteins in the rumen, so that CT effects on digestion could be evaluated. Polyethylene glycol was also added to in vitro incubations as required. The principal results were; (1) Condensed tannins had a major effect on rumen sulphur (S) metabolism. The irreversible loss rate (IRL) of reducible-S (total non-protein S in rumen fluid, measured as sulphate after performic acid oxidation of rumen fluid) from the rumen was lower (P 0. 05) for control (1. 40 g/d) and PEG (l. 34 g/d) sheep. The apparent digestibility of methionine in the small intestine was similar (0. 78) for both groups, whilst for cystine, it was lower (P< 0. 01) in control (0. 42) than PEG (0. 53) sheep. The increased absorption of methionine from the small intestine with CT was due to an increased flux from the rumen, whereas the digestibility of cystine in the small intestine may have been lower as a consequence of binding to CT complexes. (3) Condensed tannin had a major effect on plasma SAA fluxes, especially cystine. Plasma cystine concentration and IRL were higher (P< 0. 001) in control (41. 7 μmol/l and 39. 8 :μmol/min) than PEG (27. 5 μmol/l and 22. 4 μ. mol/min) sheep. Condensed tannins resulted in a 79 % increase in the transulphuration of methionine to cystine (11. 7 and 6. 5 μ:mol/min; P< 0. 05) and a decrease (P< 0. 05) in the oxidation of cystine (3. 33 and 5. 2 μ. mol/min) and methionine (0. 2 μ. mol/min and 1. 2 μmol/min) to sulphate in control compared to PEG <b>sheep.</b> The <b>net</b> effect of CT was to increase (P< 0. 05) the flux of plasma cystine to productive processes and maintenance by 110 % in control (36. 5 μmol/min) compared to PEG (17. 4 μmol/min) sheep. This represented 91 % of total plasma cystine flux in control sheep, compared to only 74 % of total cystine flux in PEG sheep (P< 0. 05). Since wool growth is generally accepted as the major productive process utilising plasma cystine, these results indicate that a major effect of CT in the diet would probably be to increase wool growth. The IRL of plasma methionine was similar in control (20. 5 μmol/min) and PEG (19. 9 μmol/min) sheep, whilst the IRL of plasma sulphate was lower (P< 0. 01) in control (35. 9 μmol/min) than PEG (50. lμmol/min) sheep. (4) The rate of protein solubilization in the rumen was studied by measuring the loss of N, corrected for microbial-NAN contamination (true), from fresh minced (FM) and freeze-dried and ground (FD) Lotus pedunculatus, incubated in polyester-fibre bags suspended in the rumen of control and PEG sheep fed Lotus pedunculatus. Freshly minced Lotus was chosen as one treatment because it more closely represented the effects of chewing on cell rupture and CT release than was likely with freeze drying. Mincing resulted in a much greater initial N loss (47 %) than freeze drying (14 %). The true loss of N from FD Lotus was higher in PEG than control sheep at 2, 4, 6. 5, 11 and 24 hours of incubation, whilst with FM Lotus, N losses were similar. Microbial-NAN adhering to FD residues was higher in PEG than control sheep at 2, 4, 6. 5 and 11 hours, but was similar at 24 hours of incubation. However, microbial-NAN adhering to FM Lotus was higher in PEG compared to control sheep, only at 6. 5 and 24 hours. These observations suggest that CT reduced protein solubility and microbial colonization of FD Lotus to a much greater extent than FM Lotus. (5) The rate of protein degradation in the rumen was studied in vitro by incubating FM and FD Lotus pedunculatus in rumen fluid, with and without PEG, and using sodium-dodecyl-sulphate gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After 4 hours of incubation protein from FD and FM Lotus was clearly degraded when PEG was present, whilst after 8 hours of incubation it was essentially undetectable in both incubations. In contrast, after 8 hours, leaf protein from FM and FD Lotus was still readily detectable in incubations without PEG. Therefore, CT substantially reduced the rate at which soluble protein was degraded by rumen microorganisms but had little effect on the rate at which it was solubilized, particularly when minced. (6) The rate of degradation of SF 8 protein was compared to the degradation of the LSU and small subunit (SSU) of Fraction 1 leaf, vicilin and ovalbumin proteins using in vitro incubations and SDS-PAGE. The SF 8 protein had a rate of proteolysis of 0. 23 h- 1 and a half-life of 3. 0 hours, but the principal degradation product of SF 8, which had a half-life of 69 hours, was extremely resistant to rumen degradation. Proteolysis of the LSU of Fraction 1 leaf protein was resolved into two components. The first product had a degradation rate of 0. 06 h- 1 and a half-life of 11. 6 hours, whilst the second component of proteolysis, which occurred from 12 hours onwards, had a degradation rate of 0. 45 h- 1 and a half-life of 4. 6 hours. The proteolysis of the SSU of Fraction 1 leaf protein had a degradation rate of 0. 04 h- 1 and a half-life of 17. 3 hours. Ovalbumin was not degraded during the initial 16 hours of incubation, but was then degraded at a rate of 0. 08 h- 1, with a half-life of 8. 7 hours. Vicilin had a rate of proteolysis of 4. 3 h- 1 and a half-life of about 10 min. Both SF 8 protein and ovalbumin were found to be more resistant to rumen proteolysis than the LSU of Fraction 1 leaf protein, but different mechanisms were involved in conveying resistance. Therefore it is worthwhile to introduce expression of genes coding for these proteins into the leaves of important agricultural legumes, using genetic engineering techniques, with a view to increasing the availability of SAA for sheep. (7) The gene for SF 8 is normally expressed only in seeds. Therefore a SF 8 cDNA clone was genetically engineered for expression in the leaves of tobacco plants and inserted into a gene delivery system in Agrobacterium tumefaciens and transferred to tobacco. Transcription of the SF 8 synthetic (chimeric) gene occurred in the leaves of transformed tobacco, with the level of SF 8 mRNA varing over a 100 fold range, but in the highest expressor, it represented 14 % of the SF 8 mRNA level found in sunflower seeds. However, SF 8 protein was not detected in the leaves of transformed tobacco. Consequently, the level of SF 8 in the leaves of transgenic tobacco must have been less than 0. 03 % of total leaf protein. The highest SF 8 mRNA expressor contained nine times more SF 8 mRNA than an ovalbumin-transformed tobacco contained ovalbumin mRNA. As the ovalbumin transformed tobacco produced 0. 01 % of its leaf protein as ovalbumin, there is at least sufficient SF 8 mRNA to support up to nine times that level of protein expression. As this level of SF 8 protein expression would be detectable using sensitive immunological procedures, it seems that either SF 8 mRNA is not translatable in tobacco plants or SF 8 protein is very unstable in tobacco leaves. Translatability of SF 8 mRNA was tested in E. coli using an expression vector, pJLA 602 without success. If SF 8 protein was unstable in tobacco leaves, then SF 8, which is a seed storage protein, should be stably accumulated in tobacco seeds. The expression of the SF 8 chimeric gene was monitored in tobacco seeds, and again the results were negative. It would appear that the SF 8 cDNA coding region was untranslatable so that DNA sequencing of the SF 8 chimeric gene will be necessary to correct the DNA sequence by oligonucleotide-directed, site specific mutagenesis. (8) Both CT and proteins, resistant to degradation in the rumen and with a high proportion of SAA, have the potential to increase the absorption of SAA from the small intestine in sheep grazing fresh forages. However, further research is required to examine; (a) the effectiveness of lower dietary CT concentrations than were examined in the present studies, on increasing SAA absorption and metabolism, and (b) what level of foreign gene expression is required in transgenic legumes to stimulate wool growth...|$|R
