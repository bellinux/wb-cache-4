40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{pulse transmission}} method (100 - 500 kHz) was adapted to measure compressional (P) and shear (<b>S)</b> wave velocities <b>for</b> <b>synthetic</b> soils fabricated from quartz-clay and quartz-peat mixtures. Velocities were determined as samples were loaded by small (up to 0. 1 MPa) uniaxial stress {{to determine how}} stress at grain contacts affects ave amplitudes, velocities, and frequency content. Samples were fabricated from quartz sand mixed with either a swelling clay or peat (natural cellulose). P velocities in these dry synthetic soil samples were low, ranging from about 230 to 430 m/s for pure sand, about 91 to 420 m/s for sand-peat mixtures, and about 230 to 470 m/s for dry sand-clay mixtures. S velocities were {{about half of the}} P velocity in most cases, about 130 to 250 m/s for pure sand, about 75 - 220 m/s for sand-peat mixtures, and about 88 - 220 m/s for dry sand-clay mixtures. These experiments demonstrate that P and S velocities are sensitive to the amount and type of admixed second phase at low concentrations. They found that dramatic increases in all velocities occur with small uniaxial loads, indicating strong nonlinearity of the acoustic properties. Composition and grain packing contribute to the mechanical response at grain contacts and the nonlinear response at low stresses...|$|R

40|$|N-Methylthio beta-lactams {{represent}} a promising new family of antibacterial agents whose in vitro activity is confined largely to Staphylococcus species, including multidrug-resistant forms of S. aureus. Originally {{developed in the}} 19802 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>for</b> use as <b>synthetic</b> intermediates, N-methylthio beta-lactams have recently been shown in these laboratories to possess intriguing biological properties which are addressed in Chapters I-IV. In terms of the antibacterial activities, the structural features and species specificities exhibited by these compounds are unlike those of any existing family of beta-lactam drugs. The lactams seem to exert their effects intracellularly, requiring passage of the bioactive species through the cellular membrane, rather than acting extracellularly on cell wall components {{in the manner of}} penicillin and related antibiotics. The lipophilic nature of these molecules, which lack the polar side chain functionality of all other microbially-active Beta-lactams, suggests the compounds do not target the penicillin binding proteins within bacterial membranes. The most active members of this Beta-lactam class appear to be those bearing an aryl (Ar) substituent at C 4 of the ring. The synthesis and structure-activity relationship of these analogues is discussed in Chapter III. Moreover, microscopy and 3 H pulse-labeling studies, which are described in Chapter IV, demonstrate that N-methylthio beta-lactams appear to be inhibitors of protein biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the {{phenomenon}} of new designer drugs has attracted much attention. Synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones are the two main classes of these drugs. Both are potent drugs of abuse, and several cases of severe toxicity and deaths are reported. The present work {{is based on a}} systematic review of studies that have assessed the market and prevalence of synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones, and integrates pharmacological, sociological, and epidemiological aspects of these two groups of emerging synthetic drugs. The review refl ects that the Internet has made synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones widely available. Furthermore, aggressive and widespread marketing, as well as the low price level of these drugs, their juridical status and their lack of detection on standard drug tests may serve as major motivations for drug use. The number of prevalence studies is small and derived from a limited number of countries. In spite of the many methodological shortcomings, some conclusions may be cautiously drawn. Taken together, the results point toward higher prevalence of use <b>for</b> <b>synthetic</b> cathinones than <b>for</b> <b>synthetic</b> cannabinoids. In the general population, the prevalence of use of synthetic cathinones is reported to be around 4 % compared to fi gures lower than 1 % <b>for</b> <b>synthetic</b> cannabinoids. Among students, the prevalence varies from 1 – 20 % <b>for</b> <b>synthetic</b> cathinones and 2 – 10 % <b>for</b> <b>synthetic</b> cannabinoids. Among groups with high rates of drug use, the prevalence varies between 4 % to more than 60 % <b>for</b> <b>synthetic</b> cathinones and around 10 % <b>for</b> <b>synthetic</b> cannabinoids...|$|R

40|$|Synthetic posttranscriptional {{regulation}} of gene expression {{is important for}} understanding fundamental biology and programming new cellular processes in synthetic biology. Previous strategies for regulating translation in eukaryotes have focused on disrupting individual steps in translation, including initiation and mRNA cleavage. In emphasizing modularity and cross-organism functionality, these systems are designed to operate orthogonally to native control mechanisms. Here we introduce a broadly applicable strategy for robustly controlling protein translation by integrating synthetic translational control via a small-molecule-regulated RNA–protein module with native mechanisms that simultaneously regulate multiple facets of cellular RNA fate. We demonstrate that this strategy reduces ‘leakiness’ to improve overall expression dynamic range, and can be implemented without sacrificing modularity and cross-organism functionality. We illustrate this in Saccharomyces cerevisae and the non-model human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Given the limited functional genetics toolkit available for P. falciparum, we establish the utility of this strategy for defining essential genes.
