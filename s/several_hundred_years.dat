5|$|Frontier policy {{under the}} Tang dynasty {{reversed}} the wall-building activities of most previous dynasties that had occupied northern China since {{the third century}} BC, and no extensive wall building took place for the next <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tree shaping {{has been}} practised {{for at least}} <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years,</b> the oldest known {{examples}} being the living root bridges built and maintained by the Khasi people of Meghalaya, India using {{the roots of the}} rubber tree (Ficus elastica).|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} cones, four stratovolcanoes, and three craters are {{visible in the}} lake. The Tandukbenua cone on the northwestern edge of the caldera has only sparse vegetation, {{suggesting}} a young age of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years.</b> Also, the Pusubukit (Hill Center) volcano (1971 metres above sea level) on the south edge of the caldera is solfatarically active.|$|E
50|$|After the {{destruction}} of 1519, Duke Ulrich rebuilt the castle for the third and last time. Wirtemberg Castle was eventually dismantled in 1819 {{during the reign of}} William I after <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>years</b> of neglect it had fallen into ruins.|$|R
50|$|Mu'awiya {{lies between}} the Barkan and Panther rivers and {{is divided into}} two parts: Mu'awiya on the east, and Khirbet Mu'awiya on the west. Between the village's parts lies the shrine of Sheikh Mua'wiya and next to them there are <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>year</b> old oak trees, that were {{preserved}} by the locals because of the sanctity of the site.|$|R
50|$|Established in the 1980s, Vardia {{is located}} in the upper Carmel, between the Hadar Hacarmel and Romema. The pine forests ringing the {{neighborhood}} were once a popular site for family recreation and hiking. Several archeological sites and the ruins of stone houses <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>years</b> old were discovered on the hills. The residential towers in this largely upscale neighborhood offer a panoramic view of Haifa Bay.|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Jacob is not known. It has been bred in the British Isles for <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years.</b> Sheep of this kind, little {{different}} from the modern breed, were shown in paintings from about 1760 at Tabley House in Cheshire, and – by George Stubbs – at Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|After meditating for <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years,</b> {{a magical}} white snake {{transforms}} into a beautiful woman. Her competitor, a black snake, does likewise. The two {{compete for the}} love of a man named Khouw Han Boen. Ultimately Khouw agrees to marry the (former) white snake, but when her true identity is revealed he attempts to cancel their wedding. The snake-woman, crying, tells Khouw's boss that they are to be married, and ultimately Khouw is guilted into marrying her.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the extreme intensity of the cyclone, relatively little structural damage resulted from it. No injuries {{were reported to have}} occurred during the storm's existence and losses were estimated to be A$6.6 million (US$5.1million). However, severe environmental damage took place. In the Northern Territory, an area about 7,000km2 (4,300mi2) was defoliated by Monica's high wind gusts. In response to the large loss of forested area, it was stated that it would take <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> for the area to reflourish.|$|E
30|$|Within {{the four}} {{subsections}} we examined for weather patterns, lightning strike occurrence varied significantly {{from year to}} year. The summer total number of lightning strikes has ranged {{by more than a}} factor of ten across the 16 yr of the analysis. The range was even greater during monthly intervals within the summer, with some months having essentially zero strikes and some having <b>several</b> <b>hundred.</b> <b>Year</b> to year variability was very similar across the four subsections, especially between the subsections in the Sierra Nevada and the Mojave Desert. The same patterns of high and low occurrence exist to some extent among all four subsections.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Several</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>years</b> ago, {{the area}} around the {{reservoir}} was a dense forest with very few inhabitants. At least from 1646 to 1659, Southern Ming loyalist Li Wanrong (李萬榮), leading a cohort numbering in thousands, controlled Kowloon and much of today's New Territories, collecting taxes and fortifying villages, including erecting a fortress in {{the lower part of the}} Shing Mun River valley. Hence the area became known as Shing Mun or [...] "fortified gate".|$|R
50|$|The webcomic Schlock Mercenary {{involves}} several {{battles with}} dark matter entities, {{who have been}} plotting to destroy the Milky Way galaxy for <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> thousand <b>years,</b> and whose stronghold is the Andromeda Galaxy.|$|R
5|$|Traditional beliefs {{regarding}} {{slow lorises}} {{have been part}} of the folklore of Southeast Asia for at least <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years.</b> Their remains are buried under houses and roads to bring good luck, and every part of their body is used in traditional medicine to make products ranging from love potions to unproven cures for cancer, leprosy, epilepsy, and sexually transmitted diseases. The primary users of this traditional medicine are urban, middle-aged women who are reluctant to consider alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{woodland}} was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds. A {{significant part of the}} exposed woodland to the north-east of Wormshill was felled and, after replanting, has only recently shown signs of maturing. An ancient yew tree believed to have stood for <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long-standing trees. However, some 25years later, the village displays few obvious signs of the damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Several</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>years</b> {{after the}} events of Light Fantasy, monsters become {{friendly}} enough to become companions (like in Pokémon). However, the Goddess from the first game becomes an enemy. The battle system {{is similar to the}} first game. The Towers of Light and Darkness no longer exists. Instead, players must explore different villages and dungeons in order to unlock the complete story of the game. There is a Buddhist tower in the game; indicating that the people observe Buddhism in the game.|$|R
5000|$|Feso, {{originally}} published in Zezuru in 1957 when Zimbabwe was still the colony of Southern Rhodesia, is a narrative with subtle political implications set <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>years</b> ago, before colonization. Beyond {{the use of the}} Shona language itself, the novel incorporates a number of features of traditional Zezuru oral culture, including song and storytelling techniques. [...] Despite Mutswairo's association with the small intellectual elite in the country, Feso was widely read, and even taught in schools, until it was banned by the Rhodesian government in the mid-1960s.|$|R
50|$|Tåsinge {{has been}} a tourist {{destination}} for more than 100 years, the main attractions being the islands idyllic and surprisingly diverse nature {{as well as the}} many preserved historic buildings, often <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> of <b>years</b> old.|$|R
5|$|The Khitan spoken {{language}} is most {{closely related to}} the Mongolic language family; some broader definitions of the Mongolic family include Khitan as a member. More broadly, Khitan is an Altaic language, although scholars are divided on the question whether the Altaic is a true language family or linguistic area in which originally distinct languages have influenced each other over a long period. Khitan shares some terms with the Altaic but non-Mongolic Turkic spoken by the Uighur peoples, who shared the steppes of North Asia with the Khitans for <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{has been the}} subject of folklore in the surrounding area for <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> and possibly more than a millennium. Its construction was commonly attributed to a giant known as Wade, a figure from Germanic or Norse mythology. In the 1720s the causeway was mentioned in a published text and became known outside the local area. Within a few years it became of interest to antiquarians who visited the site and exchanged commentary on its probable historicity. They interpreted the structure as a causeway across marshy ground, attributing its construction to the Roman military, an explanation largely unchallenged throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|After <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> of no {{permanent}} habitation, {{the second wave}} of migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first wave of immigrants, known as Dorset I, arrived around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, and few artifacts from the era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites, with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further north in the Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E
50|$|For <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> of <b>years</b> (until 1980), {{the town}} and the {{surrounding}} areas and villages, lay ground to three brickyards. Today, the landscape are marked with former clay pits, which now serves as lakes and a marina bassin.|$|R

50|$|The {{limestone}} mountain {{was originally}} a coral reef, formed about 385 {{million years ago}} on the spot where Madagascar lies today. it was subsequently moved to its present-day site as a result of tectonic plate movements over <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> million <b>years.</b>|$|R
5|$|By many general {{criteria}} of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages {{could very well}} be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E
5|$|During its rule, Spain quelled various {{indigenous}} revolts. There {{were also}} several external military challenges from Chinese and Japanese pirates, the Dutch, the English, the Portuguese and the Muslims of Southeast Asia. Those challengers were fought off despite the hostile forces having encircled the Philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from Japan to Indonesia. British forces occupied Manila from 1762 to 1764 in {{an extension of}} the fighting of the Seven Years' War. Spanish rule was restored following the 1763 Treaty of Paris. The Spanish–Moro conflict lasted for <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years.</b> In {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century, Spain conquered portions of Mindanao and the Moro Muslims in the Sulu Sultanate formally recognized Spanish sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|Gannett Glacier, on the {{northeast}} slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. It has reportedly lost over 50percent of its volume since 1920 with 25percent of that occurring between the years 1980–1999. Upper Fremont Glacier has been studied {{more than any other}} glacier in the Wind River Range. Scientist have obtained ice cores from the Upper Fremont Glacier and found that there have been measurable changes in the atmosphere over the past <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years.</b> The Upper Fremont Glacier and the Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Andes of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time.|$|E
25|$|The fair has a {{prominent}} history dating back <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> of <b>years.</b> It {{started in the}} year 1672 AD as a one-day cattle trading fair. The fair has been held every year, excluding 1858, the year after 1857 revolt, which started from Meerut.|$|R
40|$|Turcotte (9193) proposes an episodic {{hypothesis}} regarding tectonics on Venus, wherein 'global subduction' alternates with quiescence {{and development}} of a thick strong lithosphere on a time scale of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> million <b>years.</b> Kaula (1994) argues that Turcotte's model is unpersuasive in several respects...|$|R
50|$|In 1553, in the Second Margrave War, {{the town}} was burnt down. Afterwards, a long lasting phase of {{construction}} and extension began. This phase ended with the destructions of the Thirty Years' War. The rebuilding after that war lasted <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> of <b>years.</b>|$|R
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a cycle occurs in which {{volcanic}} activity at the summit is dominant for <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years,</b> after which activity shifts to the rift zones for several more centuries, {{and then back to}} the summit again. Two cycles have been clearly identified, each lasting 1,500–2,000years. This cyclical behavior is unique to Mauna Loa among the Hawaiian volcanoes. Between about 7,000 and 6,000years ago Mauna Loa was largely inactive. The cause of this cessation in activity is not known, and no known similar hiatus has been found at other Hawaiian volcanoes except for those currently in the post-shield stage. Between 11,000 and 8,000years ago, activity was more intense than it is today. However, Mauna Loa's overall rate of growth has probably begun to slow over the last 100,000years, and the volcano may in fact be nearing the end of its tholeiitic basalt shield-building phase.|$|E
5|$|Printing in China {{initially}} had {{a similar}} development, starting with the printing of religious scriptures, prayers and popularly useful texts such as almanacs or calendars which were produced for local use by temples. By the Five Dynasties, the government realized the opportunities of printing political and ideological texts such as the Classics. The ensuing Song Dynasty saw great advancements in art, religion and philosophy with scholarly activity greatly facilitated by printed books. Consequently, the Chinese publishing industry took off during the Song Dynasty, <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> before the same happened in Japan. Enhanced by the Song interest of foreign trade and the maritime activity of the Taira, the book exchange between China and Japan saw a second peak after the Sui and Tang Dynasties starting in 1192. Japanese visitors to Song China returned {{with a large number}} of printed books, on a variety of subjects such as history, philosophy, Buddhism, Confucianism, literature, medicine and geography, causing a revival of pure scholarship, which had been sidelined during the earlier obsession with poetry in the Heian period courtier society.|$|E
5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> {{before the}} events of the game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse {{attacked}} and ripped a large hole in Cocoon. Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power. The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and the Public Security and Intelligence COMmand (PSICOM), the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse. The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans through the use of Manadrives.|$|E
50|$|Mountain glaciers and {{the polar}} ice caps/ice sheets provide much data in paleoclimatology.
