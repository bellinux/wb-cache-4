The failure of this stratagem was that he used Christina as his titular audience, instead of the shadow audience he truly sought to persuade.

The definition of a website or online service directed to children is expanded to include plug-ins or ad networks that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information through a child-directed website or online service. Websites and services that target children as a <b>secondary</b> <b>audience</b> may differentiate among users, and are required to provide notice and obtain parental consent only for those users who identify themselves as being younger than 13.

40|$|Two {{concurrent}} {{understandings of}} criticality in art assign it {{as a potential}} property of artworks themselves, or bemoan it as lacking in art’s audiences.

40|$|This thesis explores Pindar's {{relationship}} to his audiences. Part One demonstrates how his victory odes {{take into account}} an audience present at their premiere performance and also <b>secondary</b> <b>audiences</b> throughout space and time. It argues that getting {{the most out of}} the epinicians involves simultaneously assuming the perspectives of both their initial and subsequent audiences. Part Two describes how Pindar uses his audiences' knowledge of other lyric to situate his work both within an immanent poetic history and within a contemporary poetic culture. It sets out Pindar's vision of the literary world past and present and suggests how this framework shapes an audienceâs experience of his work. Part Three explains how Pindar's victory odes made lucid sense as linear unities to fifth-century Greeks imbued in the traditions of choral lyric. An annotated text shows how each sentence in the epinician corpus forms part of a coherent chain of rational discourse. </p...|$|R

[...] However, Josephus's [...] "countless incidental remarks explaining basic Judean language, customs and laws … assume a Gentile audience. He does not expect his first hearers to know anything about the laws or Judean origins." [...] The issue of who would read this multivolume work is unresolved. Other possible motives for writing Antiquities could be to dispel the misrepresentation of Jewish origins or as an apologetic to Greek cities of the Diaspora in order to protect Jews and to Roman authorities to garner their support for the Jews facing persecution. Unfortunately, neither motive explains why the proposed Gentile audience would read this large body of material.|$|R
