5|$|The twentieth-century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr {{attempted}} to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy {{in the light}} of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without mythology. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil ontological existence and ties humans' <b>sin</b> to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to <b>sin</b> because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the Pelagian view that human will could overcome <b>sin</b> on its own. Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed <b>sin</b> in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original <b>sin.</b> He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described <b>sin</b> as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to <b>sin</b> affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist <b>sin.</b> Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original <b>sin,</b> but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to <b>sin,</b> Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their <b>sin,</b> before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human <b>sin</b> (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the <b>sin</b> of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on original <b>sin</b> (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by <b>sin.</b> Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} Eternal Punishment {{emerged during the}} writing for Persona 2: Innocent <b>Sin.</b> Halfway through writing the latter's script, Tadashi Satomi felt that the draft gave him the {{impression}} of needing an alternate point of view {{to that of the}} main hero. This concept formed the basis for Eternal Punishments plot. To foreshadow this, the team showed the main characters from Eternal Punishment through minor roles in Innocent <b>Sin.</b> Eternal Punishment began full development after the release of Innocent <b>Sin.</b> Innocent <b>Sin</b> and Eternal Punishment both used the same game engine and structure. Kouji Okada, Innocent Sins producer, returned in the same role. When developing Eternal Punishment, the development team took what they learned from Innocent <b>Sin</b> and used it to improve the gameplay and the Rumor system. One of the biggest concerns when making Eternal Punishment was how much the development staff wanted to include, which went well beyond their original plans.|$|E

5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, <b>sin</b> is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from <b>sin</b> is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E

5|$|During the Reformation, Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{many of the}} Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper.

No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal <b>sin</b> but who die in original <b>sin</b> are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E
