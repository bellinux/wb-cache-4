The remote modules periodically read signals from sensors and send result to the controller board that display the received data on LCD Panel. In sensor networks a set of nodes randomly deployed communicate through wireless links and provide the information as on when required. Since these nodes run with little power mostly running with batteries the hardware and software must be designed appropriately. In this paper, TEA is implemented using Zigbee wireless link. The use of Zigbee Module and Microcontroller ensures a robust and secure communication between system modules with Low power consumption...|$|R
