50|$|GuernseySt Peter Port Breakwater - (Location of 8 Bailiwick Records (Angler Fish, Couchs Sea Bream, Lesser Spotted Dogfish, <b>Flounder,</b> <b>Smooth</b> Hound, Tadpole Fish, Whiting and Ballan Wrasse)). As {{the records}} show, the St Peter Port {{breakwater}} is good fishing for many species. Located just passed Castle Cornet {{in the town}} of St Peter Port. The breakwater is a light house {{on the end of a}} pier. It offers easy access and safe fishing although it can be a very busy site due to this facts.|$|R
50|$|The Far Eastern <b>smooth</b> <b>flounder,</b> Liopsetta pinnifasciata, is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish that lives on bottoms in salt, brackish and fresh waters. Its native habitat is the temperate waters of the northwestern Pacific, specifically Japan, Russia and the Kuril Islands. It can grow up to 50 cm in length.|$|E
50|$|The American <b>smooth</b> <b>flounder</b> inhabits {{the shallow}} salt and {{brackish}} arctic-boreal {{waters of the}} northwestern Atlantic, living inshore on the soft mud bottoms of estuaries, river mouths and sheltered bays. Its range stretches along the Canada-US coast from Quebec through Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts to Rhode Island.|$|E
50|$|The American <b>smooth</b> <b>flounder</b> (Pleuronectes putnami) is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish that inhabits shallow inshore salt and brackish waters at depths of up to 27 m. Its native habitat is the temperate waters of the northwestern Atlantic, from Ungava Bay in Quebec, Canada to Rhode Island, United States. It can grow up to 30 cm in length.|$|E
50|$|The American <b>smooth</b> <b>flounder</b> is a right-eyed flatfish, {{resembling}} the winter flounder {{in shape and}} appearance. Its upper side, including the fins, ranges in colour from dark grey to brown or almost black, and may be either uniform or mottled with darker patches of the same colour; its underside is white. Females are smooth {{on both sides of}} the body, whilst males are rough on the upper side.|$|E
40|$|Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) is a teleost that tolerates {{temperatures}} {{close to}} the freezing point of sea water {{through the use of}} proteins (Ewart and Fletcher, 1990) and glycerol (Raymond, 1992) as antifreeze agents. The lower the temperature, the higher the glycerol level such that at – 2 °C serum glycerol may approach 400 mM (Raymond, 1992). Although effective at lowering the freezing temperature glycerol is lost at a rate that may exceed 10 % of glycerol stores per day (Raymond, 1993). Therefore, there must be vigorous glycerol synthesis at very low temperatures. Liver is an active site of glycerol synthesis and one source of carbon for glycerol is probably dietary amino acids that are degraded to glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) (Raymond and Driedzic, 1997; Driedzic et al., 1998). It appears that carbon flow is G 3 P ® dihydroxyacetone-P (DHAP) ® glycerol- 3 -P ® glycerol. Blood glycerol levels and liver enzyme activity levels were determined in rainbow smelt, Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod) and <b>smooth</b> <b>flounder</b> (Liposetta putmani). All animals were sampled simultaneously from sub-zer...|$|E
