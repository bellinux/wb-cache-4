5|$|Study of the {{structural}} colouration of the wing scales of <b>swallowtail</b> butterflies {{led to the development}} of more efficient light-emitting diodes. The structural colouration of butterflies is inspiring nanotechnology research to produce paints that do not use toxic pigments and in the development of new display technologies.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger <b>swallowtail</b> look like bird droppings.|$|E
5|$|Parsnip {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some {{lepidopteran}} species, including the parsnip <b>swallowtail</b> (Papilio polyxenes), the common swift moth (Korscheltellus lupulina), the garden dart moth (Euxoa nigricans), and the ghost moth (Hepialus humuli). The larvae of the parsnip moth (Depressaria radiella), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds.|$|E

50|$|Butterflies are {{plentiful}} at Dismal Swamp State Park. Forty-three {{species have been}} found in the park, including large numbers of palamedes, zebra <b>swallowtails,</b> tiger <b>swallowtails</b> and Atlantic holly azures. Several varieties of warbler and vireo are common. Woodpeckers and hawks nest here as do barred owls.|$|R
5|$|The Ohio Burgee is the {{official}} flag of the U.S. state of Ohio. Ohio's <b>swallowtail</b> flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. Its red, white, and blue elements symbolize the state's natural features and order of admission into the Union. A prominent disc in the flag's triangular canton is suggestive of the state's name.|$|E
5|$|From Boston, Edwards {{moved to}} New York {{to stay for}} some ten years, {{performing}} on stage and participating in insect studies. He {{was active in the}} Brooklyn and New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled Papilio, named for the genus Papilio in the <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly family, Papilionidae. Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia. Papilio was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into the more general Entomologia Americana, published by the Brooklyn Entomological Society.|$|E
5|$|Selective mirrors {{to create}} {{interference}} effects are formed of micron-sized bowl-shaped pits lined with {{multiple layers of}} chitin in the wing scales of Papilio palinurus, the emerald <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly. These act as highly selective mirrors for two wavelengths of light. Yellow light is reflected directly from the centres of the pits; blue light is reflected twice by {{the sides of the}} pits. The combination appears green, but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope.|$|E

5|$|An October 2001 {{survey of}} Mahanoy Creek {{identified}} {{two species of}} fish each at Ashland and Girardville. There were 20 individuals at the latter location and 22 at the former. There were also 13 species and 134 individuals at Gowen City, and 14 species and 545 individuals at the creek's mouth. Additionally, 1003 individuals and 20 species of fish were observed {{at the mouth of}} the tributary Schwaben Creek. White Suckers were found at each of the aforementioned sites. Other fish species found on Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek include the <b>swallowtail</b> shiner, the rosyface shiner, the river chub, the banded darter, and the shield darter. Brown trout, longnose dace, and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in the watershed. Historically, deer came to the creek to consume salt.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is found}} in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf {{butterfly}} and autumn leaf are remarkable imitations of leaves. As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches. Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked with eyespots {{as if they were}} snakes. Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant <b>swallowtail</b> (Papilio cresphontes) resemble bird droppings. Some caterpillars have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations. Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection. Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' <b>swallowtail</b> butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E

5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{was first}} {{described}} by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to <b>swallowtail</b> butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had {{the head of a}} different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the <b>swallowtail</b> butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
25|$|Papilio demoleus is {{a common}} and {{widespread}} <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly. The butterfly {{is also known as}} the common lime butterfly, lemon butterfly, lime <b>swallowtail,</b> small citrus butterfly, chequered <b>swallowtail,</b> dingy <b>swallowtail</b> and citrus <b>swallowtail.</b> These common names refer to their host plants, which are usually citrus species such as the cultivated lime. Unlike most <b>swallowtail</b> butterflies, it does not have a prominent tail. The butterfly is a pest and invasive species from Asia and Australia which has spread to the Caribbean and Central America.|$|E

25|$|<b>Swallowtail</b> {{butterflies}} practice Batesian mimicry, {{a behavior}} {{in which the}} butterflies' appearance closely resemble that of distasteful species that prevents predation. Swallowtails differ from many animals that practice mimicry. The tiger <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly (Papilio glaucus), exhibits a female-limited polymorphism for Batesian mimicry and others, such as the Canadian tiger <b>swallowtail</b> (Papilio canadensis) do not display any form of mimicry.|$|E
