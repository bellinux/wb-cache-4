40|$|If we treated image {{watermarking}} as {{a communication}} problem using the image as the communication channel, applying error-correcting codes (ECC) to the watermarking system should increase the robustness significantly {{and there has}} been a lot of works done in this direction. For fading channels, using diversity or <b>signal</b> <b>repetition</b> could be more effective than other ECC methods. However, twice the <b>signal</b> <b>repetition</b> needed twice the bandwidth which can be excessive because the available bandwidth in watermarking was usually small. Multiple-description coding was a mean of trading off between transmission bandwidth and bit error rate. Thereby, we could increase diversity without increasing as much bandwidth as <b>signal</b> <b>repetition.</b> In this paper, we proposed a new image watermarking method using multiple-description coding to increase robustness. Since traditional multiple-description coding was considered in on-off channels where channels were not marred by bit errors but occasional connection outages such as dropped packets, to apply multiple-description coding in watermarking, we needed a form of multiple-description coding for noisy channels instead of on-off channels. Iterative coding of multiple descriptions (ICMD) has been proposed to be used in noisy channels. Here, we used ICMD together with spread spectrum watermarking to form our watermarking system. We found that bit error did not happen until we compressed the test image in JPEG to 12. 7 % of the original size (PSNR 37. 25 dB). We concluded that ICMD was a very good way to increase robustness for image watermarking. 1...|$|E

In this work, we study whether this framework can incorporate <b>signals</b> that are <b>repetitions</b> of more general shapes than parallelepipeds. For example, the famous Dutch artist M. C.

By transcribing this idea into a mathematical framework, we explore its relationship with the traditional analysis of periodicity based on parallelepipeds.

40|$|Relying on the {{mechanism}} of bat’s echolocation system, a bioinspired electronic device has been developed to investigate the cortical activity of mammals in response to auditory sensorial stimuli. By means of implanted electrodes, acoustical information about the external environment generated by a biomimetic system and converted in electrical signals was delivered to anatomically selected structures of the auditory pathway. Electrocorticographic recordings showed that cerebral activity response is highly dependent on the information carried out by ultrasounds and is frequency-locked with the <b>signal</b> <b>repetition</b> rate. Frequency analysis reveals that delta and beta rhythm content increases, suggesting that sensorial information is successfully transferred and integrated. In addition, principal component analysis highlights how all the stimuli generate patterns of neural activity which can be clearly classified.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of communication {{depends on the}} ability of conspecifics to recognize and locate each other, and the environment can impose important limitations on reliability of transmitted and received information. In contrast to the 3 D space of airborne sound communication, substrate-borne vibrational signals are often transmitted via 1 D plant stems and leaf stalks. In such situations, discrimination between signals emitted from several sources positioned {{on the same side of}} a receiver may be difficult, as the receiver may perceive this compound signal as emanating from a single source. Here, we examined the consequences of interactions between conspecific vibrational signals emitted from 2 sources for recognition of species-specific temporal patterns. In a 1 D environment on a bean plant, males of the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula perceived conspecific female song emitted in alternation from 2 sources as a compound song with a <b>signal</b> <b>repetition</b> time outside the species-specific value and male responsiveness and the number of males locating a source (conspecific female) were low. By contrast, when the conspecific song was presented together with female signals of another stinkbug Acrosternum hilare, searching activity was not significantly affected. However, when conspecific and heterospecific signals were overlapping, males made significant orientation errors and the majority located the heterospecific source. Because both outcomes, missing a conspecific female and selecting a heterospecific partner, may ultimately lead to a reduced reproductive success, the results suggest that the 1 D environment encountered on plant stems and branches imposes important limitations on vibrational communication system.

40|$|Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOAs) are of {{considerable}} interest as nonlinear optical processing devices, since they can facilitate such operations as signal regeneration and wavelength conversion. All optical processing of signals in SOAs usually employs either cross-gain modulation (XGM) or cross-phase modulation (XPM). In the latter case, to convert phase changes to intensity variations, {{it is common}} to use integrated SOA Mach-Zehnder interferometers (SOA-MZIs). As <b>signal</b> <b>repetition</b> rates approach the operating bandwidth of the SOA devices, precise knowledge of their response in both intensity and phase becomes ever more crucial. The usual approach to the phase-sensitive characterisation of fast optical devices involves the use of interferometric set-ups [1], which can be quite involving and prone to environmental instabilities. In this paper, and in order to aid the optimisation of these versatile devices we present a study of SOA response behaviour using a linear frequency resolved gating technique (L-FROG). The L-FROG allows the phase and intensity of signals to be characterized using off-the-shelf all-fiberised equipment in a simple non-interferometric set-up. Using a SOA-MZI in a pump-probe configuration, we investigate both the XGM and XPM response to ps-long pump signals. Since intraband effects such as carrier heating and spectral hole burning, which facilitate high-speed switching, are dependent on the power of the incoming signals, we focus our studies on the variation of the SOA response to the input power. Through this study we hope to provide {{a better understanding of the}} nonlinear behaviour of SOA devices, and additionally prove the applicability of LFROG techniques for the complete characterisation of fast optical device response behaviour...|$|E

This research attempts to investigate the phenomena of rhetoric situation specially on writing to describe process paragraph used on NOKIA 3610 user’s guidebook. The research problem is how the process paragraph is applied in NOKIA 3610 user’s Guide Book. To answer the research problem, formulation of research questions is as follow: What types of process paragraph in NOKIA 3610 user Guide Book are and which type is mainly used in NOKIA 3610 user Guide Book. The descriptive qualitative method was used to conduct this research. This research describes and explains process paragraph used in NOKIA 3610 user’s guidebook. The data were taken from “NOKIA 3610 user’s guide book”. To analyze the data, the paragraph of each title are determined to know whether they are fulfilled or not. Then the data were categorized and analyzed by using process paragraph theory proposed by Martin J. Arnaudet and Mary Ellen Barret into five types namely: enumerators, listing <b>signals,</b> time clues, <b>repetition</b> and pronoun reference, and visualization. Based on the 135 data presented and analyzed in this study, it can be concluded that types of process paragraph found in this guidebook are time clues, listing <b>signals,</b> <b>repetition</b> and pronoun reference and visualization. This study also finds this kind of time clues in is almost in all data. As part of time clues, verb choice is the most type that is used in many times, while time clauses, participle phrases, sentence connector of time are seldom used; because the writer wants to get direct communication with the readers. Listing signals are the second type that mainly used especially number, it is almost half from all data. Repetitions are always used when the writer wants to emphasize the topic that is talked, pronoun references and visualizations are rarely used.
