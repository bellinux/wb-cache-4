50|$|The flying shuttle {{was one of}} the key {{developments}} in the industrialization of weaving during the early Industrial Revolution. It allowed a single weaver to weave much wider fabrics, and it could be mechanized, allowing <b>for</b> <b>automatic</b> machine <b>looms.</b> The flying shuttle was patented by John Kay (1704-c. 1779) in 1733. This greatly speeds up the previous hand process, and it halves the labour force. Where a broad-cloth loom previously required a weaver on each side, it can now be worked by a single operator. Until this point the textile industry has required four spinners to service one weaver. Kay's innovation, in wide use by the 1750s, greatly increases this disparity.|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} between textiles and computer graphics goes {{as far back}} as the early 19 th century, when Joseph Jacquard developed punch cards to store textile patterns <b>for</b> weaving on <b>automatic</b> <b>looms</b> (the first digital image format). Surprisingly little has happened in the textile industry since then (punch cards are still widely used), but through the introduction of affordable computercontrolled looms and knitting machines, it is now becoming possible to weave or knit textiles with an ease approaching that of printing computer graphics on paper. We are using these facilities of modern textile production in conjunction with another development: photochromically treated materials. Companies such as SolarActive (www. solaractiveintl. com) have created threads that change color when subjected to ultraviolet (UV) light (for example, from the rays of the sun or from a special lamp).
