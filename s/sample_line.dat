40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Two <b>sampling</b> <b>lines</b> were {{established}} in the intertidal region at each of three geographically separate sites {{on the coast of}} Oregon.

5000|$|Another sample {{extraction}} {{method used}} in industrial sources and utility sources with low emission rates, is {{commonly referred to}} as the [...] "hot dry" [...] extractive method or [...] "direct" [...] CEMS. The sample is not diluted, but is carried along a heated <b>sample</b> <b>line</b> at high temperature into a sample conditioning unit. The sample is filtered to remove particulate matter and dried, usually with a chiller, to remove moisture. Once conditioned, the sample enters a sampling manifold and is measured using the same methods above. One advantage of this method is the ability to measure % oxygen in the sample, which is often required in the regulatory calculations for emission corrections. Since dilution mixes clean dry air with the sample, dilution systems cannot measure % oxygen.|$|E
50|$|A {{small sample}} of flue gas is extracted, {{by means of a}} pump, into the CEM system via a sample probe. Facilities that combust fossil fuels often use a dilution-extractive probe to dilute the sample with clean, dry air to a ratio {{typically}} between 50:1 to 200:1, but usually 100:1. Dilution is used because pure flue gas can be hot, wet and, with some pollutants, sticky. Once diluted to the appropriate ratio, the sample is transported through a <b>sample</b> <b>line</b> (typically referred to as an umbilical) to a manifold from which individual analyzers may extract a sample. Gas analyzers employ various techniques to accurately measure concentrations. Some commonly used techniques include: infrared and ultraviolet adsorption, chemiluminescence, fluorescence and beta ray absorption. After analysis, the gas exits the analyzer to a common manifold to all analyzers where it is vented out of doors. A Data Acquisition and Handling System (DAHS) receives the signal output from each analyzer in order to collect and record emissions data.|$|E

In certain situations {{it is difficult to}} determine how to classify the variants as alleles of a number of genetic loci, that is, as variant subsets within each of which the Mendelian laws hold. In this article, we develop and analyze a series of algorithms for solving various versions and generalizations of this problem of optimal classification. Electrophoretic {{separation of}} the m variants of a protein having slightly different mobilities on a starch, agarose or acrylamide gel is a basic tool of biochemical population genetics (Hartl, 1980, pp. 72 - 84). Crude tissue extracts from the n individuals in a sample are placed at intervals along a <b>sample</b> <b>line</b> or a series of slots across a rectangular gel. Under the influence of an electric field oriented perpendicular tothe <b>sample</b> <b>line,</b> the components of the extract including the proteins migrate away from this line towards the anode or cathode, depending on their molecular charge.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{real-time}} multicamera people localization method based on <b>line</b> <b>sampling</b> of image foregrounds. For each view, these <b>line</b> <b>samples</b> are originated from the vanishing point of lines {{perpendicular to the}} ground plane. With these <b>line</b> <b>samples,</b> vertical <b>line</b> <b>samples</b> in the 3 -D scene can be reconstructed for potential human locations. After some efficient geometric refinement and filtering procedures, the remaining qualified 3 -D <b>line</b> <b>samples</b> are clustered and integrated for the identification of locations and heights {{of people in the}} scene. Both indoor and outdoor scenarios are examined to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling serious occlusion in crowed scenes. The average localization error of less than 15 cm for average viewing distance of 15 m suggests that our method can be applied to a broad range of surveillance applications that require the real-time computation of localization without using special hardware for acceleration.

40|$|A compact {{microwave}} {{plasma device}} {{that can be}} attached to a stack for near in situ atomic emission spectroscopy, with a real-time span calibration injector for accuracy, is under development for continuous metals monitoring. It uses a commercially available 2. 45 GHz, 1. 5 kW microwave source to generate a plasma in an undiluted, isokinetic sustained in a shorted waveguide, which together with a short <b>sample</b> <b>line</b> is maintained at high temperature (> 150 C) to avoid condensation. Relative to other plasma based CEMs the microwave plasma has a significant advantage to continuously operate reliably in large volumes (- 50 cm 3) of fast flowing (> 14 1 /minute, up to 40 ft/sec) air or undiluted stack exhaust. A pneumatic nebulizer attached to the <b>sample</b> <b>line</b> can momentarily, on command, inject a known trace concentration of metals to provide a real-time span calibration whenever needed. Novel grating spectrometers using low cost detectors {{have been used for}} simultaneous multiple metals monitoring with continuous rapid signal acquisition making possible the observation of discreet particles. Since the particles are observed as plasma induced sources of light, the usual limits on monitoring discreet submicron particles by conventional external light instruments are not encountered. Detection limits for Be, Cr, and Pb of < 3 ug/m 3 have been shown for one minute signal averaging in plasmas with 6 % water content. A one minute detection limit for Hg of < 1 ug. m 3 has been recently achieved in ambient laboratory air plasmas using a dedicated spectrometer. Lower detection limits are possible with longer signal integration time.

40|$|The HALO Submicrometer Aerosol Inlet (HASI) was {{specifically}} designed for HALO with the aim to provide up to 30 l/min sample air flow (divided over four forward facing <b>sample</b> <b>lines)</b> to aerosol instruments mounted inside the aircraft cabin. HASI samples the air {{on the top of}} the fuselage outside of the aircraft boundary layer. The air stream is aligned in the inlet and deaccelerated in three stages by roughly a factor of 40 using a front shroud, a main diffusor and smaller diffusers at the tips of four sample tubes which protrude into the deaccelerated air stream. In addition, there is a backward-facing sample tube installed for optional use. The design concept is to allow regulating the sample air flow in each of the four forward-facing <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> to achieve isokinetic sampling conditions according to the actual speed of the aircraft. Pumps and bypass lines for regulation of the air flow are part of the Aerosol Measurement System (AMETYST) cabin rack on HALO operated by DLR. The geometric design of the inlet should prevent large cloud droplets and ice crystals from entering the <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> directly. Judging from the first measurements of different instruments using HASI during the ML-CIRRUS and ACRIDICON-CHUVA missions with HALO, it appears that condensation particle counter (CPC) measurements of interstitial aerosol in liquid clouds are affected by artefacts while in ice clouds there is no indication of any measurement problem. Selected examples of other measurement results for initial experimental characterization of the inlet will be discussed. In order to achieve better isokinetic sampling, further numerical flow simulations of the final inlet design for different aircraft altitudes and speeds are required to establish a final regulation of the sample air flow in each of the four <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> based on pressure and temperature sensors in the inlet and aircraft data...|$|R

In standard reconstruction methods, specific assumptions concerning {{the distribution of}} the <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> are usually made, e. g. by parallel line geometry.

In this case, one would rather prefer to work with reconstruction methods allowing for arbitrary distributions of scattered <b>sample</b> <b>lines.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel kernel-based algebraic reconstruction method for medical image reconstruction from scattered Radon data. Our reconstruction relies on generalized Hermite-Birkhoff interpolation by positive definite kernel functions in combination with a suitable regularization of the Radon transform.
