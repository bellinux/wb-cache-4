5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or <b>screw</b> <b>machine.</b> In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

[...] The basis for its incorporation was {{the invention of the}} first single-spindle automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine.</b> For its next four years, the new firm occupied one of Weed's buildings, milling thousands of screws daily on over 50 machines. Its president was George Fairfield, who ran Weed, and its superintendent was Christopher Spencer, one of Connecticut's most versatile inventors. Soon Hartford Machine Screw outgrew its quarters and built a new factory adjacent to Weed, where it remained until 1948.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of NC, screw {{machines}} diverged into two classes, mechanical and NC. This distinction continues today with mechanical screw machines and CNC screw machines. However, in shop-floor jargon, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> by itself is still often understood in context to imply a mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine,</b> so the retronym mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is not consistently used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws, that is, {{there would have been no}} established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied, and the term hand <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> or manual <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic screw machines, and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> no longer was used to refer to manual or semi-automatic turret lathes, having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models [...] "screw machines", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called screw machines there were variations, such as single-spindle versus multispindle, horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc.|$|E

5000|$|Small- to {{medium-sized}} cam-operated {{automatic lathes}} were (and still are) usually called <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> or automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> These machines work on parts that (as a rough guide only) are usually less than 80 mm {{in diameter and}} less than 300 mm long. <b>Screw</b> <b>machines</b> almost invariably do bar work, which means that an entire length of bar stock (anywhere from 1 to 4 m in length) passes through the spindle and is gripped by the chuck (which is usually a collet chuck). As the part is being machined, {{the entire length of}} bar stock is turning with the spindle. When the part is done, it is [...] "parted off" [...] from the bar, the chuck un-clamps, the bar is fed forward, and the chuck then closes again, ready for the next cycle. The bar-feeding can happen by various means, including pulling-finger tools that grab the bar and pull or roller bar feed that pushes the bar from behind.|$|R

50|$|The American {{development}} of the turret lathe (1840s) and of automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This cost reduction spurred ever greater use of screws.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of numerical control {{was the next}} major leap {{in the history of}} automatic lathesâ€”and it is also what changed the paradigm of what the [...] "manual versus automatic" [...] distinction even meant. Beginning in the 1950s, NC lathes began to take over the jobs that had been done by manual lathes and cam-op <b>screw</b> <b>machines,</b> although the displacement of the older technology by CNC has been a long, gradual arc that even today is not a total eclipse. By the 1980s, true CNC <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> (as opposed to simpler CNC lathes), Swiss-style and non-Swiss, had begun to make serious inroads into the realm of cam-op <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> Similarly, CNC chuckers were developed, eventually evolving even into CNC rotary transfer machines. Very few people outside of automotive manufacturing are familiar with these machine tools, because they simply have no economic reason to come into contact with this segment of the machine tool industry. Today CNC lathes and their offspring (turn-mills, mill-turns, rotary transfers) are technological wonders with a blizzard of axes and accessories under CNC control. Their sophistication, accuracy and precision, metal-removal speed, tool-changing speed, degree of automation, and degree of networking {{with the rest of the}} enterprise are formidable.|$|R
50|$|From the late-19th through mid-20th centuries, turret lathes, both {{manual and}} {{automatic}} (i.e., <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> and chuckers), {{were one of}} the most important classes of machine tools for mass production. They were used extensively in the mass production for the war effort in World War II.|$|R
50|$|An {{automatic}} chucking {{machine is}} very similar to an automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine,</b> except it handles larger work, which due to its size is more often chucking work and less often bar work. The Fay automatic lathe was a variant that specialized in turning work on centers. While a <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is limited to around 80 mm practice, automatic chuckers are available that can handle up to 300 mm chucks. The chucks are air-operated. Many of these machines are multispindle (more than one main spindle).|$|E

50|$|The name <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is {{somewhat}} of a , because screw machines {{spend much of their}} time making things that are not screws and that in many cases are not even threaded. However, the archetypal use for which screw machines were named was screw-making.|$|E

50|$|Today {{the threads}} of {{threaded}} fasteners (such as <b>machine</b> <b>screws,</b> wood screws, wallboard screws, and sheetmetal screws) {{are usually not}} cut via single-point screw-cutting; instead most are generated by other, faster processes, such as thread forming and rolling and cutting with die heads. The latter processes are the ones employed in modern <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> These machines, although they are lathes specialized for making screws, are not screw-cutting lathes {{in the sense of}} employing single-point screw-cutting.|$|R
