5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of Sonic Heroes that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of Sonic Heroes, Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds. <b>Stunned</b> <b>that</b> Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.|$|E

Roran is <b>stunned</b> <b>that</b> his cousin is a Dragon Rider, and he asks Jeod for help to reach the Varden.

The villagers are chased by a group of Galbatorix's boats, but they force themselves into the gigantic whirpool, the Boar's eye, so that they can trap the enemy ships.|$|E

This army, with 15,099 soldiers included tank and artillery units, encountered civilian protesters along Chang'an Avenue at Wukesong, Gongzhufen, Muxidi, Fuxingmen, Xidan, Liubukou and the Square itself. At about 10:00 pm, the 38th Army opened fire on protesters at the Wukesong intersection on Chang'an Avenue, about 10km west of Square. The crowds were <b>stunned</b> <b>that</b> the army was using live ammunition and reacted by hurling insults and projectiles.

According to Wu Renhua's study, the 38th Army killed more civilian demonstrators than any other unit, despite its reputation {{at the time of}} being friendly to city residents. Fatalities were recorded all along Chang'an Avenue, at Nanlishilu, Fuxingmen, Xidan, Liubukou and Tiananmen.

2500|$|Navarro's only {{album with}} the band was One Hot Minute, {{released}} on September 12, 1995 after many delays and setbacks. Navarro's guitar work had created a stylistic departure in the band's sound, which was now characterized by prominent use of heavy metal guitar riffs and hints of psychedelic rock. The band described the album as a darker, sadder record compared to their previous material, which was not as universally well-received as Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Many of the lyrics written by Kiedis were drug-related, including the lead single, [...] "Warped," [...] which left Kiedis <b>stunned</b> <b>that</b> nobody else in the band picked up on his lyrics that he was using again. Broken relationships and deaths {{of friends and family}} also {{played a major role in}} the album's darker tone and lyrics.

Despite mixed reviews, the album was a commercial success. Selling eight million copies worldwide, it spawned the band's third No.1 single, the ballad [...] "My Friends", and enjoyed chart success with the songs [...] "Warped" [...] and [...] "Aeroplane". This iteration of the band appeared on several soundtracks.
