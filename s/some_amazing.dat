5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking <b>some</b> <b>amazing</b> music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|Gasol's first {{competition}} with the senior Spain national basketball team was the 2001 EuroBasket tournament, after having previously won the 1998 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship and 1999 FIBA Under-19 World Championship with the Spanish junior teams. Being considered, against his own will, {{the leader of the}} team, Gasol ended up with the bronze medal in the competition. Gasol has since had much success with the Spanish team, winning the 2006 FIBA World Championship and the 2009 and 2011 EuroBasket tournaments, being chosen as the Most Valuable Player in the first two; he also won silver medals at the 2003 and 2007 EuroBasket, and the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games. Gasol was also the highest-scoring player of the 2004 Summer Olympics, and Spain's flag bearer at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics, replacing the injured Rafael Nadal. In 2014, Gasol was named to the All-tournament team of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. In the 2015 EuroBasket, Gasol was named the MVP of the competition, after <b>some</b> <b>amazing</b> performances, averaging 25.6 points and 8.8 rebounds per game (he was the competition leader for points per game, and 4th in rebounds per game). During the knockout matches of the competition, Gasol inspired the Spanish side which was missing many of its stars like Ricky Rubio, Juan Carlos Navarro, Álex Abrines, and his brother Marc Gasol. Gasol scored 40 points in the semifinal against France, which was half of his team's points. The 35-year-old player was also named the competition's leader for blocked shots per game (2.3). On September 7, 2017, in a game against Hungary, Gasol became FIBA Eurobasket's all-time leading scorer, passing Tony Parker with 1,033 points.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are so excited to finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been lucky enough to have <b>some</b> <b>amazing</b> support shows... but to be able to go out and play songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E

25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn <b>some</b> <b>amazing</b> things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

[...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made <b>some</b> <b>amazing</b> runs around the box and he showed he is a team player.

500|$|Many reviewers {{perceived}} an anti-American {{message in}} the film, equating RDA's private security force to American soldiers. Commentator Glenn Beck on his radio show said that Avatar was [...] "an anti‑U.S. human thing". Russell D. Moore in The Christian Post stated that, [...] "If {{you can get a}} theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got <b>some</b> <b>amazing</b> special effects" [...] and criticized Cameron for what he saw as an unnuanced depiction of the American military as [...] "pure evil". John Podhoretz of The Weekly Standard argued that Avatar revealed [...] "hatred of the military and American institutions and the notion that to be human is just way uncool." [...] One review called Avatar the [...] "liberal tell" [...] of [...] "a thinly disguised, heavy-handed and simplistic sci-fi fantasy/allegory critical of America from our founding straight through to the Iraq War." [...] Charles Mudede of The Stranger commented that with the release of the film [...] "the American culture industry exports an anti-American spectacle to an anti-American world."

I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put <b>some</b> <b>amazing</b> stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story.

[...] Some commentators sympathetic to anarcho-primitivism have even praised the film as a manifesto for their cause.

Ross Douthat of The New York Times opined that the film is [...] "Cameron's long apologia for pantheism... Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now", while Saritha Prabhu of The Tennessean called the film a [...] "misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general", and Maxim Osipov of The Hindustan Times, on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the Bhagavad Gita. Annalee Newitz of io9 concluded that Avatar is another film that has the recurring [...] "fantasy about race" [...] whereby [...] "some white guy" [...] becomes the [...] "most awesome" [...] member of a non-white culture. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Avatar [...] "the season's ideological Rorschach blot", while Miranda Devine of The Sydney Morning Herald thought that [...] "It [...] impossible to watch Avatar without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer."
