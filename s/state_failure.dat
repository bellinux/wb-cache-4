The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by <b>state</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Fall of the Western Roman Empire (also called Fall of the Roman Empire or Fall of Rome) was {{the process}} of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule, and its vast {{territory}} was divided into several successor polities. The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control; modern historians mention factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, {{the strength of the}} economy, the competence of the Emperor, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration. Increasing pressure from barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse. The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on <b>state</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{due to the}} {{protracted}} lack of a permanent central authority, Somalia began to be characterized as a [...] "failed state". Political scientist Ken Menkhaus argues that evidence suggested that the nation had already attained failed state status by the mid-1980s, while Robert I. Rotberg similarly posits that the <b>state</b> <b>failure</b> had preceded the ouster of the Barre administration.

The two most influential of scholars of counter-insurgency have been Westerners whose job it had been to fight insurgents (often colonized people).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between <b>state</b> <b>failures</b> and <b>state</b> legitimacy in Italy. The study {{is based on a}} one-year ethnographic field research in Varese City. The political party Northern League and its followers (Leghisti) has been chosen to observe the state-society relationships. It has been discovered that among others, three factors were instrumental in the process by which the state-society relationships has been deteriorated so as to open the path for an alternative legitimacy claim such as Padanian nationalism. Initially, revelations of political corruption and illegal <b>state</b> practices, <b>failure</b> of the <b>state</b> to address problems related to globalization such as global economic integration and uncontrolled immigration were instrumental. Later, struggle of hegemony and subjugation between the League and the state has been another important cause for deteriorated relationships. This study also provides qualitative data on the processes by which those deteriorated relationships and <b>state</b> <b>failures</b> contributed the rise of xenophobia and suggests that this <b>failures</b> of the <b>state</b> coupled with the problems brought about by the uncontrolled immigration and global economic expansion is likely to open a path for criminalization of both immigrants and local people...|$|R
