25|$|Mirtazapine is {{considered}} to be relatively safe {{in the event of an}} overdose, although it {{is considered}} slightly more toxic in overdose than most of the SSRIs (except citalopram). Unlike the TCAs, mirtazapine <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> cardiovascular adverse effects at 7 to 22 times the maximum recommended dose. Case reports of overdose with as much as 30 to 50 times the standard dose described the drug as relatively nontoxic, compared to TCAs.|$|E

This resulted in one of the variants eventually achieving higher fitness, becoming dominant, and in a brief interval of rapid evolution, rapidly sweeping through the population and eliminating most other variants.|$|E

25|$|In {{multiple}} studies, neuroticism {{has been}} shown to have an equal, if not larger, impact on happiness and subjective well-being than extraversion. One study classified school children into four categories based on their scores in assessments of extraversion and emotional stability (neuroticism). The results <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> difference between the happiness levels of stable introverts and stable extraverts, while unstable extraverts and introverts both demonstrated significantly less happiness than their counterparts. In this study, neuroticism appeared to be the more salient factor for overall well-being.|$|E

Georgia protested against installment of barbwire fences by the Russian military along the South Ossetian demarcation line. In November, Georgia initialed an association agreement with the European Union and won praise from NATO for reforms.|$|E

25|$|In {{low-risk}} pregnancies, {{the association}} between cigarette smoking and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and reproducible across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology {{increases the risk of}} preeclampsia {{to such a degree that}} any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is masked. However, the damaging effects of smoking on overall health and pregnancy outcomes outweighs the benefits in decreasing the incidence of preeclampsia. It is recommended that smoking be stopped prior to, during and after pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|After being ingested, ethanol {{is first}} {{converted}} to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase {{and then to}} acetic acid by oxidation and egestion process. These reactions also convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to its reduced form NADH in a redox reaction. By causing an imbalance of the NAD+/NADH redox system, alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions more difficult. Consequences of the alcohol induced redox changes {{in the human body}} include increased triglyceride production, increased amino acid catabolism, inhibition of the citric acid cycle, lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, hyperuricemia, disturbance in cortisol and androgen metabolism and increased fibrogenesis. The metabolism of glucose and insulin are also influenced. However, recent studies <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> correlation between hangover severity and the concentrations of various hormones, electrolytes, free fatty acids, triglycerides, lactate, ketone bodies, cortisol, and glucose in blood and urine samples.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Terry-McElarth {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study in}} the American Journal of Preventative Medicine on regular soda policies and their effect on school beverage availability and student consumption. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the effectiveness of a program beginning in the 2014–2015 school year that requires schools participating in federally reimbursable meal programs to remove all competitive venues (a la carte cafeteria sales, vending machines, and stores/snack bars/carts), on the availability of unhealthy beverages at schools and student consumption. The study analyzed state- and school district-level policies mandating soda bans and found that state bans were associated with significantly lower school soda availability but district bans <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> associations. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between state policies and student consumption. Among student populations, state policy was directly associated with significantly lower school soda availability and indirectly associated with lower student consumption. The same was not observed for other student populations.|$|E

500|$|The {{theory was}} {{advanced}} {{in part because}} of lack of archeological evidence for large-scale Celtic immigration, though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Some proponents of this theory hold that it is likely that there was migration of smaller groups of Celts to Ireland, with sufficiently regular traffic to constitute a [...] "migration stream," [...] but that this was not the fundamental cause of Insular Celticisation. Historical linguists are sceptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of the Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processional view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'. Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> differences in mitochondrial DNA between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account a recent study drew the conclusion that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European [...] "Atlantic Celts" [...] showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{has found}} that {{drinking}} {{reduces the risk of}} developing gallstones. Compared with alcohol abstainers, the relative risk of gallstone disease, controlling for age, sex, education, smoking, and body mass index, is 0.83 for occasional and regular moderate drinkers (< 25 ml of ethanol per day), 0.67 for intermediate drinkers (25-50 ml per day), and 0.58 for heavy drinkers. This inverse association was consistent across strata of age, sex, and body mass index." [...] Frequency of drinking also appears to be a factor. [...] "An increase in frequency of alcohol consumption also was related to decreased risk. Combining the reports of quantity and frequency of alcohol intake, a consumption pattern that reflected frequent intake (5-7 days/week) of any given amount of alcohol was associated with a decreased risk, as compared with nondrinkers. In contrast, infrequent alcohol intake (1-2 days/week) <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> association with risk." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{potential}} problem with sustainability standards is that projects {{will be more}} costly and projects will become cost prohibitive. [...] While units that are built will be higher efficiency, the {{number of available units}} could decrease because of costs. A 2009 study prepared by Davis Langdon examines the effect of green standards on the costs of affordable housing projects in Seattle and Portland. This study compared “standard housing projects” (i.e. projects with no explicit sustainability goals) and projects attempting to achieve Built Green or LEED certification. The study includes both public and private affordable housing projects. At the time of the study, both cities had high sustainability standards for public projects, and Washington has only increased that standard since then. Construction cost analysis (in terms of cost per square foot) <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> difference between standard projects and green-rated projects.
