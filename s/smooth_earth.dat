But a word {{distinguished}} here and there, and accompanying actions, made transparent the meaning of their presence and argument. The big man refused to ride any farther. Evidently he had come so far without realizing it. His importunities were for [...] "more head of stock." [...] His scorn was for a [...] "measly little bunch not worth the risk." [...] His anger was for Belllounds's foolhardiness in [...] "leavin' a trail." [...] Belllounds had little to say, and most of that was spoken in a tone too low to be heard. His manner seemed indifferent, even reckless. But he wanted [...] "money." [...] The scar-faced man's name was [...] "Smith." [...] Then Columbine gathered from Smith's dogged and forceful gestures, and his words, [...] "no money" [...] and [...] "bigger bunch," [...] that he was unwilling to pay what had been agreed upon unless Belllounds promised to bring {{a larger number of}} cattle. Here Belllounds roundly cursed the rustler, and apparently argued that course [...] "next to impossible." [...] Smith made a sweeping movement with his arm, pointing south, indicating some place afar, and part of his speech was [...] "Gore Peak." [...] The little man, companion of Smith, got into the argument, and, dismounting from his horse, he made marks upon the <b>smooth</b> <b>earth</b> of the trail. He was drawing a rude map showing direction and locality. At length, when Belllounds nodded as if convinced or now informed, this third member of the party remounted, and seemed to have no more to say. Belllounds pondered sullenly. He snatched a switch from off a bough overhead and flicked his boot and stirrup with it, an action that made his horse restive. Smith leered and spoke derisively, of which speech Columbine heard, [...] "Aw hell!" [...] and [...] "yellow streak," [...] and [...] "no one'd ever," [...] and [...] "son of Bill Belllounds," [...] and [...] "rustlin' stock." [...] Then this scar-faced man drew out a buckskin bag. Either the contempt or the gold, or both, overbalanced vacillation in the weak mind of Jack Belllounds, for he lifted his head, showing his face pale and malignant, and without trace of shame or compunction he snatched the bag of gold, shouted a hoarse, [...] "All right, damn you!"

40|$|Abstract Long-period global-scale {{electromagnetic}} induction studies of deep Earth conductivity are based {{almost exclusively on}} magnetovariational methods and require accurate models of external source spatial structure. We describe approaches to inverting for both the external sources and three-dimensional (3 -D) conductivity variations and apply these methods to long-period (T≥ 1. 2 days) geomagnetic observatory data. Our scheme involves three steps: (1) Observatory data from 60 years (only partly overlapping and with many large gaps) are reduced and merged into dominant spatial modes using a scheme based on frequency domain principal components. (2) Resulting modes are inverted for corresponding external source spatial structure, using a simplified conductivity model with radial variations overlain by a two-dimensional thin sheet. The source inversion is regularized using a physically based source covariance, generated through superposition of correlated tilted zonal (quasi-dipole) current loops, representing ionospheric source complexity <b>smoothed</b> by <b>Earth</b> rotation. Free parameters in the source covariance model are tuned by a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies have {{analyzed}} seismic rotational data using a relationship between transverse acceleration and rotation rate derived for a homogeneous full space. In this study we explore this relationship further theoretically by presenting a full ray theory (FRT) method to simulate rotational motions of fundamental mode seismic surface waves in <b>smooth,</b> laterally heterogeneous <b>Earth</b> models. In the ray picture of wave propagation the vertical component of the rotational rate motion of fundamental mode Love waves is obtained by dividing the transverse component of ground acceleration by the Love-wave local phase velocity beneath the seismic recording station. We illustrate the method with examples of theoretical calculations of T ˜ 40 sec rotational rate ground motions of fundamental Love waves using the crust model CRUST 2. 0 combined with the mantle model S 20 RTS for the 25 September 2003 M 8. 1 Tokachi-oki earthquake, Japan.

The Love and Rayleigh wave displacement fields are written in the form uL = k i 'W(-? X V I) x L and U, = U?xR + k i l V V I X R; the quantities U, V and W are the local radial eigenfunctions, kL and k, are the local Love and Rayleigh wavenumbers, and xL and xR are surface wave potentials that vary rapidly {{on the surface of}} the unit sphere. The natural normalization condition for the local radial eigenfunctions is cC 1, = 1, where c is the local phase velocity, C is the local group velocity and 1, is the local radial kinetic energy integral; with this normalization, the Love and Rayleigh wave potentials satisfy the spherical Helmholtz equations v:xL + k i X L = 0 and v:xR + k&R = 0. Standing wave eigenfunctions xL and X, can be determined either by solving a truncated matrix eigenvalue problem or by using the EBK semi-classical method; the results incorporate multiplet coupling along a single dispersion branch but ignore cross-branch coupling.

50|$|Building B or the Pyramid of the Painted Skulls was {{centered}} {{in a spot}} a few meters from La Conejera. Later expansions of this pyramid eventually covered La Conejera and the Edificio Rojo built over it. The Pyramid of the Painted Skulls was built between 200 and 350 AD, consisting of seven stepped levels with an adobe nucleus. It was finished with adobe and rock, and <b>smoothed</b> with <b>earth</b> mixed with lime to create a painting surface. The architecture is significant because of its talud-tablero structure, and its mural-decorated walls. This structure was constructed in two phases. The first created a rectangular platform 113 meters by 107 meters. On top {{of this is a}} two story structure, eighteen meters high with stairs on the west. This structure is made of adobe bricks, which stone and clay used in the areas with stairs. Marquina determined that this structure had an east-west orientation, similar to the Pyramid of the Sun, coinciding with the Teotihuacan civilization, and later ceramic studies placed it with Teotihuacan II. Only the murals of the upper two stories of this pyramid have been studied, on the taluds and tableros of the north side as well as those on the northeast corner. The talud has traces of black and the two meter tableros consist of a frieze measuring 46 cm wide with a double frame or border that juts out from the frieze. This is characteristic of Cholula architecture. These tableros usually have one color as the base, but with stripes of other colors on top, such as yellow, red and blue. The north side is completely free of paint on the left side, but on the right, there are pockets of color remaining. The highest story contains nine skulls painted on it, which the lower one had seven. These skulls were initially thought to be the heads of grasshoppers facing forward, but later studies determined that they depict highly stylized human skulls. These skulls look forward and are painted yellow and red over a black background. Above the skulls are decorative markers that look like arrows, which indicate the direction of the scene. Those on the left side point east, and those on the right point west. To the sides are stylized wings in red, green and ochre.|$|R
5000|$|To {{establish}} a universally accepted {{foundation for the}} definition of the metre, more accurate measurements of this meridian were needed. The French Academy of Sciences commissioned an expedition led by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre Méchain, lasting from 1792 to 1799, which attempted to accurately measure the distance between a belfry in Dunkerque and Montjuïc castle in Barcelona to estimate the length of the meridian arc through Dunkerque. This portion of the meridian, assumed to be the same length as the Paris meridian, was to {{serve as the basis for}} the length of the half meridian connecting the North Pole with the Equator. The problem with this approach is that the exact shape of the Earth is not a simple mathematical shape, such as a sphere or oblate spheroid, at the level of precision required for defining a standard of length. The irregular and particular shape of the <b>Earth</b> <b>smoothed</b> to sea level is represented by a mathematical model called a geoid, which literally means [...] "Earth-shaped". Despite these issues, in 1793 France adopted this definition of the metre as its official unit of length based on provisional results from this expedition. However, it was later determined that the first prototype metre bar was short by about 200 micrometres because of miscalculation of the flattening of the Earth, making the prototype about 0.02% shorter than the original proposed definition of the metre. Regardless, this length became the French standard and was progressively adopted by other countries in Europe.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Global Earthing System (GES), with {{reference}} to MV distribution systems, was introduced by the CENELEC Harmonization Document HD 637 S 1 (published in 1999) and, later, by the International Standards EN 50522 and IEC EN 61936 - 1 (published in 2010 - 2011). It is defined as: "an equivalent earthing system created by the interconnection of local earthing systems that ensures, by {{the proximity of the}} earthing systems, that there are no dangerous touch voltages". The identification and official classification of GES areas would lead to a simplification of the design and verification procedures of MV/LV substations grounding systems, with associated economical savings for both Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and MV users. However, no practical guidelines are provided by the Standards. Although many works in literature have tried to solve this issue, until now, none of the available methodologies has been massively adopted by the Italian DSOs. In fact, in Italy, just few cases of GES are certified. This happens mostly because the identification methods that are actually available lack in rigorous scientific strength or are money and time consuming. This thesis is based on the work conducted in the Meterglob Project. A pool of 6 partners (Enel Distribuzione S. p. A., Istituto Italiano del Marchio di Qualità IMQ, La Sapienza Università di Roma, Politecnico di Torino, Politecnico di Bari, Università di Palermo) has studied the phenomena linked to GESs. The goal of the project consists in providing a set of guidelines for GES identification. The main aim of this thesis is to contribute in this research field. In this thesis, first, definitions regarding earthing and the conditions to be satisfied for the design of safe MV/LV substation earthing systems (ESs) with regard to touch voltages are shown. Moreover, the maintainability procedures that ensure a safety usage of the electrical installations are introduced. Then, the GES definition is discussed in depth. Some of the main concepts related to GES (e. g., interconnection, proximity and quasi-equipotentiality), which are only cited in the Standards, are instead here fully formalized. The methods available in literature to identify a GES are described and tested in a real urban MV network. Moreover, the main phenomena resulting from the presence of a GES are presented; according to the GES definition, the close interconnection of the grounding systems {{to each other and to}} utility installations (water/gas pipelines, railway tracks, etc.) sets up an overall low resistance grounding system and has mainly two effects: a distribution of the fault current between grounding electrodes (of the faulty substation and of the neighboring ones) and MV cables sheaths; a <b>smoothing</b> of the <b>earth</b> surface potential profile, reducing the hazardous voltage gradients. With reference to the first effect, a dedicated simulation tool is presented. A parametric analysis is carried out in order to evaluate which of the influence factors are the most significant. The setup of field measurements and their results are reported: a real single line to ground fault was produced in a MV network and the currents flowing into the ES and MV cable shields of 5 consecutive substations were measured. Both the field measurements and the model results suggest that the current injected in the faulted MV/LV substation is just a small portion of the fault current. A large part flows back in the feeding cable's shields. According to the simulation results, the main factors that influence the fault current distribution (and therefore the reduction factor, defined as the ratio between the current to earth and the total fault current) are the presence of bare buried conductors, the presence of LV neutral conductors, the per unit length resistance of the cables sheaths and the number of interconnected MV/LV substations. The effect of bare buried conductors...|$|R
