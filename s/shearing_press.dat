40|$|Measurement of texture is {{a useful}} quality control test for mushrooms. Results of these studies suggest that texture {{differences}} in mushrooms may be divided into primary and secondary differences. the former refer to differences caused largely by variation in the dry matter content of mushrooms, the latter to differences caused by variation {{in the nature of}} the dry matter content. The <b>shear</b> <b>press</b> was used for measuring mushroom texture. Shearing mushrooms previously sliced with a household egg slicer gave more accurate results than shearing whole individual mushrooms. the relative precision of the shearing operation was the same for different weights of sample but increasing slice size had a slight positive effect on the <b>shear</b> <b>press</b> reading.

40|$|The <b>shear</b> <b>press</b> is an {{instrument}} for measuring food texture (Kramer, Burkhardt &Rogers, 1951). The original model was introduced in 1950 and it was later modified for electrical indicating and recording (Decker et al., 1957). A new more versatile and precise model was introduced in 1956 (Kramer & Twigg, 1958). In this instrument force is measured by a maximum-reading dial gauge fitted across the vertical diameter of a proving ring. If time-force texture graphs are required, a transducer can be fitted across the ring {{in place of the}} dial gauge to give a print-out on a strip chart as the sample is tested.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of sex, strain and hormone treatment on cooked yields and meat quality of chicken roasters. The two strains were the Hubbard White Mountain and the Penobscot. The three treatments were the injection of estradiol- 17 beta monopalmitate, the feeding of dienestrol diacetate, and the control birds which did not receive any hormones. Cooking yields were significantly higher for male roasters than for female roasters. Taste panel scores for breast meat showed a significant difference in flavor and odor between the meat from the two sexes, that of the male chickens obtained higher scores. Panel scores for the thigh samples were higher for flavor of Penobscot birds than Hubbard White Mountain. Texture of thigh meat was preferred to that of breast meat. No other differences were detected in flavor, odor and texture. Shear values obtained from a Kramer <b>Shear</b> <b>press</b> showed highly {{significant differences between the two}} types of meat.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 To {{study the}} {{association}} between Fusarium root-rot resistance (Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli) and economically inportant characteristics of beans, 2259 lines each consisting of 30 plants were used. The lines were randomly selected for root-rot reaction, but were selected for differences in vigor and differences in plant and seed pigments, growth habit, and toughness. The lines were established from crosses of resistant and susceptible parents after which self-fertilization for 4 - 6 generations was practiced. Measurements and classifications with respect to pigmentation, vigor and growth habits were made on plants grown {{in the field and}} the greenhouse. Toughness of pods was evaluated by means of a <b>shear</b> <b>press</b> or by subjective estimates. Replicated tests of these lines with artificially produced inocula of the Fusarium organism were made in the greenhouse and in the field, thus under different environmental conditions. Uninoculated plants of each of the lines were also grown in order to evaluate the lines simultaneously for the horticultural characters. The relationships between resistance and plant characteristics were determined by correlation analysis among the traits. Though correlation coefficients were small or non-significant in many cases, some associations were indicated: 1, Indeterminate growth was associated with low root-rot infection. 2. Late flowering was related to high susceptibility of beans grown in the field. 3. Late maturity was associated with high score for root-rot of field grown beans 4.

Samples were collected for compositional analysis; the remainder was weighed, formed in a Hollymatic patty maker, individually wrapped in Cry-O-Vac D- 601 polyolefin film, heat sealed, and frozen at — 20 ° C. Composition of raw patties varied with increasing FTVP. Protein was slightly increased; however, fat and ash contents were significantly changed by FTVP additions. Every two weeks, a patty from each treatment was tested for fat oxidation. After six months storage, patties were cooked by microwave or pan frying from the frozen state or after thawing. The cooked products were tested in a <b>shear</b> <b>press</b> and judged for flavor and tenderness.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 A quality {{problem that}} {{frequently}} occurs with frozen green beans is the sloughing {{of the skin}} (epidermal tissues) of the cooked, ready-to- serve bean pods. It was found that by giving the beans a pre-blanch (relatively mild heat treatment) prior to the blanch treatment normally used for frozen green beans, on cooking, sloughing was markedly reduced, and furthermore, the bean pods were firmer. As an additional heat treatment was involved, over and above what is now used for commercial packs of frozen green beans, it was of interest to know {{the extent to which}} the color of the beans was affected. Also of interest was the effect of storage at 0 °F for four months on the color of the beans. The color changes in the dual and single blanched green beans were evaluated by two methods: (1) a physical analysis of the light reflected from the beans (Hunter Color and Color Difference Meter) and, (2) a physical analysis of the light absorbing properties of the pigments extracted from the beans and subsequent calculation of the per cent conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytin. Texture (firmness), as indicated by resistance to shear, was measured by a modified Kramer <b>Shear</b> <b>Press.</b> A mechanical device was used to determine the amount of sloughing of the skins of the bean pods. After a statistical analysis of the data collected in the experiment, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. The firmness of the cooked, dual and single blanched, frozen green beans, as measured by the <b>shear</b> <b>press,</b> was found to be highly significantly negatively correlated with sloughing of the skins. 2. There was no change in lightness or darkness of the color of single or dual blanched beans over storage at 0 °F for four months. The Hunter "-a [subscript L]/b [subscript L]" index of color noted a significant change in hue from green towards yellow of the single and dual blanched beans. The conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytin was not significant over storage. 3. The color of those beans receiving the 200 °F - 150 second final blanch (single blanch) was the same as the color of those beans receiving the 210 °F - 105 second final blanch (single blanch). 4. As the time and temperature of the pre-blanch increased, there was a corresponding increase in the amount of chlorophyll converted to pheophytin, and a change in the visual color of the beans from green towards yellow. The effect of variations of time of preblanch was much greater on the color of the dual blanched beans than the effect of variations of temperature of pre-blanch. 5. As the time and temperature of the pre-blanch increased, the texture (firmness) of the cooked dual blanched beans increased. The 200 °F - 150 second final blanch resulted in beans that were firmer than beans receiving the 210 °F - 105 second final blanch, 6. A pre-blanch at 170 °F for 30 seconds followed by a final blanch at 200 °F for 150 seconds was found to result in beans that were similar in color, yet firmer in texture (less sloughing of the skins) than the single blanched beans...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to {{determine the influence of}} initial pH of pickling solutions, total acidity, pickling time, types of vinegar used, addition of salt and sugar, and two starting temperatures of solutions on the flavor and tenderness of pickled egg whites. Tenderness was evaluated by a taste panel and also by an Alio Kramer <b>Shear</b> <b>Press.</b> The pH of each solution was determined before hard cooked eggs were placed in it and again after 3 weeks of pickling. The pH of the egg whites was determined after pickling. The pH of solutions did not influence flavor or tenderness of pickled egg whites. Total acidity of solutions starting at room temperature and at boiling temperature did not significantly influence flavor, but tenderness, as evaluated by the taste panel, was significantly increased by pickling in boiling solutions. Egg white pickled in boiling solutions had lower shear values than did whites pickled in solutions at room temperature. This suggests that the two methods of measuring egg white tenderness were not positively correlated. When shear force values of eggs pickled in solutions at room temperature and in boiling solutions were combined, there was a highly significant differ-ence in tenderness in solutions containing different levels of acid. The pH of all solutions increased during the 3 -week pickling time. Egg whites tended to approach the pH of the solutions during the pickling operation. Tenderness was less in red wine vinegar than it was in either apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar solutions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Carrots were cooked to {{the just}} tender {{stage in a}} {{saucepan}} and in a pressure saucepan for appropriate lengths of time to make them approximately equal in tenderness as determined {{by a panel of}} judges and the Kramer <b>Shear</b> <b>Press.</b> A third lot of carrots was cooked in a pressure saucepan for approximately twice as long to represent overcooked carrots. Judges and the Hunter Color Meter indicated that the carrots cooked in the saucepan were more typically red-orange and bright and the carrots overcooked in the pressure saucepan were more yellow and dull. Pigments extracted from the carrots from the three cooking treatments were chromatographed on a magnesia column and the principle fractions, α-carotene and β-carotene, eluted. The β-carotene was rechromatographed on an alumina column to separate it into all-trans-β-carotene and neo-β-carotene B. In absolute amounts, carrots cooked in the saucepan had the highest concentration of all-trans-β-carotene and the highest total of all-trans-β-carotene, neo-β-carotene B and α-carotene, followed by those carrots cooked in the pressure saucepan for 50 seconds, with those cooked in the pressure saucepan for two minutes being lowest in both all-trans-β-carotene and total carotenes. However, when the a-carotene, the neo-pcarotene B and the all-trans-β-carotene were considered as percentages of the total, the percentage of α-carotene remained constant in the three treatments. Carrots cooked in the pressure saucepan for two minutes had a lower percentage of all-trans-β-carotene and a higher percentage of neo-β-carotene B than did carrots from the other two treatments. Thus, longer cooking in the pressure saucepan caused greater conversion of the more vivid all-trans-β-carotene to the paler cis-isomer, neo-β-carotene B. This isomerization plus loss of total pigment accounts for the differences in color of the cooked carrots from the three treatments...|$|R
50|$|Hendrick Manufacturing Company {{purchased}} California Perforating Screen Company in 1966 {{and moved}} the operation into a larger facility. This larger plant could accommodate additional throat presses and supporting equipment such as <b>shears,</b> straightening rolls, <b>press</b> brakes and bending rolls. Three new, multi-punch, all-across presses were added to product custom perforated sheets that were being purchased at the time from Hendrick's Carbondale plant. Under Hendrick ownership, Cal-Perf grew from an office manager and four plant operators {{to a total of}} 23 employees.|$|R

Shipfitters also use heavy machinery, such as plate planners, <b>shears,</b> punches, drill <b>presses,</b> bending rolls, bending slabs, plate bevelers, saws, presses up to 750 tons, angle rolls (vertical and horizontal), dogs and wedges. Shipfitters are responsible for hydro and air testing of tanks and compartments, as well as perform grinding, drilling and fit-up operations on submarines and surface crafts.|$|R
50|$|Dante and Virgil's next {{circle is}} {{the ring of}} hell {{to men and women}} who wasted their lives in pursuit of {{material}} possessions. The condemned souls are tortured by being <b>sheared</b> in money <b>presses,</b> boiled in melted gold and buried in enormous mounds of heavy gold coins. Within this circle, Dante confronts his father, having been promised a thousand years free of torture and endless gold if he would murder his own son. The pair battle fiercely, but Dante gains the upperhand, kicking his father into a vat of boiling gold.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Biomass {{material}} such as rice straw, banana {{leaves and}} teak leaves (Tectona grandis) are densified {{by means of}} wet briquetting process at lower pressures of 200 - 1000 kPa using a piston <b>press.</b> <b>Shear</b> strength, durability, impact resistance and calorific values are determined. Optimum densities {{for each type of}} briquette for good quality and their corresponding die pressures were determined. Shear strength and durability increases with the applied die pressure while impact resistance is not influenced by increasing die pressure.
