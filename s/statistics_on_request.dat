40|$|TRIPS (TALON Reporting and Information Processing System) is an {{interactive}} software system for generating reports to NLM on regional medical library network activity and constitutes {{a vital part}} of a network management information system (NEMIS) for the South Central Regional Medical Library Program. Implemented on a PDP-lOfSRU 1108 interfaced system, TRIPS accepts paper tape input describing network transactions and generates output <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> disposition of <b>requests,</b> elapsed time for completing filled requests, time to clear unfilled requests, arrival time distribution of requests by day of month, and various other measures of activity andjor performance. Emphasized in the TRIPS design are flexibility, extensibility, and system integrity. Processing costs, neglecting preparation of input which may be accomplished in several ways, are estimated at $. 05 per transaction, a transaction being the transmittal of a message from one library to another...|$|R

Generally users can share common interests in electronic interests in electronic content. As MANET {{become more and}} more crucial to everyday functioning of the people. This paper discusses cooperative caching technique for minimizing price in MANET. Caching frequently accessed data items on the client side is an effective technique for improving performance in a mobile environment. The effectiveness of the caching depends on the replacement strategy the relative value of different objects. Such type of strategy is to predict next request time. This caching strategy utilizing <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> resource inter <b>request</b> times. Such statistics can be collected either locally (i. e., content providers) or at server (i. e., communication service providers). This paper shows that the caching techniques in the presence of selfish users that deviate from network wide cost optimal policies. Major works in this paper caching technique focused primarily on reduce latency by avoiding slow links between client and CSP...|$|R

40|$|In 1968, the US Congress {{enacted a}} {{detailed}} list of requirements for transparency reporting of wiretaps but with subsequent surveillance statutes with minimal reporting requirements and rapidly evolving Internet technologies, {{the gap in}} surveillance transparency grew. The Snowden disclosures in 2013 provided a peek into the surveillance landscape and {{the central role of}} ICT companies in fostering it. While attempting to salvage their tarnished reputations and encourage public discussion, several companies began to see an incentive in publishing 'transparency reports', providing <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> user data <b>requested</b> by the government. Since then, publishing these reports has become a norm in the industry but the reports provide little benefit in bridging the transparency gap. The varying formats, definitions and levels of granularity in the reports and the absence of a governance framework in the industry, prevent the reports from becoming useful tools for stakeholders wishing to inform policy decisions. In addition, new technologies, modern surveillance techniques, and evolving business models have created a set of transparency requirements that is markedly different from the initial set of requirements established under the US Wiretap Act. This thesis identifies the missing elements in the current transparency reports while providing a detailed list of necessary features. In addition, it uncovers the incentives that can be leveraged using available tools to encourage better reporting practices and suggests technical, legal and policy solutions so that transparency reporting may become a useful public policy tool rather than a ritualistic practice. by Amn RahmanThesis: S.
