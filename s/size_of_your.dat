That {{was the most important}} thing… 'Spaz' is [...] old school, hip hop feeling with some drum and bass. It becomes a big, tall monster. It's almost like this big gorilla looking down at you. If he smacks you, he kills you. His fingers are the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> body. That's kinda what we're doing. We're facing this big monster of, of what we know is out there, of what we see, that big monster of energy.|$|E

50|$|Grading is a {{necessary}} step that must be taken before approaching sample manufacturers or factories, because they require card sets <b>of</b> <b>your</b> specific patterns and an order of garments to be produced. Grading determines how your garments will fit in all sizes. Having a variety <b>of</b> <b>sizes</b> for each <b>of</b> <b>your</b> garments fills out your minimum garment order cost effectively. Grading will not create shape, but will only increase or decrease <b>size</b> <b>of</b> original shape.|$|R
50|$|Buoyancy aids {{come with}} a set of {{specifications}} detailing their sizing, weight range, and the standards they adhere to. This is often in a table printed onto the inside of the buoyancy aid, or a label on the bag/box. Most companies give the specifications for each of their models on all of their buoyancy aids, to simplify the manufacturing process, so it is important to check the model and <b>size</b> range <b>of</b> <b>your</b> particular buoyancy aid.|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{launching}} the bill, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that [...] "by making constituencies more equal in <b>size,</b> the value <b>of</b> <b>your</b> vote {{will no longer}} depend on where you live, and with fewer MPs the cost of politics will be cut."

6000|$|The two {{inspectors}} {{bent over}} the table and examined the plans, asking a question of Mr. Brook now and then.

"Your {{statements}} are most remarkable," [...] said the voice, on concluding its questioning, [...] "but you are evidently speaking the truth, {{and it is}} equally evident {{that you are not}} of Barsoom.

60|$|At last {{he got to}} the bottom. But, behold, it was not the bottom-- {{as people}} usually find when they are coming down a mountain.

50|$|These steps {{may need}} to be tweaked to align with the <b>size</b> or goals <b>of</b> <b>your</b> organization. CUs can be {{outsourced}} to a consulting firm or planned and implemented in house. It is a growing trend for organizations to partner with traditional universities. A traditional university brings organization, structure, and faculty. Universities are often interested in CU opportunities because of the economic gain. There are a number of consulting firms that will help you to set up you Corporate University, but that can become very expensive. This process can also take a long time, sometimes up to a two years. Forming a cross functional team of business stakeholders can be used to launch the corporate university.|$|R

60|$|His entire shamelessness {{was really}} super-human. Not the vestige of a blush varied the sallow monotony of his complexion; the smile wreathed his curly lips as pleasantly as ever his party-colored eyes twinkled at Magdalen with the self-enjoying frankness of a {{naturally}} harmless man. Had his wife heard him? Magdalen {{looked over his}} shoulder to {{the corner of the room}} in which she was sitting behind him. No the self-taught student of cookery was absorbed in her subject. She had advanced her imaginary omelette to the critical stage at which the butter was to be thrown in--that vaguely-measured morsel of butter, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> thumb. Mrs. Wragge sat lost in contemplation of one of her own thumbs, and shook her head over it, as if it failed to satisfy her.|$|E

6000|$|In fine, Wilhelmina's Wedding was magnificent; {{though one}} had rubs too; and Mamma was rather severe.

Crown-royal they had put (as indeed was proper) on one's head: hair was in twenty-four locks the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> arm: such was the Queen's order. Gown was of cloth-of-silver, trimmed with Spanish gold-lace (AVEC UN POINT D'ESPAGNE D'OR); train twelve yards long;--one was like to sink to the earth in such equipment." [...] Courage, my Princess!--In fact, the Wedding went beautifully off; with dances and sublimities, slow solemn Torch-dance to {{conclude}} with, in those unparalleled upper rooms; Grand-Aunt Meiningen and many other stars and rainbows witnessing; even the Margravine of Schwedt, in her high colors, was compelled to be there. Such variegated splendor, such a dancing of the Constellations; sublunary Berlin, and all the world, on tiptoe round it! Slow Torchdance, winding it up, melted into the shades of midnight, for this time; and there was silence in Berlin.|$|E

He stuck his fork into a piece of mutton as big--oh! I'm afraid to say how big; it really seemed to me the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> hand, and he piled quite a little mound of green peas on it, with a great mass of broken fragments and gravy, and put it all into his mouth at once, though that mouth was already pretty well-filled with the larger half of an enormous potato. I thought he would never get it in, but something you said caused him {{to laugh at the}} time, and before the laugh was over the bite had disappeared.

60|$|We were in {{distress}} for a moment, {{but only a}} moment. It was the fore-and-aft gear that was broken--the thing that leads aft from the forward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the wagon. In America {{this would have been}} a heavy leathern strap; but, all over the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> little finger--clothes-line is what it is. Cabs use it, private carriages, freight-carts and wagons, all sorts of vehicles have it. In Munich I afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fifty-four half-barrels of beer; I had before noticed that the cabs in Heidelberg used it--not new rope, but rope that had been in use since Abraham's time --and I had felt nervous, sometimes, behind it when the cab was tearing down a hill. But I had long been accustomed to it now, and had even become afraid of the leather strap which belonged in its place. Our driver got a fresh piece of clothes-line out of his locker and repaired the break in two minutes.|$|E

Thus, some day Phil will come into possession of land which will place him in a good position, and I am prepared to add to it considerably. Sir James Holford still gambles away his possessions; and I have explained, to his notary, my willingness to extend my purchases at any time, should he desire to sell. I should at once commence the building of a comfortable mansion, but it is scarce worth while to do so; for it is probable that, before many years, Sir James may be driven to part with his Hall, as well as his land. In the meantime I am ready to provide Philip with an income which will enable him to take his place with credit among our kinsfolk, and to raise a company of some fifty men to follow him in the field, should Conde and the Huguenots again be driven to struggle against the Guises.|$|E

Simply grab the next size die and take your chances.Breezing is the last method, where the character is overqualified for the job at hand and wants to outperform.
