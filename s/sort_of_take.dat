India [...] "an {{example of}} a film that's been made {{within the framework of}} Bollywood and yet it is a very different film.

India four out of five stars stating that [...] "while the tale of the sporting underdog is hardly new, Jaideep Sahni's screenplay offers a rare look at a popular Indian sport often overshadowed by cricket." [...] Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film gave a fresh look to the conventional underdog sports film, comparing its premise to the U.S. victory in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup.
