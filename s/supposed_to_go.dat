5|$|In 1966, Whitney and Thayer {{attempted}} to organize {{what would have}} been New York's first joint operating agreement (JOA) with the Hearst-owned New York Journal American and the Scripps-owned New York World-Telegram and Sun. Under the proposed agreement, the Herald Tribune would have continued publication as the morning partner and the Journal-American and World-Telegram would merge as the World Journal, an afternoon paper. All three would publish a Sunday edition called the World Journal Tribune. The newspapers would have maintained their own editorial voices (all three of which tended to be conservative). On paper, the JOA, which would have taken effect April 25, 1966, would have led to profits of $4 million to $5 million annually, but would have also led to the loss of 1,764 out of 4,598 employees at the papers. The Newspaper Guild, concerned about the possible job losses, said the new newspaper would have to negotiate a new contract with the union; the publishers refused. The day the JOA was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into effect, the Guild struck the newly merged newspaper (the Times continued to publish).|$|E

However, popular pressure against it led then-MG Governor Itamar Franco {{to issue a}} decree prohibiting radioactive waste from coming into the state. Faced with this restriction, the residues remained in São Paulo.|$|E

25|$|One {{preparation}} {{that was}} made for any future events was the alert system, Sistema de Alerta Sísmica (SAS), which sends early-warning messages electronically from sensors along the coastal subduction zone in Guerrero. It was expanded to a similar area {{on the coast of}} Oaxaca. An alarm is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> off in Mexico City (similar to an air-raid siren) when an earthquake of 6.0 or higher is detected. However, it does not always work.|$|E
25|$|Hans Ras {{was born}} in 1926 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, as the third son {{of a family of}} four children. His father had a {{wholesale}} business in confectionery, and all the children had to help in the business. They were all <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to junior high school for their secondary education, as was usual at the time. However, when the eldest was expelled from such a school for precociousness and sent to a higher-grade high school, the others followed in his footsteps.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{survivors}} of the fire, Maureen Krekian, discussed her ordeal in 2007. She was 11 {{at the time of the}} fire, and lived on the same road where the circus was held. On the day of the event, she was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the circus with a woman next door and her daughter. When she went to their house, she found that they had already left without her. She decided to go to the circus on her own, where she seated herself in the bleachers.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{improvement}} of De Witt's personal relations with the Prince and his mother came to nought when she suddenly died (24 December 1660), like her late husband also of smallpox. She appointed her brother Charles as William's guardian in her will. This gave the King of England formal stature to interfere in his nephew's education, and in Dutch affairs of state. At the same time, the negotiations about the treaty were not going well. Not only did Charles refuse to retract the Navigation Acts, but he even re-issued them in his own name. A further protectionist measure was the bill before the Cavalier Parliament to restrict fishing in a zone of ten miles from the English coast (though in those days territorial waters were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> no further than three miles). This the Dutch would not recognize.|$|E
25|$|In the 1975 World Championship cycle Korchnoi and Karpov, {{the newest}} star of Soviet chess, tied for {{first in the}} 1973 Leningrad Interzonal. In the 1974 Candidates' matches, Korchnoi first {{defeated}} the young Brazilian star GM Henrique Costa Mecking (who had won the other Interzonal in Petrópolis), by (+3−1=9) at Augusta, Georgia, in what he later described in his autobiography as a tough match. Korchnoi next played Petrosian again, at Odessa. The two were not on friendly terms, and it was even rumored that the two resorted to kicking each other under the table during this match; however, Korchnoi denies this. According to him, Petrosian just kicked his legs nervously and shook the table. Although the match was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to {{the first player to}} win four games, Petrosian resigned the match after just five games, with Korchnoi enjoying a lead of 3–1, with one draw.|$|E
25|$|The {{country is}} divided into {{multiple}} zones, called circles (roughly along state boundaries). Government and several private players run local and long distance telephone services. Competition has caused prices to drop and calls across India {{are one of the}} cheapest in the world. The rates are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down further with new measures to be taken by the Information Ministry. Call drop fine: Telcos warn of raising tariff. In September 2004, the number of mobile phone connections crossed the number of fixed-line connections and presently dwarfs the wireline segment by a ratio of around 20:1. The mobile subscriber base has grown by a factor of over a hundred and thirty, from 5 million subscribers in 2001 to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012. India primarily follows the GSM mobile system, in the 900MHz band. Recent operators also operate in the 1800MHz band. The dominant players are Airtel, Reliance Infocomm, Vodafone, Idea cellular and BSNL/MTNL. There are many smaller players, with operations in only a few states. International roaming agreements exist between most operators and many foreign carriers. The government allowed Mobile number portability (MNP) which enables mobile telephone users to retain their mobile telephone numbers when changing from one mobile network operator to another.|$|E

Haywald praised the visuals as well, but stated that [...] "as the scenery grows more cluttered, it also sometimes becomes {{difficult to find a}} safe place to land after sending the world spinning". Haywald rated And Yet It Moves a B+. NintendoLife rated the WiiWare version 9 out of 10, stating that the new additions and updated controls made it the [...] "definitive version of the game" [...] despite the omission of online features seen in the PC version.|$|E
500|$|The game {{takes place}} in the {{aftermath}} of the Calamity, a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the city of Caelondia (...) as well as the surrounding areas of the game's world into many floating pieces, disrupting its ecology and reducing most of its people to ash. Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via [...] "skyways" [...] that propel him through the air.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why.

500|$|Before {{talking with}} his brother, Max wrote a song {{entitled}} [...] "Inflikted," [...] inspired by Sepultura's visit in 1992 to Indonesia where {{they saw a}} [...] "crazy ritual".

[...] Max stated that [...] "Inflikted" [...] was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> towards Soulfly's sixth studio album Conquer, {{but he wanted to}} do the song with Igor. For legal reasons, they could not use Inflikted as the band name. According to Max, [...] "A lot of people had used it before, so he {{had to come up with}} something else." [...] When trying to find a name, he [...] "blurted out" [...] Cavalera Conspiracy, and Igor liked it. Max added, [...] "I think I like it better than Inflikted.

500|$|When {{the city}} first {{determined}} that a new pavilion should be built, the commission was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. The original pavilion design was much more modest than the structure that was eventually built, with a smaller shell structure and speakers affixed to poles interspersed throughout the seating area. However, two factors led to the cancellation of the original plans. First, the project's scope changed {{as a result of}} additional funds raised by John H. Bryan, former CEO of the Sara Lee Corporation. The second factor was the intervention of the Pritzker family as potential donors. Unimpressed with the pavilion's original design, Cindy Pritzker [...] "mandated that Frank Gehry be involved in its re-design". Jay Pritzker, a prominent Chicago businessman, had died in January 1999; his family own several businesses, including Hyatt Hotels. Jay and Cindy Pritzker had founded the Pritzker Prize in architecture in 1979, and the Pritzker family's Hyatt Foundation continues to award it annually. Architect Frank Gehry had received the Pritzker Prize in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Saunders {{was among}} {{a party of}} men {{evacuated}} from Crete by a British submarine in May 1942, and returned to Australia in October. He rejoined his old unit, the 2/7th Battalion, which had re-formed in Palestine and been brought back to Australia {{along with the rest}} of the 6th Division to help defend against the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. In November 1942, Saunders' younger brother Harry, who had enlisted shortly after him in 1940, was killed in action while serving in New Guinea with the 2/14th Battalion. When Harry had joined up, Reg recalled, [...] "I was angry because I was the only one that was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go....</b> with two of us there, one of us was going to get killed..." [...] The elder Saunders subsequently served in New Guinea as well, fighting in the Salamaua–Lae campaign in mid-1943 where, having again been promoted temporary sergeant, he took over command of a platoon when its commander was wounded in action. For his leadership, he was recommended for a commission by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn. When Guinn told him of his plan, Saunders laughed and said, [...] "I don't want to be an officer... I'd rather be Regimental Sergeant Major". Guinn responded, [...] "Christ, they don't make boys RSMs".|$|E
