2500|$|About {{one hour}} after the Andaste {{departed}} Grand Haven, a stiff wind sprang up. [...] Gale warnings were posted, but {{too late for the}} Andaste to see or hear them, as the vessel had no radio. [...] The storm continued to develop, producing winds of 60 miles per hour by 1 a.m. the morning of Tuesday, September 10. [...] The wind force was so great that the captain and first officer of another vessel out in Lake Michigan, the SS Alabama, testified to the Andaste inquiry as to its force and fury. In this gale the Andaste disappeared and was never seen again. Although the vessel had been due in Chicago on the morning of Tuesday, the 10th, the Andaste did not make harbor at the Calumet River or in any other port. [...] Searches for the lost vessel on September 11 found nothing. [...] Further search efforts on September 12 uncovered a large quantity of wreckage. [...] A [...] "vast floating field of wreckage" [...] was seen that afternoon southwest of Holland, a Lake Michigan port downbound from the Andaste's Grand Haven departure point. [...] The wreckage included a cabin door and hatch <b>strongbacks</b> that were identified by former Andaste seamen as having come from the lost vessel.|$|E

The <b>strongback</b> structure supports the {{electrical power system}} for SSF. To achieve minimum launch mass, {{it is essential that}} flight structures are designed as light as possible. A nonlinear structural analysis was conducted to determine the collapse load of the structure and the associated factor of safety against the service loads. A modeling technique is provided for simulating the load conditions and the buckling and post buckling (collapse) load is evaluated of the IEA <b>Strongback</b> structure, using the finite element computer code MARC. Two of four <b>strongback</b> panels were modeled and analyzed. The effects were examined of the following factors on the global behavior of the <b>strongback</b> panels: (1) load simplification and simulation; (2) type of support boundary conditions; and (3) the possibility of weight reduction of the original structure.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to assess the effects of joist spacing, <b>strongbacks</b> and ceiling on the dynamic response of timber floors with metal web joists so as to evaluate the vibrational design criteria, for example, modal frequencies, modal shapes, damping and unit point load deflection, required by Eurocode 5 - 1 - 1 and the UK National Annex for timber floors. In general, joist spacing, <b>strongbacks</b> and ceiling do not greatly influence the fundamental frequency and damping ratio, but affect higher modal frequencies. The measured damping ratio for the fundamental mode is 0 · 86 % on average. The use of <b>strongbacks</b> considerably reduces the number of first-order modes below 40 Hz, and provides easier fulfilment of the velocity design criterion. The test results indicate that the decrease in joist spacing, the increase in number, size and stiffness of <b>strongbacks,</b> and the use of a ceiling all greatly reduce the maximumdisplacement of the floors. On average, the calculated displacements based on the equations in the UK National Annex are close to those measured...|$|E
40|$|Vibrations {{associated}} with lightweight floor systems, as a serviceability criterion, {{are not well}} addressed in current residential construction practice. Cold-formed steel floor systems are usually lighter and have less inherent damping. If designers {{are going to use}} the current span deflection criteria when designing residential floor systems, it is imperative to find the construction and design details that will limit these annoying vibrations in cold-formed steel floor systems. Presented in this seminar are the results from a recent laboratory study and field study on the vibration characteristics of cold-formed steel floors performed at the University of Waterloo. Several full-scale floor systems with varying construction and design details were constructed and tested, and several in situ floor systems were tested. The objectives of this research were: to evaluate the dynamic response of residential floor systems supported by cold-formed steel joists; to investigate the influence of span length, joist types, subfloor materials, toppings, ceilings, <b>strongbacks,</b> live loads and framing conditions on the vibration characteristics of cold-formed steel floor systems; to identify the critical construction details that will limit annoying floor vibrations; to compare the vibration characteristics of in situ floor systems and laboratory constructed floor systems; and to evaluate the vibration performance of laboratory and in situ floor systems based on current acceptability criteria...|$|E
40|$|The use of cold-formed steel as a {{framework}} for floor systems in multi-story buildings and single occupancy residences is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to traditional materials and techniques. Builders and designers have recognized that the high strength-to-weight ratio provided by the cross-section of cold-formed steel members permits lighter structures and longer spans. The longer spans and lighter structures associated with cold-formed steel floor systems can result in vibration serviceability issues if proper design considerations are not made. Providing sufficient damping within the structure is {{the most effective way to}} ensure that occupants are comfortable under typical residential and office service loads. The modern, open-concept interior has open floor plans with few partitions and long spans, which result in inherently low structural damping. Cold-formed steel floor systems also have less mass than traditional floor systems, which will increase the amplitude of acceleration response. The vibration problems that may be present in cold-formed steel floor systems, like any other floor system, can be addressed if proper consideration is given by designers. Traditional design approaches for vibration serviceability have proven inadequate, and there are no current methods available to designers for calculating the response of cold-formed steel floor systems. In order to design a floor system to properly address occupant comfort, consideration must be given for the type of dynamic loading, resonance, dynamic response, and stiffness of the floor system. The objective of this thesis is to improve the understanding of the dynamic characteristics of cold-formed steel floor systems, and recommend an adequate model for predicting the dynamic response and modal properties of floor systems, in order to aid the design process. This thesis presents the results of an extensive laboratory and field study on the vibration of cold-formed steel floor systems. Floor systems built with cold-formed steel TreadyReady® joists and subfloor assemblies containing OSB, FORTACRETE®, sound reduction board, cold-formed steel deck, and LEVELROCK® topping were examined. Previous research has presented the observed influence of construction details on the modal properties of the laboratory floor systems tested. This thesis discusses the influence of different details on the transverse stiffness of the floor systems. It was found that effectively restrained <b>strongbacks,</b> and cold-formed steel deck subfloor assemblies provided significant increases in transverse stiffness. Based on the analysis of the field testing data, recommended design damping ratios are provided for floor systems constructed with the materials investigated in this study. Floor response that can be compared to serviceability criteria is presented. The peak RMS acceleration from walking excitation was found to be within the acceptable range for the ISO criterion based on residential occupancy, and the static deflection from a 1 kN point load was found to be within the acceptable range of Onysko’s criterion. An adequate design criterion for vibration requires a limiting value, and a means of estimating floor response for comparison. The AISC, ATC, and Smith, Chui, and Hu Orthotropic Plate design methods were evaluated by comparing predicted frequency against measured frequency for the test floors. The ATC and Smith, Chui, and Hu Orthotropic Plate methods were evaluated by comparing predicted deflection against measured deflection for the test floors. The ATC method is recommended as the best method for calculating floor response based on current publications. A design procedure is recommended for cold-formed steel floor systems, using the ATC design guide. The ATC acceleration criterion for walking excitation must be met for floors with fundamental frequencies of less than 15 Hz, and the ATC static deflection criterion must be met for all floors. Proposed modifications to the ATC method to improve the design of cold-formed steel floors include: adopting the recommended design damping ratios from this thesis; adopting the frequency-weighted ISO limiting acceleration and, obtaining several coefficients and empirical expressions that are relevant to cold-formed steel floors from further testing. Recommendations for improving the floor testing procedures at the University of Waterloo are given...|$|E

It {{is unable to}} carry the astronaut/passenger tunnel without a structural modification. The purpose of this design {{is to create a}} removalbe modification that will allow the IPPLA to lift and carry the passenger tunnel. Modifications evaluated were full-length insert beams which would extend through the existing <b>strongback</b> arms. These beam proposals were eliminated because of high cost and weight. Other proposals evaluated were attachments of cantilever beams to the existing <b>strongback</b> areas. The cantilever proposals reduced cost and weight compared to the full-length modifications. A third method evaluated was to simply make modifications {{to one side of the}} IPPLA therefore reducing the materials of the cantilever proposals by 40 percent. The design of the modification selected was completed with two channel beams jointly welded to a centered steel plate. The extension arm modification is inserted into the existing <b>strongback</b> channel beams and bolted into place. Two extension arms are added to one side of the IPPLA to provide the extra length needed to accommodate the passenger tunnel.
