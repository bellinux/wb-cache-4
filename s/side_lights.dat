25|$|From 1858 whilst in transit, cutters were {{required}} by law to display white <b>side</b> <b>lights,</b> but often on the outbound leg these were turned off so as to give a traditional westerly advantage over the competition. Once on station— a situation that could last for a few weeks— the boats {{were required}} to display a pilot flag, which in 1849 became the white over red flag still in use today. At night, paraffin (kerosene in U.S. English) flares were required to be fired, with each port having its own sequence; Bristol's was two shorts and a long.|$|E
25|$|The Old Courthouse {{interior}} {{is composed of}} quadrants which are set apart by broad hallways which meet at the building's center. There they form a large, open three story rotunda. The rotunda is the dominating feature of the interior. It rises over 100 {{feet into the air}} and at the top features an allegorical painting representing peace and prosperity. The halls have mosaic floors and wall treatment composed of white marble dado which is capped with antique verde serpentine stone. Marbleized plaster, scagliola, panels complete the walls. The building's ceilings are decorated with plaster cornices and molded leaf and rosette compliments. The Honduras mahogany doors have a rail and panel design and beveled glass is used for decorative <b>side</b> <b>lights</b> and panels.|$|E
25|$|Parabolic Aluminized Reflector lights, or PAR lights, or PAR cans, {{are used}} when a {{substantial}} amount of flat lighting is required for a scene. A PAR can is a sealed beam PAR lamp housed in a simple can-like unit. Like an old-fashioned automotive headlight, the reflector is integral to the lamp and the beam spread of the unit is not adjustable except by changing the lamp. PAR lamps are widely used in architectural lighting and may often be found at hardware stores. PAR lights have seen heavy use in rock and roll shows, especially those with smaller budgets, due to their low cost, light weight, easy maintenance, high durability, and high output. They are often used in combination with smoke or haze machines which make the path of the beam visible. They are also often used as top, back, or <b>side</b> <b>lights</b> in the theatre and for special effects.|$|E

25|$|In March 1869 James Hall, {{master of}} the steamer Herald, appeared, on summons, charged with a breach of the Steam Navigation Act, by taking in tow the barque Mary Miller without exhibiting two {{masthead}} lights. A considerable amount of evidence was adduced for the prosecution, {{but none of the}} witnesses could swear positively that the tug had only one masthead light after she had made fast, but the majority stated that when she came alongside they saw only one. Henry Hall, engineer of the Herald, deposed that ongoing alongside the barque the Herald had the usual steamers' lights up, but before getting underway the captain gave orders to hoist the additional masthead light. William Murdon, coxswain of the Herald, deposed that on making fast to the barque for the purpose of towing her he put up two masthead lights and the usual <b>side</b> <b>lights.</b> Charles Williams stated that he was on board the steamer Fire King on the occasion of a collision with the barque Mary Miller; he noticed a steamer alongside the barque, and the steamer had two mast headlights and a red light, and the barque had a green one. The case was dismissed.|$|E
500|$|The lower storey of the façade was {{dominated}} by a large, rounded-arched doorway in the centre. The unmoulded arch rested on wide piers, each broken by a narrow window, above which ran a simple cornice. Dance placed a transom across the doorway {{at the level of}} the cornice bearing the inscription [...] "Shakespeare Gallery". Below the transom were the main entry doors, with glazed panels and <b>side</b> <b>lights</b> matching the flanking windows. A radial fanlight filled the lunette above the transom. In each of the spandrels to the left and right of the arch, Dance set a carving of a lyre inside a ribboned wreath. Above all this ran a panelled band course dividing the lower storey from the upper.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1997 the FTO model {{range was}} given a {{facelift}} with a new front bumper arrangement, usually referred to by FTO enthusiasts as [...] "facelift" [...] models. The original two air intakes became one large single intake, blended into a full width forward-facing front splitter. The two supplementary fog and indicator paired units became four separate circular lights, each recessed into the new bumper. The headlamp internals were also changed to incorporate the vehicle's <b>side</b> <b>lights,</b> but their external design remained. An HID Option was also made available.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Mark IV was {{introduced}} to the market at the International Motor Show at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham in 1978. The main update was that construction was now all steel, frontal design was completely different from the past 14 years. The headlights were now rectangular and mounted above each other with <b>side</b> <b>lights</b> and indicators in the same cluster. The grill was not so prominent and various options were available as a package. So now the range consisted of Supreme IV, Supreme IV Express and Supreme IV GT. The GT option ushered in a distinctive grill design with a smart dual chrome flash, tinted windows and better sound system and soft trim to the ceiling to name a few [...] "standard" [...] extras.|$|E
