5|$|She and Tony meet up {{with her}} Israeli friend, Adam Eshel (Damon Dayoub), who gives them {{information}} on Bodnar's whereabouts and intentions. Bodnar contacts Ziva on the computer, urging her to walk away. They are able to track his location but are unable to apprehend him as he disappears into a crowd. Later, they learn that he is planning {{to pick up the}} diamonds from an ally (Willem Van Der Vegt) at a night club. While waiting to intercept him, Tony dances with Ziva both to help her get a better view of the area and to calm her agitated state of mind. Bodnar seems to appear, but when Ziva approaches him, she is stunned to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Ilan's brother, Yaniv (Iddo Goldberg).|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{issue number}} 2 above one can {{consider}} so-called weave states. Ordinary measurements of geometric quantities are macroscopic, and planckian discreteness is smoothed out. The fabric of a T-shirt is analogous. At a distance it is a smooth curved two-dimensional surface. But a closer inspection we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> actually composed {{of thousands of}} one-dimensional linked threads. The image of space given in LQG is similar, consider a very large spin network formed by {{a very large number}} of nodes and links, each of Planck scale. But probed at a macroscopic scale, it appears as a three-dimensional continuous metric geometry.|$|E

25|$|Bobby, who {{has been}} {{divorced}} from Pam {{for over a year}} and is now engaged to Jenna Wade, decides that he wants to remarry his ex-wife instead, and Pam agrees. The next morning, as Bobby is leaving Pam's house, someone drives a car at high speed toward Pam. Bobby shoves her out of the way just before she is hit but cannot {{get out of the way}} of the car in time to save himself. We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Katherine who was driving the car, and that she was also killed when her car crashed after running over Bobby. Bobby is rushed to the hospital, where he later dies. Pam, Jenna, J.R., Miss Ellie, Clayton, Ray and Donna were the people present at the time of Bobby's death.|$|E
25|$|The Yamato {{arrives at}} Iskandar, but is {{met by a}} large Gamilas fleet that sends a {{spacecraft}} to obstruct the muzzle of the Wave Motion Cannon. With their main weapon disabled, Kodai makes the dangerous choice to conduct a random warp and ends up at {{the opposite side of}} Iskandar. They are surprised to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> lifeless, and in fact strongly resembles Earth in its presently irradiated state. It is then discovered that Gamilas and Iskandar are the same planet. The crew thinks it is a trap, but Kodai urges them to go ahead. He leads an attack party to the planet's surface against heavy Gamilas opposition. Much of the assault force is killed, and the remaining pilots stay behind to cover for Kodai, Sanada, Saito and Mori as they head for the coordinates.|$|E

You can’t approach them. It {{is one of those things}} where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1979 movie The Amityville Horror {{was filmed}} in Toms River, rather than Amityville on Long Island. Local police and {{ambulance}} workers played extras.

2500|$|On May 8, 2006, Moussaoui filed {{papers with}} the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia {{requesting}} to withdraw his guilty plea, stating that his earlier claim {{of participation in the}} September 11 plot was a [...] "complete fabrication." [...] He said that he was [...] "extremely surprised" [...] that he was not sentenced to death. [...] "I now <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that I can receive a fair trial even with Americans as jurors," [...] he said. However, federal sentencing rules forbid pleas to be withdrawn after a sentence has already been executed, and Moussaoui had already waived his rights to appeal.|$|E

It is late evening on a Saturday, and Rita is {{alone at the}} diner. She hears a clatter {{in the kitchen and}} goes to investigate. She is shocked to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Angelo. He is no longer the mild, sweet man she knew. He paws her, and brandishes his handgun. She looks upon him both with affection and fear. Angelo reveals what he has planned to do: using his gun, he forces Rita up to Dino and Lana's apartment where he holds her as a hostage in wait for Lana and Luca's return.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the edicts of Ashoka, {{however, the}} {{majority}} of the inscriptions from this early period in Sri Lanka are found above caves, are only a few words in length and [...] "rarely say anything more than the name of the donor (who paid for the renovation of the cave, presumably); sometimes the donor's profession and village-of-origin are added, and sometimes the reader may be unable to guess if they are looking at the name of a person, profession or village, but can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a name in any case (and not a philosophical statement)." [...] The language of Sri Lanka Brahmi inscriptions has been mostly been Prakrit though some Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have also been found, such as the Annaicoddai seal.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes, when I read spiritual treatises {{in which}} {{perfection}} is shown {{with a thousand}} obstacles, surrounded by a crowd of illusions, my poor little mind quickly tires. I close the learned book which is breaking my head and drying up my heart, and I take up Holy Scripture. Then all seems luminous to me; a single word uncovers for my soul infinite horizons; perfection seems simple; I <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> enough to recognize one's nothingness and to abandon oneself, like a child, into God's arms. [...] Leaving to great souls, to great minds, the beautiful books I cannot understand, I rejoice to be little because only children, {{and those who are}} like them, will be admitted to the heavenly banquet.|$|E

2500|$|Huxley {{was among}} the friends {{rallying}} round the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and was sharpening his [...] "beak and claws" [...] to disembowel [...] "the curs who will bark and yelp". Charles Kingsley was sent a review copy, and told Darwin that he had [...] "long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated animals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species." [...] Darwin was delighted that this [...] "celebrated author and divine" [...] had [...] "gradually learnt to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused {{by the action of}} His laws." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turkish prime {{minister}} Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said, [...] "Turkey {{is not a}} country that can be flattered and then fooled," [...] before going on to conclude that, [...] "Turkish-Armenian relations will be normalised, historical matters will be enlightened and the road will be paved for peace if countries {{that have nothing to}} do with the issue stop getting involved."

2500|$|The {{importance}} of the seal {{as a means of}} authentication necessitated that when authority passed into new hands the old seal should be destroyed and a new one made. When the pope dies it is the first duty of the Cardinal Camerlengo to obtain possession of the Ring of the Fisherman, the papal signet, and to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> broken up. A similar practice prevailed in the Middle Ages and it is often alluded to by historians, as it {{seems to have been a}} matter of some ceremony. For example, on the death of Robert of Holy Island, Bishop of Durham, in 1283, the chronicler Robert Greystones reports: [...] "After his burial, his seal was publicly broken up in the presence of all by Master Robert Avenel." [...] Matthew Paris gives a similar description of the breaking of the seal of William of Trumpington, Abbot of St Albans, in 1235.|$|E
