5|$|The first World War I {{air raid}} on London, Operation Turkenkreuz, {{took place on}} 13 June 1917, when 20 Gotha G.IV bombers {{attacked}} the capital. The raid struck a number of sites including Liverpool Street. Seven tons of explosives were dropped on the station, killing 162 people and injuring 432. Three bombs hit the station, of which two exploded, having fallen through the train <b>shed</b> <b>roof,</b> near to two trains, causing multiple fatalities. It was the deadliest single raid on Britain during the war.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for redevelopment, {{the remains of}} the train <b>shed</b> <b>roof</b> had been demolished in 1958, and Barry's hotel (which had been used as offices since 1931) soon followed in 1960. The architect selected to design the new building was John Poulson who was good friends with Graham Tunbridge, a British Rail surveyor whom he had met during the war. Poulson took advantage of this friendship to win contracts for the redevelopment of various British Rail termini. He paid Tunbridge a weekly income of £25 and received in return building contracts, including the rebuilding of Waterloo and East Croydon stations. At his trial in 1974, Poulson admitted that, shortly before receiving the Cannon Street building contract, he had given Tunbridge a cheque for £200 and a suit worth £80. Poulson was later found guilty of corruption charges and was given a seven-year concurrent sentence; Tunbridge received a 15-month suspended sentence and £4,000 fine {{for his role in the}} affair.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry {{recommended}} the western (1875) train <b>shed</b> <b>roof</b> should be retained in new development; consequently it was repaired and reinforced between 1982 and 1984, followed by repairs {{to the main}} roof completed in 1987. Initial plans included the widening of the stations' exit by two tracks to make eight, with 22 platforms in a layout {{similar to that of}} Waterloo station; the combined Broad Street and Liverpool Street station was to be {{at the level of the}} latter, with relatively low-rise office developments. Poor use of land value caused the development to be reassessed in 1983/4, when it was decided to retain the existing six-road exit throat and 18-platform layout, in combination with resignalling; this resulted in a station confined to the Liverpool Street site, with ground space released for development. In 1985 British Railways signed an agreement with developers Rosehaugh Stanhope and work on the office development, known as Broadgate, began.|$|E

25|$|The next oldest {{buildings}} are the barn, the bunkhouse, the smaller {{of the wooden}} sheds, and the storage building (commissary), {{all of which were}} constructed circa 1910. The barn is the largest building in the district, measuring 60 feet long by 35 feet wide. Two stories tall, the walls are covered with board-and-batt siding, and has a corrugated metal roof of medium pitch. It has two single-story additions. The northern addition is 60 feet long with a <b>shed</b> <b>roof,</b> while the eastern addition runs the length of the original structure, widening the footprint of the barn by 15 feet. It has a lean-to structure. The entire barn complex is enclosed by a corral, which has a split rail fence approximately 5 feet high. Also within the corral is a 15 by 15 foot granary. Built circa 1940, it is constructed with the same materials as the barn, and has a <b>shed</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
25|$|The listed train <b>shed</b> <b>roof</b> {{which is}} 105 metres wide between {{platforms}} 1 and 12, has four spans, two spans 185 metres in length over {{the eastern part}} of the station date from the 1860s while the other two at the western side measuring 150 metres long were built in the early 1880s. The roof is supported by masonry walls with round-headed windows alongside platforms 1 and 12 and rows of cast iron columns. The roof spans have wrought iron trusses with cast iron struts on girders between the columns. The original roof was covered with slates with some glazing. The slates were subsequently replaced with boarded felt. Between 1997 and 1999 the roof was refurbished and 10,000 panes of toughened glass 'float' above the wrought iron trusses.|$|E

His various appointments involved him {{in the design of}} Victoria station in London, Sheffield Victoria station, St Enoch station in Glasgow, Liverpool Central station and Manchester Central station.

500|$|Starting {{with an open}} bowl-like {{design and}} one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an {{original}} capacity of around 100,000. The early 1930s saw {{the construction of a}} terrace on {{the southern part of the}} ground with a roof that covered around one fifth of the stand. It eventually became known as the [...] "Shed End", the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, but the fact that the roof looked like a corrugated iron <b>shed</b> <b>roof</b> played a part.|$|E
500|$|The setting {{represents}} the Mass– the angels are clothed in Eucharistic vestments, with {{those on the}} far right dressed in a deacon's cope. None wear the celebrant's chasuble, suggesting Christ is the priest. The <b>shed</b> <b>roof</b> is a ciborium over an altar. A later addition to the painting, added perhaps in the 17th century, and since removed, was a gold paten on which the infant lay, clearly showing Jesus as the Eucharistic host. Mary, Joseph and the angels are the first to worship the infant Christ and the shed [...] "becomes the altar of the first mass". Upton explains that when viewed {{in the context of the}} first mass the iconography is more clearly defined.|$|E

Like the front façade, the rear façade is five bays wide; access to the double porch is through a door in the central bay on both levels. The other four bays have nine-over-six double-hung wooden sash windows on the first story and six-over-six double-hung wooden sash windows on the second story. The northwestern and southeastern sides of the house have one small square window at attic level, between each pair of inside chimneys.|$|E

500|$|The {{line and}} station {{came in for}} {{criticism}} in the Beeching Report of 1963, whose recommendations resulted in the closing of many branch lines and stations across the country. Though Broad Street itself was not specifically listed for closure, it was earmarked as [...] "stopping passenger services to be modified". The station was gradually run down {{and the level of}} service was steadily reduced. In 1967, the major part of the train <b>shed</b> <b>roof</b> was removed, having become unsafe, whilst goods services were withdrawn on 27 January 1969. Four of the nine platforms were taken out of use in the same year. On 6 November 1976, peak hour services to the Eastern Region via the Canonbury Spur were withdrawn {{with the opening of the}} Northern City Line, and an additional platform was disconnected. The station was by then very dilapidated, with vegetation growing between disused platforms, and most of the old goods area was used as a car park.|$|E
500|$|At Innisfail, Winifred damaged 190houses, downed {{electrical}} wires, overturned trees, and flooded lowlands, {{with reports}} of over [...] in rainfall. Innisfail Hospital, meanwhile, suffered {{the loss of}} several windows, inciting the evacuation of patients to the first floor. The cyclone drove a small vessel ashore at nearby Banana Island; in addition, a teenage girl was severely impaled by a flying slab of iron in downtown Innisfail, later dying {{as a result of}} her injuries. Meanwhile, at Malanda, a man was knocked off a <b>shed</b> <b>roof</b> by a strong gust and was subsequently declared dead. Winds leveled dozens of structures at Mission Beach, Tully, Silkwood, Kurrimine Beach, Cardwell, El Arish, South Johnstone, and Mourilyan. At Mourilyan, 12boats sank in the town harbor, and all structures were damaged to some extent, with 20houses roofless and one flattened. At Tully, the capacity of the Kareeya Hydro Power Station was slightly reduced after rubbish became stuck in its components, and at Ingham, the Herbert River peaked at a height of , overflowing its barriers by [...] Cyclone Winifred inundated the main street of Ingham with flood waters, completely obstructed numerous north-to-south streets, flooded stores, and cut off electricity from Avergowie College. A 35-year-old man was discovered dead down a storm water drain, having drowned in the storm's flood waters. Debris and flooding also impeded and obstructed of parts of the Bruce, Gillies, and Palmerston highways.|$|E

5000|$|The {{motivation}} for building flounder houses is debated.
