40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{is made to}} draw out an outline of present social evils {{generated}} from Caste-Discrimination and this system is the misinterpreted conception of Varynavyavastha where the four varnas are divided {{on the basis of}} division of labour and since history it converted to caste system. With these Human Rights issues are directly related and human rights are an important concept in civilized and democratic society. But from the part of Government and judiciary the above said both are separated and cannot be treated equally and it can be see in the latest examples of inhuman acts with Dalits in Haryana. First this paper also highlights the schemes and policies of the government to eliminate this system and their failure in part of unavailability to <b>socially</b> <b>deprived</b> <b>persons.</b> These policies are only in the paper form and cannot become part of practical concerns. Secondly these problems related to caste- discrimination can be solved only by social awareness and social interaction among different communities but not only by policies and schemes. Since independence {{there is not a single}} case of social awareness programme conducted by political parties and government and this become the root cause of social inequality till now. The present examples of violation and injustice with poor and deprived persons show the failure of our judiciary system and so-called democratic 2 ̆ 6 secular society. With this background some recommendations will be discussed in the last of the paper so that a humane society can be modeled according to our constitutional commitment of social equality, freedom and brotherhood...|$|E

40|$|My aim in {{this thesis}} is to examine whether there are some {{mitigating}} factors, i. e. reasons to punish an offender less for his crime than an otherwise similar offender (other than that the offender suffered from mental disorder or disturbance {{or other forms of}} irrationality at the time of offence), that are more applicable to <b>socially</b> <b>deprived</b> offenders than to non-socially deprived offenders. I will answer the thesis question through a critical examination of twelve arguments for claiming that there is a mitigating factor that is more applicable to <b>socially</b> <b>deprived</b> offenders, each proposing a different mitigating factor. My conclusions are as follows: (1) Most of the arguments that I examine fail, i. e. they either fail to highlight a genuine mitigating factor, or we do not have much evidence that the mitigating factor highlighted by the argument has a greater applicability to <b>socially</b> <b>deprived</b> offenders than to non-socially deprived offenders. (2) However, one argument, which can be called the no violation of natural duties argument, is successful. (3) Moreover, the improvement of the worst off argument, an argument that is not often discussed in the literature, is particularly noteworthy. If my discussion about that argument is correct, then even if, as I will argue, the mitigating factor highlighted by that argument may not be more applicable to <b>socially</b> <b>deprived</b> offenders than to non-socially deprived offenders, the remaining parts of that argument would still have profound influence on punishment in our unjust societies. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which {{immigrants}} in Germany are <b>socially</b> <b>deprived</b> compared to German natives. We demonstrate that when using a conventional definition of the social deprivation index typically applied in the literature, immigrants do not necessarily appear to be <b>socially</b> <b>deprived.</b> We propose a weighting scheme that weights components of social deprivation by their subjective contribution to an overall measure of life satisfaction. Using this weighting scheme to calculate an index of social deprivation, we find that immigrants experience a significant degree of social deprivation, confirming much of the economic literature examining the economic assimilation of immigrants in Germany. This result is driven by particularly high weights being attributed to employment. Also the size of the groups "in need" is smaller when using the innovative weighting scheme, allowing a more precise targeting of economic policy. © 2010 The Authors.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{descriptive}} information {{now available}} for primary {{care in the}} UK is unique in international terms. Under the 'Quality and Outcomes Framework' (QOF), data for 147 performance indicators are available for each general practice. We aimed to determine {{the relationship between the}} quality of primary care, as judged by the total QOF score, social deprivation and practice characteristics. Methods We obtained QOF data for each practice in England and linked these with census derived data (deprivation indices and proportion of patients born in a developing country). Characteristics of practices were also obtained. QOF and census data were available for 8480 practices. Results The median QOF score was 999. 7 out of a possible maximum of 1050 points. Three characteristics were independently associated with higher QOF scores: training practices, group practices and practices in less <b>socially</b> <b>deprived</b> areas. In a regression model, these three factors explained 14. 6 % of the variation in QOF score. Higher list sizes per GP, turnover of registered patients, chronic disease prevalence, proportions of elderly patients or patients born in a developing country did not contribute to lower QOF scores in the final model. Conclusion <b>Socially</b> <b>deprived</b> areas experience a lower quality of primary care, as judged by QOF scores. Social deprivation itself is an independent predictor of lower quality. Training and group practices are independent predictors of higher quality but these types of practices are less well represented in <b>socially</b> <b>deprived</b> areas. </p...|$|R
