The new paradigm - connecting to the contemporary theories of authors such as Rancière and Badiou - is that "the <b>strctural</b> incapacity of the political in understanding violence" {{is rooted in the}} assumption that its origin is unitarian. The "Stasis" as well as sexual difference offer the clues to think again about politics and community starting from an originary "partage"...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{behavior}} of the HEGY statistics for quarterly data, for seasonal autoregressive unit roots, when the analyzed time series is deterministic seasonal stationary but exhibits a change in the seasonal pattern. As a by-product we analyze also the HEGY test for the nonseasonal unit root, the data generation process being trend stationary too. Our results show that when the break magnitudes are finite the HEGY test statistics are not asymptotically biased towards the non-rejection of the seasonal and nonseasonal unit root hypotheses. However, the finite sample power properties may be substancially affected, {{the behavior of}} the tests {{depending on the type of}} the break. Hence, our results are also useful to understand and to predict this behavior under several circumstances. seasonality; unit roots; <b>strctural</b> breaks; HEGY tests...|$|E
40|$|Macroeconomic {{adjustment}} in the Southern {{countries of the}} euro area after the financial crisis appears well under way as external imbalances in these countries have almost disappeared. However, in this paper, we argue the underlying <b>strctural</b> problems persist and recovery is fragile. Both sovereign debt and external debt are approaching sustainability thresholds and indications of substantial structural reform are insufficient yet for the Southern countries. Prospects for higher growth {{in the near future}} are dim, due to lack of economic reforms, private and public debt overhang and imposed austerity programs. Moreover, the observed adjustment is strongly asymmetric and leads to more rather than less divergence. Overall, we feel the chosen approach will prove to be unsustainable and infeasible in the near future. To defend the euro and the euro area, a new approach is urgently needed...|$|E
40|$|Makkah {{and central}} Red Sea regions have been re-evaluated from recent {{earthquake}} data analysis. Epicenters of recent seismic activity {{are concentrated in}} three local seismic zones. These are Ad Damm fault (NE), Nu’man–Makkah–Fatima (NW), and Jeddah-Red Sea (NW) seismic zones. Moreover, an extended seismic zone along {{the central part of}} Red Sea is observed. Most of these epicenters are distributed along tectonic faults, as indicated from the subsurface structure analysis of the aeromagnetic anomaly map. Some epicenters of small magnitudes are inaccurately located. The study indicates the existence of large active <b>strctural</b> basin south of Makkah region, winch traverse Ad Damm fault zone with the Red Sea transform faults. Slip vector analyses were carried out for 50 available earthquake focal mechanisms around Makkah region. In Nu’man, Makkah, and Fatima structural zones, the slip vectors generally trend NW and NNW. However, in the southern part at the Ad Dam structure zone, the slip vector trends NE–SW. These may result from the current complicated drifting motion of Arabian plate away from African plate combined {{with the opening of the}} Red Sea rift...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Helma-Madrakah area {{lies in the}} {{northern}} part of the Makkah quadrangle located in the southern part of the Hijaz region, western Saudi Arabia. The area is bounded by longitudes 39 º 30 ′N and 39 º 54 ′E and latitudes 21 º 45 ′N and 22 º 00 ′N; i. e., north of Makkah Al-Mukarramah and north-east of Jeddah. The present study deals with the interpretation of aeromagnetic data, which conducted by Aero-Service Corporation in the period 1965 - 1966 to depict subsurface regional and residual subsurface struc-tural features. The Filon Fourier spectral analysis technique is used to determine average depths to the causative bodies (6. 0, 1. 2 and 0. 7 km) of regional and residual anomalies. Special windows are designed and used to calculate the regional and residual components at each point along several profiles. Accordingly, the regional and residual magnet-ic maps of the area under study were produced. The regional magnetic contour map indicates the rocks in the east-ern part of the area to be more acidic than these in the western part. The residual magnetic contour maps, on the other hand, show a number of higher frequency dipole magnetic anomalies. This reveals that the near surface rocks contain a certain amount of magnetic min-erals. Therefore, the locations of these anomalies are considered very important for mineral exploration. A basement structural map constructed using regional and residual magnetic maps as well as the geological map of the area, shows the area to be dissected by a set of N-S, NNW and NNE <b>strctural</b> trends.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} testing of mechanically-damaged pipes {{repaired}} using Armor Plate Pipe Wrap (APPW). In this discussion, mechanical damage means local indentation of a pipe with an extemal gouge. This type of defect results in reduction of <b>strctural</b> integrity when internal pressure is applied both statically and in a cyclic manner. A significant level of research on mechanical damage has been conducted {{over the past twenty}} years based upon the observation that third-part damage {{is the leading cause of}} pipeline failures in the United States. More recently, effort have addressed the effects of cyclic pressure service on mechanical damage and the number of cycles required for the development of leaks. In this study, mechanical damage was created by insta 11 ng dents in pipes that were previously gouged by an end milL. The gouge depths and dent depths were 15 percent of the pipe wall thicknesses and diameters, respectively. Two pipe sizes and grades were used. One being 12. 75 -in x 0. 188 -in, grade X 52 and the other bring 12. 75 -in x 0. 375 -in, grade X 42. Four defects were created in each of the two pipe samples, giving a total of eight defects in the test program. In each sample one defect was not repaired, two were repaired by grinding and installation of APPW, and the fourth defect was repaired by grinding, insta 11 ation of APPW plus installation of a stainless steel clamp. Internal pressure was cycled in each samples at a range of 100 percent of the maximum operating pressure (MOP) until failure occurred in each defect. As failures occurred, the failed sections were cut out and the remaining segments welded together so that additional cycle testing could occur...|$|E
40|$|Kalsilite, a {{polymorph}} of KAISiO 4 is an end {{member of}} nepheline-kalsilite series and the mineral was syn-thesized by hydorhermal methods. The synthetic kalsilite is hexagonal, P 63, with a= 5. 151 (5), c= 8. 690 (8) A. The structure was refined by full-matrix least-squares methods to a R-value 0. 084, using 373 observed reflections. The obtained structure agrees well {{with those of}} the natural and the alkali-exchanged specimens reported in the previous literatures. The oxygen atoms are disordered at two mirror-equivalent sites, constructing the domain structure. The average domain structure shows P 63 mc symmetry and the <b>strctural</b> relation between the two P 63 structure corresponds to the twinning by merohedry. The domain structure was considered to be caused accompanied with the high-low inversion of the kalslite structure. Heating experiments of kalsilite reveal that the X-ray powder pattern changes at 865 ℃, and that cell dimensions vary discontinuously at this temperature. It was confirmed that kalsilite underwent a displacive transition like those observed in quartz or tridymite. The high-form is refered as 'high-kalsilite', and a possible simulate model is proposed. The structure of the high-kalsilite at 950 ℃ was refined byfull-matrix least-squares methods to a R-value 0. 095, using 115 observed reflections. The high-kalsilite is also hexagonal, P 63 mc or P 63 /mmc, with a= 5. 288 (1), c= 8. 628 (5) A at 950 ℃. The structure almost prefectly coincides with that of the simulated model. Based on the interatomic distances, the distribution of silicon and aluminum atoms is found to be or-dered and the space group is determined to be P 63 mc. Kaliophilite and the related orthorhombic from, polymorphs of KAISiO 4, were synthesized by dry method. The synthetic kaliophilite (kaliophilite-H 2) is hexagonal with a= 5. 17 (1), c= 8. 49 (3) A, and the orthorhombic KAISiO 4 (kaliophilite-O 1) is orthormbic with a= 9. 01 (1), b= 15. 60 (2), c= 8. 53 (4) A. Detailed examina-tion of the obtained powder patterns together with that of simulated model indicates that the kaliophilite-H 2 has a disorderd structure of four types of the low-kalsilite. The structure was refined by the X-ray powder pattern-fitting method (Rietvelt method) to a R-value 0. 121...|$|E
