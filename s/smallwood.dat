5|$|The British {{government}} {{decided to let}} Newfoundlanders deliberate and choose their own future by calling a National Convention in 1946. Chaired by Judge Cyril J. Fox, it consisted of 45 elected members {{one of whom was}} the future first premier of Newfoundland, Joey <b>Smallwood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} as many as 256 {{soldiers}} of the First Maryland Regiment under Colonel William <b>Smallwood</b> fell in the battle, about two-thirds of the regiment. It is known that they were buried in a mass-grave, but the grave's exact location has been a mystery for 240 years. In 2012 Brooklyn historian and president of the Brooklyn Preservation Council, Robert Furman, stated that he had a strong suspicion of the location of the gravesite, believing it to be in an empty lot in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn.|$|E
50|$|McMichael {{became a}} close ally of Ray <b>Smallwoods,</b> serving his {{political}} apprenticeship under the UDP chairman. <b>Smallwoods</b> {{was killed in}} 1994 and McMichael succeeded him as UDP leader. Although McMichael roundly condemned the killing of <b>Smallwoods</b> he later conceded that the shooting of <b>Smallwoods,</b> {{as well as that}} of Joe Bratty and Raymie Elder soon afterwards, convinced him that a Provisional IRA ceasefire was near as all three had been long-standing targets for the republican group.|$|R
50|$|During early 1992, <b>Smallwoods,</b> {{and others}} {{close to him}} in the Inner Council, held a series of {{meetings}} with Presbyterian ministers Jack Weir and Godfrey Browne. At these meetings, facilitated by Reverend Roy Magee, {{a former member of the}} Ulster Vanguard and campaigner against the Anglo-Irish Agreement who had become a peace advocate, the ministers pressed <b>Smallwoods</b> to lead the Inner Council towards a ceasefire. The proposal was rejected by the Inner Council and <b>Smallwoods</b> ended the discussions in March after learning that Weir and Browne had also been negotiating with Sinn Féin, a fact that <b>Smallwoods</b> feared might lead to suggestions that he had been passing information to the IRA.|$|R
5000|$|Nonetheless, Magee {{remained}} in regular contact with <b>Smallwoods,</b> whom he {{believed to be}} one of the main moderates on the Inner Council. Around 1993, <b>Smallwoods,</b> following prompting from Magee, opened communication with Alec Reid and Gerry Reynolds, two priests from the Roman Catholic Clonard Monastery on the Falls Road whom he used to open communications with republicans. <b>Smallwoods</b> intimated to them that the UDA was hoping to see peace and was preparing for a ceasefire. Father Reid had already built a relationship with Robert [...] "Basher" [...] Bates, one of the Shankill Butchers whose conversion to born-again Christianity had seen the two co-operate on ecumenical initiatives, but <b>Smallwoods</b> was the first active, high-ranking loyalist to hold regular dialogue with Catholic clergy. The Greysteel massacre of October 1993 almost led to the initiative breaking down as a disgusted Magee decided to break off contact with the UDA altogether but he was dissuaded by <b>Smallwoods,</b> who convinced him that there was a growing willingness to embrace peace on the Inner Council. Magee would later state that, despite his endorsement of a policy of targeting Sinn Féin members, <b>Smallwoods</b> proved to be an important voice for moderation on the Inner Council and a prime architect of the eventual loyalist ceasefire.|$|R
5|$|In 1982, {{the band}} {{released}} {{one of their}} most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, The Number of the Beast. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release. The band's manager, Rod <b>Smallwood,</b> later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes. The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.|$|E
5|$|John Watson, {{whose wife}} Mary is now visibly pregnant, finds an unkempt Sherlock Holmes {{living in a}} crack house under the {{influence}} of drugs. John attempts to force him to rehabilitate, but Sherlock insists that he was undercover for a case. Mycroft confronts Sherlock about the drug use and realises that Sherlock is investigating Charles Augustus Magnussen, a newspaper owner who blackmails people. Sherlock has been enlisted by Lady Elizabeth <b>Smallwood</b> to negotiate the return of stolen letters written by Smallwood's husband. Mycroft warns Sherlock not to go after Magnussen, which Sherlock ignores.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1777, the {{regiment}} and a detachment of the Maryland Line {{under the command}} of General William <b>Smallwood</b> (the 2nd Maryland Brigade) arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, to protect the city from the British. They encamped at the present-day Brandywine Park in Wilmington. The highlight of this time included Smallwood's capture of the British armed brigantine Symmetry on December 30. This ship was laden with supplies, including winter clothing, en route to the British in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Stirling led {{two units}} of Colonel John Haslet's 1st Delaware Regiment under the {{immediate}} command of Major Thomas Macdonough, and Colonel William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Infantry under the immediate command of Major Mordecai Gist; both Haslet and <b>Smallwood</b> were on courts-martial duty in Manhattan. Following close behind was Parson's Connecticut regiment with 251 men. Stirling led this combined force to reinforce Parsons and Atlee {{and stop the}} British advance. Stirling had a total of 1,600 troops at his command.|$|E
5|$|Three main factions {{actively}} campaigned {{during the}} {{lead up to}} the referendums. One faction, led by <b>Smallwood,</b> was the Confederate Association (CA) advocating union with the Canadian Confederation. They campaigned through a newspaper known as The Confederate. The Responsible Government League (RGL), led by Peter Cashin, advocated an independent Newfoundland with a return to responsible government. They also had their own newspaper The Independent. A third smaller Economic Union Party (EUP), led by Chesley Crosbie, advocated closer economic ties with the United States.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Cross {{recipient}} Cecil Meritt {{cited the}} fact that he already held Canada's highest decoration as a reason not to be admitted to the Order of Canada. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was in 1982 offered appointment to the order as an honorary Companion; however, he refused on the grounds that, as the consort of the Queen, he was a Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment. In 1993, the Advisory Council proposed an amendment to the constitution of the Order of Canada, making the sovereign's spouse automatically a Companion, but Prince Philip again refused, stating that if he was to be appointed, it should be on his merits. Congruent with these arguments, he in 1988 accepted without issue a substantive induction as a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2013, the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended in a way that permitted the substantive appointment of Royal Family members and Prince Philip accepted induction as the first extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada on 26 April 2013. Former Premier of Newfoundland Joey <b>Smallwood</b> declined appointment as a Companion because he felt that, as a self-proclaimed Father of Confederation, he deserved a knighthood. <b>Smallwood</b> was never knighted and later accepted induction as a Companion.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Smallwoods</b> {{was noted}} for his strong working class loyalist {{approach}} to Northern Irish politics, which was {{distinct from the}} more middle class unionism favoured by larger parties. It was also noted by both Ian S. Wood and an Observer journalist that <b>Smallwoods</b> sometimes struggled with his dual role as politician and paramilitary director, often beginning interviews by calling the UDA [...] "them" [...] before eventually switching to [...] "us". Having come from a background in the UDA in the 1970s, <b>Smallwoods</b> was sympathetic to Ulster nationalism and, during his chairmanship, he placed {{the notion of an}} independent Northern Ireland at the heart of party policy. According to Gusty Spence, however, Ulster nationalism was a fallback position for <b>Smallwoods,</b> who also recognised the impracticalities of the idea, a plan that Spence had no truck with.|$|R

5|$|Blyton's granddaughter, Sophie <b>Smallwood,</b> wrote a new Noddy book to {{celebrate}} the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, Mr Tumpy's Caravan, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books {{in a collection of}} papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.|$|E
5|$|Churchill Falls is {{a single}} {{underground}} generation station located on the Churchill River {{near the town of}} Churchill Falls and the <b>Smallwood</b> Reservoir in Labrador. It was constructed over a period of five to six years from 1966 to 1971–72 by the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation (CFLCo), though generators were installed after major construction was completed. The single generation facility cost C$946 million to construct and produced 5,225MW of power initially after all eleven generating units were installed. A station upgrade in 1985 raised the generating capacity to over 5,400MW. Hydro-Québec Generation owns a 34.2% interest in CFLCo, which is the same company that constructed the generating plant. However, Hydro-Québec has rights to most of the 5,400MW of power the station produces under a 65-year power purchase agreement, expiring in 2041.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{remained}} in the band for another year, recording two studio albums with them—Head On and Shock Tactics. However, Samson soon ran into difficulties with their record label, Gem, who {{went out of business}} and failed to finance their European tour in support of Iron Maiden. The band were turned over to RCA, which began neglecting the group, and so they promptly fired their management team and the resulting injunction meant that their equipment was reclaimed and they could not be paid for their concert performances. The band's last gig was at Reading Festival, after which Dickinson was approached by Iron Maiden's manager, Rod <b>Smallwood,</b> who asked him to audition to be their new lead vocalist.|$|E
50|$|After 1949, when Newfoundland joined Canada, Russell entered {{politics}} and served {{for two years}} in Joey <b>Smallwood's</b> cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources, but, opposing <b>Smallwood's</b> industrial policies, resigned from cabinet and left politics shortly thereafter. For several years he worked as an insurance salesman, later returning to teaching at the high school and then at Memorial University of Newfoundland.|$|R

5|$|In {{the small}} town of Home, Pennsylvania, a woman gives birth to a {{deformed}} baby. Three similarly-deformed men bury it near their dilapidated house during a rainstorm. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are sent to investigate after the corpse is found by children during a sandlot ball game. While talking to Home's sheriff Andy Taylor (Tucker <b>Smallwood),</b> Mulder asks whether the Peacock brothers—the inhabitants of the house nearest to the crime scene—have been questioned about the baby. Taylor informs him that the house dates back to the American Civil War and is without electricity, running water, or heat. He also insinuates that the family has been inbreeding since the war. The three Peacock brothers watch the agents from their front porch.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{featured}} several returning guest stars, including Randy Oglesby, Tucker <b>Smallwood,</b> Josette DiCarlo and Sean McGowan. Additional {{sets were}} {{required for the}} scenes at the Xindi Council, while the sets for Degra's ship had been created for an earlier episode. Although most scenes were filmed between February 12 and 23, the scenes featuring the Sphere-Builders were filmed {{in conjunction with the}} following episode on February 26. Two reviewers praised the episode, and it was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects. There was a slight increase in ratings with the episode earning a 3.4/5% audience share, translating into approximately 3.35 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|The highway passes {{south of}} Wiggins Lake as it {{approaches}} the junction with M-18 in Gladwin. The two highways run concurrently on Cedar Avenue for approximately ten blocks through downtown. M-61 leaves {{town on the}} east side near the airport. The highway continues eastward to a junction with M-30 (Meridian Road) in White Star on the west banks of the <b>Smallwood</b> Lake section of the Tittabawassee River. The highway crosses the river and runs through Wooden Shoe Village as it continues through the Au Sable State Forest, crossing extreme northern Bay County. The trunkline crosses into Arenac County before meeting I-75 and US23 in Arenac County near Standish.|$|E
50|$|As UDP chair, <b>Smallwoods</b> {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure as the UDA moved towards a ceasefire and {{emerged as an}} articulate voice of loyalist politics. <b>Smallwoods,</b> however, was not to see these developments as {{he was killed by}} the Provisional IRA in Lisburn on 11 July 1994. The attack, which occurred in the garden of his house on Lisburn's Donard Drive, was witnessed by his wife Linda.|$|R

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was part}} of the platoon of the advance party that first entered Germantown before the battle became general. Unbeknownst to Washington, the columns of Greene and <b>Smallwood</b> got lost. Washington himself accompanied Sullivan's force and, at 5am, ordered him to launch the assault. The leading element of Sullivan's column, General Thomas Conway's brigade, attacked the British 2d Light Infantry battalion, which had been reinforced by the British 40th Regiment of Foot under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Musgrave. The regiment formed part of Sullivan's early attack on the British; its losses were 3 officers and 19 men.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{supported}} {{the side of}} Charles I in the Civil War. At the outbreak of fighting in 1642, he left London for the house of his father-in-law, Peter Mainwaring of <b>Smallwood,</b> Cheshire. There he lived a retired life until 1644, when he was appointed King's Commissioner of Excise at Lichfield. Soon afterwards, {{at the suggestion of}} George Wharton, a leading astrologer with strong court connections, Ashmole was given a military post at Oxford, where he served as an ordnance officer for the King's forces. In his spare time, he studied mathematics and physics at his lodgings, Brasenose College. There he acquired a deep interest in astronomy, astrology, and magic. In late 1645, he left Oxford to accept the position of Commissioner of Excise at Worcester. Ashmole was given the additional military post of captain in Lord Astley's Regiment of Foot, part of the Royalist Infantry, though as a mathematician, he was seconded to artillery positions. He seems never to have participated in any actual fighting.|$|E
5|$|In a {{press release}} {{regarding}} From Fear to Eternity, band manager Rod <b>Smallwood</b> revealed that Iron Maiden will release a new concert video to DVD in 2011, filmed in Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina during The Final Frontier World Tour.

In addition to the concert footage, the video release includes an 88-minute tour documentary, entitled Behind The Beast, containing interviews with the band and their crew. In December 2012, one song from the release ("Blood Brothers") {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards.|$|E
5000|$|Adams {{was close}} to Ray <b>Smallwoods</b> {{personally}} and described himself as [...] "really devastated" [...] following Smallwoods' killing by the Provisional IRA in July 1994. He identified <b>Smallwoods</b> as his mentor in heping {{to bring him to}} politics. Nonetheless Adams continued to work towards delivering a ceasefire and was described by Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack as [...] "one of the moderate voices advising the UDA, even in the darkest days".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Smallwoods</b> was {{a native}} of Lisburn and, as such, {{was a member of the}} Ulster Defence Association's South Belfast brigade, which also covered the nearby town. In late 1979, John McMichael, a leading figure in the UDA and also a Lisburn native, set up a {{commando}} structure within the UDA and drew up a [...] "shopping list" [...] of leading targets for this group to kill. Amongst the names on the list killed were Irish Independence Party member John Turnley, Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners' representative Miriam Daly and INLA and Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) activists Ronnie Bunting and Noel Lyttle. On 14 January 1981, <b>Smallwoods,</b> an associate of McMichael, was amongst those in attendance at a meeting above McMichael's pub in which it was decided that the next target would be former Irish republican politician Bernadette McAliskey. According to Sammy Duddy, <b>Smallwoods</b> was one of only nine men that McMichael used for these operations. <b>Smallwoods</b> and McMichael were close personally as well as professionally and both men and their families holidayed together on the Isle of Man.|$|R
