A <b>secondary</b> <b>clock,</b> that averages at an integer fraction of the main clock signal, is used to reduce the capacitance spread which reduces power consumption and relaxes amplifier requirements.

After a review of cascode transconductance amplifiers, a three-path amplifier with reduced input capacitance and enhanced slew-rate has been proposed to improve settling time.

40|$|Most {{aspects of}} energy {{metabolism}} display clear variations during day and night. This daily rhythmicity of metabolic functions, including hormone release, {{is governed by}} a circadian system that consists of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) and many <b>secondary</b> <b>clocks</b> {{in the brain and}} peripheral organs. The SCN control peripheral timing via the autonomic and neuroendocrine system, as well as via behavioral outputs. The sleep-wake cycle, the feeding/fasting rhythm and most hormonal rhythms, including that of leptin, ghrelin and glucocorticoids, usually show an opposite phase (relative to the light-dark cycle) in diurnal and nocturnal species. By contrast, the SCN clock is most active at the same astronomical times in these two categories of mammals. Moreover, in both species, pineal melatonin is secreted only at night. In this review we describe the current knowledge on the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by central and peripheral clock mechanisms. Most experimental knowledge comes from studies in nocturnal laboratory rodents. Nevertheless, we will also mention some relevant findings in diurnal mammals, including humans.

Online measurement techniques {{can determine the}} timing characteristics of an FPGA application while it is operating, and facilitate a range of benefits. Degradation can be monitored by tracking changes in timing performance, while {{power consumption}} can be reduced through dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) of the power supply to exploit any spare timing headroom. If higher performance is the objective, dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) {{can be used to}} maximise operating frequency. In both cases, online timing measurement of the application circuit is used to exploit favourable operating conditions.

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in Waterbury, Connecticut by Charles Warner, the pioneer of the {{electric}} clock. The company was later moved to Springfield MA in 1911. Standard quickly became known for its electric clock systems, which were often installed in schools, universities, and other public buildings. These systems consisted of a master clock, which then controlled all <b>secondary</b> <b>clocks.</b> Like many companies during the Great Depression, Standard suffered from financial difficulties throughout the 1930s. In the 1940s during World War II, Standard products were used in many defense projects. In 1950, Standard made a 15000 sq ft addition onto their Springfield plant, and introduced several new product lines, most notably fire alarm systems, fluid analyzer systems, and nurse call systems for use in hospitals. In 1970, {{it was announced that}} the company would be sold to Johnson Controls in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. During this period, the company modernized its fire alarm division with the SET/7000, a modular solid-state conventional panel, and later with the SET/7500, a 250-zone multiplex panel in console form that could control fire alarm, security, and building automation systems, along with their light plates and remote lights. In 1978, Johnson Controls sold Standard Electric Time to Faraday. In 1981, Faraday downsized the company substantially, closing all divisions except for standard electric time, and moved it to Tecumseh, Michigan. Faraday is now owned by Siemens, and a small branch office still remains in Springfield.|$|R
40|$|The {{circadian}} {{clock is}} {{accountable for the}} regulation of internal rhythms in most living organisms. It allows the anticipation of environmental changes {{during the day and}} a better adaptation of physiological processes. In mammals the main clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and synchronizes <b>secondary</b> <b>clocks</b> throughout the body. Its molecular constituents form an intracellular network which dictates circadian time and regulates clock-controlled genes. These clock-controlled genes are involved in crucial biological processes including metabolism and cell cycle regulation. Its malfunction can lead to disruption of biological rhythms and cause severe damage to the organism. The detailed mechanisms that govern the circadian system are not yet completely understood. Mathematical models can be of great help to exploit the mechanism of the circadian circuitry. We built a mathematical model for the core clock system using available data on phases and amplitudes of clock components obtained from an extensive literature search. This model was used to answer complex questions for example: how does the degradation rate of Per affect the period of the system and {{what is the role of}} the ROR/Bmal/REV-ERB (RBR) loop? Our findings indicate that an increase in the RNA degradation rate of the clock gene Period (Per) can contribute to increase or decrease of the period - a consequence of a non-monotonic effect of Per transcript stability on the circadian period identified by our model. Furthermore, we provide theoretical evidence for a potential role of the RBR loop as an independent oscillator. We carried out overexpression experiments on members of the RBR loop which lead to loss of oscillations consistent with our predictions. These findings challenge the role of the RBR loop as a merely auxiliary loop and might change our view of the clock molecular circuitry and of the function of the nuclear receptors (REV-ERB and ROR) as a putative driving force of molecular oscillations...|$|R
5000|$|The {{competition}} for selling exact time necessitated developing a reliable master clock and auxiliary clocks. Connecting multiple clocks via electrical wires {{in a system}} had proved feasible. Two slightly different master clock-slave clock concepts emerged. The first entailed {{the use of an}} electro-mechanical [...] "synchronizer" [...] to forcibly bring the minute hand to the 12 position exactly on the hour. Each of the clocks in this system used a complete clock mechanism {{with the addition of a}} synchronizer. A central clock (master clock) sent the synchronizing signal along telegraph lines to each clock, thereby assuring that all clocks displayed exactly the same time. The individual clocks in this system had self-contained batteries and required three volts direct current (DC) to operate. The batteries for the synchronizing system transmission were located in a central office. The use of the mechanical synchronizer was the design of Chester H. Pond and his associates as they formed the SWCC in 1886. A second approach to synchronized time transmitted along wires was to connect a master clock to relatively simple <b>secondary</b> <b>clocks</b> (slave clocks). The slave clocks did not have complete clockworks but simply a mechanism that, when energized electrically from the master clock, would advance the clock hands one unit of time. The slave clock would display exactly the same time as the master clock. Slave clocks were much less complicated to manufacture and required little or no servicing. Initially they were more prone to failure. Each of the slave clocks had wires that connected to the master clock. The master clock in this system required 24 volts DC to both wind the master clock and as a source of current to advance the hands of the slave clock. These master-slave systems were more suited for individual buildings such as schools or factories, rather than locations that were great distances apart. A master-slave clock system was developed and marketed in 1886 by Charles D. Warner and operated as the Standard Electric Time Company. The accuracy of the master-slave system was dictated by the accuracy of the master clock and reliability of the slave clocks. Over the years, correction systems were developed for the master-slave systems that rendered the systems very reliable and accurate. In the first three decades of the 20th century, many more companies entered the time-selling business. When one considers the entire country, the number of synchronized clock systems installed in learning institutions, factories, businesses, government installations, transportation facilities, and other buildings, was enormous. Many hundreds of thousands of slave clocks and probably tens of thousands of master clocks were manufactured, sold, installed and serviced by people involved in the exact-time-for-sale business.|$|R
40|$|When {{performing}} precision measurements, {{the quantity}} being measured is often perturbed by the measurement process itself. This includes precision frequency measurements for atomic clock applications {{carried out with}} Ramsey spectroscopy. With the aim of eliminating probe-induced perturbations, a method of generalized auto-balanced Ramsey spectroscopy (GABRS) is presented and rigorously substantiated. Here, the usual local oscillator frequency control loop is augmented with a second control loop derived from secondary Ramsey sequences interspersed with the primary sequences and with a different Ramsey period. This second loop feeds back to a <b>secondary</b> <b>clock</b> variable and ultimately compensates for the perturbation of the clock frequency caused by the measurements in the first loop. We show that such a two-loop scheme can lead to perfect compensation of measurement-induced light shifts and does not suffer {{from the effects of}} relaxation, time-dependent pulse fluctuations and phase-jump modulation errors that are typical of other hyper-Ramsey schemes. Several variants of GABRS are explored based on different secondary variables including added relative phase shifts between Ramsey pulses, external frequency-step compensation, and variable second-pulse duration. We demonstrate that a universal anti-symmetric error signal, and hence perfect compensation at finite modulation amplitude, is generated only if an additional frequency-step applied during both Ramsey pulses is used as the concomitant variable parameter. This universal technique {{can be applied to the}} fields of atomic clocks, high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, magnetically induced and two-photon probing schemes, Ramsey-type mass spectrometry, and to the field of precision measurements. Some variants of GABRS can also be applied for rf atomic clocks using CPT-based Ramsey spectroscopy of the two-photon dark resonance. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive {{hydrogen maser}} atomic <b>clocks</b> and two <b>secondary</b> rubidium atomic <b>clocks</b> which {{are independent of}} one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|R
40|$|The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is a 700, 000 acre estuary at the {{confluence}} of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, which consists of below sea-level islands surrounded by levees. Many of theses levees are not engineered structures, consisting of uncompacted sands, silts, clays, and organics often founded upon natural levees and in some cases on peaty organic soil. Many hazards threaten the Delta, but the seismic hazard is exceptional because of the potential for multiple simultaneous breaches inundating many islands within the Delta. The objectives of this research are to improve fundamental understanding of cyclic and post-cyclic behavior of peat that could affect levee performance, and develop analysis tools to predict this behavior. Laboratory testing is performed on 22 undisturbed Shelby tube samples gathered from Sherman Island at depths ranging from approximately 1 to 6 m. The shear testing in this research is carried out using the UCLA bi-directional broadband simple shear device, which is a digitally-controlled device with capabilities for chamber pressure control and multidirectional excitation. The apparatus was improved as part of this research program to add capabilities for testing under constant-height and stress-controlled conditions. Oedometer tests are carried out on Sherman Island peat to evaluate its compressibility properties. To facilitate accurate determination of the end of primary consolidation, a new consolidometer was fabricated that provides single drainage through the top of the specimen, while pore pressure is measured at the bottom. For specimens with high organic content (OC > 28 %), values of coefficient of consolidation (c_v) for normally-consolidated load stages are observed to decrease as vertical effective stress increases, often by more than two orders of magnitude over the stress range tested in the consolidometer. For the Sherman Island peat c_v is as high as 400 〖? 10 〗^(- 4) cm 2 /s at σ_p^'. The trend of compression index (Cc), and recompression index (Cr) confirms that they are positively correlated with in situ water content (w 0) and OC. The values of C_α⁄C_c (where C_αis secondary compression index) for the Sherman Island peat ranges from 0. 05 to as high as 0. 12 with an average of 0. 08. Hydraulic conductivity k depends on void ratio, and decreases with the decrease in void ratio. The slope of e versus logk (i. e., C_k) increases with initial void ratio (e 0), and the best fit for the data is C_k= 0. 20 e_ 0. Monotonic test results show that lightly overconsolidated peat with OCR < 2 shows contractive behavior, while higher OCR’s result in dilative behavior. The Normal Consolidation Line (NCL) and Failure State Line (FSL) are approximately parallel for OC ≤ 35 %. Normalized shear strength (the normalization is with respect to pre-shear vertical effective stress) has been evaluated as a function of OCR. The soil behavior generally supports the concept of normalization, with the strength ratio being higher for high OC (80 - 85 %) than for low OC (≤ 35 %). Cyclic strain-controlled tests show that for low shear strain amplitude, γ_c (< 0. 7 %), although hysteretic loops form, cyclic degradation of stiffness does not occur and pore pressures do not accumulate. Accordingly, stress paths are similar to those for a drained test. For higher 〖 γ〗_c, r_ur increases from cycle-to-cycle and reaches to around 0. 1 after 15 cycles at 4 % shear strain. The soil stiffness degrades slightly to achieve the uniform strain amplitude. One of the principle contributions in this dissertation is to demonstrate that evaluation of the rate of secondary compression following primary consolidation is related to the vertical distance in void ratio – effective stress space between soil state and a secondary compression reference line (SCRL). The traditional approach takes this rate as logarithmically decaying with time following load application, but is shown to not be generally applicable. For example, it fails for the case of a small load increment applied to a soil element. I develop a conceptual and analytical framework to compute the rate of void ratio change as a function of soil state given this framework, which predicts slower secondary compression as OCR (overconsolidation ratio) increases. The proposed framework provides a much improved match to observations for conditions differing from those in traditional consolidation tests in which the ratio of load increase to initial stress is approximately unity. When peaty organic soils are cyclically loaded, they can experience an increase of secondary compression rate relative what would have been present without dynamic loading. This increased rate of volume change occurs even for shear strain amplitudes that do not induce a pore pressure response. For a given soil, the rate change increases with strain amplitude and number of cycles, which {{can be viewed as a}} partial resetting the <b>secondary</b> compression <b>clock</b> without change in total stress. However, rather than modeling this in a time-based framework, I demonstrate that this reset behavior can be captured by a vertical shift of the SCRL, which can be quantified by a reset index (I_R). The value of I_R varies between 0 (no reset) to 1 (fully reset). An empirical model is developed for I_R as a function of cyclic shear strain amplitude, number of uniform loading cycles, organic content, over-consolidation ratio, initial overburden pressure, and amount of static shear stress. A simplified procedure is developed to estimate post-earthquake settlement of organic soils in consideration of post-earthquake pore pressure dissipation and accelerated rates of secondary compression. The procedure uses 1 -D site response analysis to find representative profiles of peak shear strain and its phasing in time. The irregular shear strain time series is then converted to uniform shear strain cycles at some specified amplitude as a fraction of the peak. Reset index and pore pressure ratio at the conclusion of shaking are then calculated using predictions equations conditioned on strain amplitude, number of cycles, over-consolidation ratio, organic content, and pre-earthquake stress conditions. The resulting values of reset index and pore pressure can be used in a non-linear consolidation code to calculate post-earthquake settlement versus time...|$|R
