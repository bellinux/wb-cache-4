5|$|In the {{alternate}} history novel How Few Remain, Alexander continues {{his career as}} a brigadier general long after the Confederate States of America wins the civil war and was instrumental in defending Confederate Kentucky and fending off another Union invasion while under <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> during a second war with the United States in the 1880's.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{chose the}} {{relatively}} well-rested commands of D. H. Hill, <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> and John Magruder {{to lead the}} Confederate offensive, as they had barely participated in the fighting of the day before. Meanwhile, James Longstreet's First Corps and A. P. Hill's Light Division, who had fought {{the majority of the}} previous day's hostilities, would be held in reserve. According to Lee's plan, the Army of Northern Virginia would form a semi-circle enveloping Malvern Hill. D. H. Hill's five brigades would be placed along the northern face of the hill, forming the center of the Confederate line, and the commands of <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> and John Magruder would take the left and right flanks, respectively. Whiting's forces would position themselves on the Poindexter farm, with the outfits of Brig. Gen. Charles Sidney Winder and Richard Ewell nearby. The infantry of these three detachments would provide reinforcement for the Confederate line if necessary. Maj. Gen. Theophilus Holmes would take up a position on the extreme Confederate right flank.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, White {{served as}} a Sergeant Major and Captain in the Confederate States Army and headed a bureau of the Confederate States Department of the Treasury. White served under the {{commands}} of <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> and Jubal Early and {{was responsible for the}} safekeeping of Hampshire County's land registration records from destruction by Union Army forces. From 1864 to 1865, White was in command of Company C of the 23rd Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Union's V Corps, {{commanded}} by Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, took up {{positions on the}} hill on June30. McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle, having boarded the ironclad USS Galena and sailed down the James River to inspect Harrison's Landing, where he intended to locate the base for his army. Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps. Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate Maj. Gen. John Magruder {{to be late for}} the battle, an excess of caution delayed Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger, and Maj. Gen. <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> had problems collecting the Confederate artillery.|$|E
5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York that educates and commissions officers for the United States Army. Confederate President Jefferson Davis, himself a former officer and West Point graduate (class of 1828), preferred West Point trained officers for the Confederate States Army (CSA). This article lists those alumni. Also included {{are a number}} of officers who were cadets at West Point but for reason unknown never graduated, such as Lewis Armistead. There are several (indicated) familiar relations between the officers, so we e.g. have several members of the Lee family of Virginia. Other notable Confederate officers include James Longstreet (class of 1842), <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> (class of 1846), and J.E.B. Stuart (class of 1854).|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival at}} the end of the day of Union {{reinforcements}} under Pope, as well as the rest of Jackson's men, resulted in a two-day stand-off there, with the Confederates finally withdrawing from Cedar Mountain on August 11. <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> observed that Banks's men fought well, and Lincoln also expressed confidence in his leadership.During the Second Battle of Bull Run, Banks was stationed with his corps at Bristoe Station and did not participate in the battle.Afterwards, the corps was integrated into the Army of the Potomac as the XII Corps and marched north with the main army during the Confederate invasion of Maryland. On September 12, Banks was abruptly relieved of command.|$|E
5|$|White and {{his company}} saw combat from early 1864 through the early 1865. During the summer of 1865 alone, White's company participated in 56 battles and skirmishes, {{including}} picket fights, with two men killed, 26 men wounded (four of which later {{died as a result}} of their wounds), and ten men taken prisoner. By October 1, 1864, White's company had 15 serviceable horses and 70 that were not serviceable. Between 1863 and 1865, White received one severe wound (from June 21, 1864) and two minor wounds from various campaigns. White felt the effects of these wounds for the remainder of his life. Throughout his military service during the American Civil War, White served under the commands of <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> and Jubal Early.|$|E
5|$|He {{initially}} alienated many of {{his officers}} and men by publicly denigrating their record in comparison to his Western command. He launched an offensive against the Confederate army of General Robert E. Lee, in which he fell prey to a strategic turning movement into his rear areas by Maj. Gen. <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson.</b> At Second Bull Run, he concentrated his attention on attacking Jackson while the other Confederate corps attacked his flank and routed his army. Following Manassas, Pope was banished far from the Eastern Theater to the Department of the Northwest in Minnesota, where he commanded U.S. Forces in the Dakota War of 1862. He was appointed to command the Department of the Missouri in 1865 and was a prominent and activist commander during Reconstruction in Atlanta. For {{the rest of his}} military career, he fought in the Indian Wars, particularly against the Apache and Sioux.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, {{following}} John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in October 1859, a Virginia uniformed volunteer military company {{known as}} the Frontier Riflemen was formed with White as commanding officer in the rank of Captain. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Governor John Letcher ordered the Frontier Riflemen to report to Lieutenant General <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> at Harpers Ferry. White and his unit marched to Harpers Ferry on May 18, 1861. He and his unit traveled north on the Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad mainline at Green Spring, then to Harpers Ferry. Following their arrival, White's company was reassigned as Company I of the 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment commanded by Colonel A. P. Hill. The company marched from Harpers Ferry to Winchester and returned to Romney in June 1861, at which time they occupied the town for several days.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{order has}} been criticized because it left too much {{discretion}} to Ewell. Numerous historians and proponents of the Lost Cause movement (most prominently Jubal Early, despite his own reluctance to support an attack at the time) have speculated how the more aggressive <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> would have acted on this order if he had lived to command this wing of Lee's army, and how differently {{the second day of}} battle would have proceeded with Confederate artillery on Cemetery Hill, commanding the length of Cemetery Ridge and the Federal lines of communications on the Baltimore Pike. Stephen W. Sears has suggested that Gen. Meade would have invoked his original plan for a defensive line on Pipe Creek and withdrawn the Army of the Potomac, although that movement would have been a dangerous operation under pressure from Lee.|$|E
5|$|Porter Alexander is {{best known}} as an artilleryman who played a {{prominent}} role in many of the important battles of the war. He served in different artillery capacities for Longstreet's First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, starting that role on November 7, 1862, after leaving Lee's staff to command the battalion that was the corps' artillery reserve. He was promoted to colonel on December 5. He was instrumental in arranging the artillery in defense of Marye's Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, which proved to be the decisive factor in the Confederate victory. While the rest of Longstreet's corps was located around Suffolk, Virginia, Alexander accompanied <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> on his flanking march at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, and his artillery placements in Hazel Grove at Chancellorsville proved decisive.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the American Civil War, the Wirgman Building was {{frequently}} {{used as a}} military prison by both Confederate States Army and Union Army forces during their occupations of Romney. In the Spring of 1862, a spy for the command of <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson,</b> Lieutenant John Blue, was captured by Union Army soldiers while he was conducting a reconnaissance mission to determine the size and strength of the Union Army forces occupying Romney. Pending his transfer to a military prison in Wheeling where {{he was to be}} tried as a suspected spy, Blue was imprisoned in a room {{on the second floor of}} the Wirgman Building. During the early morning on Easter Day, Blue disabled the only guard on duty, disguised himself in a Union Army coat and headgear and proceeded to barricade the remainder of the prison garrison within the Wirgman Building. Blue walked to the periphery of the town of Romney unnoticed by the occupying Union Army forces, and successfully made it to safety.|$|E
5|$|In July 1892, Curtis sent a {{photograph}} of the Lotto painting to Leech, who consulted with Barber and replied that the engraver could not work from a painting in which the subject faces forward. So that Barber could depict Columbus in profile, Curtis arranged for a little-known Washington, D.C. sculptor, Ulric <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> Dunbar, to create a bust based on the painting at the Company's expense; when complete it was forwarded to Barber in Philadelphia. Barber prepared sketches based on the bust on August 15, and presented them to Acting Mint Director Robert E. Preston (Leech was on vacation), who forwarded them to fair authorities in Chicago. Ellsworth showed them to artists working on the exposition, and to the press. The artistic reaction was negative, and the newspapers suggested that the sketches resembled more a long-haired professor than the celebrated mariner. This controversy, coupled with his anger from public debate over whether the painting actually was of Columbus, caused Ellsworth to refuse permission for his painting to be used.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 24 April, Farragut's fleet made its {{historic}} run past the Mississippi River forts that defended New Orleans from the south. Because the Rebel leaders had not coordinated {{the responsibilities of the}} forts and the associated river fleet, the action was divided into two independent parts. Each ship of the attacking column was past the forts before she had to contend with the defending Confederate vessels, which therefore received the undivided attention of the Yankee gunners when they met. Under the circumstances, only one of the River Defense Fleet managed to close with the enemy: <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> was able to ram USS Varuna while that unfortunate gunboat was simultaneously being rammed by Governor Moore of the Louisiana navy. Varuna sank, the only Federal ship lost that night. <b>Stonewall</b> <b>Jackson</b> did not escape unscathed. Holed by shots from other Federal ships assisting Varuna and unable to reply, she was run ashore by her crew, where they abandoned her and set her afire.|$|E
