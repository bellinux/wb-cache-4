Combustible gas, as substitute fuel for internal combustion engine, is a desirable energy source. The development of gas internal combustion engine can not only {{take full advantage of}} current energy resources to relieve the pressure of petroleum shortage, but also is capable of supplying electricity to the areas which face a circumstance of electricity deficiency, exerting its strength in the field of distributed energy generation. This paper mainly discuss the status today and the future development trend of gas internal combustion engine, the technical problems and advantages of internal combustion engine development。The influence of biomass gas from gasification to the internal combustion engine is deeply analyzed from the aspect of the components of gas from gasification, the combustion characteristic, the heat value, and the impurity. Given the phenomenon of valve <b>spring</b> <b>fracture</b> frequently of the 8300 gas internal combustion engine in the practical application carefully research of valve train reveals that acceleration change sharply is the main reason. A new cam is designed to overcome the defects of old cam and also to satisfy the request of internal combustion engine fueled with gas from gasification. Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion, Chinese Academy of Sciences, with the "national high-tech development plans" (' 863 'Plan) support, launched a 5 MW biomass gasification-steam integrated generation combined cycle demonstration project. Experiments were carried out to analyse the aspects of the combustible gas consume rate, exhaust temperature, peak eruption temperature and the emission characteristic smoke, NOx, CO, HC. The experiment suggests that the bad performance of economic and power characteristics {{is the result of the}} lower heat value and the excessive components for hindering combustion. the proper air fuel ratio，and enhancement of gas flow in cylinders, and catalyzing are effective ways to lower the gas emissions of internal combustion engine fueled with biomass gas from gasification. Simulation of internal combustion engine fueled with biomass gas from gasification is carried out using the software of AVL BOOST, which optimizes the internal combustion engine parameter of spark advanced angle and air fuel ratio. 随着世界范围内内燃机保有量快速的增长，全球石油资源的过度开发，燃油供需矛盾日益加剧，开发燃油替代能源迫在眉睫。我国具有丰富的燃气资源，燃气作为内燃机的代用燃料是一种理想的能源。燃气内燃机的开发，不仅能充分利用现有的能源、缓解石油短缺的压力,还能向电力紧缺的地区供电，在分布式能源发电领域发挥其优势。 本论文简要地阐述了国内外燃气内燃机的现状和发展趋势，主要技术问题以及研发燃气内燃机的意义。对于生物质气化气的特性对内燃机的影响，从气化气成分、燃烧特性、热值以及气化气中杂质几方面进行了深入分析。对实际工程应用中 8300 型生物质气化气内燃机出现的气门弹簧频繁断裂现象进行了分析，通过对配气机构研究发现，气门加速度突变是导致气门弹簧断裂的主要原因。针对原配气凸轮的缺陷，设计了一种全新的高次方凸轮来满足生物质气化气内燃机的要求。中国科学院广州能源研究所在“国家高技术发展计划”（‘ 863 ’计划）支持下，开展了 5 MWe生物质气化-蒸汽整体联合循环发电示范工程研究，对示范工程中应用的燃气内燃机在不同负荷下的燃气消耗率、排气温度、最大爆发压力以及烟度、NOx,CO,HC的排放特性进行了试验研究。试验发现，气化气热值低、大量阻燃成分的存在是导致燃气内燃机经济性、动力性降低的主要原因，采用合适的空燃比、加强缸内气体流动、对尾气进行催化还原是降低生物质气化气内燃机尾气排放的有效措施。采用AVL BOOST软件对当前应用的生物质气化气内燃机进行模拟计算，优化了 8300 型生物质气化气内燃机的点火提前角、空燃比两个内燃机参数...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA new {{discrete}} element model (DEM) {{has been}} developed {{for the purpose of}} simulating dynamic fracturing driven by the internal generation of fluids in low permeability elastic solid bodies. The elastic material is represented by a network of nodes connected by <b>springs,</b> and <b>fracture</b> nucleation and propagation is implemented by splitting nodes and reconnecting the spring network. This produces realistic fracture shapes, and reduces lattice artefacts compared with DEM models in which fracturing is implemented by breaking/removal of <b>springs.</b> <b>Fracture</b> volumes and surfaces are explicitly represented in terms of the voids in the reconnected spring network, simplifying the coupling between mechanical deformation and fluid pressure in the fractures, and facilitating the modelling of fluid transport. The model is illustrated by applying it to fracturing driven by internal fluid generation in an impermeable quasi two-dimensional system. This is relevant for many geological processes, including primary migration of oil and gas in low-permeability source rock. The model may also be adapted to hydraulic fracturing processes, which are of industrial interest in connection with unconventional oil and gas production...|$|R

Using Cross-Tabulation Analysis, <b>spring</b> distributions by <b>fracture</b> sets were compared among geological environments, and the deviations related to differences in rock structure and, presumably, to differences in deformational histories.

The highest densities (12. 2 springs/km of lineament) were associated with young shear fractures produced by brittle deformation, and the lowest (0. 1) with old tensional and ductile fractures. Spectral Determination also relates each orientation class to a dominant structural parameter: where spring occurrence is controlled by the class is parallel to the present-day stress-field orientation; where the control is attributed to the length of <b>fractures,</b> the <b>spring</b> occurrence follows the strike of large-scale normal faults crossing the region.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} has wide engineering applications including {{exploration of}} unconventional resources, Enhanced Geothermal System, storage of radioactive waste and mining. It is a multi-physics and multi-scale problem {{which makes it}} difficult to be evaluated numerically. The multi-physics nature is arisen from coupling of at least three physical processes – deformation of rock under applied stress, fracture propagation and fluid flow along fracture while the multi-scales nature comes from the presence of discontinuities in different scales in rock mass. Also, fracture growth is highly sensitive to existing discontinuities which either enhance or suppress the growth. In this paper, a simple discontinuum numerical method – Lattice Element Method (LEM) is proposed to simulate hydraulic fracturing in large scale three-dimensional model. Rock is modelled as lattice network composed of 1 D Hookean’s <b>springs.</b> <b>Fracturing</b> is modelled by removing lattice exceeding a threshold as determined by critical energy release rate of rock. By introducing disorder in the model, the heterogeneity of rock is modelled and mesh dependency in fracture growth is removed. Disordered network is generated by Delaunay triangulation of randomly generated nodes and geometries of Voronoi cells are used for scaling of lattice stiffness and breaking threshold to match macroscopic parameters. Complicated fracture evolution like fracture branching and fracture coalescence can be modelled by LEM. Fluid flow along fractures is simplified as pipe network and cubic law model is used to relate the dependency between fluid transmissivity and aperture of fracture. An in-house C++ code using parallel conjugate solver is developed which is capable to handle large scale three-dimensional models composed of millions of degree of freedom running thousands of steps. LEM simulations of hydraulic fracturing under different pre-existing fractures and different in-situ stress are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of LEM to model field scale problem in three dimensions with consideration of heterogeneity of rock and influence of fracture networks...|$|R
40|$|The Large Block Test (LBT) is one {{of three}} thermal tests at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. While two of those three tests (the Single Heater Test and the Drift Scale Test) were large {{underground}} tests, the LBT was above ground. The test block, with a size of 3 x 3 x 4. 5 m, has a highly heterogeneous permeability field, with at least four orders of magnitude variation in permeability. Some of the temperature data from the LBT appear irregular at first glance, but on closer examination can be attributed to this heterogeneous nature of the fractured block. In this project, we attempt to develop a better understanding of these irregular temperature data from the LBT. The test block in the LBT was excavated from the surrounding Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>fractured</b> nonlithophysal tuff in the Fran Ridge area of Yucca Mountain. The bottom of the block remained attached to the underlying rock, while the top and the four side faces were kept open to the atmosphere. Mapping of all the fractures from the four sides and the top surface of the block revealed the existence of some large fractures in the block. The presence of such large fractures indicates that the flow of water and heat-induced vapor can be very different in different zones of the block, with vapor and water flowing more easily through the highly permeable fractures than elsewhere. It is our hypothesis that the irregular temperature data arise out of thermal-hydrological processes taking place in the heterogeneous fracture system. We show, through simulations performed with a 3 D dual-permeability numerical model based on the TOUGH 2 simulator, that such a heterogeneous fracture system can indeed give rise to irregular temperature data...|$|R
40|$|A high {{performance}} micro scanner {{is a critical}} element to enable efficient beamsteering in miniature laser projection displays. Such scanner requires a large mirror size, large scan angles, and a high frequency to ensure good optical resolutions. However, these conditions also induce large dynamic deformations on the mirror plate, resulting in optical aberrations. This dissertation describes a new design of two-dimensional micro scanner with good dynamic atness. The design targeted to achieve a resolution analogue to VGA video requirements (640 pixels x 480 pixels) with a modulation transfer function (MTF) value of 0. 5. Another portion of the dissertation {{is dedicated to the}} fracture strength investigations of single crystal silicon torsion <b>springs.</b> The <b>fracture</b> strength knowledge will contribute to the design of a reliable micro scanner under high frequency, large angle actuation conditions. The demonstrated two-dimensional micro scanner has a high horizontal scanning frequency of 30. 84 kHz and a low vertical scanning frequency of 335 Hz. It has two special features to enhance the mirror plate atness: 1. the backside islands to increase rigidity and 2. the multiple-joint torsion springs to evenly distribute forces onto the mirror plate. A novel DRIE-TMAH combination process was developed to fabricate the backside islands with an average height of 86 um and > 96 % within-wafer uniformity. When operated with a mechanical scan angle of 4. 8 °, the 1 mm diameter mirror plate had a root-mean-square dynamic deformation of 13. 86 nm. This translates to a 25 nm deformation at +- 10 °, which is less than 1 / 20 wavelength of the 635 nm light source. The MTF of the scanner was calculated based on the deformations and proved the scanner's ability to achieve a VGA resolution with 0. 5 MTF. Another part of the dissertation documents the findings of the fractures strength experiments performed with single crystal silicon torsion springs. Three types of specimens with different sizes and stress distributions were fabricated for the experiments. The specimens were actuated to different angles to determine the stress levels at which the <b>springs</b> <b>fracture.</b> Fitting the fractures stress data with a two-parameter Weibull distribution function, the characteristic stresses of the three specimen types were found to be 3. 10 GPa, 2. 51 GPa, and 4. 76 GPa. Among them, the design with the highest stress concentration and lowest surface roughness exhibits the highest fracture strength. This indicates a high stress concentration to be desirable for torsion spring designs. A normalized characteristic stress was implemented to attempt the fracture strength prediction of a new device. However, the analyses demonstrated such predictions to be unreliable if the surface condition of the new device is {{different from that of the}} known and tested specimens...|$|R

40|$|The Gazda quarry {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{outcrops}} of the present-day Süttő travertine complex that is situated close to the town of Süttő (Hungary), in the Pannonian Basin. Sedimentological and petrographical analyses show that the Gazda travertine body is built out of phytohermal, wavy laminated, massive and flat laminated travertine lithofacies representing reed mound, slope, lacustrine and palustrine depositional environments, respectively. Based on petrographic analyses, the following three main textural features were recognized that allow to describe the most common microscopic features: (1) micrite textures; (2) micritic coatings and crusts; and (3) different types of clasts. Each major lithofacies is characterized by a particular association of these textural types. The geometry of the travertine beds follows the antecedent land-surface, a NE-SW striking pre-Pleistocene valley. It is proposed that in this valley travertine precipitation took place along a gently sloping terrain. The Gazda travertine system was fed by at least two groundwater-springs. One of them was located NE of the quarry from which waters were flowing along the axis of the valley. The other source was located to the East of the Gazda quarry and waters joined the main water-course along the valley. Closest to the confluence, a phytohermal mound developed with lateral slope and eventual pond depositional systems. Onlapping and interfingering with the flat laminated lithofacies indicate alternating activity of the two <b>springs.</b> <b>Fractures</b> observed in the quarry are mainly related to postdepositional gravitational sliding, however, neotectonic forces resulting in SE–NW tension also played a role in the formation of the fractures. Stable oxygen and carbon isotope analyses show that water temperature was approximately 25 °C. Petrographic studies indicate that only syn-diagenetic processes affected the precipitates. Therefore the original stable oxygen isotope signatures, characteristic of the depositional environment, were preserved. Detailed sedimentological and geochemical study of the Gazda travertine complex allowed small-scale facies characterization providing information about the ancient depositional environment and the heterogeneous nature of these carbonates...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is a multi-physics multi-scale problem {{related to}} natural {{processes such as}} the formation of dikes. It also has wide engineering applications such as extraction of unconventional resources, enhanced geothermal energy and carbon capture and storage. Current simulators are highly simplified because of the assumption of homogeneous reservoir. Unconventional reservoirs are heterogeneous owing {{to the presence of}} natural fracture network. Because of high computational effort, three-dimensional multi-scale simulations are uncommon, in particular, modelling material as a heterogeneous medium. Lattice Element Method (LEM) is therefore proposed for multi-scale simulation of heterogeneous material. In LEM, material is discretised into cells and their interactions are modelled by lattices, hence a three-dimensional model is simplified to a network of one-dimensional lattice. Normal, shear and rotational springs are used to define the constitutive laws of a lattice. LEM enables desktop computers for simulation of a lattice model that consists of millions of lattices. From simulations, normal springs govern the macroscopic bulk deformation while shear springs govern the macroscopic distortion. There is fluctuation of stresses even under uniform loading {{which is one of the}} characteristics of a lattice model. The magnitude increases with the stiffness ratio of shear spring to normal <b>spring.</b> <b>Fracturing</b> process can be modelled by LEM by introducing a microscopic tensile strength and a microscopic shear strength to the lattice properties. The strength parameters can be related to fracture toughness with the length scales of cells. From simulations, the relationships between model parameters and macroscopic parameters that are measurable in experiments are identified. From the simulations of uni-axial tension tests, both the spring stiffness ratio and the applied heterogeneity govern the fracturing process. The heterogeneity increases the ductility at the expense of the reduction on the macroscopic strengths. Different stages of fracturing are identified which are characterised by the model heterogeneity. Heterogeneous models go through the stages of the spatially distributed microscrack formation, the growth of multiple fracture clusters to the dominant fracture propagation. For homogeneous models, one of the microcracks rapidly propagates and becomes a dominant fracture with the absence of intermediate stages. From the uni-axial compression test simulations, the peak compressive stress is reached at the onset of the microscopic shear crack formation. Ductility is governed by the stiffness reduction ratio of a lattice in closed fractured stage to its unfractured stage. A novel Dual Lattice Model (DLM) is proposed for hydraulic fracture simulation by coupling a solid lattice model with a fluid lattice model. From DLM simulations of hydraulic fracturing of the classical penny shape crack problem under hydrostatic condition, the heterogeneities from both the fracture asperity and the applied heterogeneity increase the apparent fracture toughness. A semi-analytical solution is derived to consider the effect of fluid viscosity in the elastic deformation regime. Two asymptotes are identified that gives steep pressure gradients near the injection point and near the fracture tip which are also identified in the DLM simulations. Simulations also show three evolving regimes on energy dissipation/transfer mechanisms: the viscosity dominant, the elastic deformation dominant and the mixture of elastic deformation and toughness.

Methods: We analyzed data from the Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women (GLOW), including women aged >= 55 years from the United States of America, Canada, Australia and seven European countries. Women completed questionnaires including fracture data at baseline and years 1, 2 and 3. Results: Among 60, 393 postmenopausal women, 4122 incident fractures were reported (86 % non-hip, non-vertebral [NHNV], 8 % presumably clinical vertebral and 6 % hip). Hip fractures {{were more likely to}} occur in spring, with little seasonal variation for NHNV or spine fractures. Hip fractures occurred equally inside or outside the home, whereas 65 % of NHNV fractures occurred outside and 61 % of vertebral fractures occurred inside the home. Falls preceded 68 - 86 % of NHNV and 68 - 83 % of hip fractures among women aged = 85 years, increasing with age. About 45 % of vertebral fractures were associated with falls in all age groups except those >= 85 years, when only 24 % occurred after falling.

Predictions of the recharge areas were most robust in situations of strong competition by neighbouring springs while the catchment boundaries for isolated springs were extremely sensitive to the parameter controlling flow direction. Validation using a different pesticide showed the best agreement with the simplest model used, whereas using historical crop-rotation data and spatially distributed soil-leaching data did not improve predictions.

Moreover, the upper part of the karst around the observatory appears to be representative of slow transfer of the whole catchment. Indeed, slow transfer estimated on the site fully supports the low-flow discharge at the only spring which represents all groundwater outflows from the catchment. In the last part of the paper, reservoir models are used to characterize the water transfer and storage processes. Particular highlights are done on the advantages of continuous gravity data (compared to repeated campaigns) and on the importance of local accurate meteorological data to limit misinterpretation of the gravity observations. The results are complementary with previous studies at the basin scale and show a clear potential for continuous gravity time-series assimilation in hydrological simulations, even on heterogeneous karstic systems...|$|R
40|$|In karst settings, {{hydrograph}} separations using isotopic tracers {{are commonly}} and effectively used {{to quantify the}} proportions of rain rapidly delivered to <b>springs</b> along <b>fractures</b> and conduits during storm events. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is an effective, non‐conservative tracer for use in hydrograph separations of karst waters because of the ubiquitous nature of carbon in the sources of waters to caves and springs and unique concentrations and isotopic compositions of carbon inputs. DIC concentration and isotopic composition (δ¹³C‐DIC) in rain are typically calculated based on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) using equilibrium carbonate reactions and stable carbon isotope fractionation values. As atmospheric CO₂ changes, traditional assumptions applied in attaining calculated values can result in error, and better estimates of rain DIC are needed. The concentration and isotopic composition of rain DIC in the karst of northwestern Arkansas was calculated using Python™ programming language based on local atmospheric CO₂ and rain pH data from 2011 to 2013. Python™ provides an open‐source code and rapid means to complete iterative calculations, and the PECCI code (Python™ Estimation for Carbon Concentration and Isotopes) {{can be used for}} rain DIC calculations in other areas. Measured northwestern Arkansas atmospheric CO₂ had a median concentration of 397. 7 ± 4. 3 ppm and increased slightly over three years and median δ¹³C‐CO₂ was ‐ 8. 5 ± 0. 4 ‰. Rain samples exhibited a median pH of 5. 6 ± 0. 4. Calculated rain DIC ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 34 mg/L and δ 13 C‐DIC ranged from ‐ 8. 5 ‰ to ‐ 8. 2 ‰ between 5 and 30 °C. At an average annual temperature of 14. 6 °C, rain DIC was calculated to be 0. 25 mg/L and δ¹³C‐DIC was ‐ 8. 34 ‰. Although the variations in DIC are small, the concentration and isotopic composition of end‐member sources in hydrograph separations controls the final hydrologic budget calculations. The PECCI code can be modified to calculate rain DIC for otherstudy sites or time periods...|$|R
5000|$|Hanh {{introduces}} the five aggregates {{as a method}} for realizing the interconnectedness and {{the changing nature of}} the self, as represented by the aggregates, and the outside world. Realizing interconnectedness and the changing nature of reality is a step toward liberation from the false view, which sees the world and the self as separate and unchanging entities. By realizing oneness with ourselves and the outside of ourselves, we experience liberation from the fear and anxiety of the discriminating view of the world, one that fractures reality into separate, unchanging units, brings. When we perceive the illusion of the isolated, unchanging self, we reach a level of wisdom the author calls [...] "non-discrimination mind". This state of seeing shows us that there is nothing out there to get, nothing to strive for, nothing to fear, as all these are an illusion <b>springing</b> from a <b>fractured</b> perception of reality. Reality is already perfect, unified, and our struggle is to see that truth, and be liberated from our chains of false perception that fractures everything into separate units. There is, in other words, no difference between the perceiver and the object being perceived; there is no separation between the self and the world.|$|R
40|$|Embolization of {{catheter}} fragments or <b>fractured</b> <b>spring</b> guidewires {{used during}} cardiac catheterization or fractured {{central venous pressure}} (CVP) lines is not uncommon. Although CVP lines are usually used in seriously ill patients, often with complications secondary to prior surgical intervention, if the catheter fragments are not removed they can give rise to serious illness or death in about 50 % of patients. Experience with the removal of nine such catheter fragments is reported. In eight patients a helical basket was available for removal through a Dotter retrieval catheter. With prolonged hyperalimentation therapy polyethylene catherters become very brittle. They are relatively easy to grip with the wire basket. Silicone elastomer catheters remain pliable but are so bouncy that they are difficult to grip. For removal of catheter fragments from vessels of small diameter, such as the subclavian vein, or vessels in which the catheter has to take an acute bend to enter, such as the right or left pulmonary artery, a smaller, more pliable Bean-Smith-Mahorner biliary stone helical basket was adapted by extending the length of wire to 100 cm. For removal of catheter fragments from the right pulmonary artery it is probably better to use a softer, 100 -cm-long no. 8 French right heart catheter. A Dotter retriever catheter set with {{both large and small}} helical wire baskets should be available in any cardiac catheterization laboratory...|$|R

Anthropogenic land-use activities can affect regional biophysical processes and functioning of neighboring land areas impacting {{the human and}} natural communities found in these areas. Karst landforms add complexity to land-use management. The term "karst" describes predominately limestone and dolostone landforms weathered primarily through a chemical dissolution process. Over geologic time, karst features including sinkholes, bedrock <b>springs</b> and <b>fractures,</b> sinking streams and caves form on and under the land surface. Studies that further our understanding of land cover and land use, especially in sensitive land areas can inform and improve land management and policy development for those areas. Through three projects, this thesis examined land and land-use characteristics in a regional karst landscape. Physical spring characteristics were analyzed {{to determine whether a}} subset of spring characteristics can discriminate springs into bedrock units or aquifer units. A subset of characteristics was found that discriminated the springs into both bedrock units and aquifer units. Springs had a clumped distribution on the landscape with most springs found at low elevations. For the second project, land pattern metrics were examined for a county-delineated land area and compared with pattern metrics in the major watershed overlying that county area. Differences between patterns of variation in metrics for the watershed versus the county area including greater fragmentation in the county landscape, fewer components of variation in the watershed and greater importance of land cover diversity in the watershed. For the last project, local municipal protection of regional natural resource processes was examined by determining the extent of local policy coverage on landscape functions and ecosystem services. Current coverage and gaps were identified. Policy changes directed at incorporating landscape functions into land-use planning were presented. This research provides new information about spring characteristics, land pattern metrics, and policy coverage of natural resources and ecosystem services, contributing to the accumulation of knowledge of land use and land cover characteristics, especially for karst regions, including that found in southeast Minnesota...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{building}} construction along the Mississippi River bluffs in the 1970 s created a unique enclosed outcrop of the Late Ordovician Platteville Formation at Lilydale, Minnesota. This outcrop was examined in early 2013 after a newly-formed spring flooded an elevator shaft the previous year, {{drawing attention to}} the foundation conditions. The Lexington Riverside property is a six story condominium complex constructed within {{the top of the}} bluff. A two-level underground parking garage was built into the bluff. Bedrock was mechanically excavated to accommodate the construction of the building, creating an unweathered rock surface. The space between the structure and the excavated rock face, running for 150 meters, was roofed over, and is used as a utility space. At least three dominantly carbonate members of the Platteville Formation are visible: Mifflin, Hidden Falls, and Magnolia, in ascending order. The foundation of the structure was constructed on the lowermost Platteville limestone and Glenwood shale and is tile-drained to the nearby river gorge. Most of the seeps and springs on the property, both inside and on the grounds, belong to the three Platteville spring-lines identified for the Twin Cities Metropolitan (TCM) area by Brick (1997). Groundwater emanates from both vertical joints and horizontal bedding plane partings within the Platteville limestone and at the Platteville–Glenwood shale contact. Overall, the hydrostratigraphic attributes of this site are consistent with how the Platteville has been recently characterized in the TCM area in a fractured bluff edge setting (Anderson et al., 2011). The enclosed outcrop features many seep- and spring-related mineral deposits. Most notable were the iron-stained flowstone and microgours near the seeps and <b>springs</b> along <b>fractures</b> in the limestone, and calcite rafts on the surfaces of the pools. At some damp locations a fungal ecosystem has developed. Gypsum beards have grown in dry portions of the cavern. This man-made cavern, and others nearby, present unique opportunities to research groundwater flow in fractured bedrock settings. Studying the spring locations relative to joints and bedding, changes in spring flow rate over time, and mineral deposition rates, are possible in this accessible location without the complication of surface water inputs or instrumental interference from the general public...|$|R
40|$|Loess Plateau is {{of great}} {{significance}} to the hydrology in the Yellow River Basin, and interactions between surface water and groundwater at Loess Plateau, especially at the Hilly and Gully Region, are important preconditions for water resources evaluation and ecological restoration. For this aim, Chabagou Catchment in the Hilly and Gully Region was chosen to study interactions between the two by integrating hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and hydrochemistry. In Chabagou Catchment, precipitation, surface water and groundwater were observed and sampled systematically; two trips of instantaneous sampling, including surface water and groundwater, were performed in June and August of 2005, with electrical conductivity (EC) and pH values tested in situ. The isotopic compositions and EC of surface water varied greatly and had different trends along the stream. The isotopic compositions of surface runoff concentrated along the mainstream. EC increased in June, but in August, it decreased from upper to middle reaches and then increased at the lower reaches. Variation of isotopic compositions in groundwater was small while it was large for EC. According to the isotopic and hydrochemical information of instantaneous sampling, relationships between surface water and groundwater has been identified. In dry season, low flow surface water is recharged by contact <b>spring</b> in <b>fractured</b> bedrock, and evaporates severely during flow. In rainy season, peak runoff recedes quickly and only groundwater adjacent to the mainstream or gullies can get recharge during flood; when pea runoff recedes, surface runoff mainly gets recharge from spring water and surface water held up by silt arresters at the upper reaches; increasing recharge of contact springs and runoff in branches reduces EC of surface water at the middle reaches; while at the lower reaches, recharge from spring and branches decreases and surface water gets severe evaporation along the mainstream. No matter in dry season or in rainy season when peak runoff recedes, surface water experiences serious evaporation, and only phreatic aquifers near mainstream can get recharge from surface runoff and experiences severe groundwater evaporation. Silt arresters can obviously hold up surface runoff and increase the adjacent groundwater and baseflow. The enhanced evaporation caused by silt arresters may concentrate the total dissolved solid of surface water at upper layers, while its influence on groundwater quality of groundwater is not apparent yet and calls for further study...|$|R

During variuous field work campaigns, 26 locations were sampled and where further studied at two different laboratories concurrently. Specifically designed sheets and data collecting allowed sampling on site, recollecting information regarding location {{and access to the}} springs, hidrogeological and physicochemical parameters and aquifers. Springs were coded in order to permit an expansion of the project, adjusting them to studies around Catalunya and/or elsewhere. Results show that meteorology could have had an impact on sampling, nonetheless, 4 groups and 6 typologies were found in accordance to their hidrogeology: springs on crystallinic materials including <b>fracture</b> <b>springs,</b> springs on altered material, springs related to floodbanks, springs in regional faults and springs on quaternary sediment which correspond to alluvial formations. The majority of these waters are human-consumption ready, except for sparkling springs given their high fluoride content. Hidrochemical classification reveals that springs can be divided into sulfated, chlorinated and bicarbonated wateres these being continental waters in contact with short granitic medium thus have a poor chemical evolution. Finally, an evaluation was carried out, with the intention of determining which springs have the richest heritage.
