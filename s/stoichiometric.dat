5|$|Catalytic {{variants}} employing <b>stoichiometric</b> diallylcarbonate {{and other}} allylic carbonates {{have also been}} developed, primarily by Jiro Tsuji. For these the choice of solvent is essential: nitrile solvents produce the desired enones while ethereal solvents produce α-allyl ketones instead.|$|E
5|$|The major {{advances}} in catalytic {{versions of this}} reaction have steered towards co-oxidants that regenerate the palladium(II) species effectively. Specifically, conditions using atmospheric oxygen as well as <b>stoichiometric</b> allylcarbonate have been developed.|$|E
5|$|This method {{suffers from}} long {{reaction}} times and often produces significantly lower yields than the <b>stoichiometric</b> equivalent as showcased in {{the synthesis of}} platyphillide by Nishida. The contrast of the two methods highlights the catalytic method's shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of the {{intrinsic}} magnetic field on Venus, the solar wind penetrates relatively deep into the planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss. The loss happens mainly via the magnetotail. Currently the main ion types being lost are O+, H+ and He+. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen losses is around 2 (i.e. almost <b>stoichiometric)</b> indicating the ongoing loss of water.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{efforts to}} improve the selectivity of the Nazarov cyclization took advantage of the β-silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step. This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in the mid-1980s and utilizes <b>stoichiometric</b> amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction. With bicyclic products, the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} described, the Nazarov cyclization {{involves the}} activation of a divinyl ketone using a <b>stoichiometric</b> Lewis acid or protic acid promoter. The key {{step of the}} reaction mechanism involves a cationic 4π-electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product (See Mechanism below). As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested <b>stoichiometric</b> ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} reagents employed in a <b>stoichiometric</b> fashion are shown below. The {{first is a}} bicyclic oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β-adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) but {{is limited by the}} availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent. The synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E
5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct <b>stoichiometric</b> ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full <b>stoichiometric</b> quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E

25|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} is always positive. A negative sign is present {{to indicate that}} the reactant concentration is decreasing.) The IUPAC recommends that the unit of time should always be the second. The rate of reaction differs from the rate of increase of concentration of a product P by a constant factor (the reciprocal of its <b>stoichiometric</b> number) and for a reactant A by minus the reciprocal of the <b>stoichiometric</b> number. The <b>stoichiometric</b> numbers are included so that the defined rate is independent of which reactant or product species is chosen for measurement. For example, if a = 1 and b = 3 then B is consumed three times more rapidly than A, but v = -d/dt = -(1/3)d/dt is uniquely defined.|$|E

Linear programming is then used to calculate a solution of fluxes corresponding to the steady state.|$|E

This section describes {{the most commonly used}} conditions for the <b>stoichiometric</b> and catalytic oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds with oxoammonium salts. Although a wide variety of alcohols may be oxidized using TEMPO, competitive oxidation of more electron-rich functionality sometimes takes place. In addition, the site selectivity of oxidation of polyols may differ depending on the conditions used.|$|E
25|$|Gorban–Yablonsky theorem.

Physically, the last condition means that the irreversible reactions cannot be included in oriented cyclic pathways.|$|E

25|$|The formyl {{group can}} be readily reduced to a primary alcohol (−CH2OH). Typically this {{conversion}} is accomplished by catalytic hydrogenation either directly or by transfer hydrogenation. <b>Stoichiometric</b> reductions are also popular, as can be effected with sodium borohydride.|$|E
25|$|Oxoammonium-catalyzed {{oxidation}} reactions {{involve the}} conversion of organic substrates to more highly oxidized materials through the action of an N-oxoammonium species.

25|$|Under basic conditions, two {{equivalents}} of oxidant {{are needed}} because of competitive comproportionation between reduced nitroxide and unreacted oxoammonium (see equation (3) above).

25|$|Background {{pressure}} – Common in oxide deposition, {{an oxygen}} background {{is needed to}} ensure <b>stoichiometric</b> transfer from the target to the film.

25|$|Iron pentacarbonyl {{has been}} found to be a strong flame speed {{inhibitor}} in oxygen based flames. A few hundred ppm of iron pentacarbonyl are known to reduce the flame speed of <b>stoichiometric</b> methane–air flame by almost 50%. However due to its toxic nature it has not been used widely as a flame retardant.|$|E
25|$|The exponents n and m {{are called}} {{reaction}} orders and {{depend on the}} reaction mechanism. For elementary (single-step) reactions the order with respect to each reactant is equal to its <b>stoichiometric</b> coefficient.

25|$|Corey-Itsuno {{reduction}}, {{also known}} as the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata reduction, is an enantioselctive reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the <b>stoichiometric</b> reductant. The Corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols. The reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the CBS catalyst (scheme 9).|$|E
25|$|Although only a {{catalytic}} {{amount of}} base {{is required in}} some cases, the more usual procedure {{is to use a}} <b>stoichiometric</b> amount of a strong base such as LDA or NaHMDS. In this case, enolate formation is irreversible, and the aldol product is not formed until the metal alkoxide of the aldol product is protonated in a separate workup step.|$|E
25|$|In geology, {{substances}} {{of uniform}} composition are called minerals, while physical mixtures (aggregates) of several minerals (different substances) {{are defined as}} rocks. Many minerals, however, mutually dissolve into solid solutions, such that a single rock is a uniform substance despite being a mixture in <b>stoichiometric</b> terms. Feldspars are a common example: anorthoclase is an alkali aluminum silicate, where the alkali metal is interchangeably either sodium or potassium.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, fire is {{intensified}} {{by increasing the}} overall rate of combustion. Methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to <b>stoichiometric</b> proportions, increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix, increasing the ambient temperature so the fire's own heat is better able to sustain combustion, or providing a catalyst; a non-reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react.|$|E
