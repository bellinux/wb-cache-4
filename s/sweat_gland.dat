25|$|Sebaceous gland {{activity}} (which is {{triggered by}} androgens) lessens, reducing oil production {{on the skin}} and scalp. Consequently, the skin becomes less prone to acne. It also becomes drier, and lotions or oils may be necessary. The pores become smaller because of the lower quantities of oil being produced. Many apocrine glands – a type of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> – become inactive, and body odor decreases. Remaining body odor becomes less metallic, sharp, or acrid, and more sweet and musky.|$|E
25|$|Biofeedback {{is a form}} of {{alternative}} medicine that involves measuring a subject's quantifiable bodily functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> activity, and muscle tension, conveying the information to the patient in real-time. This raises the patient's awareness and conscious control of his or her unconscious physiological activities. Neal Miller is generally considered the father of modern-day biofeedback. Miller theorized the basic principles of biofeedback by applying his theory that classical and operant conditioning were both the result of a common learning principle in 1961. Miller hypothesized that any measurable physiological behavior within the human body would respond in some way to voluntary control.|$|E

Interestingly enough, the outcome to the recall of the grudge the candidates’ blood pressure and heart rate increased, and they sweated more.

2500|$|Biofeedback {{is often}} used to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of relaxation training, because it feeds back information to the chronic headache sufferer about the [...] "body's (biological) current state". One of the most common biofeedback tests is the Electromyograph (EMG), which evaluates the “electrical activity” produced by muscles. Biofeedback also can measure electrical brain activity through a test called the Electroencephalograph (EEG). Another test, called the thermograph, measures skin temperature, because when a person is relaxed they have increased blood flow and a higher temperature. Another method is BVP biofeedback training, which improves chronic headaches by teaching a patient how to regulate and decrease arterial pulse amplitudes by restricting the arteries. When tense, a person's <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> activity increases, which is measured by electrodermograph testing of the hands. Biofeedback methods have been proven to work. A study involving fifteen treatment sessions found that biofeedback was [...] "successful in reducing both frequency and severity of headache at discharge and over time". Biofeedback allows headache sufferers to identify problems and then seek to reduce them.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To make a {{quantitative}} evaluation by image analysis of oestrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and androgen receptors in papillary hidradenomas and anogenital <b>sweat</b> <b>glands.</b> METHODS: 20 papillary hidradenomas and the anogenital <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> detected in surgical specimens selected from 10 vulvectomies for squamous carcinoma, eight haemorrhoidectomies, and one anal polypectomy, all from female patients, were {{investigated by the}} avidinstreptavidin peroxidase testing system. RESULTS: 90 % of papillary hidradenomas and almost all the anogenital <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> showed immunoreactivity for oestrogen receptor and, more weakly, for progesterone receptor, with immunolabelled nuclear area ranging from 10 % to 90 %. Conversely conventional <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> did not show any nuclear staining. Overexpression of androgen receptors occurred in 20 % of papillary hidradenomas, with nuclear staining strictly bordering papillary epithelium with apocrine differentiation. There was no immunoreactivity for androgen receptors in anogenital <b>sweat</b> <b>glands.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Oestrogen and progesterone receptors seem to represent reliable markers for differentiating between anogenital <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> and conventional <b>sweat</b> <b>glands,</b> and a further link to explain why papillary hidradenomas occur almost exclusively in the female anogenital region. Positivity for oestrogen/progesterone receptors suggests that epithelia either of anogenital <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> or of papillary hidradenomas are controlled by ovarian steroid hormones. Androgen receptor nuclear staining of the epithelium with apocrine differentiation in vulvar papillary hidradenoma strengthens its homology with breast duct papilloma...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and function of}} aquaporins (AQPs) have not previously been defined in <b>sweat</b> <b>glands.</b> In this study, AQP 1, AQP 3, and AQP 5 mRNA were demonstrated in rat paw by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR, but AQP 2 and AQP 4 were not. AQP 1, AQP 3, and AQP 5 protein were confirmed in these tissues by immunoblotting. AQP 1 was identified in capillary endothelial cells by immunohistochemical labeling, but not in <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> or epidermis. Abundant AQP 3 expression was seen in basal levels of epidermis, but not in <b>sweat</b> <b>glands.</b> AQP 2 and AQP 4 were not observed in either skin or <b>sweat</b> <b>glands.</b> Immunohistochemical labeling revealed abundant AQP 5 in secretory parts of rat and mouse <b>sweat</b> <b>glands,</b> where immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated abundant AQP 5 labeling in the apical plasma membrane. AQP 5 immunolabeling of human <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> yielded a similar pattern. To establish the role of AQP 5 in sweat secretion, we tested the response of adult mice to s. c. injection of pilocarpine, as visualized by reaction of secreted amylase with iodine/starch. The number of active <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> was dramatically reduced in AQP 5 -null (-/-) mice compared with heterozygous (+/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice. We conclude {{that the presence of}} AQP 5 in plasma membranes of <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> is essential for secretion, providing potential insight into mechanisms underlying mammalian thermoregulation, tactile sensitivity, and the pathophysiology of hyperhidrosis. ...|$|R
5000|$|Discussion of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> tumors can be {{difficult}} and confusing due to the complex classification and redundant terminology {{used to describe the}} same tumors.
