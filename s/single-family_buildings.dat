50|$|The Roaring Spring Historic District {{is located}} within the Borough of Roaring Spring, a paper-mill town of about 2,600 {{established}} in the late 1860s in southern Blair County, south-central Pennsylvania.1 Roaring Spring is situated within the northwest quadrant of a long bowl-like valley known as Morrisons Cove, {{one of dozens of}} long but broad valleys in Pennsylvania's Ridge and Valley region. The town developed just southeast of a natural pass into the valley called McKee's Gap where an important iron smelting business (Martha Furnace) operated through the mid 19th century. The site of Roaring Spring is moderately hilly, drained by Cabbage and Halter Creeks. The most prominent natural feature is the Big Spring, or Roaring Spring, a large natural limestone spring so-called because of the great noise its eight-million-gallon-a-day stream once made rushing out of the hillside near the village center.2 Roaring Spring is overwhelmingly residential (91 percent) in scale, but also includes churches, stops, professional offices, a municipal building, parks, a cemetery, a book factory complex, and a former railroad station. Most houses are two-story, wood-frame <b>single-family</b> <b>buildings</b> situated on lots of 1/5 acre to 1/7 acre. The largest segment of the building stock between 1865 and 1944 was constructed between the 1890s and 1930s. Architecturally, the district contains a variety of late 19th to early 20th century styles and vernacular building types, including Gothic Revival, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Bungalow, Foursquare, Gable Fronts, Gable Fronts & Wings, I Houses, and double-pile Georgian types. Ninety (90) percent of the district's 643 properties is rated as contributing. The remaining 10 percent consists of buildings less than 50 years old (constructed after 1944) or older buildings whose architectural integrity has been lost through inappropriate alterations. Overall, most alterations, such as inappropriate replacement of windows, doors and porch posts, are reversible if desired.|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that {{the concentration of}} people in high-density urban city centers, which are typically dominated by medium- and high-rise buildings located close to public transit systems, offers greater overall energy efficiency and lower life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than lower-density expanded suburbs, which are dominated by low-rise <b>single-family</b> <b>buildings</b> and larger per-person automobile travel requirements. However, few studies have combined quantitative analyses of the life-cycle energy use of both buildings and transportation in both urban and suburban areas, especially in American cities. This work uses a variety of data sources to provide a quantitative comparison of the life-cycle energy consumption associated with residential life (including buildings, transportation, and supporting infrastructure) in prototypical downtown high-rises and suburban low-rises in and around Chicago, IL. We estimate that downtown high-rise living in Chicago, IL accounts for approximately 25 % more life-cycle energy per person per year than suburban low-rise living, on average, contrary to some common beliefs (best estimates were ~ 141 and ~ 113 GJ/person/year, respectively).

The existing housing stock represents a largeamount of the bought energy need for heating and a simple method forquickly determining the energy performance is needed. There are many different methods for estimating the energyperformance of buildings. In this report the feasibility of using asingle-variate steady state method to investigate energy performancehas been tested. Bought energy need in single-family houses in a coldclimate has been observed during the cold period. The observationshave been made {{with the help of}} a measurement system requiring aminimal installation. The heat loss factor of the observed buildingshas been determined using the energy signature approach and differenttime scales have been tried. The result shows that to determine the heat loss factor of single-familybuildings, a single-variate method is valid. Daily averages are a goodtime scale for houses using radiators under the windows to heat thebuilding. Buildings with floor heating in concrete slab need to have alonger time scale, around 3 days. The method does not account for occupancy levels and separateenergy use in specific installations is not easy to estimate with theminimalized measurement setup. A combination of heat sources suchas district heating, electrical heating, heat recovery and/or fire stove isproblematic to handle with the energy signature method if enoughobservations for al heat sources can be achieved.

By comparing different configurations of micro-CHP systems, [16] quantified the behavior of integrated hybrid solar thermal, photovoltaic (PV), and micro-CHP systems. Based on linear programming techniques, [17] addressed the optimal sizing of hybrid micro-CHP to satisfy the energy demand in dwellings. In order to design superior integrated systems, [18] reviewed the existing design options for heating systems incorporating fuel cell micro-CHP in dwellings, motivating a new methodology considering all possible interconnections of plant. [19] explored the potential overall benefit of integrating a resistor for storage heating, which acts as a power sink when needed, presenting a cost-minimizing control strategy for a residential micro-CHP system. Considering fuel cell output compared to user thermal and electrical demand, [12] employed four operational modes to evaluate the system behavior under both for the electrical-led and thermal-led operation in <b>single-family</b> <b>buildings.</b> To fulfill domestic user energy demand and reduce the primary energy consumption, [20] investigated the potential to integrate a solid oxide fuel cell prime mover and ZEBRA batteries by comparing alternative micro-CHP technologies. By considering two heat-led operational strategies, [21] addressed the economic optimization of a micro-CHP system during the cold season for multi-apartment housing. The four different micro-CHP systems are analyzed in [22] to evaluate the effect of heat dumping on economic performance and emission of pollutants. To investigate various designs of a district heating pipe network, [23] constructed an objective formula to minimize the annual total energy consumption and costs so as to arrive at the optimal flow rate and supply temperature operating strategy. To achieve comprehensive use of solar energy, [24] designed and constructed an integrated solar house with solar PV system, direct-gain solar system and an advanced building envelope (e.g. Low-E glass window, flat-opening airtight door, double-layer polyurethane insulation wall, etc.) to perform an experimental study of solar energy, energy efficiency and energy balance.|$|E
30|$|The {{nature of}} damages and {{fatalities}} experienced during the Boumerdes earthquake (2003) ordinarily {{should not be}} associated with a nation such as Algeria which have well established seismic regulations. Seismic regulations were first established in Algeria after the severe Earthquake of El Asnam October 10, 1980 (magnitude 7.3). Algerian Seismic Regulation 81 (RPA 81) was the first regulation established to reduce the impact of earthquakes on buildings and other infrastructure (Zermout et al. 2014). Over the years, the RPA 81 has undergone several revisions like RPA 83, 88 and 99. The RPA 99 regulation has recently been revised to a newer version RPA 99 /Version 2003 (CGS, 2003) in response to the May 2003 Zemmouri earthquake (Zermout et al. 2014). This is a clear indication that seismic regulations have been in existence prior to the 2003 earthquake, yet catastrophic failure of structures was reported all around Boumerdes. This implies that the existing code was not implemented and enforced for control of construction in seismic prone regions in Algiers and other regions of Algeria. It is therefore imperative for the government of Algeria to seek out policies which would ensure enforcement of the existing regulations to prevent future risk in the event of earthquakes. One strategy which has been suggested by Bendimerad (2004) to prevent future extensive damages and chaos during earthquakes and other similar disasters is the simplification of the existing seismic code for easy adaption for <b>single-family</b> <b>buildings.</b> Also, the enlightenment of citizens on the importance of adhering to seismic code for design and construction of structures, and stringent enforcement of seismic codes for all civil structures would reduce the economic and human losses usually recorded during earthquakes. Bendimerad (2004) similarly suggested that retrofitting of already existing vulnerable buildings in seismic prone regions could be considered a long term approach to reduce the losses associated with disasters in the major cities in Algeria. Meslem et al. (2012) stated in a post-earthquake investigation that the alarming extent of damages recorded in the Boumerdes 2003 event was attributed to the presence of non-engineered private buildings in the Boumerdes area. Since the existing Algerian seismic code at that time were only applied to public buildings. The report from the investigation also mentioned site condition as another factor which contributed to the severe damages recorded in buildings during the earthquake; and should be taken into consideration to prevent future destruction of similar nature. The findings in the report were drawn from the observation that buildings erected on flat planes recorded slight damages compared to similar buildings erected on steep slopes and small hilltops. The authors therefore advised that site condition also be a key factor to consider when revising the seismic code for buildings in Algeria.|$|E

No change was identified in <b>single-family</b> <b>building</b> permits. Both airline passenger counts and manufacturing hours declined slightly during July. Further, initial unemployment insurance claims rose during the month, a negative signal for the labor market. Business expectations also fell during July. Respondents to the Survey of Nebraska Business predicted a slight decline in sales and employment at their business over the next six month. Finally, the value of the U. S. dollar rose again during July, continuing to pressure businesses that export, a significant concern in Nebraska with its large export industry...|$|R
40|$|The Leading Economic Indicator – Nebraska (LEI-N) {{increased}} by 0. 78 % during December 2013. The {{increase in the}} LEI-N, which predicts {{economic growth in the}} state six months in the future, follows a decline in November. Taken together, recent results for the LEI-N suggest that the Nebraska economy will grow only modestly {{in the second quarter of}} 2014, but that the rate of growth may begin to improve in June, as summer begins. During December, four components of the leading economic indicator expanded and two declined. Among expanding components, there was a solid increse in <b>single-family</b> <b>building</b> permits, consistent with the continued recovery of the housing industry in Nebraska. There also were modest increases in both airline passenger counts and manufacturing hours. Further, there was a modest improvement in business expectations. Respondents to the Survey of Nebraska Business predicted an increase in employment at their business over the next six month. Among declining components, initial unemployment claims rose in December on a seasonally-adjusted basis. There also was an increase in the value of the U. S. dollar, a negative for the state’s exporters...|$|R
40|$|The Leading Economic Indicator – Nebraska (LEI-N) rose by 0. 36 % during January 2013. The {{increase}} in the LEI-N, which predicts {{economic growth in the}} state six months in the future, suggests moderate economic growth in Nebraska in the summer of 2013. Looking at individual components of the LEI-N, four improved in January. There was strong growth in <b>single-family</b> <b>building</b> permits during January, reflecting significant improvement in the outlook for the housing sector over the last year. There also was modest improvement in airline passengers counts, a drop in initial claims for unemployment insurance, and a drop the value of the U. S. dollar during January. A drop in initial claims portends improvement in the labor market while a drop {{in the value of the}} dollar should lead to improved export activity. Among other components, there was a modest decline in manufacturing hours. Further, respondents to the Survey of Nebraska Business reported negative expectations for business sales and employment over the next six months. Business expectations have been negative for the past five months. Business expectations must improve in order to see strong growth in the Leading Economic Indicator – Nebraska...|$|R
40|$|Some form {{of federal}} code or {{standard}} for energy conservation in new building construction is incorporated into all {{state and local}} codes. The impact of such regulations {{from the standpoint of}} their importance to the residential data base developed by Gas Research Institute is examined, as they influence thermal requirements and reflect recent developments through their updates and revisions. The analyzed codes include ASHRAE 90. 2 P, 1990 Model Energy Code, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, and the Amendments of 1988. For the evaluation {{of the impact of the}} thermal envelope standards on the energy performance of a prototypical new single-family house, base case construction and modified standard buildings with characteristics typical of 1980 s- 1990 s are modeled with a building energy simulation program. The effects of appliance and heating and cooling equipment efficiency standards are also modeled. The study focuses on the changes that can be expected in new <b>single-family</b> <b>building</b> types with regard to heating, cooling, water heating, and other energy uses. The analysis concludes that new thermal standards can contribute to energy conservation in many U. S. climates...|$|R
