40|$|Problem statement: Accounting for {{uncertainties}} {{that are}} present in geometric and material data of reinforced concrete buildings is performed in this study {{within the context of}} performance based seismic engineering design. Approach: Reliability of the expected performance state is assessed by using various methodologies based on finite element nonlinear static pushover analysis and specialized reliability software package. Reliability approaches that were considered included full coupling with an external finite element code and surface response based methods in conjunction with either first order reliability method or importance sampling method. Various types of probability distribution functions that model parameters uncertainties were introduced. Results: The probability of failure according to the used reliability analysis method and to the <b>selected</b> <b>distribution</b> of probabilities was obtained. Convergence analysis of the importance sampling method was performed. The required duration of analysis as function of the used reliability method was evaluated. Conclusion/Recommendations: It was found that reliability results are sensitive to the used reliability analysis method and to the <b>selected</b> <b>distribution</b> of probabilities. Durations of analysis for coupling methods were found to be higher than those associated to surface response based methods; one should however include time needed to derive these lasts. For the reinforced concrete building considered in this study, it was found that significant variations exist between all the considered reliability methodologies. The full coupled importance sampling method is recommended, but the first order reliability method applied on a surface response model can be used with good accuracy. Finally, the distributions of probabilities should be carefully identified since giving the mean and the standard deviation were found to be insufficient.

30|$|Approximate {{aggregate}} interference distribution by known distribution [6, 9, 13, 14, 27, 32, 156 – 158]. It is well-studied {{that the}} CLT {{and the corresponding}} Gaussian model provide a very poor approximation for modeling aggregate interference statistics in large wireless cellular networks [30, 159, 160]. Its convergence can be measured by the Berry-Esseen inequality [161] and is typically thwarted by a few strong interferers. The resulting PDF exhibits a heavier tail than what is anticipated by the Gaussian model [30]. Resorting to the approximation of the aggregate interference distribution by a known parametric distribution imposes two challenges: (i) {{the choice of the}} distribution itself and (ii) the parametrization of the <b>selected</b> <b>distribution.</b> Although there is no known criterion for choosing the optimal PDF, its tractability for further performance metrics as well as the characteristics of the spatial model, the path loss law, and the fading statistics advertise certain candidate distributions [32].|$|E

The basis of effective flood risk management is a reliable frequency analysis that can be used for estimating event return period. An upgrade of the classical frequency analysis is the regional flood frequency analysis. Its main advantage is that it allows higher accuracy of flood forecasts also in areas with shorter or no measurements. Regional flood frequency analysis encompasses four steps: checking the accuracy and discordance of data, identification of homogeneous regions, choice of an appropriate frequency distribution for a region, and quantiles of the <b>selected</b> <b>distribution.</b> The most challenging part of this analysis is the identification of homogeneous hydrological regions. In this paper we present three methods that can be used for this step. The regional flood frequency analysis was performed for selected water gauging stations in Slovenia...|$|E

We use sum of least square error to measure of the quality how well an image is fitted to distribution. That P. d. f has minimum score in relation to sum of square error is chosen. Next, each image is quantized into 4 gray levels by applying thresholds to the c. d. f of the <b>selected</b> <b>distribution</b> of each channel. Finally, three quantized images are combined into one color image to obtain final segmentation result. To show the validity of the proposed method, experiments on some images are performed.

We use a set of real-world data to demonstrate how the software automatically specifies and ranks probability distributions, and then assists the analyst in deciding whether the "best" candidate distribution actually provides a good representation of the data. If no distribution provides a good fit, then ExpertFit can define an empirical distribution. In either case, the <b>selected</b> <b>distribution</b> is put into the proper format for direct input to the analyst's simulation software. We then consider the case of selecting a distribution in the absence of data. As an example, we show how ExpertFit can be used to specify time-to-failure and repair-time distributions for a machine that is subject to random downtimes...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} a good data {{distribution}} scheme is critical to performance of data-parallel applications on both distributed memory multiprocessors and NUMA shared memory multiprocessors. The high cost of interprocessor communication in distributed memory multiprocessors makes the minimization of communications the predominant issue in <b>selecting</b> data <b>distribution</b> schemes. However, on NUMA multiprocessors other issues such as contention, false sharing and cache affinity also affect performance. In this paper, we present empirical measurements which suggest that these issues cannot be ignored in <b>selecting</b> data <b>distribution</b> schemes.
