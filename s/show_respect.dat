5|$|The {{traditional}} {{beliefs of}} the Sihanaka, as elsewhere in Madagascar, revolve around respect for a creator god (Zanahary), the ancestors, and fady (ancestral interdictions). Aspects of ancestor worship among the Sihanaka include joro (collective prayers said to invoke the blessings of God or the ancestors), burial in family tombs, the famadihana reburial ceremony, and the sanctification of particular stones (tsangambato), land (tany masina), and shrines (doany, tony and jiro). Another major element of this tradition {{is the role of}} ambalavelona, believed to be the spirits of the ancestors themselves. Each ancestral practice or tradition has a particular spirit associated with it, and the Sihanaka <b>show</b> <b>respect</b> for these spirits by maintaining ancestral customs and traditions and adhering to fady.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{buildings}} extant {{at the royal}} city {{during the time of}} King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the political capital of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original roof thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid rosewood and topped by a peaked roof that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the roof of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The roof horns (tandrotrano) formed {{at each end of the}} roof peak by the crossing of the gable beams were originally silver-plated, and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle of the roof peak. Silver ornaments were also hung from the corners of the roof in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an exterior wall near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims come here to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to <b>show</b> <b>respect</b> for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the concept of old age and respect towards seniors, which gone through {{significant}} change during history and that is the reason why the status of seniors in society has decreased and youth gained prominence. The main goal of this thesis based on qualitative research is to find out the ways of <b>showing</b> <b>respect</b> to seniors and from which reasons it is so, while the accent is kept on perception of respect by four age generations. Observations and interviews revealed a discovery of typology of seniors and non-seniors, two forms of respect and four reasons of <b>showing</b> <b>respect.</b> The two main reasons of <b>showing</b> <b>respect</b> are perception of seniors as the weak ones or as heroes. The thesis develops forms and reasons of respect and thereby serves an insight into relationships and attitudes of young generations towards seniors. It revealed there are differences in ways of <b>showing</b> <b>respect</b> among generations. It should also give us pause to thought over sometimes big gap between these two worlds - youth and old age...|$|R
