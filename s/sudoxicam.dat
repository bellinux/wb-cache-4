40|$|Two {{antiplatelet}} drugs, pyridinolcarbamate and <b>Sudoxicam,</b> {{were tested}} separately and {{in combination with}} heparin {{for their ability to}} modify experimental hyperacute renal allograft rejection in primates. Pyridinolcarbamate delayed and amerliorated tissue injury and obstructive thrombosis but only minimally prolonged renal blood flow over that seen in untreated allografts, suggesting that graft failure was primarily due to vasoconstriction. <b>Sudoxicam,</b> an antiinflammatory agent, resulted in higher initial blood flow, but the duration of flow and graft survival were again only minimally prolonged. However, functional changes including C 3, Factor II and X consumption were prevented, a net increase in Factor VIII activity was minimized, and fibrinolysis was inhibited. The combined effects of pyridinolcarbamate and heparin resembled those of heparin alone. Combination of <b>Sudoxicam</b> with heparin was more effective than heparin along in preventing intrarenal complement consumption, sequestration of formed elements, activation of coagulation, and inhibition of fibrinolysis. However, the latter combination also failed to prolong venous flow and graft survival over that seen with heparin alone...|$|E
40|$|Six oxicams, <b>sudoxicam,</b> isoxicam, piroxicam, tenoxicam, {{meloxicam}} and lornoxicam, {{were compared}} {{in an attempt}} to understand why, despite close chemical structures, two of them were associated with an increased risk of toxicity in patients. Different factors have been revealed which may explain these differences. A weak association constant to human serum albumin (HSA), together with a high plasma concentration, favours a rapid increase in unbound concentration (C-u) when total plasma concentration rises (peak of absorption). Pathological states may enhance this increase when both HSA plasma concentration is decreased and free fatty acid concentrations are increased. However, the main cause of toxicity may be the existence in some subjects of HSA natural mutants whose ability to bind oxicams is markedly lower than norma...|$|E
