40|$|Workplace {{isolation}} {{has been}} recognized as a critical issue facing salespeople in field offices. Studies have recognized that field salespeople are physically and psychologically isolated, {{but there is little}} empirical research on the effects of perceived isolation on important job outcomes. One important issue {{that has yet to be}} considered is the effect of workplace isolation on trust in <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> coworkers. The current study uses a sample of pharmaceutical salespeople to replicate previous results pertaining to workplace isolation effects and to test an integrated model of workplace isolation, salesperson satisfaction, trust, organizational commitment, and overall job performance. The results reveal that perceptions of workplace isolation negatively affect trust in <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> coworkers and that the relationship between trust (in <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> coworkers) and organizational commitment is mediated by satisfaction with <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> coworkers. Further, the findings confirm previous research that indicates that organizational commitment is positively related to salesperson job performance...|$|R

The aim was to examine what is described as relationship difficulties, how they evaluate them and what meaning they assing to it. In connection with difficulties in relationship in this study I'm concerned also with the question, what is {{the perception of the}} supervisory relationship from the view of <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> supervisees and what characteristic of this relationship they consider to be important and what they expect from it. The topic is established on Bowlby's attachment theory. It is based on two concepts of the theory - a function of a safe haven and a function of a secure base. These functions are related to a creation of relationship and to relationship difficulties. This study focuses also on the issue if there's a connecting link between the way of reflection of relationship difficulties and the supervisory relationship by <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> supervisees and mentioned concepts of attachment theory.

In order to better understand goal-related feedback in Masterâ€™s thesis projects, the present study explores goals of students <b>and</b> <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> similarities and differences within and between supervision dyads. Twelve <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> students were interviewed, and their goals were categorized using a curricular perspective and personal goals perspective. Results indicated that most students <b>and</b> <b>supervisors</b> pursue both curricular and personal goals. Within dyads these goals vary greatly. Also, <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> students perceive each otherâ€™s goals in only a few cases. The findings suggest that goal-related feedback in Masterâ€™s thesis supervision appears to be complex, as the students <b>and</b> <b>supervisors</b> of this study (1) pursue different goals and (2) do not perceive each otherâ€™s goals. </p...|$|R

In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce's Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from the Oriental Saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday. Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday's revolver. But Holliday returned carrying a double-action revolver. Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce's business partner William Parker in the big toe. Joyce then hit Holliday {{over the head with}} his revolver. Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery.|$|E

Jeffrey as his <b>supervisor</b> <b>and</b> Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist Karl Sax.

The motivation for this study comes from the assumption that students feel stress during the practicum sessions due to the unethical behavior of <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> cooperating institutions. What {{is the nature of}} ethics followed by <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> cooperating institutes during the practicum? What are the reasons behind the unethical behavior of supervisors? What are the significant ethics which <b>supervisors</b> <b>and</b> cooperating institutes have to follow during the practicum? These are the questions which have been tried to get answered in this research paper. Researchers selected five public universities of Punjab. All Student Teachers (STs) enrolled in Education departments of selected five universities were target population of the study.
