500|$|Kelly {{said that}} Donen's {{impulsive}} marriage to Coyne showed an emotional immaturity {{and lack of}} good judgment, and stated that [...] "Jeannie's marriage to Stanley was doomed from the start. Because every time Stanley looked at Jeannie, he saw Betsy, whom he loved; and every time Jeannie looked at Stanley, I guess <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> One way or another it was all pretty incestuous." [...] Kelly's marriage to Blair ended in 1957, after which he moved in with Coyne. They married in 1960 and had two children together. Coyne died of leukemia in 1973. In November 2012 the musical What A Glorious Feeling depicted both the making of Singin' in the Rain and the love triangle between Donen, Kelly and Coyne.|$|E
500|$|By the {{following}} year, {{the case against}} Andrić was dropped {{due to lack of}} evidence, and he was released from prison on 20 March 1915. The authorities exiled him to the village of Ovčarevo, near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan monks. Andrić soon befriended the friar Alojzije Perčinlić and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule. Andrić lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andrić's mother soon came to see her son, and offered to serve as a housekeeper for the parish priest. [...] "Mother is very happy," [...] Andrić wrote. [...] "It has been three whole years since <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> And she can't grasp all that has happened to me in that time, nor the whole of my crazy, cursed existence. She cries, kisses me and laughs in turn. Like a mother." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{mother was}} much troubled when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> but my father, hearing the story, approved.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> too <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{and stared}} for one moment. Then, loosing the child, she cast up her hands, {{through which the}} {{sunlight}} shone as through parchment, and slowly sank to the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is sure ground, indeed, for pronouncing me innocent," [...] said Miriam, {{with the}} tears gushing into her eyes. [...] "Yet I have since become a horror to your saint-like Hilda, by a crime which <b>she</b> herself <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> help to perpetrate!" ...|$|R
60|$|Somehow <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> through <b>me,</b> knew I was {{not just}} what I pretended to be. But she never breathed her conviction. She championed me. I {{wanted to tell her}} the truth about myself because I {{believed}} the doubt of me alone stood in the way of my winning her.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{woman sitting}} in a chair, {{and as soon as}} <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> she gave a shriek.|$|E
60|$|Yes, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{watching}} them, {{and such}} fury {{seemed to take}} hold of her that I thought my hour had come.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Goyte came darting {{past the}} end of the house, her head {{sticking}} forward in sharp scrutiny. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> and came forward.|$|E
60|$|When my godmother {{had held}} my hand for a little while, and chatted with me, and scolded me for having become thinner than when <b>she</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> professed to {{discover}} that the snow-wind had disordered my hair, and sent me up-stairs to make it neat and remove my shawl.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This, sir,' said Bounderby, 'is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind's eldest daughter. Loo, Mr. James Harthouse. Mr. Harthouse {{has joined}} your father's muster-roll. If {{he is not}} Torn Gradgrind's {{colleague}} before long, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns. You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior. I don't know what <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>me</b> to marry <b>me,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> something in <b>me,</b> I suppose, or she wouldn't have married me. She has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise. If you want to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here! how am I {{going to}} know the creature? I never <b>saw</b> her, and <b>she</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> You 'll have to come too, Fan," [...] he added, pausing {{on his way to}} the door, arrested by the awful idea that he might have to address several strange girls before he got the right one.|$|R
60|$|I {{appeared}} at once, and leaped {{down upon the}} beach. A remarkable air of relief overspread her countenance as soon as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|These things I {{learned in}} a flash. Then with a murmured [...] "Mr. Quatermain, my Lady," [...] the footman {{closed the door}} and <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "But maybe <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{after all}} {{and did not}} want to let on," [...] he thought dismally. [...] "Maybe she thought I wouldn't {{recognize}} her." ...|$|E
60|$|Aunt Martha {{would be}} in danger of taking a fit if <b>she</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> talking to a man. She watches me jealously, firmly {{determined}} to guard me from any possible attack of a roaring and ravening lion in the disguise of nineteenth-century masculine attire. So I have to walk demurely and assume a virtue, if I have it not, while I pine after the untested flesh-pots of Egypt in secret.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{suppose that}} I have been deceived! I {{have spoken with}} the woman who waited by the garden-paling at Ramsgate, and who took the child from your hands. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> you with <b>me</b> at the lecture; and she is {{absolutely}} sure {{that you are the}} man.|$|R
60|$|I kept myself {{concealed}} {{behind a}} pillar of the garden-gate; I looked, hardly daring either to move or breathe; for I feared that if <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> or heard <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> would leave the window. After a lapse of some minutes, the canary touched the sugar with his beak.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Dr. Cumberledge," [...] she said, when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> alone, [...] "I was right! I {{have found}} out a fact or two about Daphne's rival!" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{daughter}} of Heaven remembered me to-night; <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> weep, {{and she came}} with comfort: [...] "Sleep," [...] she said. [...] "Sleep, sweetly--I gild thy dreams!" ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{danger was}} over. We rode back to Salisbury. The first words Hilda said when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> were: [...] "Well, {{he has got}} away from you!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{dismissed}} {{my old man}} here, {{and stayed}} incognito {{for three or four}} days in Colchester, and then took a passage in a waggon, because I would not venture being seen in the Harwich coaches. But I needed not have used so much caution, for there was nobody in Harwich but the woman of the house could have known me; nor was it rational to think that she, considering the hurry she was in, and that <b>she</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> but once, and that by candlelight, should have ever discovered me.|$|R
60|$|Troubled by {{the doubts}} which these {{considerations}} suggested, I committed {{an act of}} imprudence--I replied so reservedly that I put her on her guard. All I said was that I supposed Mr. Engelman agreed with Mr. Keller, but that I {{was not in the}} confidence of the two partners. From that moment <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> through <b>me,</b> and was silent on the subject of Mr. Engelman. Even Minna's singing had lost its charm, in my present frame of mind. It was a relief to me when I could make my excuses, and leave the house.|$|R
60|$|I had now {{a clue to}} Guert's {{being so}} much in the street. He was as good as his word, however, for he took a stand near the Dutch church, where I soon had the {{happiness}} of seeing Anneke and her friend driving past, on their evening's excursion. How blooming and lovely the former looked! Mary Wallace's eye turned, I fancied understandingly, to the corner where Guert had placed himself, and her colour deepened as she returned his bow. But, the start of surprise, the smile, and the lightening eye of Anneke, as <b>she</b> unexpectedly <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> filled my soul with delight, almost too great to be borne.|$|R
60|$|I {{found the}} little family we left {{just as we}} left them, and Amy cried for joy when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> and I almost did the same.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was right}} about Dolcino," [...] she said, as soon as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> with a strange little air of triumph. [...] "He is really very ill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, miss." [...] If Charley {{could only}} have made the letters in her copy as round as the eyes with which she looked into my face, {{they would have been}} excellent. [...] "And this poor person came about the house three or four days, hoping {{to get a glimpse of}} you, miss--all she wanted, she said--but you were away. That was when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> a-going about, miss," [...] said Charley with a short laugh of the {{greatest}} delight and pride, [...] "and she thought I looked like your maid!" ...|$|E
5000|$|.....the most {{magnificent}} {{exhibition of}} intellectual & moral faith I ever <b>saw.</b> <b>She</b> converted <b>me</b> internally, but not really, I fear.... When {{you think that}} Miss Addams does not think this as a philosophy, but believes it in all her senses & muscles-- Great God... I guess I'll {{have to give it}} all up & start over again.|$|R
60|$|Singing. Waiting she sang. I {{turned her}} music. Full voice of perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. First I <b>saw.</b> <b>She</b> thanked <b>me.</b> Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were more}} than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come, and in that interval, which seemed a long one, I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks. I loved my darling so well that I was more {{concerned}} for their effect on her than on any one. I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined--I am quite certain I did not, that day--but, I thought, would she be wholly prepared? When <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> might <b>she</b> not be a little shocked and disappointed? Might it not prove a little worse than she expected? Might she not look for her old Esther and not find her? Might she not have to grow used {{to me and to}} begin all over again? ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{and stood}} still, then opened {{her arms and}} clasped me to her breast, uttering no word. A while later she spoke almost in a whisper, saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is saying, Nanny," [...] Gavin broke in, almost gaily for a minister, [...] "that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{recently}} {{wearing a}} cloak. You know I {{have no such}} thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain, dancing {{about with}} a long, soft roll in her hand: [...] "Oh, oh, oh! <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> gloating {{on it at}} Shumaker's! I do wonder if it is." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{presence}} of mind she had! One could never surprise her out of it. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> Noel and <b>me</b> there when she first took her seat on the bench, and we flushed to the forehead with excitement and emotion, but her face showed nothing, betrayed nothing. Her eyes sought us fifty times that day, but they passed on and {{there was never any}} ray of recognition in them. Another would have started upon seeing us, and then--why, then there could have been trouble for us, of course.|$|R
5000|$|... "She was a {{magnificent}} teacher, a brilliant artist in every way, {{and she was}} nurturing and encouraging," [...] said Heggie in a 2015 interview with Opera News. [...] "She wanted {{you to have a}} broad recognition of what the world had to offer in literature, music, art, food, and daily life. She was all about unleashing inspiration, trusting instincts, opening up your heart and soul to possibility. And <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> something in <b>me</b> as an artist and as a composer that I didn't see or recognize in myself." ...|$|R
60|$|CURTIS--Oh, I {{tried to}} become reconciled. I tried my damnedest. I tried {{to love this}} child as I had loved those that died. But I couldn't. And so, this being estranged us. We loved as {{intensely}} as ever but IT pushed us apart. I grew to dread {{the idea of this}} intruder. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> this in <b>me.</b> I denied it--but she knew. There was something in each of us the other grew to hate. And still we loved as never before, perhaps, for we grew to pity each other's helplessness.|$|R
