40|$|Intact etioplasts with an intactness of 85 % {{and with}} a cytosolic and a {{mitochondrial}} contamination of less than 10 % were isolated from 8 -d-old dark-grown barley (Hordeum vulgare) leaves. These plastids contained <b>starch</b> <b>equivalent</b> to 21. 5 μmol of glucose per mg protein. From various likely precursors applied to isolated etioplasts, only dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) had significant effects on metabolite levels and on the internal ATP/ADP ratio. The concentration dependence of DHAP uptake exhibited saturation characteristics with half saturation at 0. 36 mm DHAP and a maximal velocity of 6. 6 μmol mg− 1 of protein h− 1. The transport was significantly inhibited by inorganic phosphate, pyridoxal- 5 ′-phosphate, and 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyano- 2, 2 ′-stilbenedisulfonate. The rate of glucose- 6 -phosphate uptake was much lower and not saturable up to a concentration of 10 mm. Exogenously applied [14 C]DHAP was incorporated into starch {{at a rate of}} 0. 14 μmol of DHAP mg− 1 of protein h− 1. Enzyme activities required to convert DHAP into starch were found to be present in etioplasts. Furthermore, enzymes generating ATP from DHAP for ADPglucose synthesis were also detected. Finally, a scheme is presented suggesting DHAP uptake to serve both as carbon skeleton and as energy source for starch synthesis, mediated by a translocator with properties {{similar to those of the}} triose phosphate translocator from chloroplasts...|$|E
40|$|Systems of feed {{evaluation}} require {{the determination of}} the digestibility of the components of the feeds. The determination of digestibility in vivo is laborious and expensive, thus considerable research effort has been directed towards the determination of techniques to measure digestibility in vitro. The development of laboratory methods for assessing the digestibility of ruminant feeds is discussed. A two- stage technique, composed of microbial and enzymatic digestion stages, has currently been applied to the analysis of herbages, mixed forages, wood, brassicas, concentrates and silages. The digestibility of substrates determined by means of the two-stage in vitro method may be affected by the method of preparation of the substrate, the pH and duration of the microbial digestion, and the ratio of the rumen fluid to the buffer solution. The source of the rumen fluid may also affect digestibility in vitro, since the activity of this. fluid varies between species, individuals within species and the diet of the donor animals. Variation due to the diet of the donor may be minimized by means of a diet with an adequate crude protein content. Regression analyses are presented relating in vivo digestibilities to values of digestibility estimated by various laboratory procedures. In vivo digestibility may be predicted more accurately by the in vitro digestibility technique than by the nylon bag technique or by chemical methods of evaluation. However, methods incorporating the digestibility of cell wall material, digestion by fungal cellulase or summative equations of chemical constituents may be used as alternatives to the two-stage digestibility technique. The review is concluded with a discussion of the relationships between in vitro digestibility values of feeds and the values of total digestible nutrients, index of nutritive value, <b>starch</b> <b>equivalent,</b> voluntary intake, digestible energy and metabolizable energy, the last two of which are currently used to formulate rations for ruminants.

However, {{contrary to popular}} belief, {{there is no evidence}} that modest use of added sucrose is detrimental to diabetic control. In this study of 17 non-insulin dependent diabetics, the medium-term metabolic effects of the daily supplementation of a subject 2 ̆ 7 s usual diet with either 28 g of sucrose or with saccharin and <b>starch</b> of <b>equivalent</b> sweetener and energy value, were compared over six-week periods. Neither dietary period had any significant effect on fasting concentrations of blood glucose, plasma insulin, GIP or serum triglyceride. The metabolic responses to two different test meals, consisting of a standard breakfast supplemented with either sucrose or saccharin plus starch, did not differ significantly either between test meals or between dietary periods. Similarly neither dietary period had any significant effect on urinary excretion of glucose. Na+ or K+. There was no significant difference in mean blood pressure between dietary periods.

40|$|Quinoa {{seeds are}} highly nutritious {{due to the}} quality of their {{proteins}} and lipids and the wide range of minerals and vitamins they store. Three compartments can be distinguished within the mature seed: embryo, endosperm, and perisperm. The distribution of main storage reserves is clearly different in those areas: the embryo and endosperm store proteins, lipids, and minerals, and the perisperm stores <b>starch.</b> Tissues <b>equivalent</b> (but not homologous) to those found in grasses can be identified in quinoa, suggesting the effectiveness of this seed reserve distribution strategy; as in cells of grass starchy endosperm, the cells of the quinoa perisperm endoreduplicate, increase in size, synthesize starch, and die during development. In addition, both systems present an extra-embryonic tissue that stores proteins, lipids and minerals: in gramineae, the aleurone layer(s) of the endosperm; in quinoa, the micropylar endosperm; in both cases, the tissues are living. Moreover, the quinoa micropylar endosperm and the coleorhiza in grasses play similar roles, protecting the root in the quiescent seed and controlling dormancy during germination. This investigation is just the beginning of a broader and comparative study of the development of quinoa and grass seeds. Several questions arise from this study, such as: how are synthesis and activation of seed proteins and enzymes regulated during development and germination, what are the genes involved in these processes, and lastly, what is the genetic foundation justifying the analogy to grasses...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{efforts have}} been made in the USA and other {{countries}} to develop renewable feedstocks for production of fuels and chemicals. Among these, sorghum has attracted strong interest because of its many good characteristics such as rapid growth and high sugar accumulation, high biomass production potential, excellent nitrogen usage efficiency, wide adaptability, drought resistance, and water lodging tolerance and salinity resistance. The ability to withstand severe drought conditions and its high water usage efficiency make sorghum a good renewable feedstock suitable for cultivation in arid regions, such as the southern US and many areas in Africa and Asia. Sorghum varieties include grain sorghum, sweet sorghum, and biomass sorghum. Grain sorghum, having <b>starch</b> content <b>equivalent</b> to corn, has been considered as a feedstock for ethanol production. Its tannin content, however, may cause problems during enzyme hydrolysis. Sweet sorghum juice contains sucrose, glucose and fructose, which are readily fermentable by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and hence is a good substrate for ethanol fermentation. The enzyme invertase, however, needs to be added to convert sucrose to glucose and fructose if the juice is used for production of industrial chemicals in fermentation processes that employ microorganisms incapable of metabolizing sucrose. Biomass sorghum requires pretreatment prior to enzymatic hydrolysis to generate fermentable sugars to be used in the subsequent fermentation process. This report reviews the current knowledge on bioconversion of sorghum to fuels and chemicals and identifies areas that deserve further studies...|$|R
40|$|Background Grass pollen allergens are {{the most}} {{important}} cause of hay fever and allergic asthma during summer in cool temperate climates. Pollen counts provide a guide to hay fever sufferers. However, grass pollen, because of its size, has a low probability of entering the lower airways to trigger asthma. Yet, grass pollen allergens are known to be associated with atmospheric respirable particles. Objective We aimed (1) to determine the concentration of group 5 major allergens in (a) pollen grains of clinically important grass species and (b) atmospheric particles (respirable and nonrespirable) and (2) to compare the atmospheric allergen load with clinical data to assess different risk factors for asthma and hay fever. Methods We have performed a continuous 24 h sampling of atmospheric particles greater and lower than 7. 2 μm in diameter during the grass pollen season of 1996 and 1997 (17 October 1996 – 16 January 1997) by means of a high volume cascade impactor at a height of about 15 m above ground in Melbourne. Using Western analysis, we assessed the reactivity of major timothy grass allergen Phl p 5 specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against selected pollen extracts. A MoAb-based ELISA was then employed to quantify Phl p 5 and cross-reactive allergens in pollen extracts and atmospheric particles larger and smaller than 7. 2 μm. Results Phl p 5 -specific MoAb detected group 5 allergens in tested grass pollen extracts, indicating that the ELISA employed here determines total group 5 allergen concentrations. On average, 0. 05 ng of group 5 allergens were detectable per grass pollen grain. Atmospheric group 5 allergen concentrations in particles > 7. 2 μm were significantly correlated with grass pollen counts (rs = 0. 842, P < 0. 001). On dry days, 37 % of the total group 5 allergen load, whereas upon rainfall, 57 % of the total load was detected in respirable particles. After rainfall, the number of <b>starch</b> granule <b>equivalents</b> increased up to 10 -fold; <b>starch</b> granule <b>equivalent</b> is defined as a hypothetical potential number of airborne starch granules based on known pollen count data. This indicates that rainfall tended to wash out large particles and contributed to an increase in respirable particles containing group 5 allergens by bursting of pollen grains. Four day running means of group 5 allergens in respirable particles and of asthma attendances (delayed by 2 days) were shown to be significantly correlated (P < 0. 001). Conclusion Here we present, for the first time, an estimation of the total group 5 allergen content in respirable and nonrespirable particles in the atmosphere of Melbourne. These results highlight the different environmental risk factors for hay fever and allergic asthma in patients, as on days of rainfall following high grass pollen count, the risk for asthma sufferers is far greater than on days of high pollen count with no associated rainfall. Moreover, rainfall may also contribute to the release of allergens from fungal spores and, along with the release of free allergen molecules from pollen grains, may be able to interact with other particles such as pollutants (i. e. diesel exhaust carbon particles) to trigger allergic asthma...|$|R
40|$|Dose-effect {{relationship}} was {{studied in the}} rheoviscometric behaviour of geliffied suspensions of irradiated corn starch and black pepper, as the variation of the apparent viscosity and the shear stress related to the dose. Irradiation has been performed up to 16 kGy. Black pepper was ground and sieved to three particle sizes to analyse also the influence of particle size on the apparent viscosity variation by dose. The rheoviscometric measu- rements {{have been carried out}} by a rotationary viscometer on geliffied suspensions of starch and black pepper, into <b>equivalent</b> <b>starch</b> concentration and alkalinised suspen- sions for pepper. For starch, shear stress variation by dose is expo- nential, where the coefficients depend on the shear rate. For black pepper, the curves of apparent viscosity relation to dose also fit an exponential equation and the influence of particle size is discussed, too. Viscometric behaviour similar to irradiation of both corn starch and black pepper could be attributed to starch degradation at relatively high doses and should be used to develop an identification and control method for the ioni- sing treatment of starch-based food materials...|$|R
40|$|As a {{follow up}} to {{laboratory}} work completed under the project A 0305 (Process Improvements to Starch Products from Root and Tuber Crops) and a process audit of starch and sago production (Trim and Curran, 1993) a visit was undertaken {{to carry out}} a preliminary field test of a hydrocyclone unit and evaluate its potential for application in the sago and starch industry. The commissioning trials showed that the unit performed marginally better than predicted during laboratory tests. Solid recoveries from the unit were in the range 91 - 95 % compared to 88 - 92 % with similar underflow volume splits of around 45 %. Integrated factory trials demonstrated the possibility of re-cycling up to 60 % of the water required for root crushing and sieving of the <b>starch</b> milk with <b>equivalent</b> reduction in the volume of waste water produced. Composition of factory waste waters when the hydrocyclone unit was used was little {{different from that of the}} waste waters produced under normal operation. However, the reduction in pollution load possible from using hydrocyclones to re-cycle process water may be more than 50 %. There appeared to be a positive effect on the quality of the starch, in terms of the colour and level of impurities, produced when using the hydrocyclone. This offers the possibility of eliminating subsequent washing of the starch. A slight improvement in the whiteness of the polished sago was recorded which may be reflected in higher prices. Based on these highly successful results and the positive reaction showed by producers and local authorities, proposals are made for full-scale trials of a hydrocyclone unit over a full processing season, and to assess the implications at the macro level, both in economic and environmental terms, of introducing the technology. It is also recommended that collaboration be made with a hydrocyclone manufacturer in order to facilitate uptake of the technology by producers, and to collaborate with SAGOSERVE on the development of strategies for introduction of the technology and its wider dissemination across the industrial sector...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the bioavailability of D-methionine (Met) relative to L-Met for nursery pigs using the slope-ratio assay. A total of 50 crossbred barrows with an initial BW of 13. 5 kg (SD = 1. 0) were used in an N balance study. A Met-deficient basal diet (BD) was formulated to contain an adequate amount of all amino acids (AA) for 10 – 20 kg pigs except for Met. The two reference diets were prepared by supplementing the BD with 0. 4 or 0. 8 g L-Met/kg {{at the expense of}} corn <b>starch,</b> and an <b>equivalent</b> concentration of D-Met was added to the BD for the two test diets. The pigs were adapted to the experimental diets for 5 d and then total but separated collection of feces and urine was conducted for 4 d according to the marker-to-marker procedure. Nitrogen intakes were similar across the treatments. Fecal N output was not affected by Met supplementation regardless of source and consequently apparent N digestibility did not change. Conversely, there was a negative linear response (P < 0. 01) to Met supplementation with both Met isomers in urinary N output, which resulted in increased retained N (g/ 4 d) and N retention (% of intake). No quadratic response was observed in any of the N balance criteria. The estimated bioavailability of D-Met relative to L-Met from urinary N output (g/ 4 d) and N retention (% of intake) as dependent variables using supplemental Met intake (g/ 4 d) as an independent variable were 87. 6 % and 89. 6 %, respectively; however, approximately 95 % of the fiducial limits for the relative bioavailability estimates included 100 %. In conclusion, with an absence of statistical significance, the present study indicated that the mean relative bioequivalence of D- to L-Met was 87. 6 % based on urinary N output or 89. 6 % based on N retention...|$|R
