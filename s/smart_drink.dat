These amino acids were {{claimed to have}} positive or enhanced effects on alertness, stress resistance and energy levels. Some of the acids, then considered [...] "foods" [...] and nutritional supplements by government agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), changed in status and have since been removed from store shelves. Others are still available when prescribed by a doctor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>smart</b> <b>drinks</b> and [...] "smart drugs" [...] {{began in the}} early 1980s when baby boomers started using because they believed these products would improve job performance and give them a competitive edge in the workplace. The popularity of <b>smart</b> <b>drinks</b> peaked during the early 1990s, as all-night techno and house music parties took place, events of the underground dance culture at the time, known as [...] "raves." [...] Rave enthusiasts preferred drugs such as Ecstasy, methamphetamine, ketamine, or [...] "poppers" [...] to alcohol. Instead of drinking alcoholic beverages at raves, the dancers would <b>drink</b> <b>smart</b> <b>drinks.</b> <b>Smart</b> <b>drinks</b> not only held a novelty factor for the vibrant social subculture, but they also helped rave promoters by eliminating the need to secure alcohol sales permits and therefore allowed raves to be held outside of the traditional nightclub, bar or pub scene.|$|R

5000|$|Smart {{is remembered}} for the infamous [...] "Aftershave Incident" [...] in 1982. While in Paris, after beating France in the Five Nations, England {{teammate}} Maurice Colclough emptied {{a bottle of}} free aftershave from the after-match meal, filled it with wine, and drank from it. Thinking that Colclough had drunk the aftershave {{and not wanting to}} appear upstaged by his teammate, <b>Smart</b> <b>drank</b> his bottle of aftershave. This made him very ill. After England medical officer Leo Walkden failed to get a response from Smart, he was required to go to hospital to have his stomach pumped. The incident was alluded to a month later, after England had beaten Wales, by Steve Smith who quipped: [...] "The aftershave will sure taste good tonight!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The article {{describes}} zippies, according to 50-year-old Fraser Clark, as [...] "Zen-Inspired Pronoia Professional", or [...] "hippies with zip." [...] The UK media tried to pin various labels on the Y Generation such as [...] "cyber-crusties", [...] "techno-hippies", and [...] "post-ravers." [...] Fraser Clark espoused a philosophy known as pronoia and {{embarked on an}} expedition to the United States. This tour was dubbed the Zippy Pronoia Tour to US. Other uses of the term are [...] "Zen Inspired Peace Professional."These zippies were a New Age kind of hippie who embraced Chaos Theory, Blakean revolt, modern mysteries such as New Age Paganism, trance music, rave culture, <b>smart</b> <b>drinks,</b> free software, technology and entrepreneurism {{in an effort to}} bring about a better world.|$|R

500|$|There {{are other}} {{possibilities}} beyond madness or religious fervor {{that may have}} led to Smart's confinement: Newbery may have used the imprisonment of his son-in-law as leverage to control the publication of Smart's work and as a warning to others who worked for him not to cross him. Another theory suggests Smart's actions were a result of alcohol, and {{had nothing to do with}} a mental imbalance. However, Smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father-in-law in some way, which could have resulted from an incident in which <b>Smart</b> <b>drank.</b> Hester Thrale reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that Smart's [...] "religious fervor" [...] tended to coincide with times that Smart was intoxicated. Smart's own testimony that he [...] "blessed God in St. James's Park till I routed all the company" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 90–91) as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking, as he was known for pulling pranks and the Board of Green Cloth, the government body that controlled St James's Park, would treat most disturbances in the park as resulting from madness. If Smart was placed into the asylum as a result of actions at St James's, he would not have been the only one, since records show that the Board of Green Cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to Bethlem Hospital for [...] "frenzy" [...] at St James's Park during the century prior to Smart being placed in St Luke's.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Problematic alcohol {{consumption}} {{is associated with}} a high disease burden for affected individuals and has a detrimental impact on companies and society due to direct and indirect health costs. This protocol describes a study design to evaluate the (cost) -effectiveness of a guided and unguided Internet-based self-help intervention for employees called "GET. ON Clever weniger trinken" (be <b>smart</b> - <b>drink</b> less) compared to a waiting list control group. METHODS: In a three-arm randomized controlled trial, 528 German adults who are currently members of the workforce will be recruited by occupational health departments of major health insurance companies. Employees aged 18 and older displaying problematic drinking patterns (> 21 / 14 drinks per week and an AUDIT score[*]>[*] 8 / 6 for men/women) will be {{randomly assigned to one of}} three following study conditions: 1. unguided web-based self-help for problematic drinking, 2. adherence-focused guided self-help, and 3. waiting list control. Self-report data will be collected at baseline (T 1), 6 weeks (T 2), and 6 months (T 3) after randomization. The primary outcome will be the reduction of alcohol standard units during the 7 days prior to T 2, using the Timeline Followback method. Cost-effectiveness analyses to determine direct and indirect costs will be conducted from the perspectives of employers and the society. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. DISCUSSION: There is a need to identify effective low-threshold solutions to improve ill-health and reduce the negative economic consequences due to problematic alcohol drinking in workforces. If the proposed web-based intervention proves both to be efficacious and cost-effective, it may be a useful tool to increase utilization rates of interventions for problematic drinking in occupational settings.

40|$|Many {{chronic health}} {{conditions}} {{have been linked}} to alcohol consumption, as well as excess morbidity, mortality and an increased financial burden on the National Health Service (NHS). The British HIV Association (BHIVA) recommends that HIV patients be asked about alcohol due to its effect on adherence to antiretroviral therapy. National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend screening for alcohol use disorders in patients attending genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. In this study we looked at the use of a screening tool for alcohol use disorders in HIV patients in a metropolitan city. We assessed HIV patients over a 6 -month period for alcohol use disorders using the AUDIT-C questionnaire. Patients with a score &#x 3 E; 4 were identified as higher risk and provided with brief advice about alcohol and offered written information and support. Demographic data was collected along with hepatitis B and C status, information on sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and diagnosis. 352 patients were reviewed {{with a mean age of}} 41. 297 (84. 4 %) patients were male, 235 (66. 8 %) were white British and 251 (71. 3 %) were men who have sex with men (MSM). 277 (78. 7 %) patients were on antiretroviral therapy with 254 (91. 7 %) of these having an undetectable viral load. Alcohol use disorders were assessed using the AUDIT-C score in 332 (94. 3 %) patients with no patient declining assessment. 166 (50 %) patients had an AUDIT-C score &#x 3 E; 4 signifying higher risk. Alcohol advice was provided to 161 (97 %) of these patients and a <b>Drink</b> <b>Smart</b> guide offering advice on alcohol self help offered to 103 (64 %) patients and accepted by 45 (43. 7 %). An opportunistic STI screen was offered to 258 (73. 3 %) patients on that visit in line with best practice guidelines and was accepted by 83 (32. 2 %). 25 infections were found in 20 patients, of which 13 (65 %) had AUDIT-C scores &#x 3 E; 4. There were 8 active hepatitis C co-infected patients of which 3 had an AUDIT-C score &#x 3 E; 4 and 12 chronic hepatitis B co-infected patients with 3 having an AUDIT-C score &#x 3 E; 4. Our results show that screening for alcohol use disorders using the AUDIT-C questionnaire has high acceptability among HIV patients; however the data is biased to Caucasian MSM. Alcohol use has been shown to exacerbate liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis, increase the likelihood of STI acquisition and compromise immunity. It is therefore important to screen for and quantify alcohol use as part of routine HIV clinical practice...|$|R
