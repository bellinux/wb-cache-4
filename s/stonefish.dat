5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous. Some, like eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or <b>stonefish</b> (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines {{that can}} seriously injure or kill humans. Some, like the {{electric}} eel and the electric catfish, {{can give a}} severe electric shock. Others, such as the piranha and barracuda, have a powerful bite and have sometimes attacked human bathers. Reports indicate {{that some of the}} catfish family can be large enough to prey on human bathers.|$|E
25|$|Common {{interesting}} animals {{around the}} wreck are tuna, barracuda, batfish, moray eel, lionfish, <b>stonefish,</b> crocodilefish, scorpionfish, and sea turtle.|$|E
25|$|Some {{fish and}} {{invertebrates}} such as Lionfish, <b>stonefish,</b> crown of thorns starfish, and some sea urchins have spines which can produce puncture wounds with venom injection. These are often extremely painful {{and may be}} fatal in rare cases. Usually caused by impact with the stationary animal.|$|E
50|$|Choridactylus is a genus of <b>stonefishes</b> {{native to}} the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|R
50|$|Minous is a genus of <b>stonefishes</b> {{native to}} the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean.|$|R
50|$|Erosa {{is a small}} genus of <b>stonefishes</b> {{found in}} the eastern Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean.|$|R
25|$|This fish is an {{opportunistic}} feeder. Its diet includes planktonic, demersal, and benthic organisms. Copepods {{constitute the}} bulk of their diet. It serves as an important food source for several species of lionfish (Pterois spp.), the honeycomb grouper (Epinephelus merra), the crocodilefish (Cymbacephalus beauforti), the snowflake moray (Echidna nebulosa), the estuarine <b>stonefish</b> (Synanceia horrida), and the yellow-lipped sea krait (Laticauda colubrina).|$|E
25|$|Unlike the <b>stonefish</b> {{which can}} shoot venom, the {{lionfish}} can only release venom when something strikes its spines. Although not {{native to the}} US coast, lionfish have appeared around Florida and have spread up the coast to New York. They are attractive aquarium fish, sometimes used to stock ponds, {{and may have been}} washed into the sea during a hurricane. Lionfish can aggressively dart at scuba divers and attempt to puncture the facemask with their venomous spines.|$|E
25|$|The fauna of Australia {{consists}} of a huge variety of animals; some 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 24% of fish and insects and 93% of amphibians that inhabit the continent are endemic to Australia. This high level of endemism {{can be attributed to}} the continent's long geographic isolation, tectonic stability, and the effects of an unusual pattern of climate change on the soil and flora over geological time. A unique feature of Australia's fauna is the relative scarcity of native placental mammals. Consequently, the marsupials — a group of mammals that raise their young in a pouch, including the macropods, possums and dasyuromorphs — occupy many of the ecological niches placental animals occupy elsewhere in the world. Australia is home to two of the five known extant species of monotremes and has numerous venomous species, which include the platypus, spiders, scorpions, octopus, jellyfish, molluscs, <b>stonefish,</b> and stingrays. Uniquely, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous species of snakes.|$|E
25|$|Inimicus is a genus of venomous fishes, {{closely related}} to the true <b>stonefishes.</b> This genus {{is a member of the}} family Synanceiidae (devilfishes, goblinfishes, and <b>stonefishes)</b> of the ray-finned fish order Scorpaeniformes. These benthic fishes are found on sandy or silty {{substrates}} of lagoon and seaward reefs, in coastal regions of tropical oceans. The ten described species are collectively known by various common names, including ghoul, goblinfish, sea goblin, spiny devilfish, stinger, and stingfish).|$|R
50|$|The Crocodilefish (Cymbacephalus beauforti), {{also known}} as De Beaufort's {{flathead}} or Giant flathead, {{is a member of}} the order Scorpaeniformes, which also includes the scorpionfishes and <b>stonefishes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Venom {{can also}} be found in some fish, such as the {{cartilaginous}} fishes - stingrays, sharks, and chimaeras - and the teleost fishes including onejaws, catfishes, <b>stonefishes</b> and waspfishes, scorpionfishes and lionfishes, gurnards, rabbitfishes, dragonets, surgeonfishes, scats, stargazers, weever, and swarmfish.|$|R
25|$|Most of Australia's {{fish species}} are marine, and 75% live in {{tropical}} marine environments. This is {{partly due to}} Australia's huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7m and weigh up to 400kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, butterflyfish, angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of <b>stonefish</b> and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Banton" [...] {{was derived}} from the Asi word batoon, meaning [...] "rocky", {{referring}} to the mountainous and rocky topography of the island due to its volcanic origin. Another possible origin is the word bantoy, which is the Asi word for the venomous <b>stonefish.</b>|$|E
500|$|Neighbours {{initially}} {{aired on}} Seven Network where it struggled to attract high ratings leading to its cancellation by the network {{four months after}} it premiered. The series was then picked up by Network Ten. After the usual break in broadcast over the summer non ratings period the series made its debut on Ten in 1986. Ten revamped the show, adding several new, younger cast members including Jason Donovan as Scott Robinson and Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell. When the show began on Ten it initially attracted low ratings, so the Network worked hard to publicise the series. Ten's publicity drive was designed to promote the show in a star-focused campaign recalling that of the Hollywood star system where stars were packaged to feed into a fan culture. This paid off {{and by the end}} of 1987 ratings had improved for the show. The episode featuring Scott and Charlene's wedding achieved the highest ever ratings for Neighbours and it became one of the highest rating soap episodes ever in Australia. The same episode attracted 19.6 million viewers when it was aired in the United Kingdom. By the early 1990s, Australian audiences had decreased although viewing figures had recovered slightly by the end of the decade. In 1994, Network Ten told TV Week that they would be introducing a [...] "younger, livelier look with six regular characters under the age of 18" [...] in a bid to generate interest. It was then that they introduced the characters of <b>Stonefish</b> Rebecchi played by Anthony Engelman and Serendipity Gottlieb played by Raelee Hill.|$|E
5000|$|Synanceia is a genus of fish of {{the family}} Synanceiidae, the <b>stonefishes,</b> whose members are venomous, dangerous, and even fatal to humans. It {{is one of the}} most venomous fish known. [...] They are found in the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.|$|R
50|$|The Tentacled {{flathead}} (Papilloculiceps longiceps) or Crocodilefish is {{a member}} of the order Scorpaeniformes, an order which also includes the scorpionfishes and <b>stonefishes.</b> It is found in the Western Indian Ocean; the Red Sea. The species now also occurs in the Mediterranean, having invaded as a Lessepsian migrant through the Suez Canal.|$|R
50|$|Inimicus didactylus, {{also known}} as Demon Stinger or Devil Stinger, {{is a member of}} the Inimicus genus of venomous fishes, closely related to the true <b>stonefishes.</b> It can reach a body length of 25 cm (10 in) and is irregularly {{surfaced}} with spines and a knobby appearance. The fish has venomous spines to ward off enemies. The fish are nocturnal, and often dig themselves partially into the sandy seabed during the day. The body is red or sandy yellow and well camouflaged on sandy and coral seabeds.|$|R
2500|$|The most venomous known fish is {{the reef}} <b>stonefish.</b> It has a {{remarkable}} ability to camouflage itself amongst rocks. It is an ambush predator {{that sits on}} the bottom waiting for prey to come close. It does not swim away if disturbed, but erects 13 venomous spines along its back. For defence, it can shoot venom from each {{or all of these}} spines. Each spine is like a hypodermic needle, delivering the venom from two sacs attached to the spine. The <b>stonefish</b> has control over whether to shoot its venom, and does so when provoked or frightened. The venom results in severe pain, paralysis and tissue death, and can be fatal if not treated. Despite its formidable defence, the <b>stonefish</b> does have predators. Some bottom feeding rays and sharks with crushing teeth feed on them, as does the Stokes' seasnake ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} in The Stems, Dom Mariani {{undertook}} a number of side-projects. One of these, The <b>Stonefish,</b> was an instrumental surf rock group formed in February 1986, which reunited him with Hitchcock (now on guitar and dobro) and Zupanovich, alongside his Stems' cohort Dave Shaw. In March the following year they issued a four-track 12" [...] EP, From 20,000 Fathoms, on Citadel Records. The EP included material written and performed by Mariani's earlier instrumental group, The Go-Starts. However, The <b>Stonefish</b> had disbanded {{by the time the}} record was released.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{armament}} of Onslow was six [...] bow torpedo tubes, {{capable of}} firing torpedoes or releasing sea mines. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially {{carried by the}} submarine; this {{was replaced by the}} wire-guided Mark 23. During a refit from 1982 to 1984, Oberon became the first conventionally powered submarine in the world to be fitted with anti-ship missiles; specifically the UGM-84 Sub Harpoon. At the same time, the Mark 23 torpedoes were replaced by the United States Mark 48 wire-guided torpedo. As of 1996, the standard payload of Onslow was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 <b>Stonefish</b> sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes.|$|E
50|$|Inimicus filamentosus, {{also known}} as the filament-finned stinger, barred ghoul, two-stick stingfish, or devil scorpionfish, {{is a member of the}} Inimicus genus of venomous fishes. It is a member of the Synanceiidae (devilfishes, goblinfishes, and <b>stonefishes)</b> family of the Scorpaeniformes order of ray-finned fishes. These benthic fishes are found on sandy or silty {{substrates}} of lagoon and seaward reefs, in coastal regions of tropical oceans. Like all the other known species of Inimicus, I. filamentosus is a demersal ambush predator. They are nocturnal, and often dig themselves partially into the sandy seabed during the day.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{armament}} of the Oberons {{consisted of}} six [...] torpedo tubes. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially {{carried by the}} submarine; this was later replaced by the wire-guided Mark 23. After a multi-year refit ending in 1985, Otama was upgraded to carry United States Navy Mark 48 torpedoes and UGM-84 Sub Harpoon anti-ship missiles; the last Australian Oberon to undergo the Submarine Weapon Update Program. As of 1996, the standard payload of an Australian Oberon was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some {{or all of the}} torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 <b>Stonefish</b> sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes. On entering service, two stern-mounted, short-length [...] torpedo tubes for Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes. However, the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes made the less-capable aft-firing torpedoes redundant; they were closed off, and later removed during a refit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stonefish</b> stings in Australia {{can cause}} {{envenomation}} and death if not treated. The <b>stonefish</b> {{is one of}} the most venomous fish in the world and when stepped on by a human forces venom into the foot. Most <b>stonefish</b> stings occur as a result of stepping on the creature, while it is less common for the fish to sting when it is picked up. <b>Stonefish</b> stings can occur on the beach, not just in the water, since <b>stonefish</b> can survive out of the water for up to 24 hours. They often cannot be easily seen as they look similar to rocks or coral. <b>Stonefish</b> antivenom is the second-most administered in Australia.|$|E
50|$|However, a British company (BAE Systems) does {{manufacture}} the <b>Stonefish</b> {{influence mine}} for export to friendly {{countries such as}} Australia, which has both war stock and training versions of <b>Stonefish,</b> in addition to stocks of smaller Italian MN103 Manta mines. The computerised fuze on a <b>Stonefish</b> mine contains acoustic, magnetic and water pressure displacement target detection sensors. <b>Stonefish</b> can be deployed by fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, surface vessels and submarines. An optional kit is available to allow <b>Stonefish</b> to be air-dropped, comprising an aerodynamic tail-fin section and parachute pack to retard the weapon's descent. The operating depth of <b>Stonefish</b> ranges between 30 and 200 metres. The mine weighs 990 kilograms and contains a 600 kilogram aluminised PBX explosive warhead.|$|E
50|$|After <b>stonefish</b> envenomation, {{the amount}} of anti-venom given depends {{on the number of}} {{puncture}} wounds from the <b>stonefish</b> spines.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Stonefish</b> {{influence}} mine is manufactured by a British company (BAE Systems). Originally, the weapon was supplied to the Royal Navy, {{but it has}} also been exported to friendly countries such as Australia, which has both warstock and training versions of <b>Stonefish.</b> There has been conjecture that South Africa, Chile, Iraq, Libya and possibly other countries may have gained access to either some early <b>Stonefish</b> information or to similar technology. The mine is named after the <b>stonefish,</b> a venomous fish of the same name.|$|E
5000|$|A {{writer for}} Inside Soap said <b>Stonefish</b> was happiest causing a {{stir in the}} classroom, and that {{wherever}} there was trouble, you could bet he was involved. <b>Stonefish</b> arrived in Ramsay Street after believing Brett Stark (Brett Blewitt) had started dating his girlfriend Sassy Patterson-Smythe (Defah Dattner). Engelman said <b>Stonefish</b> was usually easy going, but he became really jealous. However, when Sassy {{moved out of the}} picture, <b>Stonefish</b> and Brett become great friends. When <b>Stonefish</b> fell behind with his studies, Cody Willis (Peta Brady) helped him out, making <b>Stonefish</b> think she was romantically interested in him. Engelman said, [...] "He's really got the hots for her, but when he makes a pass at her at a party it all goes horribly wrong." [...] The actor said he had a lot in common with his character, as he had a tough time at school too and did not have much luck with girls.|$|E
50|$|Two {{sizes of}} <b>Stonefish</b> {{explosive}} warhead {{are available for}} warstock mines, 100 kg and 300 kg. However, the destructive power of a <b>Stonefish</b> mine can be adjusted by coupling multiple warheads together in different combinations. In this way, a <b>Stonefish</b> mine can have a warhead which weighs 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or 600 kg. The ability to change the warhead size allows <b>Stonefish</b> to be deployed against small targets in shallow coastal waters or against large targets in deep ocean. Depending on the warhead configuration, a <b>Stonefish</b> mine can have a total weight of up to 990 kg. The physical measurements of a <b>Stonefish</b> mine are such that it can easily be loaded into the torpedo tubes of submarines, then deployed using a small charge of compressed air to expel it. Alternatively, if an optional air-drop kit is fitted {{it can also be}} deployed by maritime patrol aircraft such as the P-3 Orion (connected to the aircraft via suspension lugs and an arming lanyard) its descent to the ocean surface slowed by a parachute retard pack.|$|E
50|$|This <b>stonefish</b> lives {{primarily}} {{above the}} Tropic of Capricorn. It {{is the most}} widespread species in the <b>stonefish</b> family, and is known from shallow tropical marine waters in the Pacific and Indian Oceans from the Red Sea to the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
50|$|Antivenom is {{available}} for <b>stonefish</b> stings.|$|E
50|$|Pseudosynanceia melanostigma, the {{blackfin}} <b>stonefish,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>stonefish</b> native to the western Indian Ocean where it occurs in areas with muddy bottoms. This species grows to a length of 13 cm SL. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, TV Week {{revealed}} Neighbours {{would be}} introducing [...] "a younger, livelier look with six regular characters {{under the age}} of 18." [...] Shortly after, the character of <b>Stonefish</b> was created and introduced to the show. Engelman was cast in the role and he told a writer for Inside Soap that his first script said that the character got his nickname because he looked like a <b>stonefish.</b> The actor quipped [...] "They'd written that before they'd even cast me! When I got my script I was like 'What the hell does a <b>stonefish</b> look like anyway?!'" [...] <b>Stonefish</b> became the first member of the Rebecchi family to arrive in Erinsborough. He was later joined by his mother, father, brother and cousin. The character left in 1996.|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} {{depth of}} <b>Stonefish</b> ranges between 30 and 200 m. Its shelf life is 20 years, {{and it has}} an operational lifetime of 700 days after being deployed on the seabed. <b>Stonefish</b> incorporates arming delays, ship counting and self-sterilisation features which can be configured by the user.|$|E
