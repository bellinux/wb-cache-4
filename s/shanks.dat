40|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} with {{a strong}} genetic component. Core symptoms are abnormal reciprocal social interactions, qualitative impairments in communication, and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior with restricted interests. Candidate genes for autism include the <b>SHANK</b> gene family, as mutations in <b>SHANK</b> 2 and <b>SHANK</b> 3 have been detected in several autistic individuals. <b>SHANK</b> genes code {{for a family of}} scaffolding proteins located in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. To test the hypothesis that a mutation in <b>SHANK</b> 1 contributes to the symptoms of autism, we evaluated <b>Shank</b> 1 (-/-) null mutant mice for behavioral phenotypes with relevance to autism, focusing on social communication. Ultrasonic vocalizations and the deposition of scent marks appear to be two major modes of mouse communication. Our findings revealed evidence for low levels of ultrasonic vocalizations and scent marks in <b>Shank</b> 1 (-/-) mice as compared to wildtype <b>Shank</b> 1 (+/+) littermate controls. <b>Shank</b> 1 (-/-) pups emitted fewer vocalizations than <b>Shank</b> 1 (+/+) pups when isolated from mother and littermates.

40|$|<b>Shank</b> {{proteins}} are {{a family}} of multidomain scaffolding proteins best known for their role in organizing the postsynaptic density region in neurons.

The present study utilized bioinformatics to demonstrate the presence of exons encoding ankyrin repeats in the region preceding the previously described <b>Shank</b> 2 gene. cDNA sequencing of mRNA from epithelial cells revealed a novel spliceoform of <b>Shank</b> 2, termed <b>Shank</b> 2 E, that encodes a predicted 200 kDa protein with six N-terminal ankyrin repeats. <b>Shank</b> 2 mRNA from epithelial tissues was larger than transcripts in brain. Likewise, the apparent mass of <b>Shank</b> 2 protein was larger in epithelial tissues (230 kDa) when compared with brain (165 / 180 kDa). Immunofluorescence and membrane fractionation found <b>Shank</b> 2 E concentrated at the apical membrane of liver epithelial cells.

40|$|<b>Shank</b> {{proteins}} (<b>Shank</b> 1, <b>Shank</b> 2, and <b>Shank</b> 3) act as scaffolding {{molecules in}} the postsynaptic density of many excitatory neurons. Mutations in <b>SHANK</b> genes, in particular <b>SHANK</b> 2 and <b>SHANK</b> 3, lead to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in {{both human and}} mouse models. <b>Shank</b> 3 proteins are made of several domains-the Shank/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain, ankyrin repeats, SH 3 domain, PDZ domain, a proline-rich region, and the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain. Via various binding partners of these domains, <b>Shank</b> 3 is able to bind and interact {{with a wide range}} of proteins including modulators of small GTPases such as RICH 2, a RhoGAP protein, and &# 946;PIX, a RhoGEF protein for Rac 1 and Cdc 42, actin binding proteins and actin modulators. Dysregulation of all isoforms of <b>Shank</b> proteins, but especially <b>Shank</b> 3, leads to alterations in spine morphogenesis, shape, and activity of the synapse via altering actin dynamics. Therefore, here, we highlight the role of <b>Shank</b> proteins as modulators of small GTPases and, ultimately, actin dynamics, as found in multiple in vitro and in vivo models. The failure to mediate this regulatory role might present a shared mechanism in the pathophysiology of autism-associated mutations, which leads to dysregulation of spine morphogenesis and synaptic signaling.

Copy-number variants and truncating mutations in <b>SHANK</b> genes were present in ∼ 1 % of patients with ASD: mutations in <b>SHANK</b> 1 were rare (0. 04 %) and present in males with normal IQ and autism; mutations in <b>SHANK</b> 2 were present in 0. 17 % of patients with ASD and mild intellectual disability; mutations in <b>SHANK</b> 3 were present in 0. 69 % of patients with ASD and up to 2. 12 % of the cases with moderate to profound intellectual disability.

40|$|<b>Shank</b> 3 is a postsynaptic density (PSD) {{scaffold}} protein of the <b>Shank</b> family. Here we use pre-embedding immunogold {{electron microscopy}} to investigate factors influencing {{the distribution of}} <b>Shank</b> 3 at the PSD. In dissociated rat hippocampal cultures under basal conditions, label for <b>Shank</b> 3 was concentrated in a broad layer of the PSD, ~ 20 - 80 nm from the postsynaptic membrane. Upon depolarization with high K+ (90 mM, 2 min), or application of NMDA (50 μM, 2 min), both the labeling intensity at the PSD and the median distance of label from the postsynaptic membrane increased significantly, indicating that <b>Shank</b> 3 molecules are preferentially recruited to the distal layer of the PSD. Incubation in medium supplemented with zinc (50 μM ZnCl 2, 1 hr) also significantly increased labeling intensity for <b>Shank</b> 3 at the PSD, but this addition of <b>Shank</b> 3 was not preferential to the distal layer. When cells were incubated with zinc and then treated with NMDA, labeling intensity of <b>Shank</b> 3 became higher than with either treatment alone and manifested a preference for the distal layer of the PSD. Without zinc supplementation, NMDA-induced accumulation of <b>Shank</b> 3 at the PSD was transient, reversing within 30 min after return to control medium.

The album is a follow-up to her successful debut album, Thankful (2003). Executive produced by Clive Davis, Breakaway sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John <b>Shanks,</b> Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, {{in pursuit of a}} pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release.
