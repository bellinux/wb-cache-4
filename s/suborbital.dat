5|$|After the accident, NASA {{decided to}} give the flight the {{official}} designation of Apollo 1 and then skip to Apollo 4 for the first unmanned orbital test of the CSM, counting the two unmanned <b>suborbital</b> tests AS-201 and 202 {{as part of the}} sequence. The spacecraft problems were corrected, and the Apollo program carried on to reach its objective of landing men on the Moon successfully.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been <b>suborbital</b> and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day. Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce {{the gap between the}} two countries.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{applications}} were envisaged for the Gemini spacecraft {{at various stages}} before, during, and after the two years {{in which it was}} used by NASA for manned spaceflight. Although none of these proposals ever made it into operation, many were considered seriously, and in some cases flight hardware was constructed prior to cancellation. In the case of the Manned Orbital Laboratory, a Gemini spacecraft was launched on a <b>suborbital</b> demonstration flight in support of the program. In some cases technology developed in the Advanced Gemini program has been reintegrated into other programs, such as components from the Titan IIIM, which was to have launched MOL, being used to upgrade other Titan rockets.|$|E

5|$|Selected {{as one of}} the Mercury Seven astronauts, Grissom was {{the pilot}} of the second American <b>suborbital</b> flight, in the Liberty Bell 7. The hatch of the craft blew off and filled with water, causing it to sink {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. His next flight was in the Project Gemini Program in a craft named the Molly Brown, which was a {{successful}} mission. He was killed along with fellow astronauts Ed White and Roger Chaffee during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (then known as Cape Kennedy), Florida. He was the first of the Mercury Seven to die. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and, posthumously, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Shepard's {{high school}} alma mater in Derry, Pinkerton Academy, has a {{building}} named after him, {{and the school}} team is called the Astros after his career as an astronaut. Alan B. Shepard High School, in Palos Heights, Illinois, which opened in 1976, was named in his honor. Framed newspapers throughout the school depict various accomplishments and milestones in Shepard's life. Additionally, an autographed plaque commemorates {{the dedication of the}} building. The school newspaper is named Freedom 7 and the yearbook is entitled Odyssey. Blue Origin's <b>suborbital</b> space tourism rocket, the New Shepard, is named after Shepard.|$|E
5|$|The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the United States Department of Defense Space Test Program (STP) {{conducted}} the Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE) on September 19, 2009, using exhaust particles from a Black Brant XII <b>suborbital</b> sounding rocket launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility {{to create an}} artificial noctilucent cloud. The cloud was to be observed {{over a period of}} weeks or months by ground instruments and the Spatial Heterodyne IMager for MEsospheric Radicals (SHIMMER) instrument on the NRL/STP STPSat-1 spacecraft. The rocket's exhaust plume was observed and reported to news organizations in the United States from New Jersey to Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|When NASA {{was created}} that same year, the Air Force program was {{transferred}} to it and renamed Project Mercury. The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard Freedom7, launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (<b>suborbital)</b> flight. John Glenn became the first American to be launched into orbit, by an Atlas launch vehicle on February 20, 1962, aboard Friendship7. Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit flight Faith 7, May 15–16, 1963.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ride}} was renovated in 1990, a new space theme was given. The {{story of the}} ride was the {{passengers}} had been to deliver cargo from a <b>suborbital</b> factory to a station in Alaska. Large screen projections, simulated lasers, mist, and recordings {{were added to the}} ride. In the queue, guests would go through three rooms including Rocket Recovery, Mission Control and Repair Bay. The original entrance to the ride was located next to Troika. During HalloWeekends, the park would change the entrance of Disaster Transport to under the lift hill, leaving the one next to Troika to be used for the Halloween Haunt. For the 2009 season, the entrance was permanently changed to under the lift hill. When the entrance was changed, the Rocket Recovery and Mission Control rooms were closed, leaving the Repair Bay the only room guests walked through.|$|E
5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a <b>suborbital</b> trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E

5|$|The viper dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a <b>suborbital</b> muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E
