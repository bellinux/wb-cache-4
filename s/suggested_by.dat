5|$|A thick {{regolith}} {{layer on}} the lower slopes of the mountains and a thin cover of debris on the upper slopes are <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> the relative absence of large boulders {{on the lower}} mountain flanks.|$|E
5|$|According to film {{historian}} Laurent Bouzereau, Jabba the Hutt's {{death in}} Return of the Jedi was <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> script writer Lawrence Kasdan.

5|$|Alternative {{dates for}} his reign (1194 to 1170 BC) were <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> David Rohl, {{but these were}} {{rejected}} {{by the majority of}} Egyptologists even before the radiocarbon date was published in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Among his discoveries was the {{asteroid}} 253 Mathilde, found on November 12, 1885. The initial orbital elements of {{the asteroid}} were then computed by V. A.

5|$|Another {{approach}} to understanding mirror symmetry was <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow in 1996.

5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, {{who was a}} son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, {{it is possible that}} the two were brothers too, as <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E

5|$|Djedkare {{may have}} left {{some of his}} monuments {{unfinished}} at his death, as <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> several relief-bearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in the pyramid of king Unas. Their original setting remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s {{other ideas}} were {{proposed}} as non-standard cosmologies to explain Hubble's observations, including the Milne model, the oscillatory universe (originally <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Friedmann, but advocated by Albert Einstein and Richard Tolman) and Fritz Zwicky's tired light hypothesis.|$|E
60|$|Volumnia {{had thought}} {{he might have been}} employed. Sir Leicester could desire to know by whom, and what for.

30|$|Results {{shown on}} the CloudHarmony website are much higher, but this could be because they are using a file size of 4 GB, whereas our test is using the default setting (double size of the memory) in EC 2 for the more {{accurate}} results as <b>suggest</b> <b>by</b> Bonnie++ literature.|$|R
5|$|During winter, {{it often}} makes short {{distance}} movements, and some birds move into parts of western Pakistan and an adjoining corner of Iran, and less commonly north-western Gujarat, India. Longer movements may occur, as <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> a possible sighting in the United Arab Emirates in November 2000.|$|E

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{argues for}} the latest possible date of Proto-Indo-European (without Anatolian), roughly a millennium later than the mainstream Kurgan hypothesis.

40|$|Photonic {{structures}} with {{long-range order}} are inherently iridescent, <b>suggesting</b> <b>by</b> current theory. Contrary to this paradigm and inspired by biological photonic structures from hairs of blue tarantulas, a noniridescent photonic structure with long-range order is shown here. This photonic structure is hierarchical and has high degrees of rotational symmetry in suitable spatial scales...|$|R
50|$|Other allelic {{variants}} are Met239Val {{which was}} identified in an Italian pedigree by Rogaev (1995) who also suggested {{early on that}} the gene may be similar to PSEN1, and an Asp439Ala mutation in exon 12 of the gene which is <b>suggest</b> <b>by</b> Lleo (2001) to change the endoproteolytic processing of the PS2.|$|R
5|$|Foucault's {{analysis}} of Las Meninas, although {{on one level}} a contribution to art history, is more about epistemology, specifically the 'cognitive status of the modern human sciences', based on the possibility, <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Ludwig Wittgenstein, that a picture {{is a model of}} reality.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{initially}} {{named his}} discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius.

5|$|High {{potassium}} levels {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe rhabdomyolysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E
