5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead <b>sinkers</b> in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the price rose rapidly {{as a result}} of {{increasing}} demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production, stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82. In 1984, the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide, especially in the United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes, fishing <b>sinkers,</b> food-processing equipment, free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, lubricating greases, and shot for waterfowl hunting. Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price.|$|E
5|$|Metallic lead beads {{dating back}} to 7000–6500 BCE {{have been found in}} Asia Minor and may {{represent}} the first example of metal smelting. At that time lead had few (if any) applications due to its softness and dull appearance. The major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver, which may be obtained by burning galena (a common lead mineral). The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics, an application that spread to Ancient Greece and beyond; the Egyptians may have used lead for <b>sinkers</b> in fishing nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, and for ornaments. Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material, as currency, and for construction. Lead was used in the Ancient Chinese royal court as a stimulant, as currency, and as a contraceptive; the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in wire drawing.|$|E

50|$|On 15 March 1926 however, {{shortly before}} the {{completion}} of shaft number 2 six men fell to their death when the Capstan engine controlling the scaffolding upon which they were working upon malfunctioned. It was described in local papers with headlines such as ‘Mysterious Mishap’, as the full cause of the tragedy was unknown. It {{was not the first}} loss of life at the pit but was to be ultimately the most costly. The incident was the largest loss of life in a mine in the United Kingdom in 1926. The six men who lost their lives are as follows; Edmund Thorley, age 33 - 1st Chargeman <b>sinker,</b> John Hansbury, age 34 - 2nd Chargeman <b>sinker,</b> John William Barley, age 51 - <b>Sinker,</b> Charles H.

5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net <b>sinkers,</b> plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper {{was the most important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked {{deposits of}} emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sinker</b> ball has {{an ability}} to “dive” at the plate, often {{resulting}} in ground balls. Several ground ball pitchers such as Tim Hudson, Greg Maddux, Derek Lowe, Chien-Ming Wang, Brandon Webb, and Jake Westbrook rely heavily on their <b>sinker</b> pitches and may often be considered sinkerballers. Self-proclaimed ground ball pitcher Zach Day has indicated that his primary pitch is a <b>sinker</b> ball as well.|$|R
50|$|Carpenter's <b>sinker</b> {{generally}} {{averaged about}} 91.5 mph in 2011, his last full season, and slightly lower that its average speed of 93 mph in 2009. His <b>sinker</b> and four-seam fastball combination averaged 92.4 mph in 2011. Against right-handed hitters, his <b>sinker</b> was most effective with horizontal movement {{rather than with}} marked sink. His cutter actually had more sink on it than his <b>sinker,</b> along with the effective, familiar cutting motion. It averaged between 86.5 and 88 mph {{over the last few}} years over his career. The curveball had significant downward movement, and, at or below 75 mph, was slow for a pitcher who threw as hard as Carpenter did.|$|R
25|$|Tackle that is {{attached}} {{to the end of a}} fishing line is called terminal tackle. This includes hooks, <b>sinkers,</b> floats, leaders, swivels, split rings and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures.|$|E
25|$|A {{pattern of}} {{multiple}} baits or lures can be trolled at varying distances behind a boat. Lures can be fished {{straight from the}} rod tip (flat line), or from outriggers. Purpose designed <b>sinkers</b> exist to control the trolling depth on freshwater lakes.|$|E
25|$|Lead poisoning* is {{uncommon}} in dogs. Exposure to lead is from eating paint chips from lead-based paint (found in houses painted prior to 1950), and eating lead {{objects such as}} shot, fishing <b>sinkers,</b> or counterweights. Signs of poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, blindness, seizures, and tremors.|$|E
50|$|During his prime, Wang was a finesse pitcher {{with a power}} pitcher's velocity. In this period, he {{primarily}} {{relied on}} his power <b>sinker</b> along with the occasional four-seam fastball, slider, changeup, and splitter. His <b>sinker,</b> which was responsible for his elevation to ace status before his foot injury, had very impressive lateral movement and was thrown at greater than average velocity, sitting in the 91-94 mph range. Before his first shoulder injury, {{he also had a}} curveball until he was encouraged to opt for a <b>sinker</b> instead. By 2016, after a long recovery process, Wang's <b>sinker</b> had returned to the 89-93 mph range, with a top speed of 95 mph.|$|R
50|$|Abad {{features}} a four-seam fastball (94-97 mph), a <b>sinker</b> (92-95 mph), a curveball (78-83 mph), and a changeup (75-79 mph). He tends {{to use the}} <b>sinker</b> and changeup more against right-handed hitters, and his four-seamer and curveball more against left-handed hitters.|$|R
50|$|Tim Hudson {{notes that}} he {{transformed}} from a strikeout pitcher to a ground ball pitcher because of the capabilities of his <b>sinker</b> ball. He also {{notes that he}} feels double plays are easy to force with a ground ball. As of 1998, 72% of balls put in play against Greg Maddux resulted in ground balls, who often relies on a <b>sinker</b> ball.In June 2002, Lowe allowed eleven fly balls to 129 batters, relying on his <b>sinker</b> to induce ground balls. According to a scouting report by Lewis Shaw, Brandon Webb’s <b>sinker</b> possesses heavy downward movement and high velocity, {{and one of his}} notable tendencies is to induce ground balls from right-handed hitters.|$|R
25|$|Loons may {{inadvertently}} ingest small lead pellets, {{released by}} anglers and hunters, that {{will contribute to}} lead poisoning and the loon's eventual death. Jurisdictions that have banned the use of lead shot and <b>sinkers</b> include {{but are not limited}} to Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, some areas of Massachusetts, Yellowstone National Park, Great Britain, Canada, Michigan, and Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Yellowfin whiting {{have become}} a major target for anglers in both South and Western Australia {{for a number of}} reasons: they are very good table fish, they provide good sport on light line, and are easily {{accessible}} from beaches and jetties, with a boat not necessary for their capture. Yellowfin whiting are actually most commonly targeted from beaches, estuaries and jetties constructed over shallow waters, with good catches often made on the ingoing and outgoing period of the tide. Due to their easily spooked nature, tackle used to capture the fish is usually very light, with lines kept below 6kg, hooks below size 4, and <b>sinkers</b> to an absolute minimum as heavy lines and <b>sinkers</b> often scare away the fish. Specialist whiting fishermen often attach a red bead or piece of tubing directly above the hook to attract the fish, although the usefulness of this is debated. The most common bait used is 'beach worms', which may be from a variety of families, with prawns, cockles and squid occasionally taking good catches also. Lure and fly fishing for the species is poorly developed, with their shy nature preventing these methods from being effectively used.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{reasons for}} using lead are its {{relatively}} low melting point and cost {{compared to other}} high density materials. It is also resistant to corrosion in fresh and salt water. Most dive weights are cast by foundries and sold by dive shops to divers {{in a range of}} sizes, but some are made by divers for their own use. Scrap lead from sources such as fishing <b>sinkers</b> and wheel balance weights can be easily cast by a hobbyist in relatively cheap re-usable moulds, though this exposes them to vaporized lead fumes.|$|E
50|$|Adcock is a sinkerballer. His <b>sinker</b> {{is thrown}} in the low 90s and has superb movement; it averages nearly a foot of tailside break away from left-handers and in toward right-handers. Complementing his <b>sinker</b> are a four-seam fastball, slider, curveball, and changeup.|$|R
50|$|Qualls throws {{two main}} pitches: a heavy <b>sinker</b> in the low-to-mid 90s, {{and a hard}} slider in the mid-to-upper 80s.

25|$|The Archaic period, from 8000–2000 BCE, {{experienced}} warmer climates. Archaic {{peoples in}} West Virginia were hunter-gatherers, who fished and gathered wild berries, nuts, seeds, and wild plants. The megafauna had migrated or died out by this time, so people hunted deer, bear, wild turkeys, rabbits, {{and other small}} game with atlatls and small spears. The atlatls used elaborate stone weights called bannerstones. They used ground-stone implements and flint woodworking tools, as well as bowls of sandstone and soapstone, knives, and net <b>sinkers.</b> In Kanawha Valley, tools were made with Kanawha Black Flint. The Kessell Side Notched point at the St. Albans Site, dated to 7900 BCE, {{is an example of}} a rare, early archaic stone point.|$|E
25|$|Recreational {{fishing is}} done for {{pleasure}} or sport, and not for profit or survival. Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard {{with the intent to}} catch a fish. Usually some form of fishing tackle is brought on board, such as hooks, lines, <b>sinkers</b> or nets. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, kayaks, rafts, pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs. Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open cockpits at the stern, designed for convenient fishing.|$|E
25|$|Historically, in Alaska, {{hand hook}} and line {{trolling}} {{were used to}} catch king and silver salmon in salt water. This method required minimal gear-boat, lines and hooks—and was used to catch fish that were still feeding in open water before returning to spawn. Trolling was very successful in southeast Alaska and historically the catch {{was used by the}} fresh and mild-cured fish packing industries. Power boats located near feeding grounds conducted most of the trolling. Each boat had four to ten lines, extending from tall poles hung outboard when fishing; each line carried several hooks, with heavy lead <b>sinkers</b> and spoons or baits as lures. Trolling lengthened the fishing season, allowing fishermen to fish in early spring before spawning runs.|$|E
50|$|Webb {{was mainly}} {{known for his}} <b>sinker.</b> Along with Roy Halladay's and Chien-Ming Wang's, it had often been {{considered}} the best such pitch in baseball. His <b>sinker</b> was thrown in the 87-91 mph range. He also threw a curveball (72-75) and changeup (77-80), and occasionally cutter against left-handed hitters.|$|R
50|$|In baseball, a <b>sinker</b> or sinking fastball {{is a type}} of fastball pitch {{which has}} {{significant}} downward and horizontal movement and is known for inducing ground balls. Pitchers who use the <b>sinker</b> tend to rely on it heavily and do not need to change pitch speeds as much as other pitchers do because the sinking action induces weak bat contact. Other pitchers normally change pitch speeds to achieve this effect.link refers to one analysts opinion The <b>sinker</b> is much more often used by right-handed pitchers than left-handed pitchers.|$|R
50|$|Stammen is a sinkerballer. His <b>sinker</b> {{is thrown}} in the 90-93 mph range and is used {{especially}} frequently against left-handed hitters. Against right-handed batters, Stammen pairs his <b>sinker</b> with a slider in the mid 80s. The <b>sinker</b> is useful in inducing ground balls, while the slider is a good option for compiling strikeouts — it has a whiff rate of 46% for his career and is the pitch most responsible for his career strikeouts. Additionally, he has a curveball that is used frequently in two-strike counts, especially against left-handers. He also a four-seam fastball.|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{reactions}} of professional fishermen, western school whiting are considered to have good to excellent flesh for eating, and fetch similar high prices at market to other whiting species. Due to their offshore nature {{in the south of}} Western Australia, they are rarely taken by recreational fishermen, while {{in the northern part of}} their range where they inhabit shallower waters, they are often overlooked for larger tropical species by anglers. Thus they are not a major recreational fishery either. They respond to the same fishing styles as other whitings, generally using light lines and <b>sinkers</b> with worm or mollusc baits. They are caught off beaches, jetties and from boats. There is no size restriction on the species, but a daily bag limit of 40 per person applies.|$|E

500|$|The common loon's {{breeding}} range has moved northward, the species breeding {{as far south}} as Iowa a century ago. It is adversely affected by acid rain and pollution, as well as lead poisoning from fishing <b>sinkers</b> (especially those that are {{about the size of the}} grit stones they ingest) and mercury contamination from industrial waste. [...] Heavy metals such as mercury may be partially removed through biological processes such as excretion or deposition in feathers, but their adverse effects are magnified through concentration of the toxic elements in organs such as the liver. Eggs shells may also contain metal contaminants, leading to low reproductive productivity. High levels of heavy metals are linked to loons being in poor condition, males being affected more because they eat larger fish.|$|E
