40|$|The direct {{imaging and}} {{characterization}} of Earth-like planets {{is among the}} most sought-after prizes in contemporary astrophysics, however current optical instrumentation delivers insufficient dynamic range to overcome the vast contrast differential between the planet and its host star. New opportunities are offered by coherent <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> <b>fibers,</b> whose technological development has been motivated by the needs of the telecom industry in the near infrared. This paper presents a new vision for an instrument using coherent waveguides to remap the pupil geometry of the telescope. It would (i) inject the full pupil of the telescope into an array of <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> <b>fibers,</b> (ii) rearrange the pupil so fringes can be accurately measured, and (iii) permit image reconstruction so that atmospheric blurring can be totally removed. Here we present a laboratory experiment whose goal was to validate the theoretical concepts underpinning our proposed method.

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} are optical fiber Fabry-Perot (FP) sensors and side-polished fibers. By vacuum deposition, {{aluminum}} films are formed directly onto the <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> <b>fibers</b> to serve as mirrors. FP cavities with Al mirrors {{are used in the}} experimental investigations. Typical finesse is about 4. However, finesse as high as 14 has been achieved. The transfer functions and polarization characteristics of single-mode fiber FP cavities are studied. To use optical fiber FP cavities as temperature and stress sensors, ways must be found to discern the direction of the change of the optical path length. Such a scheme has been developed and demonstrated. Theoretical study also shows two polarization modes are supported by FP cavities containing birefringent fibers, and the retardation between two polarization modes is varied when the fiber is stressed laterally. Taking advantage of the stress dependent retardation, optical fiber polarimetric sensors without using analyzers are proposed and demonstrated. The theoretical results are confirmed with the experimental investigations. ^ The main objectives of side-polished fiber research are to develop techniques to form and to characterize low-loss side polished <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> <b>fibers.</b> Theoretical calculations show that the polished surface has to be within 12 to 2 μm of the core if significant interaction with the fields guided by a single-mode fiber is desired. The study also reveals that the polishing depth must be determined accurately to within fractions of a micron for most applications. Therefore, stringent dimensional control is necessary if the polishing is to be successful. In this thesis, a reliable technique of fabricating side-polished <b>fibers</b> is established. <b>Single</b> <b>mode</b> <b>fibers</b> are embedded in the V grooves of silicon wafers and polished with 0. 05 μm colloidal silica slurries. A nondestructive method to estimate the polishing depth has been demonstrated. ...|$|R
