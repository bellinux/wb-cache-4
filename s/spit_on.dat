5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would <b>spit</b> <b>on</b> their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In March 1991, {{during a}} game in New Jersey, Barkley {{attempted}} to <b>spit</b> <b>on</b> a fan that had been heckling with racial slurs but the result was his spit hitting a little girl. Rod Thorn, the NBA's president of operations at the time, suspended Barkley without pay and fined him $10,000 for spitting and verbally abusing the fan. It became a national story and Barkley was vilified for it. Barkley, however, eventually developed a friendship with the girl and her family. He apologized and, among other things, provided them tickets to future games.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would <b>spit</b> <b>on</b> him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E

An air weapons range used by the New Zealand Defence Force is a short distance south of the spit.|$|E
25|$|Attendance at {{the renovated}} {{building}} rose significantly to 214,495 {{in just two}} months. In the past, both museums had drawn just 450,000 over 12 months.

Some patrons <b>spit</b> <b>on</b> art they did not like, while others kissed or touched some paintings. Video security cameras were hastily installed in September 2007 to stop the vandalism. By the end of the year, more than 786,000 people had visited the two museums.|$|E

Sometimes, an incident involving Jim Carrey forgetting a line led to animosity between the two actors during filming. Between scenes Jim Carrey often remained in character as Andy Kaufman {{and at one point}} <b>spit</b> <b>on</b> Jerry, just as Kaufman had done in 1982. A 'stunned' Lawler reacted by grabbing Carrey by the hair and locked him in a sleeper hold and jerking his neck—supposedly sending Carrey to the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Orford Ness is a cuspate {{foreland}} shingle <b>spit</b> <b>on</b> the Suffolk {{coast in}} Great Britain, {{linked to the}} mainland at Aldeburgh and stretching along the coast to Orford and down to North Weir Point, opposite Shingle Street. It is divided from the mainland by the River Alde, and was formed by longshore drift along the coast. The material of the spit comes from places further north, such as Dunwich. Near the middle point of its length, at the foreland point or 'Ness', lies the Orfordness Lighthouse. In {{the name of the}} lighthouse (and the radio transmitting station – see below), 'Orfordness' is written as one word.|$|E
25|$|Levin {{returned}} to political writing with his play The Patriot, which opened October 1982 at the Neve Zedek Theater, directed by Oded Kotler. The play presents, among other things, an Israeli citizen who asks to emigrate to the United States. On account of this, the American consul asks him to <b>spit</b> <b>on</b> his mother, to kick an Arab boy's face, and afterward, to taunt God. Although the Council for Film and Drama Criticism banned the entire play, Kottler decided to present it. Yitzhak Zamir, then the government's legal counsel, recommended indictments against the theater management for transgressing censorship law. The play {{was allowed to}} go on only after it was edited.|$|E

Despite Benn's efforts, his display was tarnished through a spitting incident with South African fast bowler Dale Steyn. Benn was reported to have provoked Steyn to <b>spit</b> <b>on</b> the feet of Benn after his dismissal when batting, and this resulted in a formal complaint to the ICC from Cricket South Africa, which was matched by a complaint from West Indies Cricket also, causing Steyn to lose his match fee.|$|E

However, the mob had not tied his hands and, as he struggled free, they broke his arm and shoulder, while another attempted to set light to his naked foot. He was taken down a further time and cruelly beaten before being hung up again, and died {{a short while}} later, just before midnight on 7 September 1736. The spot where Porteous died is today marked by a memorial plate in the Grassmarket.

25|$|In , {{the rivalry}} hit {{an all-time high}} when Darcy Tucker {{attacked}} the Senators' Chris Neil, who {{was sitting on the}} bench. This resulted in numerous players exchanging punches before order was restored. Tucker, Neil and Shane Hnidy all received fighting majors and game misconducts for the same incident. After the game, Tucker claimed Neil <b>spit</b> <b>on</b> him, an allegation which Neil denied. The NHL board looked into this claim and concluded that Tucker's allegation was false. Tempers remained frayed, especially with 1:23 to play, when Toronto's Tie Domi went after Magnus Arvedson and threw several punches at Arvedson. Video evidence showed Arvedson spearing Domi just prior, awaiting the faceoff. Domi received a roughing minor, instigator minor, fighting major, misconduct and game misconduct. Arvedson did not get a penalty on the play. Suspensions were announced a few hours after Tucker and Domi appeared at NHL head offices in Toronto for a hearing. Tucker was suspended for five games, without pay, after it was determined that Neil did not spit at Toronto's bench. Domi was suspended for three games, also without pay. A total of 163 minutes in penalties were called in the game.|$|E
25|$|Kittie {{was formed}} in 1996 when drummer Mercedes Lander and guitarist Fallon Bowman met in gym class. Mercedes' sister Morgan Lander became the lead vocalist and guitarist after weeks of Fallon and Mercedes jamming. Tanya Candler {{completed}} the lineup by joining as the bassist. Kittie made demos and started playing concerts in 1998. The band played concerts at Call the Office and the Embassy and signed up for Canadian Music Week in 1999. Kittie approached Jason Wyner, {{a person who was}} second in command at NG Records. The band went up to Jason and made him see them play live and Jason and the rest of NG Records signed Kittie in the summer of 1999. Kittie got signed to the NG Records-distributed record label Artemis Records and producer Garth Richardson acquired Kittie's demo. NG Records was bought out by Artemis Records. Therefore, Kittie ended up on Artemis Records. Kittie released their debut album <b>Spit</b> <b>on</b> Artemis Records and toured with the band Slipknot. Although Kittie's album Spit was finished in August 1999, it wasn't released until January 2000. The album is the band's most successful album, being certified gold by the RIAA. Spit has sold at least 600,000 copies in the United States and at least 40,000 copies in Canada. Bassist Tanya Candler was replaced by bassist Talena Atfield.|$|E
