40|$|A novel {{small size}} {{wearable}} antenna for WLAN applications is proposed in this paper. The antenna structure {{is based on}} a previous development and achieves lower size by implementing different miniaturization techniques. The radiating structure has the shape and dimensions of a standard denim jeans button and is made up of a button shaped cylindrical structure and a top metal disc connected to the ground plane. The antenna is also filled by a dielectric material and an extra <b>shorting</b> <b>via</b> connects the two top parallel plates. The structure and dimensions achieved are those of a standard metal button with greater deal of camouflage and rigidness than previous wearable antenna developments. The proposed wearable antenna is designed for 2. 4 GHz and 5 GHz with an omni-directional pattern required for transmission with other wearable devices located across the body...|$|E

A Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA) for real time locating has been designed, built and characterized on paper substrate. In specific the PIFA for tagging of metallic objects such as containers in ports or automotive applications is designed, fabricated, and characterized on a paper substrate. The antenna interconnect, or simply the <b>shorting</b> <b>via</b> A via, was drilled though the paper substrate using laser in one of the corners of the structure and, and is characterized by plotting S parameters.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, various topologies {{of feeding}} {{structures}} are comparatively evaluated for 60 -GHz three-dimensional integrated cavity resonators used in three-dimensional integrated RF modules. Three excitation techniques (slot excitation with a <b>shorting</b> <b>via,</b> slot excitation with a 4 open stub, probe excitation) {{have been evaluated}} using simulated and measured data. The probe excitation is demonstrated as an attractive option for wideband applications due to its relatively wide bandwidth performance (1. 8 %) and the strongest external coupling. The slot excitation with an open stub outperforms the other techniques, exhibiting the lowest insertion loss (0. 84 dB) for a 3 -dB bandwidth of about 1. 5 % centered at 59. 2 GHz and has the simplest fabrication. Index Terms—Cavity resonators, low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC), millimeter-wave (mmW), probe excitation, slot excitation, system-on-package (SOP), 3 -D integration, unloaded quality factor (Qu).

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that commercial snap-on buttons can be utilized as detachable <b>shorting</b> <b>vias</b> for wearable textile antennas. As a consequence, modularity in antenna characteristics {{can be obtained}} based on a common initial design. As an illustration, a patch antenna with different configurations of <b>shorting</b> <b>vias</b> is designed and experimentally characterized. In this design, adapted from a recently reported modular snap-on-buttonbased wearable antenna, four sets of two back-toback male snap-on buttons affixed within a twolayered substrate are used as detachable patch holders and/or modular <b>shorting</b> <b>vias</b> to the ground plane. By engaging selected male buttons from the ground plane with female buttons to form <b>shorting</b> <b>vias,</b> various antenna patterns can be selected.

40|$|In this paper, a circularly {{polarized}} U-slot half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) antenna is proposed. It {{is based on}} a combination of U-shaped slot etched in the HMSIW top wall and a <b>shorting</b> <b>via</b> placed between the area bounded by the slot and the HMSIW bottom wall. The antenna is designed for the operating frequency of 10 GHz, parametrically studied, fabricated and experimentally verified. Experimental results proves that the fabricated prototype radiates a left handed {{circularly polarized}} (LHCP) electromagnetic wave and it achieves the impedance bandwidth of 11. 9 % for the reflection coefficient less than - 10 dB, the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth 2. 2 % for AR less than 3 dB, and the LHCP peak gain of 6 dBi.

40|$|Preliminary: Please do not quote or cite without {{permission}} from the authors Contributing to the debate whether securities lending should move to central counterparties (CCP), we examine short selling from the centralized and the over-the-counter (OTC) lending markets. We also differentiate between domestic versus offshore OTC lending where the offshore lending is effectively unknown to regulators. This lack of transparency in the offshore market {{is likely to be}} preferred not only by traders with private information but also by rouge traders. We find that the offshore market is not disruptive rather it is the most efficient information provisional channel, reflected by the- 1. 7 % underperformance of the highly shorted stocks in the subsequent month. Interestingly, stocks with high shorting from the centralized market do not experience significant underperformance over the next month. Rather <b>shorting</b> <b>via</b> CCP facilitate transient price discovery and liquidity, where a 1 % increase in shorting is associated with 7 % higher liquidity. Overall, our results suggest that the centralized and the OTC lending markets complement each other, as we find that stocks with non-trivial short selling from all three alternative lending markets exhibit the highest pricing efficiency, with the lowest skewness, kurtosis and price delays...|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} mode {{analysis of}} vias in the multilayered printed-circuit-board periphery is developed {{to suppress the}} electromagnetic radiation induced by ground bounce. After separating the even and odd modes in alternating planes, the far-field radiation of parallel plates is derived using Huygens' principle. It is mainly contributed by the odd mode excitation, while the even mode sets a lower bound on the radiation level from the system when <b>shorting</b> <b>vias</b> are inserted between alternating ground plates. For the odd-mode radiation, a canonical problem is then constructed and analytically solved by applying image theory. Based on that, a systematic approach to achieve the optimum suppression design is developed for the various geometry parameters of the <b>shorting</b> <b>vias,</b> including the pitch, radius, and distance to the board edge. Full-wave simulation and measurement are also presented and the good agreement with the theoretical prediction validates the correctness and efficiency of the present analysis and design...|$|R
