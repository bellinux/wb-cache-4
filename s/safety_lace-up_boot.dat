40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of wearing two standard underground coal mining work boots (a gumboot and a leather <b>lace-up</b> <b>boot)</b> on lower limb muscle activity when participants walked across simulated underground coal mining surfaces. Quadriceps (rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis) and hamstring (biceps femoris, semitendinosus) muscle activity were recorded as twenty male participants walked at a self-selected pace around a circuit while wearing each boot type. The circuit consisted of level, inclined and declined surfaces composed of rocky gravel and hard dirt. Walking in a leather <b>lace-up</b> <b>boot,</b> compared to a gumboot, resulted in increased vastus lateralis and increased biceps femoris muscle activity when walking on sloped surfaces. Increased muscle activity appears to be acting as a slip and/or trip prevention strategy in response to challenging surfaces and changing boot features...|$|R

40|$|Lower limb {{injuries}} are highly prevalent in underground coal mining. Wearing gumboots with inadequate ankle support {{was thought to}} contribute to these injuries. Despite the uptake of leather <b>lace-up</b> <b>boots,</b> which provide more ankle support, no recent research could be found investigating {{the effect of this}} alternative work boot in underground coal mining. Consequently, this study aimed to determine whether boot type (gumboot, leather <b>lace-up</b> <b>boot)</b> influenced work footwear habits, foot problems, lower limb pain, lower back pain, or perceptions of work boot fit and comfort in underground coal miners. Chi-squared tests were applied to 358 surveys completed by underground coal miners to determine whether responses differed significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) according to boot-type. There were no significant between-boot differences in regards to the presence of foot problems, lower limb pain or lower back pain. However, the types of foot problems and locations of foot pain differed according to boot type. Gumboot wearers {{were also more likely to}} state that their work boot comfort was either uncomfortable or indifferent, their work boot fit was poor and their current boot did not provide enough support. The introduction of more structured leather <b>lace-up</b> <b>boots</b> appears to have positively influenced the support and fit provided by mining work boots, although foot problems, lower limb pain and lower back pain continue to be reported. Further investigation is recommended to identify which specific boot design features caused these observed differences in work boot fit, comfort and locations of foot pain and how these design features can be manipulated to create an underground coal mining work boot that is comfortable and reduces the high incidence of foot problems and lower limb pain suffered by underground coal miners...|$|R

40|$|Workplace {{injuries}} in mining are highly prevalent (Smith et al., 1999) and, in Australia, occur most frequently in underground coal mines (Government of Western Australia, 2011). The most common of these injuries {{are to the}} lower limbs, contributing to almost 18, 900 lost working days and incurring $ 28 million in compensation claims annually. Approximately, 40 % of miners who sustained lower limb injuries identified their work boots as the main causal factor. As a consequence, laced leather work boots were introduced {{as an alternative to}} the steelcapped gumboot (Marr, 1999; see Figure 1).

50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} to see kilts worn at Irish pubs in the United States, and it is becoming somewhat less rare to see them in the workplace. Casual use of kilts dressed down with <b>lace-up</b> <b>boots</b> or moccasins, and with T-shirts or golf shirts, is becoming increasingly familiar at Highland Games. The kilt is associated with a sense of Scottish national pride and will often be seen being worn, along with a football top, when members of the Tartan Army are watching a football or rugby match. The small Sgian Dubh knife is sometimes substituted by a wooden or plastic alternative or omitted altogether for security concerns: for example, they typically are not allowed to be worn or carried on to a commercial aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Most [...] are {{constructed}} of leather, sometimes with a breathable waterproof lining, such as Gore-Tex. However, the shoes are not comparable to rubber boots {{when it comes}} to being waterproof and drying quickly, making it difficult to cross rivers while keeping the inside of the boot dry. Although there are rubber <b>lace-up</b> <b>boots</b> designed for hiking purposes, rubber hiking boots are not ideal for extensive use because the feet cannot breathe and sweat extensively, which can lead to foot problems such as blisters, fungal infections and trench foot. These drawbacks negate any advantage rubber boots have in keeping out external moisture. However non-rubber hiking boots are generally quite expensive and require more care. The largest hiking boot is 7.14m long, 2.5m wide, and 4.2m tall by Schuh Marke (Germany).|$|R
5000|$|The elasticated side design, {{originally}} {{invented in}} England by Joseph Sparkes Hall in 1837, allows the wearer to easily slip their boots {{on and off}} without the hassle of laces, but with the firm fit of <b>lace-up</b> <b>boots.</b> The original English design, for urban use, {{became known as the}} Chelsea Boot in the 1960s. In 1932 R.M. Williams adapted this design for stockmen's boots. [...] There are several Australian companies manufacturing boots in this classic style today. Some of the more popular brands are Blundstone (perhaps the original dating back to 1870), Rossi Boots (established in 1910 and still manufactured in Australia), R. M. Williams, Baxter's Redback Boots, and Mongrel Boots (Victor Footwear, manufacturing in Australia since 1930). In Australian English, the manufacturer's brand name is often associated generically with this style of boot, leading to the names Blundstones, RMs or Rossis.|$|R
