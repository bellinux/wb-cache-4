40|$|Rhetorical {{sentence}} classification is {{an interesting}} approach for making extractive summaries but this technique {{still needs to be}} developed because the performance of automatic rhetorical sentence classification is still poor. Rhetorical sentences are sentences that contain rhetorical words or phrases. Rhetorical sentences not only appear in the contents of a paper but also in the title. In this study, features related to <b>section</b> <b>class</b> and title class that have been proposed in a previous research were further developed. Our method uses different techniques to reach automatic <b>section</b> <b>class</b> extraction for which we introduce new, format-based features. Furthermore, we propose automatic rhetoric phrase extraction from the title. The corpus we used was a collection of technical-experimental scientific papers. Our method uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and the Naïve Bayesian algorithm for classification. The four categories used were: Problem, Method, Data, and Result. It was hypothesized that these features would be able to improve classification accuracy compared to previous methods. The F-measure for these categories reached up to 14 %.  </p...|$|E

This is a challenge for nurses in the hospitalization. Based on the results of interviews with staff personnel at the hospital found that PKU Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta there are regular activities for the employees of lectures every Wednesday and Saturday. For employees with years of service 15, 20, 25 and 30 years there is also a reward that is usually given on special milad hospital. This is part of organizational culture in hospitals.

Results: Based on bivariate analysis of organizational culture with the organizational commitment, obtained P value 0. 008 < ? 0. 05, for the analysis of bivariate sub variable the demand of work, interpersonal relations, support work and the physical work environment with a organizational commitment the obtained the P value in a row 0. 016, 0. 024, 0. 041, 0. 044 < 0. 05, which means that there is a significant relationship of organizational culture and its sub-variables with organizational commitment of nurse-inpatient <b>section</b> <b>class</b> II and III hospital PKU Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.
