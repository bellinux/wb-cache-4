5000|$|At {{the same}} time, Robin has shown up at Zelena's place, and the witch is stunned {{to find him}} there. He wants to leave Storybrooke, and she agrees to help him, since she also wants to leave for New York City. However, Regina is waiting for them at the city limits, having caught on to Robin {{stealing}} the heart from the vault, and the anti-magic potion. However, when Robin attempts to use the anti-magic potion, it fails to break the protection spell, and instead, the barrier blasts him backwards. Knowing that he is stuck in Storybrooke, Regina, now convinced that the Wish Realm Robin will never {{live up to the}} one she remembers, offers to help him leave if he wants to do so. Later on, Regina and Zelena finally come to an understanding as sisters, but suddenly become aware that the Regina's other half, The Evil Queen, is missing from her cage. Unfortunately, the [...] "serum" [...] Evil Queen (still in her form as a cobra) doesn't <b>stay</b> <b>missing</b> for long, because afterward, Robin is bitten by the aforementioned creature, {{and it turns out that}} the anti-magic potion really works, since the spilled anti-magic potion on Robin's hand restores The Evil Queen to her normal form. Then, the Evil Queen offers to take Robin on a tour of Storybrooke from her viewpoint.|$|E
40|$|Comparison of {{hospital}} admission causes for previously known (group A) and HIV-infected patients diagnosed during in-ward stay (group B), from 2009 to 2011. Retrospective evaluation of demographic, epidemiologic, clinical, immunologic, virologic and treatment parameters {{at time of}} admission. 1167 patients were admitted; of those 617 (52, 9 %) were HIV-infected: 92 % HIV- 1 and 8 % HIV- 2. 83 % had previously known HIV infection and 15 % were diagnosed during hospital <b>stay</b> (<b>missing</b> data in 2 %). 66 % were male, mean age was 46 years and 52 % were Portuguese. The most frequent transmission routes were heterosexual exposure (36 %) and iv drug use (29 %). Mean length {{of hospital}} stay was 17 days (group A) and 28 days (group B) (p =&#x 200 A; 0, 004). At admission, the mean TCD 4 + count was 280 cells/mm 3 in group A, and 132 cells/mm 3 in group B (p&# 60; 0, 001). The majority of group B patients had clinical or immunological AIDS criteria at admission (84 %) while group A presented a 71 % rate for the same parameter (p= 0, 011). In group A, 52 % of patients were on antiretroviral therapy but of those only 33 % presented undetectable HIV plasma RNA, non-adherence being an important cause of therapeutic failure identified in 40 % of cases. Respiratory infection was the principal cause of hospital admission in both groups (33 % in group A vs. 35 % in group B). The most prevalent nosological entities were community acquired pneumonia in group A (18, 1 % vs. 11, 5 %-p= 0, 118) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in group B (4 % vs. 18 %-p&# 60; 0, 001). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was frequently identified {{as an agent of}} opportunistic infection (10 % in group A vs. 24 % in group B-p=&# 60; 0, 001). HCV coinfection was a comorbidity found in 37 % in group A vs. 11 % in group B (p&# 60; 0, 001). Other relevant comorbidities were psychiatric disturbances (16 % vs. 3 %-p= 0, 001) and neoplastic conditions (11 % vs. 0 %-p= 0, 001), mostly present in group A. Mortality rate was not significantly different between groups (10 % group A vs. 11 % group B) (p= 0, 773). This analysis evidenced that, a significant percentage of HIV patients diagnosed at admission were late presenters. Slightly a half of patients with previous known HIV infection were prescribed cARV and only a third presented undetectable HIV viral load. Non-adherence was a major concern in this population. Respiratory infections had a significant clinical impact in both groups, justifying the importance of vaccination prevention strategies in immunocompromised individuals...|$|E
