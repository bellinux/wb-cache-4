50|$|Students then {{learn how}} to control the glider on the ground, {{practicing}} take-offs and controlling the wing 'overhead'. Low, gentle hills are next where students get their first short flights, flying at very low altitudes, {{to get used to}} the handling of the wing over varied terrain. <b>Special</b> <b>winches</b> can be used to tow the glider to low altitude in areas that have no hills readily available.|$|E
50|$|Outdoors, a hood is {{positioned}} either manually or via tractor {{with a special}} pre-stressed 4 point suspension arm. Steaming time amounts to 30 min for a penetration down to 25 cm depth. Hereby a temperature of 90 °C can be reached. In large stable glasshouses, the hoods are attached to tracks. They are lifted and moved by pneumatic cylinders. Small and medium-sized hoods up to 12 m² are lifted manually using a tipping lever or moved electrically with <b>special</b> <b>winches.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{ship was}} built by William Dobson and Company in Walker Yard {{as one of a}} trio of ships {{including}} [...] and [...] for the Goole Steam Shipping Company and launched on 10 July 1884. She was described in the Shields Daily Gazette of 12 July 1884 as constructed with a topgallant forecastle fitted for the crew, long bridge house extending over the engine and boiler room, and poop which will be handsomely fitted up for the comfortable accommodation of first-class passengers. The machinery to be supplied by R and W Hawthorn, and will develop 600 hp, being greatly in excess of that usually fitted. All modern appliances have been provided for the rapid dispatch in loading and unloading cargo, <b>special</b> <b>winches</b> having been prepared to the company’s own design, as also has the steering gear.|$|E
5000|$|Longlining - is a {{commercial}} technique {{that uses a}} long heavy fishing line {{with a series of}} hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Longlines are usually operated from specialised boats called longliners. They use a <b>special</b> <b>winch</b> to haul in the line, and can operate in deeper waters targeting pelagic species such as swordfish, tuna, halibut and sablefish.|$|R
40|$|Time {{studies of}} {{harvesting}} and skidding tree-length logs in Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis L.) natural coastal forests of Chalkidiki area in northern Greece {{were carried out}} to formulate linear regression models and to evaluate productivity. The harvesting system consisted of a feller with chainsaw for felling, delimbing and crosscutting, and a four wheel drive farm tractor, with a 74 kW engine, equipped with a <b>special</b> <b>winch</b> attached to the tractor three point hitch for the extraction of tree length logs. Operational factors such as distance, slope, volume and the time required for harvesting and extracting tree length logs were measured and recorded. The results illustrate that the calibrated linear regression models show strong correlation between the time needed for harvesting operations and the extraction distance from the stump to the forest road...|$|R
50|$|In {{the period}} between 1953-62 the {{production}} program became extremely varied. Aside from a line of simple devices (wheeled sets, <b>special</b> benches, hoisting <b>winches),</b> {{there was also an}} assortment of high accuracy and precision products (air-compressors, tractors, hydraulic pumps, circular sawing machines).|$|R
5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times; they were granted on 5 July 1991. The arms are black with a silver/white winch in the centre. It is a <b>special</b> type of <b>winch</b> that {{has historically been}} used in this area to remove stones from the many farm fields. The arms were chosen to symbolize the hard living on the rocky soils of the municipality.|$|R
40|$|The Surface Heat and Energy Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) was an {{intensive}} field project {{which took place}} in the Arctic Ocean from October 1997 through October 1998. Its purpose was to measure as many facets of the Arctic environment as possible so that {{we would be able to}} better understand the interaction between the ice, atmosphere, and ocean and their interactions with global climate. One aspect of the atmospheric field component was launching tethered balloons to monitor the profiles of temperature, wind, pressure, and humidity, as well as examine the vertical structure of cloud droplet sizes and distributions. The tethered balloon that we used was one specially designed for use in freezing climates by SPEC Corporation in Boulder, Colorado. A <b>special</b> <b>winch</b> that was able to withstand Arctic temperature and weather became necessary when the testing of simple winch systems used in warmer climates failed under these extreme conditions. The purpose of this manual is to acquaint any new user to the powered tethered balloon system deployed at the The Surface Heat and Energy Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA ice camp. It includes a description of the preparations necessary to get ready for a launch, the mechanics of the actual launch, and an account of the proper procedure for taking down the equipment when finished. It will also include tips on how to minimize potential equipment failures, some trouble shooting, and some safety ideas. This manual is designed so that new operators can use the system with minimal previous training. At the end of this manual, the reader will find a quick checklist...|$|R
40|$|Tuna and {{tuna-like fishes}} are under-exploited {{resources}} of Indian EEZ. Exploitation of oceanic tuna and billfishes are possible only by longlining and purse seining. Existing {{deep sea fishing}} vessels in India are mostly trawlers equipped for bottom trawling for shrimps and fishes. Most of them are stem trawlers and few are double riggers. Hence the deck layout is not suitable for either longlining or purse seining. Both longlining and purse seining for oceanic tuna and billfishes are specialized techniques which require special onboard facilities, deck layout and deck machineries like line haulers, chute, shooting and hauling accessories for longlining and <b>special</b> powerful purse <b>winch,</b> power block etc. for tuna piu'se seining...|$|R
50|$|The diving {{team will}} {{include at least}} one working diver {{and at least one}} standby diver, a diving {{supervisor}} and a tender for each diver. Other personnel may be needed to operate <b>special</b> equipment like <b>winches</b> and a bell launch and recovery system, and to operate cranes and other equipment related to the work to be done. If the divers are deployed using a diving bell, the standby diver stays in the bell and is called the bellman. The bellman acts as tender for the working diver's umbilical, but must tend his own umbilical during a rescue. The working diver and bellman may swap functions during a shift to give the diver a break. A standard practice is for the standby diver's umbilical to be about 2m longer than the working diver's umbilical, to ensure that the standby diver can reach the diver in an emergency.|$|R
5000|$|After {{watching}} a skier perform a ski jump off a downhill slope, the presenters learned {{they had been}} tasked {{to see if they}} could get a 1986 Mini to do the same jump and landing it further than the skier did. After thinking over whether this could be done with the car's own power, May revealed it would not have any chance of success; there was also concerns it would be unsafe for anyone drive the Mini while attempting the ski jump. Thus, Clarkson called in for help from the United Kingdom Rocketry Association. The following day, May, tasked with handling the unmanned Mini's guidance, revealed that the car would need skis for the special groves that would be cut for it on the ski jump they were using. The Rocketry Association, who were working on the Power for the jump (with Clarkson's help), decided to also work on making some custom-made skis for the Mini upon learning of this. Meanwhile, Hammond began work on setting up a barrier to stop the Mini after it made its jump, but after making a clumsy one before the wrong jump, recruited a herd of tractors to set up a wall of hay bales at the bottom of the jump, backed with a large snow bank to ensure the car stopped fully and safely. As night fell, the Mini, now laden with rockets, was carefully put into place on the <b>special</b> groves and <b>winched</b> to the top of the jump, given final checks, and eventually was launched down the jump. Although it failed to beat the skier's distance, the presenters were more than satisfied that the Mini had managed to successfully do the ski jump, which was extraordinary feat in itself.|$|R
