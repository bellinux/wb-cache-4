40|$|In road construction, several {{processes}} and products {{are now available}} to produce environmentally friendlier warm mix asphalts, {{including the use of}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> additives. These additives facilitate the production of energy efficient asphalt mixtures at reduced manufacturing and construction temperatures. However, their sustainability during the road life cycle can only be obtained by optimizing the mixture's performance. Thus, the objective of this work was to assess the properties of different blends of base bitumens (softer to harder ones) containing a range of synthetic wax contents, as well as the performance of the corresponding warm mix asphalts, that could ultimately lead to more sustainable mixtures. It was concluded that different blends should be selected to maximize the temperature reduction, the fatigue or the rut resistance, without compromising the other properties of the mixture.

40|$|Latent {{heat energy}} storage systems using <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> could have lower heat {{transfer}} rates during melting/freezing processes {{due to its}} inherent low thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> can be enhanced by employing high conductivity materials such as alumina (Al 2 O 3). A numerical analysis {{has been carried out}} to study the performance enhancement of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> with nanoalumina (Al 2 O 3) particles in comparison with simple <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> in a concentric double pipe heat exchanger.

40|$|Microencapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> with {{polyaniline}} shells is synthesised as {{thermal energy}} storage material by in situ polymerisation. <b>Paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is the core material and polyaniline is the shell in this preparation. These materials are environment-friendly. The chemical structure, surface morphologies, thermal properties and thermal stability of the encapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> are determined by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetry analysis, respectively. The field-emission scanning electron microscopic {{results indicate that the}} <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is encapsulated well and that the capsules are spherical in shape. The differential scanning calorimetric analysis shows that the encapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> has a large energy storage and releases capacity (22 - 121 J g(- 1)) depending on the different ratios of the <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> and polyaniline. The thermogravimetric analysis results indicate that polyaniline can improve the thermal stability of encapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> because of the synergistic effect between the two (<b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> and polyaniline). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the microencapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> that acts as a microencapsulated phase change material has a good potential for {{thermal energy storage}} purposes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{absorption}} coefficient spectra and refractive index spectra of food grade, industrial grade and pharmaceutical grade <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax,</b> the three {{different types of}} <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> within the terahertz frequency range from 0. 2 to 2. 2 THz are measured using transmission-type terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The average refractive indexes of food grade, industrial grade and pharmaceutical grade <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> in the frequency range are respectively 1. 50, 1. 49 and 1. 46. The three different types of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> all have weak absorption for terahertz waves and each <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> have several obvious absorption peaks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple and rapid method of modifying poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) {{surfaces}} with <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax.</b> PDMS that contains a layer of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> at its surface resists the absorption of hydrophobic molecules; we used fluorescence microscopy to confirm that paraffin-modified PDMS resists the absorption of rhodamine B. Furthermore, we demonstrated that microfluidic devices made from PDMS that contains a surface layer of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> prevent efficiently the transport of gas molecules through the bulk and into microchannels. We characterized the surface of PDMS that contains <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> using the water contact angle, optical transmission, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We show that PDMS that contains <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> can be substituted for native PDMS; specifically, we fabricated peristaltic valves in PDMS that contains <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax,</b> and the valves showed no degradation in performance after multiple open/close cycles. Finally, we show how to use PDMS that has been treated with <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> as a mold for the fabrication of PDMS replicas; this approach avoids silanization of PDMS, which is a time-consuming step in soft lithography. The wax-modified PDMS channels also show performance superiro to that of bare PDMS in micellar electrokinetic chromatography for quantitative analysis...|$|R

40|$|Petroleum wax is a substance, {{which has}} many {{applications}} and economical value today. The production of petroleum wax {{in the world}} about 3. 6 x 109 ton per year, valued at nearly $ 2 billion. The basic raw material for <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is petroleum crude oil and lubricating oil. Although the availability of Sudan petroleum crude oil which contain large amount of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> and availability of refineries for crude oil, there are no units in these refineries for production of wax. Sudan now imports <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> to cover its needs (145. 3058 ton). In this research, <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is extracted from Nile Blend oil under {{the best and most}} economical operating conditions (the used sample contains 26 % <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax).</b> The laboratorial experiments of extraction are done in three steps: In the first step the asphaltene is removed, in the second step the solvents in which the <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> dissolves is added and in the last step the solution is chilled to precipitate the <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax.</b> For dissolution of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> in Nile Blend oil, the following solvents are used: -Methyl ethyl ketone, -Methyl ethyl ketone(75 %) + Toluene(25 %) -Methyl ethyl ketone(50 %) + Toluene(50 %) -Methyl ethyl ketone(70 %) + Toluene (20 %) and Naphtha(10 %) The laboratorial experiments of extraction wax is done {{for a wide range of}} temperature (28 – 70 °C), mixing time of solvent and sample (5 – 30 minutes) and solvent to sample ratio (16 : 1 – 32 : 1). The results revealed that the best conditions to extract 100 % of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> from Nile Blend crude oil are: Temperature 60 °C Mixing time of solvent and sample is 25 minutes Solvent to sample ratio is 20 : 1.

50|$|Microcrystalline waxes are {{a type of}} wax {{produced}} by de-oiling petrolatum, {{as part of the}} petroleum refining process. In contrast to the more familiar <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> which contains mostly unbranched alkanes, microcrystalline wax contains a higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons. It is characterized by the fineness of its crystals in contrast to the larger crystal of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax.</b> It consists of high molecular weight saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is generally darker, more viscous, denser, tackier and more elastic than <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes,</b> and has a higher molecular weight and melting point. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical microcrystalline wax crystal structure is small and thin, making them more flexible than <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax.</b> It is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|R

50|$|Although many natural <b>waxes</b> contain esters, <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> are hydrocarbons, {{mixtures}} of alkanes {{usually in a}} homologous series of chain lengths. These materials represent a significant fraction of petroleum.
