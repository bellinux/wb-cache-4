5000|$|Oscar Frederick Mossberg (1866-1937) {{was born}} on 1 September 1866 in Sweden, {{near the village of}} Svanskog in VÃ¤rmland, and emigrated to the United States in 1886. Mossberg went to work at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. While at Iver Johnson, Mossberg {{supervised}} the manufacture of revolvers and shotguns, while contributing some of his own patented designs, including a top strap latching mechanism for the Iver Johnson <b>Safety</b> <b>Revolver.</b> [...] When Mossberg left Iver Johnson, he went on to manage the small factory of the C.S. Shattuck Arms Co. in nearby Hatfield, Massachusetts, which manufactured single and double-barrel breechloading shotguns. From there he went to work for J. Stevens Arms & Tool Co., where he designed a small 4-shot novelty pistol which he patented in his name. [...] Working out of an old barn behind his house, Mossberg and his sons made about 500 of these 4-shot pistols between 1907 and 1909. [...] In 1914, Mossberg left Stevens, moving to New Haven, Connecticut in order to work for Marlin-Rockwell. In 1919, when Marlin-Rockwell went out of business (they primarily made machineguns, and World War I had just ended), the unemployed 53-year-old O.F. Mossberg and his two sons Iver and Harold started a new firearms company of their own, O.F. Mossberg & Sons. [...] Renting a small loft on State Street in New Haven, the Mossbergs began work on a simple four-shot [...]22-caliber pocket pistol, the Brownie. [...] Marketed largely to hunters and trappers for the humane dispatch of wounded or trapped animals, approximately 37,000 Brownie pistols were produced from 1920 to 1932.|$|E
5000|$|The company's name changed {{again to}} Iver Johnson's Arms & Cycle Works in 1891, {{when the company}} {{relocated}} to Fitchburg, Massachusetts, (sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "Fitzburg") {{in order to have}} better and larger manufacturing facilities. The company attracted a number of talented immigrant machinists and designers to its ranks, including O.F. Mossberg and Andrew Fyrberg, who would go on to invent the company's top-latching strap mechanism and the Hammer-the-Hammer transfer bar safety system used on the company's popular line of top-break <b>safety</b> <b>revolvers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Presidential assassin Leon Czolgosz {{shot and}} fatally wounded U.S. President William McKinley in Buffalo, New York on September 6, 1901 with an Iver Johnson [...]32 caliber <b>Safety</b> Automatic <b>{{revolver}}</b> (serial number 463344). (McKinley succumbed to these wounds nearly eight days later, at 2:15 {{am on the}} 14th of September). The revolver is currently {{on display at the}} Buffalo History Museum in Buffalo.|$|R
5000|$|... {{a manual}} safety catch {{that allows the}} pre-cocked hammer to be set on manual <b>safety,</b> {{enabling}} the <b>revolver</b> to be carried cocked. (The mechanism also prevents accidental discharge with the cylinder open or not fully closed, with the revolver dropped or struck.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Early flintlocks had {{required}} a half-cock position to prime the pan, {{in preparation for}} firing the firearm, after loading the main chamber. Some other early types of revolvers, such as the Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, required the user to place the hammer at half-cock to permit rotation of the cylinder to load the firearm. On such firearms, the standard practice was not to load all 6 chambers and leave the hammer at half-cock, but, rather, to load only 5 of 6 chambers by standard safety practice, and stow the dropped hammer on an unloaded chamber. [...] Nonetheless, some users did use the half-cock notch as a very early <b>safety</b> on such <b>revolvers</b> when all 6 chambers were loaded, often to a dangerous and unintended consequence.|$|R
50|$|These safeties, {{similar to}} grip safeties, are de-activated {{as a natural}} {{consequence}} of the shooter firing the firearm, but are engaged in most other circumstances. The trigger is composed of two interdependent parts, and the shooter in firing the firearm manipulates both parts of the trigger. Conversely, unintentional pressure or a strike against the trigger is unlikely to do so, and such an action will not fire the firearm. Such a design, made popular by Glock pistols but originally used in the 1897 Iver Johnson Second Model <b>Safety</b> Hammerless <b>revolver,</b> incorporates a trigger with a spring-loaded lever in its lower half. This lever which protrudes from the trigger face must be fully depressed in order to disengage a lock that allows the main trigger body to move. Unintentional pressure against {{the top of the}} trigger without pressing the lever does not disengage the lock and the trigger will not move. Other designs include a spring-loaded pad that forms the upper portion of the trigger face and manipulates a similar lock. This design has more moving parts, but is advantageous in that accidental pressure on the lock release has reduced leverage thus requiring more force to pull the main trigger, where force against the lower portion does not release the lock and will not move the trigger.|$|R
50|$|A {{consistent}} lockup {{is important}} to keep all these parts in line, and revolvers are prone to abuse that can damage these parts, adversely affecting the accuracy and even <b>safety</b> of the <b>revolver.</b> This lockup consists of two parts, the crane to frame lockup, and the cylinder bolt to cylinder lockup. Many swing-out cylinder revolvers only support the cylinder securely at the rear, and flipping the cylinder open and closed can bend the crane and prevent the cylinder from lining up parallel to the bore. The cylinder bolt, which engages the bottom of the cylinder through a slot in the frame, should provide a relatively tight lockup, and not drag the cylinder during rotation or pop loose when the hammer is cocked at a reasonable speed. Fanning a revolver can batter the cylinder bolt and prevent a solid lockup.|$|R
5000|$|A {{drawback}} of a DA/SA {{weapon is}} that the trigger pull of the first shot is different than the subsequent single-action shots, which can affect accuracy on the crucial first few shots in an emergency situation. Although there is little need for a safety on a DA/SA handgun when carrying it loaded and the hammer down, after the first shots are fired, the hammer will be cocked and the chamber loaded. Thus, most DA/SA guns either feature a conventional safety that prevents the hammer from dropping, or a [...] "decocker" [...] lever that safely drops the hammer without fear of the gun firing. The latter is the more popular, because without a decocker, the user is forced to lower the hammer onto a loaded chamber after loading the weapon, with attendant <b>safety</b> risks involved. <b>Revolvers</b> almost never feature safeties, since they are traditionally carried un-cocked, and the hammer requires the user to physically cock it, unlike a DA/SA gun, which cocks itself every time the slide is cycled.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{so short}} a distance, and with so good a rest, I could not miss, {{and before the}} smoke cleared away I winged another, and the rest ran back hastily. I sent a shot or two among them as they were consulting, {{with the result that}} they rode off three or four hundred yards farther back. They did not attempt to return my fire, for, except when I raised my head for a moment, they could see nothing of me. They doubtless learned from the women that I had a Colt's rifle and a brace of revolvers, and that if they were to make a rush across the open not many of them were likely to reach me. After a talk two or three of them mounted their horses and rode so as to strike the river both above and below me, {{intending}} no doubt to cross if they found a place where there was a chance of doing so. I felt pretty sure that they would do nothing till it was dark, then they would crawl up and make a rush; I was certain, anyhow, that they would not give it up, as there were two of their number lying on the veldt besides the two at the farmhouse. There was, however, more pluck in them than I had given them credit for, for about mid-day they began to advance, crawling along the ground as if stalking a quarry. The men who had gone out on horseback had all returned, but just as the others started crawling up three of them galloped away down stream. I determined at once to shift my position a bit, so as to put off the evil hour. I pulled a stone as big as my head out of the clay of the bank {{and put it on the}} edge where my head had been, and then got down into the water. It was waist-deep at a couple of feet from the bank, which above was too steep to walk along. I had gone a hundred yards when I saw, seven or eight inches above the water-level, a hole, and pushing my arm in I found it was a place where a good bit of the bank had caved in. Laying my gun and pistols down on a ledge I felt about farther. At the top it went in nearly three feet, and was higher at the back than it was at the water's edge. At any rate it afforded a good chance of <b>safety.</b> Holding the <b>revolvers,</b> the chamber of the rifle, and my ammunition above water, I stooped until I could get into the hole, which was but just wide enough for the purpose; then I pushed myself back to the end. I found there was just height enough for me to sit with my mouth above water. The back sloped so that I had to dig my heels into the clay to prevent myself from slipping forward.|$|R
