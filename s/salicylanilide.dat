Several halogenated <b>salicylanilides</b> with potent antiparasitic activity have been synthesised of which only closantel, niclosamide, oxyclozanide, rafoxanide and resorantel are commercially available. Closantel and rafoxanide, which represent the most important drugs in the group, are used extensively for the control of Haemonchus spp. and Fasciola spp. infestations in sheep and cattle and Oestrus ovis in sheep {{in many parts of the}} world. Niclosamide is used extensively for its anticestodal activity in a wide range of animals. Antiparasitic activity of the halogenated <b>salicylanilides</b> has also been demonstrated against a large number of other internal parasites, in particular haematophagous helminths, and external parasites including ticks and mites, in a variety of animal species. Several cases of toxicity and mortality have been reported for closantel and rafoxanide in sheep and goats.

Various isolates of F. hepatica with varying susceptibilities to salicylanilides were isolated and maintained in the laboratory. Individual flukes of these isolates were surveyed for their level of GST activity and a correlation between the level of GST activity and drug efficacy was found. In contrast to most other studies, a decrease in GST activity was associated with an increase in drug resistance. Evidence was collected to show that this may be a selective process since flukes which had survived exposure to rafoxanide and closantel in vivo (in sheep) had lower activity levels of GST than flukes from untreated sheep. Treatment with other flukicides (oxyclozanide, luxabendazole and triclabendazole) did not have this effect. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with closantel induced selection of particular isoenzymes in different isolates of F. hepatica having different degrees of susceptibility to closantel. However, no single isoenzyme or isoenzyme profile was associated with resistance and, in total, up to 8 different isoenzymes could be present in a single isolate. Thus, GST has some potential as a marker enzyme for <b>salicylanilide</b> resistance in F. hepatica.

40|$|Despite {{the large}} arsenal of {{antibiotics}} {{available on the}} market, treatment of bacterial infections becomes more challenging {{in view of the}} fact that microbes develop resistance against existing drugs. There is an obvious need for novel drugs acting on both old and new targets in bacteria. In this thesis we have employed a whole cell bacterial assay for screening and identification of type III secretion system (T 3 SS) inhibitors in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. The T 3 SS is a common virulence mechanism utilized by several clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria including Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Chlamydiae and Escherichia coli. Several components in the T 3 SS have proved to be conserved and hence data generated with Y. pseudotuberculosis as model might also be valid for other bacterial species. We have screened a 9, 400 commercial compound library for T 3 S inhibitors in Y. pseudotuberculosis using a yopE reporter gene assay. The initial ~ 30 hits were followed up in a growth inhibition assay resulting in 26 interesting compounds that were examined in more detail. Three of the most interesting compounds, <b>salicylanilides,</b> 2 -hydroxybenzylidene-hydrazides and 2 -arylsulfonamino-benzanilides, were selected for continued investigations. The inhibitor classes show different profiles regarding the effects on T 3 SS in Yersinia and their use as research tools and identification of the target proteins using a chemical biology approach will increase our understanding of bacterial virulence. The 2 -hydroxybenzylidene-hydrazides have been extensively studied in vitro and show potential as selective T 3 S inhibitors in several Gram-negative pathogens besides Y. pseudotuberculosis. The data obtained suggest that this inhibitor class targets a conserved protein in the secretion apparatus. In cell-based ex vivo infection models T 3 SS was inhibited to the advantage of the infected eukaryotic cells.

40|$|Photoallergic dermatoses are skin lesions {{following}} sun exposure, {{characterized by}} activation of immunological mechanisms, involving photosensitizers and photoallergens {{that can cause}} photosensibilization in some individuals. In this group of disorders, photoallergic contact dermatitis should be accentuated. It manifests as contact allergic dermatitis on sun-exposed skin areas, following direct contact with photoallergens during UV exposure (predominantly UVA). Under influence of light, photosensitizers get activated, followed by fusion with cutaneous proteins which renders them to complete antigens, and consequential initiation of immunological mechanisms with resulting pathological skin lesions. The most common photoallergens are: sulfonamide antibiotics, phenothiazines, and halogenated <b>salicylanilides.</b> Photoallergic dermatoses are comprised of several disorders, although the causative photoallergen remains unknown (e. g. solar urticaria, polymorphous light eruption and hydroa vacciniforme). Solar urticaria is a rare, acute urticarial reaction on both sun-exposed and covered skin areas, which appears soon after exposure to sun or artificial lighting. Polymorphous light eruption is a relatively common polymorphous skin eruption, which usually appears in spring. Its pathogenesis is unknown, presumably photoallergic reaction. Hydroa vacciniforme is a rare photodermatosis of unknown etiology, which usually presents in summer-time. It is characterized by vesicobullous eruptions, with residual nonesthetic varioliform scarring...|$|R
