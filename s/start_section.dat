Their behaviour with respect to Hecke sum of R-matrices is studied. Given a Hecke R-matrix in n-dimensional vector space, we construct a Hecke R-matrix in 2 n-dimensional vector space commuting with a differential. The notion of a quantum differential supergroup is derived. Its algebra of functions is a differential coquasitriangular Hopf algebra, having the usual algebra of differential forms as a quotient.

40|$|Understanding of {{particle}} emission processes from the Mercury surface {{is one of}} the major objectives of ELENAinstrument in the SERENA experiment on board of the BepiColombo mission. In particular the Ion-Sputteringprocess resulting from charged and energetic particles impacting on the surface can be investigated detectingthe low energetic neutral particles escaping from the planet. The possibility to identify the Ion-Sputtering signaltogether with back-scattered particles and neutrals generated by charge exchange is strictly linked with the newtechnology capability to measure low energetic neutral atoms. This goal can be addressed thanks to a new&oldapproach for the neutral atoms measurement: a well known Time of Flight system enhanced with a new kind ofStart section able to define the start time of the entrance in the ToF path without interacting with the particles anddirectly follow to the Stop detector.

The capability to detect non-thermal low energy neutral species is crucial for the ELENA (Emitted Low-Energy Neutral Atoms) sensor, {{which is part of the}} SERENA package (Search for Exospheric Refilling and Emitted Natural Abundances) on board the MPO spacecraft of the BepiColombo mission of ESA to Mercury, which is scheduled for launch in August 2015. ELENA is a Time of Flight (TOF) sensor, based on a novel concept using an ultra-sonic oscillating shutter (<b>Start</b> <b>section)</b> and MCP detector (Stop detector). The ELENA scientific objective is to monitor the emission of neutral atoms from the surface of Mercury by detecting energetic neutral atoms in the range 10 eV – 5 keV, within 76 ° FOV, perpendicular to the S/C orbital plane. The surface is scanned thanks to the spacecraft motion. In particular, processes of particle release from the surface will be investigated by identifying particles released via solar wind-induced ion sputtering (with energies > 1 eV – < 100 eV) as well as energetic Hydrogen atoms, which are back-scattered solar wind protons, at energies of hundreds eV. MCP absolute detection efficiency for very low energy neutral atoms (E < 30 eV) is a crucial point for this investigation.

However, {{the effect of}} some of these variables on pacing and exercise performance remains somewhat unclear. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to provide an overview as to how manipulation of different extrinsic factors affects pacing strategy and exercise performance. Only self-paced exercise studies that provided control and intervention group(s), reported trial variance for power output, disclosed the type of feedback received or withheld, and where time-trial power output data could be segmented into start, middle and end sections; were included in the meta-analysis. Studies with similar themes were grouped together to determine the mean difference (MD) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) between control and intervention trials for: hypoxia, hyperoxia, heat-stress, pre-cooling and various forms of feedback. A total of 26 studies with cycling as the exercise modality were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, four studies manipulated oxygen availability, eleven manipulated heat-stress, four implemented pre-cooling interventions and seven studies manipulated various forms of feedback. Mean power output (MPO) was significantly reduced in the middle and end sections (p 0. 05). Negative feedback improved overall trial MPO and MPO in the middle section of trials (p 0. 05). The available data suggests exercise regulation in hypoxia and heat-stress is delayed in the <b>start</b> <b>section</b> of trials, before significant reductions in MPO occur in the middle and end of the trial. Additionally, negative feedback involving performance deception may afford an upward shift in MPO in the middle section of the trial improving overall performance.

Also, {{we set up}} the Adams spectral sequence for chain complexes in D+(f,g) (R) in chapter four and study its convergence. To accomplish this task, we give two background chapters. We give some good account of chain complexes in chapter one. We review some basic homological algebra and give definition and basic properties of chain complexes. Then we study the homotopy category of chain complexes and we end chapter one with section about spectral sequences. Chapter two is about the derived category of a commutative ring. Section one is about localization of categories and left and right fractions. Then in section two, we give definition of triangulated categories {{and some of its}} basic properties and we end section two with definitions of homotopy limits and colimits. In section three, we show that the derived category is a triangulated category. In section four, we give definitions of the derived functors, the derived tensor product and the derived Hom. In chapter three, we <b>start</b> <b>section</b> one by giving some facts about local rings and we end this section by showing that every bounded below chain complex of finite type has a minimal free resolution. In section two, we show a derived analog of the Whitehead Theorem. In section three, we construct Postnikov towers for chain complexes. In section four, we define the Steenrod algebra. In section five, six and seven, we define irreducible, atomic, minimal atomic, no mod m detectable homology, H*-monogenic, nuclear chain complexes and the core of a chain complex. We show some various results relating these notions to each other and give some examples. In chapter four, we set up the Adams spectral sequence in section one and study its properties. In section two, we study homology localization and local homology. In section three, we define K[0]-nilpotent completion and we show that the Adams spectral sequence for a chain complex Y converges strongly to the homology of the K[0]-nilpotent completion of Y. In section four, we study the Adams spectral sequence’s convergence where we show that the K[0]-nilpotent completion for a bounded chain complex Y consisting of finitely generated free R­-modules in each degree is isomorphic to the localization of Y with respect to the H*(—, K) -theory.

40|$|Rush-hour {{lanes and}} pluslanes have been {{operational}} in the Netherlands since 1996. They are {{intended as a}} measure to increase capacity without the need to add an extra lane to the cross section. Individually, rush-hour lanes and pluslanes have been evaluated. However, not much research, however, compares rush-hour lane or pluslane designs with each other. In this research, long-term data {{will be used to}} get detailed information about the performance of different rush-hour lane and pluslane designs. Also, a driving simulator study is performed to gain insight in the underlying behavioral factors and to analyze the performance of changes in rush-hour lane designs. The main question for the research is: What is the performance of rush-hour lanes and pluslanes, what are the behavioral factors and design factors causing differences in performance and what changes can be made to the design of rush-hour lanes to improve the performance? In the ex-post evaluation of performance, data is used for a period of 120 days of 5 highway sections with a rush-hour lane and 5 highway sections with a pluslane. The sections are compared using lane flow distributions that show the occupation of the lanes and intensity-speed relations that show the differences in free-flow speeds driven on the sections. In the first analysis, rush-hour lanes are compared with regular right lanes and pluslanes are compared with regular left lanes. The rush-hour lane section at the A 50 between junction Ewijk and junction Valburg is designed in the driving simulator to analyze the behavioral factors that underlie the results from this first comparison. Also, a comparison is made between the occupation of different locations at rush-hour lanes and pluslanes. For this purpose, the <b>start</b> <b>section</b> and the end section are compared with a turbulence-free section. As a final analysis, the design factors that are researched for their influence on performance are: the lane width, the speed limit and the total number of lanes. A lot of variation in these design factors {{can be found on the}} rush-hour lane and pluslane sections that have been implemented today. However, some designs have not been implemented yet. The driving simulator provided the perfect opportunity to test new designs of rush-hour lanes. The simulator is used to test the influence of reducing the signaling by 50 % and the influence of changing the markings from continuous to broken on the occupation of rush-hour lanes. Regarding the design factors, it can be concluded from this research that a high speed limit of 120 km/h has a negative effect on the occupation of rush-hour lanes and also on the speeds driven at rush-hour lane sections. The car-following behavior of vehicles on a rush-hour lane section with such speed limit is researched in the driving simulator study. It shows that the incentive of using the rush-hour lane at this speed limit is low. Changing the markings from continuous to broken in the driving simulator does not affect the occupation of the rush-hour lane at 120 km/h. Also, reducing the signaling by half does not affect the occupation. Further research needs to show if these design factors have an influence on the occupation of rush-hour lanes at lower speed limits. The models that are implemented in the simulator at the Delft University of Technology are not realistic enough for this kind of research, as the behavior of virtual traffic influences the results too much. Smaller lane widths appear to have a negative effect on the occupation of rush-hour lanes and on the speeds driven at rush-hour lane sections. This could, however, not be concluded from this research alone. At pluslane sections with a combination between a high speed limit (100 km/h) and a small lane width (< 2, 80 m) the occupation of the pluslane becomes significantly less. Adding an extra lane to the section (making it 3 + 1) lowers the intensity shares at low intensity levels for that section for both rush-hour lanes and pluslanes. At higher intensity levels, no significant differences were found. Quantifying the influence of the design factors on the performance of rush-hour lanes and pluslanes is an interesting subject for further research. The performance of managed lanes to be implemented in the future can then be predicted by a model before realization. The differences between start sections and end sections also need to be analyzed in more detail for this purpose. The combination between an ex-post evaluation and a driving simulator study as is used in this research can also be well-suited for that new research.
