5000|$|Methadone is {{available}} in traditional pill, <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet,</b> and two different formulations designed for the patient to drink. Drinkable forms include ready-to-dispense liquid (sold in the United States as Methadose), and [...] "Diskets" [...] which are tablets designed to disperse themselves rapidly in water for oral administration, used {{in a similar fashion}} to Alka-Seltzer. The liquid form is the most common as it allows for smaller dose changes. Methadone is almost as effective when administered orally as by injection. In fact, injection of methadone does not result in a [...] "rush" [...] as with some other strong opioids such as morphine or hydromorphone, because its extraordinarily high volume of distribution causes it to diffuse into other tissues in the body, particularly fatty tissue; the peak concentration in the blood is achieved at roughly the same time, whether the drug is injected or ingested. Oral medication is usually preferable because it offers safety, simplicity and represents a step away from injection-based drug abuse in those recovering from addiction. U.S. federal regulations require the oral form in addiction treatment programs. Injecting Methadone pills can cause collapsed veins, bruising, swelling, and possibly other harmful effects. Methadone pills often contain talc that, when injected, produces a swarm of tiny solid particles in the blood, causing numerous minor blood clots. These particles cannot be filtered out before injection, and will accumulate in the body over time, especially in the lungs and eyes, producing various complications such as pulmonary hypertension, an irreversible and progressive disease. The formulation sold under the brand name Methadose (flavored liquid suspension for oral dosing, commonly used for maintenance purposes) should not be injected either. While it has been done in extremely diluted concentrations, instances of cardiac arrest have been reported, as well as damaged veins from sugars (even sugar-free syrups may cause this damage due to the presence of similarly-damaging artificial sweeteners). Oral medication also offers safety, simplicity and represents a step away from injection-based drug abuse in those recovering from addiction. U.S. federal regulations require the oral form in addiction treatment programs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeSublingual {{buprenorphine}} and combination buprenorphine/naloxone (BNX) {{are effective}} {{options for the}} treatment of opioid dependence. A BNX <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the induction and maintenance treatment of opioid-dependence in adults was developed as a higher-bioavailability formulation, allowing for a 30 % lesser dose of buprenorphine with bioequivalent systemic exposure compared with another BNX <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> formulation. No data were previously available comparing the higher-bioavailability BNX <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> to generic buprenorphine or BNX sublingual film; we therefore evaluated treatment retention during induction and stabilization with the higher-bioavailability BNX <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> versus generic buprenorphine or BNX sublingual film. MethodsThis multicenter, prospective, randomized, parallel-group noninferiority trial was conducted at 43 centers in the United States. Eligible patients were adults aged 18 to 65 years who met the criteria for opioid dependence and had at least mild withdrawal symptoms. On days 1 and 2, patients received blinded, fixed-dose induction with the higher-bioavailability BNX <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> or generic buprenorphine. On days 3 to 14, patients induced with BNX received open-label, titrated doses of the BNX tablet for stabilization; patients induced with buprenorphine received sublingual BNX film. Co-primary end points were treatment retention on days 3 and 15; noninferiority was concluded if the lower limit of the 95 % CI of the between-group difference in treatment retention was ≥− 10 %. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study period. FindingsA total of 758 opioid-dependent patients were included in the study (BNX <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet,</b> 383 patients; generic buprenorphine, 375). Day- 3 retention rates were 93. 9 % (309 / 329) and 92. 6 % (302 / 326) with the BNX tablet and buprenorphine, respectively (between-group difference 95 % CI, − 2. 6 to 5. 1). Day- 15 retention rates were 83. 0 % (273 / 329) and 82. 5 % (269 / 326) with the BNX tablet and BNX film, respectively (between-group difference 95 % CI, – 5. 3 to 6. 3). No unexpected tolerability issues were identified; the safety profile of the BNX <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> was similar to those of generic buprenorphine and BNX film. ImplicationsBased on the findings from this study in patients with opioid dependence, the higher-bioavailability BNX <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> formulation was noninferior to both generic buprenorphine (induction) and BNX film (stabilization). These findings suggest that BNX sublingual tablets are an efficacious and well-tolerated option for induction and early stabilization treatment of opioid dependence.

This study was designed to review data on nasal symptoms with 300 IR 5 -grass pollen <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablets</b> in adults and children. Methods: We reviewed data from four double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials. Two groups of patients who received a daily dose of either placebo or 300 IR 5 -grass pollen <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablets</b> starting 4 months before the expected start of the pollen season and continuing through the season were compared (analysis of covariance) for scores of sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, nasal congestion, total nasal symptom score (TNSS), and adult Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) scores.

First, the drug displays inadequate aqueous solubility, which delays the onset of its action. Second, the drug undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in a low (40 %) bioavailability. Third, the gastrointestinal effects of SC include dyspepsia and a burning sensation. The aim {{of this research was}} to prepare SC as a <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> utilizing soy polysaccharide as novel superdisintegrant to mitigate the abovementioned problems. The solubility of SC in various hydrophilic carrier solutions was estimated in order to prepare the drug as a coprecipitate. Sublingual tablets were prepared and evaluated for hardness, friability, drug content, wetting time, water absorption ratio, in vitro dispersion time, dissolution rate, and stability study. The pharmacokinetic study of the tablets was carried out on healthy volunteers. The results indicated that the co-precipitation of SC with polyvinylpyrollidone K 30 enhanced the solubility of SC by more than eight folds. The tablet contained 8 % soy polysaccharide as a superdisintegrant and provided a wetting time of 25  seconds, and in vitro dispersion times of 55  seconds. The drug release was found to be 95. 6 %. The prepared SC <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> also exhibited a rapid onset of action, and its bioavailability was enhanced 1. 68 -fold compared with that of the marketed tablets. It can be concluded that SC <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> is a promising formulation that results in higher solubility, faster dispersion and onset of action, higher release rate, and higher systemic bioavailability.

We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of HDM <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablets</b> over 1 treatment year and the subsequent immunotherapy-free year. Adults with HDM-associated allergic rhinitis were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to receive 500 index of reactivity (IR) tablets, 300 IR tablets, or placebo administered once daily for 1 year and were followed for the subsequent year. The primary efficacy variable was the Average Adjusted Symptom Score over the year 1 primary period (ie, October 1 to December 31). Symptoms and rescue medication scores, onset of action, patient-reported outcomes, and safety were secondary variables. The same end points were evaluated during the immunotherapy-free year. The primary efficacy end point was analyzed by using analysis of covariance. Five hundred nine participants were randomized, and 427 continued in the immunotherapy-free year. Both the 500 IR and 300 IR HDM <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablets</b> significantly reduced mean Average Adjusted Symptom Scores compared with placebo by - 20. 2 % (P =. 0066) and - 17. 9 % (P =. 0150), respectively.

40|$|Nasal {{administration}} has {{potential for the}} treatment of indications requiring a fast onset of effect or for drugs with low oral bioavailability. Liquid nasal sprays are relatively common, but can be associated with suboptimal absorption from the nasal cavity; this thesis shows that nasal absorption can be significantly enhanced with a dry powder formulation. It was shown that interactive mixtures, consisting of fine drug particles adhered to the surface of mucoadhesive carrier particles, could be created in a particle size suitable for nasal administration. Sodium starch glycolate (SSG), a common tablet excipient, was used as carrier material. In vitro evaluation of the formulation indicated that the mucoadhesion of the carrier was unlikely to be affected by the addition of a drug. The powder formulation did not improve the in vitro transfer of dihydroergotamine across porcine nasal mucosa compared with a liquid formulation; however, the results were associated with methodological shortcomings. The binding of model substances to SSG and three other excipients was evaluated. Ion exchange interactions were for example detected between SSG and cationic drugs, but these interactions were most extensive at low salt concentrations and should unlikely affect in vivo bioavailability at physiological salt concentrations. Absorption of the peptide drug desmopressin from the SSG nasal formulation, from a novel <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet</b> formulation and from a commercial nasal liquid spray was evaluated in a clinical trial. While no improvement over the liquid spray was seen with the <b>sublingual</b> <b>tablet,</b> plasma concentrations after the nasal powder formulation were three times higher than those after the liquid spray.
