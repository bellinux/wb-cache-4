In the Fasti Ovid relates only the myths that associate Janus with Saturn, whom he welcomed as a guest and with whom he eventually shared his kingdom in reward for teaching the art of agriculture, and to the nymph Crane Grane or Carna, whom Janus raped and made the goddess of hinges as Cardea, while in the Metamorphoses he records his fathering with Venilia the nymph Canens, loved by Picus, first legendary king of the Aborigines.|$|E

25|$|When {{measurable}} quantities involve cross products, the handedness of the coordinate systems used cannot be arbitrary. However, when physics laws are written as equations, {{it should be}} possible to make an arbitrary choice of the coordinate system (including handedness). To avoid problems, one <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> to never write down an equation where the two sides do not behave equally under all transformations that need to be considered. For example, if one side of the equation is a cross product of two vectors, one must take into account that when the handedness of the coordinate system is not fixed a priori, the result is not a (true) vector but a pseudovector. Therefore, for consistency, the other side must also be a pseudovector.|$|E
25|$|Surfing, {{like all}} water sports, carries the {{inherent}} danger of drowning. Anyone {{at any age}} can learn to surf, but {{should have at least}} intermediate swimming skills. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. A leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, a leash can even be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. However, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.|$|E

Having begun with a scathing criticism of the corrupting effects of money and misguided servile attitudes towards the wealthy, Clement discusses the implications of [...] The rich are either unconvinced {{by the promise of}} eternal life, or unaware of the conflict between the possession of material and spiritual wealth, and the good Christian has a duty to guide them towards a better life through the Gospel.

The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, {{as long as it is}} used charitably, but men <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to let their wealth dominate their spirit. It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich man is to be saved, all he must do is to follow the two commandments, and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of our neighbor.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973 Jiang Qing, Mao's fourth {{wife and}} a former {{political}} ally of Lin's, started the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign, aimed at using Lin's scarred image to attack Zhou Enlai. Much of this propaganda campaign involved the creative falsification of history, including (false) details about how Lin had opposed Mao's leadership and tactics throughout his career. Lin's name became involved in Jiang's propaganda campaign after flashcards, made by Ye Qun to record Lin's thoughts, were discovered in Lin's residence following his death. Some of these flashcards recorded opinions critical of Mao. According to Lin's writings, Mao [...] "will fabricate 'your' opinion first, then he will change 'your' opinion – which is not actually yours, but his fabrication.

Lin's private criticisms of Mao were directly contradictory of the public image cultivated by Lin, who publicly stated following the Great Leap Forward that all mistakes of the past were the result of deviating from Mao's instructions.|$|E

[...] Stating that a corporation is no more than an artificial being, Porter expressed his idea that a corporation's intentions should be nothing more than what its charter defines. Porter then outlined several examples of how corporations in early Italy sought nothing but to grow in size, even at the expense of smaller businesses, and how these corporations eventually gained more power in national affairs than was appropriate. Porter believed in the rights of the individual citizen, as opposed to the rights of the larger corporations. Towards the end of his speech, Porter stated that the convention should mark his words that, [...] "If ever our republic fails, it will be by the destruction of the confidence of our citizens in the security of their individual rights." ...|$|E
