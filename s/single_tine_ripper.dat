40|$|Herbicide {{runoff from}} {{cropping}} fields {{has been identified}} {{as a threat to the}} Great Barrier Reef ecosystem. A field investigation was carried out to monitor the changes in runoff water quality resulting from four different sugarcane cropping systems that included different herbicides and contrasting tillage and trash management practices. These include (i) Conventional - Tillage (beds and inter-rows) with residual herbicides used; (ii) Improved - only the beds were tilled (zonal) with reduced residual herbicides used; (iii) Aspirational - minimum tillage (one pass of a <b>single</b> <b>tine</b> <b>ripper</b> before planting) with trash mulch, no residual herbicides and a legume intercrop after cane establishment; and (iv) New Farming System (NFS) - minimum tillage as in Aspirational practice with a grain legume rotation and a combination of residual and knockdown herbicides. Results suggest soil and trash management had a larger effect on the herbicide losses in runoff than the physico-chemical properties of herbicides. Improved practices with 30 % lower atrazine application rates than used in conventional systems produced reduced runoff volumes by 40 % and atrazine loss by 62 %. There were a 2 -fold variation in atrazine and > 10 -fold variation in metribuzin loads in runoff water between reduced tillage systems differing in soil disturbance and surface residue cover from the previous rotation crops, despite the same herbicide application rates. The elevated risk of offsite losses from herbicides was illustrated by the high concentrations of diuron (14 mugL- 1) recorded in runoff that occurred > 2. 5 months after herbicide application in a 1 st ratoon crop. A cropping system employing less persistent non-selective herbicides and an inter-row soybean mulch resulted in no residual herbicide contamination in runoff water, but recorded 12. 3 % lower yield compared to Conventional practice. These findings reveal a trade-off between achieving good water quality with minimal herbicide contamination and maintaining farm profitability with good weed control...|$|E

A tension force was measured during the needle retraction phase (first retraction: 0. 54 ± 0. 13 mN). The force was statistically significantly lower during the second insertion phase (Turkey-Kramer multiple comparison, alpha = 0. 05).

A tine mechanism for an autonomous weeding machine was developed, and the interaction of a <b>single</b> <b>tine</b> and a rotating tine mechanism with the soil was investigated. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a laboratory methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of a tine and rotating tine mechanism in disturbing weed plants simulated by individual wood pieces. Two experiments were performed using the tine and tine mechanism under a controlled environment. Soil in a large rotating bin was processed and sieved to a maximum size of 5 mm. The soil was then conditioned with water to produce the desired moisture content. A <b>single</b> <b>tine</b> was used in the first experiment. The experimental factors for this test were the tine diameter, tine depth and the speed that the tine moved through the soil.

All of these tests were conducted in a rotating soil bin with a controlled speed. The orientation of each simulated weed was observed in each trial. The observations were captured in a Mean Likelihood of Control (MLC) parameter which was intended to indicate the mean likelihood of simulated weed being controlled. In the first experiment, significant differences were observed in MLC across tine diameter, tine working depth and travel speed. There was evidence of a significant interaction between tine diameter and tine working depth.

The first model {{is based on the}} effect of the operational conditions speed and depth for each tine, the second model is employing a statistic dummy variable, also representing each tine. The geometry of tines is base for the third model. A stepwise selection with a multi-linear regression at significance level 5 % was used to evaluate these regression models. Experiments were carried out in a sandy loam soil at soil moisture content of 10. 3 % ± 0. 8 (based on dry matter) and soil bulk density of 1. 38 g/cm³ ± 0. 01 under controlled soil bin conditions featuring varying speeds between 1. 1 and 3. 6 m/s and varying depth from 5 to 20 cm. Field testing was done in order to validate the regression model obtained from the soil bin. The results show that the horizontal force increases linearly with the speed-depth interaction term and quadratically with the depth for each tine in all regression models. The depth is effecting the force more significantly in comparison to speed (p < 0. 05). Eventually it can be stated that there is a good general accordance of observed and predicted values of the horizontal force for all tines by using the dummy and the geometric regression models...|$|R

So modelling {{such a process}} requires to handle numerically the non-linearities induced by the material and by unilateral contact and friction between the rigid structure and the soil. Moreover, the different sizes of tines and blade make it a two-scale process, thus requiring large numbers of d. o. f’s in FE simulations.

Using a strip tillage system a narrow zone is cultivated leaving most of the straw residue on the soil surface.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate different injection methods for slurry on ley established on various soils. In full-scale experiments the placements of the slurry as well as ammonia emissions and yields were measured after injection in open slots with three techniques: pressurised injec-tion (PI), shallow injection with V-shaped discs (SIO 1), and shallow injection with two angled discs (SIO 2). The performance between the injectors varied and only the SIO 2 was able to place the slurry in ley below soil surface on all three soil types. The ammonia release was on average halved after injection with SIO 2 compared to band spreading, however there was an average loss of 19 kg N ha- 1. A tine for shallow injection in closed slots (tubulator) was therefore developed. In small scale with <b>single</b> <b>tines,</b> the tubulator was compared to SIO 2 with regards to slurry placement, ammonia emissions and draught requirements. Ammonia losses after injection with the tubulator tine were only 1. 6 % of the total applied ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) compared to 27 % with the SIO 2. The draught requirement for the tubulator was roughly the same, or a little higher than the SIO 2 tine.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Vibrating a tillage tool is an {{effective}} way of reducing the draft force required to pull it through the soil. The degree of draft force reduction {{is dependent on the}} combination of operating parameters and soil conditions. It is thus necessary to optimize the vibratory implement for different conditions. Numerical modelling is more flexible than experimental testing and analytical models, and less costly than experimental testing. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) was specifically developed for granular materials such as soils and can be used to model a vibrating tillage tool for its design and optimization. The goal was thus to evaluate the ability of DEM to model a vibratory subsoiler and to investigate the cause of the draft force reduction. The DEM model was evaluated against data obtained from field testing done with a full scale <b>single</b> <b>tine</b> vibratory subsoiler. Soil testing was also done for material characterization and for the calibration of DEM material properties. The subsoiler was simulated using a commercial code, PFC 3 D. The effect on the simulation results of particle diameter, different bonding models and damping models was investigated. The final simulations were evaluated against the experimental results in terms of the draft force and material behaviour. The cause of the draft force reduction due to vibration was also investigated with the aid of the DEM model. From the results it was concluded that DEM is able to model the vibratory subsoiler for its design and optimization. The DEM model also provided valuable insight into the cause of the draft force reduction such as the increased peak stresses due to vibration and the increase in particle kinetic energy...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{front-mounted}} implements {{has increased}} {{during the last}} couple of years. One drawback of the commercially available front linkages is, however, that they have been unable to move sideways. Jönsson (1983) formulated the conditions that must be fulfilled to build a front-mounted three-point hitch that allows lateral movements of the implement since it centres the implement. This is done in two different ways, depending on the implement. Directional implements are centred if the lower links of the hitch converges in the direction of travel. This was first shown by Makanjuola & Cowell (1970). The return velocity of the implement depends on the convergence of the lower links. Non-directional implements are more difficult to centre. While directional implements centre due to the linkage geometry, non-directional implements centre due to the internal forces in the linkage. Jönsson (1983) formulated a criterion of stability: (FT/FR) > (LC/LA) where FT= Force in upper link. FR= The implement's resulting force on the linkage. LC= Lateral distance between the linkage’s instantaneous centre and the centre of resistance. LA= Distance between the instantaneous centre and the upper link forces. If the stability criterion is true in every possible position that the three-point linkage can reach, a non-directional implement will centre after a. disturbance. In this work, a front-mounted self-centring three-point hitch of that kind was built and tested. The hitch was tested in combination with five different implements: 1. A one-furrow fully-mounted plough. During the work the plough proved to be self-centering and steerable. The plough was, however, very sensitive to the linkage adjustments. This was primarily due to the short upper link and mast height. On the other hand, the short top link functioned as a depth control. As the working depth of the plough changed, the change of the share pitch brought the tool back to its original depth. 2. Hoe. With this implement this front-coupling was superior to the conventional rear-mounted type. According to the driver's wish, the linkage was easily adjusted to slow or fast reaction. A slowly reacting implement compensates better for bad driving in rowcrops than a fast reacting one. On the other hand, the turning radius increases. It is also better from the ergonomic point of view to have this kind of implement in front of the driver. 3. Harrow. During the tests the harrow usually, but not always, centred itself. In extreme conditions the harrow's clod-crusher nullified the centring ability. A harrow with a jointed cross-shaft ought to be self-centering. The joint will permit vertical movement of the implement. Thereby the clod-crusher cannot interfere with the upper link-forces. 4. <b>Single</b> <b>tine.</b> The front coupling was also tested with a <b>single</b> <b>tine.</b> This was done to test a pure non-directional implement. With the tine the centring was good and the front-mounted three-point hitch behaved as expected. 5. Single disc. In order to test a pure directional implement, a single disc was mounted to the hitch. During the tests the return velocity of the implement was measured at different cross-shaft lengths. A dependence between the length of the cross-shaft (the convergence) and the return velocity was indicated, in spite of severe disturbances during the tests. The tested type of front-linkage probably has a greater developing potential than the ones available on the market today. The self-centring front-linkage reduces the stress on the tractor, the linkage and the implement more than the conventional front-linkages. The driver ergonomy is improved by using front-mounted implements instead of rear mounted. A lot of work is however needed, before this type of linkage can be commercially available. The adjustment of the coupling needs to be simplified. Some kind of regulating device for working depth is also needed to fully use the advantages of front-mounting...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Implements for tilling {{compacted}} {{forest soils}} were tested on sites logged with ground-based machines in Oregon. The sites covered {{a variety of}} soil conditions ranging from a clay loam to a rock 7 2 C 2 iplemeflts tested included disk harrows (four aies), brusa blades (three sites), standard subsoiler tines (two sites), wing. - ed subsoiler tines (two sites), and rock <b>ripper</b> <b>tines</b> (five sites). Soil density and strength measurements made prior to the tillage operatIons indicated that the depth of compacted soil within primary skid trails exceeded 12 inches and was often detectable {{to a depth of}} 18 inches. Logging debris typically was incorporated into the skid trail surfaces. The disk harrow proved ineffective for loosening compacted forest soils at depth when: 1) the soil had a high rock content, 2) disk weighting was insufficient, or 3) the trail cross-section was concave and the harrow wide. The brush blade failed to loosen the deeper layers of compaction and resulted in transfer of some of the loosened soil to the trail edges. The short closely-spaced tines did not allow loosened soil and logging debris to pass between the tines. The performance of subsoiler and rock <b>ripper</b> <b>tines</b> was favorable in the rocky coarse-grained soils and some of the cohesive soils. However, plastic flow rather than shatterin. g occurred when tines operated below their crit- [...] ical depth. The critical depth was controlled by soil conditions and tue geometry. The winged subsoiler tines resulted in 30 to 64 percent greater shattering than did standard subsoiler tines at a ripping depth of 1. 5 feet. Close tine spacing caused logging debris to accumulate in front of the tines. The tines produced large angular clods when working in a cohesive soil. These clods did not break down after heavy rains. Clods from coarse-grain soils broke down readily when moistened. A trapezoid-shaped representatjoii of the soil sbattering pattern produced by tines was shown to compare adequately with actual shattering patterns. A computer program was developed to analyze ripping depth and tine spacing combinations resulting in maximum shattering across the skid trail width. The cost of the tillage operations ranged from 89 to 228 per mile of skid trail (1980 - 1981 dollars) ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} {{was intended to}} alleviate the problems and costs of deep tilling in sugarcane production in Mian-Ab sugarcane farms located in Khuzestan province, Iran. The main objective {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of subsoiling operations with bentleg subsoiler (BLS) equipped with shallow tines, a combination expected to increase the critical depth resulting in less power consumption and improved soil physical conditions. Six treatments arranged in a completely randomized block design were used to measure the draft force (except for the bulldozer mounted rippers), disturbed soil cross-sectional area and penetration resistance. The treatments included (1) subsoiling with rippers mounted on bulldozer, (2) BLS without attachment, (3), and (4) BLS equipped with <b>single</b> <b>tine</b> at working depths of ½ and ⅓ of target depth, (5) and (6) BLS equipped with two tines at ½ and ⅓ target depth. The experiment was replicated three times. The results indicated that BLS without attachment had the highest draft requirement as compared with other BLS treatments with shallow tines. In general, tine attachment resulted in less draft mainly due to displacement of critical depth to lower soil zones. Increasing the number and depth of shallow tines resulted in less draft force. The BLS equipped with two tines working at ½ target depth exhibited minimum drawbar power. The inclusion of shallow tines resulted in 21 % reduction in drawbar power requirement as compared to BLS without tine attachment. The cross-sectional area of the soil tilled by ripper was minimum. Furthermore, the tilled area was not uniform and subsequent subsoiling operations were needed. The average soil cross-sectional area per unit width was improved by BLS treatments by a factor of 2. 3 as compared with that of ripper. The highest cone index was obtained in plots tilled by ripper; the BLS reduced this index in a significant manner. The soil worked with subsoiler equipped with tines exhibited the least resistance. The range of wheel slippage for BLS treatments was 12 - 16 % which lies in {{the upper end of the}} recommended range for optimum traction efficiency.

Tillage was the main plot factor; conventional tillage versus the minimum tillage (MT) systems of <b>ripper</b> <b>tine</b> and planting basins. Maize mulch rate (0, 4 and 8 t ha- 1) was the sub-plot factor to which was super-imposed the intensity of hoe weeding treatment (low and high) as from the fifth season.

Whereas the maize mulch rate of 4 t ha- 1 increased weed density in both crops, the mulch rate of 8 t ha- 1 decreased the density of Portulaca oleracea and Corchorus tridens in sorghum. Weed density was lower and community diversity higher in the high than the low weeding intensity treatment in sorghum. Although, frequent hoe weeding can be used to control weeds in MT systems, labour shortages may ultimately limit the area under MT in smallholder agriculture.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, as more farm power is being demanded on farms, due to {{increased}} farm sizes and operating speeds, larger and heavier farm machines are deployed in various farming operations. Their cumulative negative effects have become more apparent with increased incidences of soil compaction problems. This has forced many farmers to practice deep tilling, using subsoilers to break up compacted subsoil layers. In some maize growing regions of South Africa, conventional subsoilers are used in a tandem configuration. The farmers believe {{that the use of}} subsoilers in this mode reduces the draft force per unit area tilled. This probably happens because the critical depth for the rear subsoiler is increased beyond its working depth of 600 mm. Operating in this mode necessitated this study, with the ultimate goal of testing an appropriate existing force model for a <b>single</b> <b>tine</b> in predicting the force requirements of the front subsoiler in a tandem configuration. Secondly, to develop an alternative model for the rear subsoiler based on the three-dimensional failed soil-profile and to determine the relative position of the front subsoiler at which energy utilization is optimized. To develop the proposed model, an analytical approach based on limit equilibrium analysis was used and a Matlab-based computer program was coded to solve it. Its verification was conducted through field experiments in sandy clay loam soil. The experiments consisted of a continuous measurement of the horizontal and vertical forces acting on each subsoiler by a two-dimensional force transducer system. At the same time, the three-dimensional and thus the cross-sectional areas of the disturbed soil-profiles at different sections were measured, as well as the soil characteristics. A manual method employing a pin-profile meter was used to measure the vertical cross-sectional areas of the failed soil-profiles at 100 mm intervals. Further more, a technique using an automatic penetrometer and a computer program was developed to identify and map the three-dimensional failed soil-profiles. This technique indicated that the subsoiler failed the soil beyond its maximum operating depth and width. The results also indicated that the soil-failure pattern at close spacing is in phase at both subsoilers, leading to reduced total draft force requirements. At a wider spacing, the soil-failure pattern was out of phase, thus resulting in increased total draft force requirements. At the same time, the cross-sectional area tilled per unit draft force increased with increased spacing. This was because the failed maximum cross-sectional area increased in size faster than the total draft force as the spacing was increased. The proposed model verification results show that the predicted and recorded forces at the rear subsoiler correlated reasonably well at a wider spacing. When the front subsoiler was shallow working and close to the rear subsoiler, the model under- predicted the measured forces on the rear subsoiler, whilst the Swick-Perumpral model over predicted the applied forces to the front subsoiler and this was generally the case at wider spacings. Furthermore the efficiency of the subsoilers was maximized when the longitudinal spacing was such that it allowed the soil failed by the front subsoiler to stabilize before the rear subsoiler reached it. The maximum cross-sectional area failed per unit draft force was recorded when the depth of the front subsoiler was equal to about 80 % of the rear subsoiler-operating depth. The knowledge contributed by this research will not only facilitate qualitative field operations and optimize energy use, but also promote better management decisions.

The experiment was run for two years at two sites: clay (Matopos Research Station fields) and sand (Lucydale fields) soils, in a 7 × 3 factorial combination of mulch rates (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 t ha− 1) and tillage methods (planting basins, <b>ripper</b> <b>tine</b> and conventional plough). Each treatment was replicated three times at each site in a split plot design. Maize residue was applied as mulch before tillage operations. Two maize varieties, a hybrid (SC 403) and an open pollinated variety (ZM 421), were planted. Maize yield and soil water content (0 – 30 and 30 – 60 cm depth) were measured under each treatment. On both soil types, neither mulching nor tillage method had a significant effect on maize grain yield. Tillage methods significantly influenced stover production with planting basins giving the highest stover yield (1. 1 t ha− 1) on sandy soil and conventional ploughing giving 3. 6 t ha− 1 on clay soil during the first season.

40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} (CA) {{is thought}} to reduce weed pressure from {{the third year of}} adoption, when recommended practices are followed. Weed growth and crop yield were assessed during the third and fourth year of maize–cowpea–sorghum rotation, second and third year of maize–cowpea rotation and first and second year of maize monocropping on a clay loam soil at Matopos Research Station (annual rainfall, 573  mm) following recommended CA management practices. Each experiment had a split-plot randomized complete block design with mouldboard plough (CONV), minimum tillage (MT) with <b>ripper</b> <b>tine</b> and planting basins as main-plot factor and maize residue mulch rate (0, 2 and 4 t/ha) as a subplot factor, with threefold replication. All subplots were surface mulched and weeded by hoe at the same time. We hypothesized that under MT weed growth would be considerable with maize monocropping but from year 3 of CA, weed growth would decrease and crop yield increase relative to values from unmulched CONV. Minimum tillage increased weed growth in 2 nd year of maize monocropping. Under the maize–cowpea rotation, the considerable weed growth in planting basins was likely due to the large intrarow spacing and poor light competiveness of the cowpea variety. Mulch contributed to weed growth being suppressed by up to 36 % under CA in the maize–cowpea–sorghum rotation relative to unmulched CONV. When planted on the same date, crop yield did not differ between CA and unmulched CONV. Maize–cowpea–sorghum rotation grain yield (3143  kg/ha) was double that under monocropping, probably due to improvements in soil physical and chemical conditions.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was initiated to obtain some understanding on the behaviour of soil at higher moisture content {{and to explore}} the potential of preparing paddy fields with reduced amounts of water. This investigation comprised of three separate studies. Based on existing information that water could be reduced when soil clods were initially formed prior to flooding, the effects of clod size, clod initial moisture content and confining states on the rate of water uptake were explored. The moisture gradients within clods wetted and dried for different period of times were also studied. The results of the clod wetting experiments show that· the rate of water uptake by capillarity was greatest when clods were initially very dry and smaller clods tended to absorb water faster than bigger clods when under confined conditions. Confining {{had no effect on}} infiltration when the initial condition was very wet. On drying, the smallest clod dried the fastest, reduced greater volume and increased its dry bulk density significantly. Larger clods required,longer drying period to arrive at a uniform moisture profile within as compared to smaller clods. Results from the wetting experiments were tested against the infiltration model of. Jarvis and Leeds-Harrison (1987) and a model developed based on linear flow of heat into a solid (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959). A second project involved the study of soil deformation at high moisture contents in an attempt to produce clods with minimum draught force using simple relieved tines at various rake angles and depths in a soil tank. The principal. objective of the - ii - study was to utilise soil implement mechanics knowledge to improve the efficiency of soil preparation for wetland crops. Aspects like the nature of soil disturbance, extent of disturbance and draught requirement were investigated. The soil was in a plastic consistency prepared to three specified density states of 940, 1000 and 1250 kg/m 3 • The soil disturbance pattern was monitored using implanted coloured beads and glass sided tank studies. In addition, the extent and height of heave and surface disturbance were noted. Predictive models based upon Mohr-Coulomb soil mechanics theory were developed to predict the interaction between the soil and simple implements at three rake angles. These were based on the lateral failure theory of Godwin and Spoor (1977) and the two dimensional soil failure model of Hettiaratchi and Reece (1974). Results from the <b>single</b> <b>tine</b> study were tested against the models. A sliding resistance component and crescent effect were incorporated to improve the predictions for the 45 ° and 90 ° rake angle tines. The magnitude of each mode of failure is dependent upon the critical aspect ratio which varies with tine rake angles and soil conditions. The mode of failure is considered to be lateral when the tine aspect ratio is larger than the critical aspect ratio and an upward failure when the tine aspect ratio is lower than the critical aspect ratio. The predicted results are in close agreement with the results of the experimental studies. For the backward raked tine, a model was developed based on the formation of an elliptical wedge and bearing capacity type of failure ahead and below the wedge. This failure theory was based on the bearing capacity failure for deep footings. The model - iii - helped identify an additional parameter that influenced the draught force for a backward raked tine. This parameter is the sliding resistance component on both sides and beneath the elliptical soil wedge •. Results from multitine studies showed that draught force increased with tine spacinq but the increase was not significant. In the wet condition the tines merely cut slots and little or no interaction was noted. In an effort to find the optimum water level for soil puddlinq, a laboratory study was conducted to determine the influence of water-soil ratio on the ease of puddling air dry aqqreqates. Soil puddlinq was carried out usinq a·rotary stirrer simulatinq the rotary motion of a rotary cultivator commonly used in wetland preparation •. The results obtained showed that· the fastest dispersion of particles resultinq in a minimum wet bulk density of 1. 23 Mg/m 3, was achieved at a water-soil ratio of 1. 2. (A supersaturated condition equivalent to a moisture content of 120 % dry basis). Increasing the water-soil ratio above this value did not change the wet bulk density value for all stirring times...|$|R
40|$|Constraints to {{effective}} weed management {{may be the}} main reason for the small area under minimum tillage (MT) in smallholder farming in southern Africa. The effect of maize residue mulching and intensity of hand hoe weeding on the growth of weeds, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata cv. IT 86 D- 719) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor cv. Macia) was investigated in the fifth and sixth years of a conservation agriculture (CA) field experiment at Matopos Research Station (28 ° 30. 92 ′E, 20 ° 23. 32 ′S). The experiment was a split-plot randomized complete block design with three replications. Tillage was the main plot factor (conventional tillage – mouldboard plough compared against MT systems – <b>ripper</b> <b>tine</b> and planting basins) and maize residue mulch rate (0, 4 and 8 t ha− 1) the sub-plot factor. Hoe weeding was done either four times (high weeding intensity) or twice (low weeding intensity) during the cropping season. Planting and weeding were done {{at the same time in}} all treatments. There was markedly greater early season weed growth in MT systems relative to mouldboard plough (MBP) in both crop species. In sorghum, MT (planting basins: 40. 3 kg ha− 1; ripper tine: 34. 8 kg ha− 1) systems had higher cumulative weed biomass measured after planting than MBP (29. 9 kg ha− 1) system. Maize mulching was generally associated with increased mid- to late-season weed growth in the two crops probably due to improved soil moisture conservation during periods of low precipitation. Weed suppression by the maize mulch was observed only in sorghum and limited to early in the cropping season with no effect observed for the remainder of the sorghum rotation phase. The high weeding intensity treatment had lower weed growth in both crops and better sorghum yield than low weeding intensity. The MT systems had poor crop establishment which translated into low yields. Cowpea grain yield obtained from MT systems was less than 300 kg ha− 1 compared to 413 kg ha− 1 in MBP. The poor sorghum establishment in MT systems translated into low grain yield as sorghum grain yield was lowest in planting basins (2602 kg ha− 1) and highest in MBP with 4159 kg ha− 1. Results suggest that CA systems require early and frequent hoe weeding even after four years to reduce weed infestations and improve crop growth. This higher demand on a smallholder household's limited labor supply throughout the cropping season will be a key determinant of the spread and adoption of CA in southern Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{reported}} {{requirement for}} a higher weeding effort due to increased weed infestations under conservation agriculture (CA) relative to conventional mouldboard plough tillage is perceived by both smallholder farmers and extension workers as the main limiting factor to the widespread adoption of CA by smallholder farmers in southern Africa. However, proponents of CA argue that weeds are only a problem under CA in the initial two years and decline afterwards resulting in reduced labour requirements for weeding under CA. They further posit that weeds are only major problem where minimum tillage (MT) is adopted without crop residue mulching and diverse crop rotations. This thesis explores the effect of time under CA on weed population dynamics and crop growth under the recommended CA practices and actual smallholder farmer practice in semi-arid Zimbabwe. Assessment of weed and crop growth on a long-term CA experiment at Matopos Research Station revealed that the MT systems of planting basins and <b>ripper</b> <b>tine</b> were associated with higher early season weed density and biomass than conventional early summer mouldboard tillage (CONV) in both the fifth (cowpea phase) and sixth (sorghum phase) years of CA. This increased weed infestation within the first four weeks after planting in CA necessitated early weeding to provide a clean seedbed and avert significant crop yield loss. Maize mulching only suppressed early season weed growth in sorghum mostly at a mulch rate of 8 t ha- 1 {{which is not a}} mulching rate that is attainable on most smallholder farms. However, the lower maize residue mulch rate of 4 t ha- 1 was consistently associated with increased weed emergence and growth as {{from the middle of the}} cropping season in both crop species. The increased weed infestations under the mulch were probably due to the creation of ‘safe sites’ with moist conditions and moderate temperatures. The high weed growth under the mulch contributed to the low sorghum grain yield obtained under mulched plots. In addition, maize mulching was also associated with a less diverse weed community that was dominated by the competitive Setaria spp. and difficult to hoe weed Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn. However, the weed community under CA was similar to that under CONV tillage with no evidence of a shift to the more difficult to control weed species. The increased early season weed growth and high weed pressure under CA meant that it was still necessary to hoe weed four times within the cropping season to reduce weed infestations and improve crop growth even after four years of recommended CA practices. Early and frequent weeding was effective in reducing weed growth of most species including Setaria spp. and E. indica demonstrating that on smallholder farms where labour is available hoe weeding can provide adequate weed control. The wider spacing recommended for use in CA contributed to the low cowpea and sorghum grain yields obtained under CA compared to CONV tillage. On smallholder farms in Masvingo District, the MT system of planting basin (PB) was the only conservation farming (CF) component adopted by farmers. There was no difference in the total seedling density of the soil weed seed bank and density of emerged weeds in the field in PB and conventional mouldboard ploughing done at first effective rains (CONV tillage). However, the first weeding in PB was done at least 15 days earlier (P < 0. 05) than in CONV tillage suggesting high early season weed growth in PB relative to CONV tillage. As weed density did not decline with time in PB, weed management did not differ with increase in years under PB. Shortage of inputs such as seed and fertiliser was identified by smallholder farmers as the most limiting factor in PB crop production with the area under PB was equivalent to the seed and fertiliser provided by CARE International for most farmers. On this small area, weeds could be managed by available family labour. Double the maize grain yield was obtained in PB (mean: 2856 kg ha- 1) due to improved weed management and soil fertility. However, the use of poorly stored composts was found to introduce weeds into some PB fields. The findings of this study demonstrated that weed pressure was still high and weed management were still a challenge under the practice recommended to smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe even in the sixth year of practice. There is, therefore, a need for research on the economic feasibility of using herbicides, intercropping and optimal crop density to ameliorate the high weed pressure under CA.
