40|$|A <b>single</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>study</b> on monarch {{butterflies}} {{has prompted}} widespread concern that corn pollen, engineered to express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) endotoxin, might travel beyond corn fields and cause mortality in nontarget lepidopterans. Among the lepidopterans at high potential risk from {{this technology is}} the black swallowtail butterfly, Papilio polyxenes, whose host plants in the midwestern U. S. are located principally in narrow strips between roads and crop fields. A field study was performed to assess whether mortality of early instar black swallowtails was associated either with proximity to a field of Bt corn or by levels of Bt pollen deposition on host plants. Potted host plants were infested with first instar black swallowtails and placed at intervals {{from the edge of}} a field of Bt corn (Pioneer 34 R 07 containing Monsanto event 810) at the beginning of anthesis. We confirmed by ELISA that pollen from these plants contained Cry 1 Ab endotoxin (2. 125 ± 0. 289 ng/g). Although many of the larvae died during the 7 days that the experiments were run, there was no relationship between mortality and proximity to the field or pollen deposition on host plants. Moreover, pollen from these same plants failed to cause mortality in the laboratory at the highest pollen dose tested (10, 000 grains/cm 2), a level that far exceeded the highest pollen density observed in the field (200 grains/cm 2). We conclude that Bt pollen of the variety tested is unlikely to affect wild populations of black swallowtails. Thus, our results suggest that at least some potential nontarget effects of the use of transgenic plants may be manageable...|$|E

40|$|There is much {{evidence}} that mate-choice {{decisions made by}} humans are affected by social/contextual information. Women seem to rate men portrayed in a relationship as more desirable than the same men when portrayed as <b>single.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> have found evidence suggesting that human mate choice, as in other species, {{is dependent on the}} mate choice decisions made by same-sex rivals. Even though non-independent mate choice is an established and well-studied area of mate choice, very few field studies have been performed. This project aims to test whether women’s evaluation of potential mates desirability is dependent/non-independent of same-sex rivals giving the potential mates sexual interest. This is the first field study performed in a modern human’s natural habitat aiming to test for non- independent mate choice in humans. No desirability enhancement effect was found. The possibilities that earlier studies have found an effect that is only present in laboratory environments or have measured effects other than non-independent mate choice are discussed. I find differences in experimental design to be the most likely reason why the present study failed to detect the effect found in previous studies. This field study, the first of its sort, has generated important knowledge for future experimenters, where the most important conclusion is that major limitations in humans ability to register and remember there surrounding should be taken in consideration when designing any field study investigating human mate choice. ...|$|R

The analysis of this cyclic peptide toxin was validated for pasta and rice samples using a newly presented synthetic cereulide peptide standard, together with 13 C 6 -cereulide that previously have not been commercially available. The use of cereulide standard was also compared to the most frequently used surrogate standard, the antibiotic valinomycin. The performance of the method was evaluated by analyzing spiked sample pools from different types of rice and pasta, as well as 21 individual rice and pasta samples from differently prepared meals. Inoculation of samples with three cereulide toxin-producing strains of Bacillus cereus was finally used to mimic naturally contaminated foods. The quantification range of the method was 1 – 500 ng/g (R 2 = 0. 999) and the limits of detection and quantification were 0. 1 and 1 ng/g, respectively.

40|$|Apoptosis {{induced by}} {{cisplatin}} nephrotoxic injury. An agent {{often used in}} cancer treatment, cisplatin may cause acute renal failure after even a <b>single</b> dose. Recent <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> confirmed the induction of renal cell apoptosis by cisplatin. Reduction in cell viability as well as {{increase in the number}} of cells with fragmented nuclei correlated with cisplatin exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a characteristic laddering pattern which was preceded by an increase in caspase- 3 activity. As the cisplatin concentration increased beyond 50 μm, the elevation of caspase- 3 activity declined, which suggests that necrosis, instead of apoptosis, is more likely to be responsible for cell death secondary to higher cisplatin concentrations. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of cisplatin nephrotoxicity may lead to the development of a novel therapeutic strategy that targets cancer cell death while simultaneously minimizing renal injury...|$|R
40|$|A large {{fraction}} of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop specific autoantibodies, which until recently were only of two types, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). We aimed to replicate important findings about a recently described third type of specific autoantibodies, anti-carbamylated protein (anti-CarP) antibodies, {{because they have been}} described based only in the homemade ELISA from a <b>single</b> <b>laboratory.</b> Our <b>study</b> included 520 patients with established RA and 278 healthy controls of Spanish ancestry and it was done with an independently performed ELISA. The prevalence and pattern of environmental, clinical and genetic associations of the anti-CarP antibodies were similar to the previously described. Notably, the presence and titers of anti-CarP correlated with the presence and titers of ACPA, but the anti-CarP antibodies did not share the known genetic and exposure risk factors of the ACPA. In addition, anti-CarP antibodies were independently associated with a higher (10. 5 %) prevalence of bone erosions. The reproducibility of these characteristics across laboratories and European subpopulations, indicates the wide validity of the results and suggests that determination of anti-CarP antibodies could contribute to explain RA pathogenesis and identify clinically relevant patient subgroups.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe a simple device for detecting the time of an impact and to demonstrate its efficiency in measuring the depth of surface-opening cracks in concrete. Surface-opening cracks in concrete are relatively deep so that a mechanical impact instead of an ultrasonic transmitter is used to generate stress waves with enough energy for successful evaluation. A technique called the time-of-flight diffraction technique with impact-generated stress waves is an efficient method for detection of surface-opening cracks in concrete. Because the initial time of the impact is unavailable in a mechanical impact device, two receivers are employed in the test. One of the receivers is used to determine the time of the impact indirectly. The present study developed a simple device to record the time of impact initiation. The device comprises a conductive impact device, a sensing film, and an auxiliary circuit. With the device, stress waves are generated and the time of impact is detected so that the evaluation work needs only a <b>single</b> receiver. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> were carried out on concrete specimens containing cracks with depths of 0. 158 and 0. 90 m. Field studies were performed on a dam damaged by an earthquake. Experimental results show that the new device can be used to accurately determine the crack depth in concrete. Using the device, the cost and effort for evaluation and signal analysis are reduced, which largely enhances the evaluation efficiency. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{measurements}} of skin absorption are {{an increasingly important}} aspect of regulatory studies, product support claims, and formulation screening. However, such measurements are significantly affected by skin variability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine inter- and intralaboratory variation in diffusion cell measurements caused by factors other than skin. This was attained through the use of an artificial (silicone rubber) rate-limiting membrane and the provision of materials including a standard penetrant, methyl paraben (MP), and a minimally prescriptive protocol to each of the 18 participating laboratories. "Standardized" calculations of MP flux were determined from the data submitted by each laboratory by applying a predefined mathematical model. This was deemed necessary to eliminate any interlaboratory variation caused by different methods of flux calculations. Average fluxes of MP calculated and reported by each laboratory (60 +/- 27 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1), n = 25, range 27 - 101) were in agreement with the standardized calculations of MP flux (60 +/- 21 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1), range 19 - 120). The coefficient of variation between laboratories was approximately 35 % and was manifest as a fourfold difference between the lowest and highest average flux values and a sixfold difference between the lowest and highest individual flux values. Intra-laboratory variation was lower, averaging 10 % for five individuals using the same equipment within a <b>single</b> <b>laboratory.</b> Further <b>studies</b> should be performed to clarify the exact components responsible for nonskin-related variability in diffusion cell measurements. It is clear that further developments of in vitro methodologies for measuring skin absorption are required. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|The {{workshop}} report provided evidences {{from numerous}} <b>single</b> factorial <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> and modelling exercises that crop pests and diseases {{were affected by}} the vagaries of climate change viz., temperature, rainfall and wind patterns. There was also adequate support for the notion on the innate ability of crop pests and diseases to adapt to changing environmental conditions. It was revealed that organisms respond in different ways to various ecosystem templates thus lending credence to the fundamental need for one to be cognitive of organisms’ ecology {{and that of the}} nexus with ecosystem services. In contrast, it was recognized that there were conflicting messages on impacts of climate change on crop pests and diseases that were sent out to policy makers and farmers. Several key aspects were identified and the following needs for refinement were recognised: (i) Research designs that span across spatial and temporal landscapes; (ii) Effective modalities of communicating impacts to influence policies and changes and (iii) Re-designing policies and national agricultural frameworks to enhance resilience to climate changes (e. g. ecological engineering). The workshop highlighted several issues pertinent to climate impact on pests and diseases. The issues focused on the following questions: (i) The specific needs (viz. ecological and implementation) in the development of climate change adaptation strategies for P&D management, (ii) New policies or infrastructure that need to be designed to enhance sustainable agriculture, (iii) Policy change activities that could be initiated, and (iv) the key imperatives {{that need to be addressed}} to improve farmer livelihoods, learning and motivation. Overall, the workshop provided a valuable opportunity to take stock of the current state of affairs pertaining to the impact of climate change on crop pests and diseases and the adaptation strategies needed to plan and prepare the best set of collective actions in the face of climate change. The output list of recommendations and next steps will enable us to forge ahead with the directions and plans to diagnose and identify optimum efforts that will benefit the rural poor who are chronically vulnerable to the threats of climate change...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of laughter is little understood {{even though it}} is an area of human behaviour that long intrigued psychologists and philosophers. A framework for understanding is required. With guidance from existing literature, observational data is used to develop such a framework. It is argued that no one single approach can, in principle, explain the phenomenon. Laughter occurs in too varied situations for it to be possible to claim that it is due to one <b>single</b> cause. Moreover, <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> usually require subjects to laugh at 'funny stimuli on cue. As a result, they have focussed on responsive laughter rather than on the conditions under which subjects try to make others laugh. Given this background, observational data is useful. In this study observational data from a longitudinal study of two children and from a study of children in a playgroup are used to argue that very young children not only laugh responsively but also create occasions for their own laughter. Moreover, while their ability to laugh develops in many ways linked to their cognitive and social development, they can still laugh at the kinds of situations that made them laugh when they were very young. It is concluded that observations have helpfully added to ways in which the {{development of}} laughter has been conceptualised. It is also suggested that some observations of laughter in young children have implications for research on how young children are capable of intentional behaviour. <p...|$|R

40|$|The tiered {{approach}} to assessing ecological risk of insect-resistant transgenic crops assumes that lower tier <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies,</b> which expose surrogate non-target organisms to {{high doses of}} insecticidal proteins, can detect harmful effects that might be manifested in the field. To test this assumption, we performed meta-analyses comparing results for non-target invertebrates exposed to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry proteins in <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> with results derived from independent field studies examining effects on the abundance of non-target invertebrates. For Lepidopteran-active Cry proteins, <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> correctly predicted the reduced field abundance of non-target Lepidoptera.

Exposure to Coleopteran-active Cry proteins did not significantly reduce the laboratory survival or field abundance of any functional group examined.

30|$|The {{distribution}} of HCV genotypes may vary {{due to the}} age of the population. In some studies, it was determined that Subtypes 1 a and 1 b were more common among older patients (51 – 60  years old), whereas subtype 3 b was the most common subtype among younger individuals (10 - 20  years old). Similar results were found by several recent studies, which indicate an increase in the frequency of HCV genotype 3 among younger population of Iran, Germany, Serbia and Montenegro and Slovenia (Jahanbakhsh Sefidi et al. 2013; Ross et al. 2000; Seme et al. 2009; Svirtlih et al. 2007). In the United States and western European countries, HCV non-genotype 1 is increasingly prevalent in younger patients and this is attributed to risk exposure differences (Cornberg et al. 2011). The results of our study showed that {{distribution of}} HCV genotypes varies with age. For instance, genotype 1 was more common in male between ages 10 and 29, while it was more prevalent in female between ages 30 and 79. The subtype 1 b distribution between male and female is similar to genotype 1. Genotype 2 and subtype 2 a were more common in female than male patients before 59 and over 80  years old, while more prevalent in male between ages 60 and 69, and has the equal proportions among 70 – 79  years old. To our knowledge, it is the first that evaluates the distribution of genotypes of HCV in WuHan, but it has some limitations, such as subtype with a relatively small sample size and a selection bias is possible given the use of the data from a <b>single</b> <b>laboratory,</b> but our <b>study</b> may be helpful for understanding the genotype distribution of HCV in WuHan and can provide important information about HCV prevalence among different ages and sexes.|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacterial hepatotoxins, microcystins, are {{specific}} inhibitors of serine/threonine protein phosphatases and potent tumor promoters. They have caused several poisonings {{of animals and}} also pose a health hazard for humans {{through the use of}} water for drinking and recreation. Different strains of the same cyanobacterial species may variously be nontoxic, be neurotoxic, or produce several microcystin variants. It is poorly understood how the amount of toxins varies in a <b>single</b> strain. This <b>laboratory</b> <b>study</b> shows the importance of external growth stimuli in regulating the levels and relative proportions of different microcystin variants in two strains of filamentous, nitrogen-fixing Anabaena spp. The concentration of the toxins in the cells increased with phosphorus. High temperatures (25 to 30 degrees C), together with the highest levels of light studied (test range, 2 to 100 mumol m- 2 s- 1), decreased their amount. Different structural variants of microcystins responded differently to growth stimuli. Variants of microcystin (MCYST) -LR correlated with temperatures below 25 degrees C, and those of MCYST-RR correlated with higher temperatures. Nitrogen added into the growth medium and increasing temperatures increased the proportion of microcystin variants demethylated in amino acid 3. All variants remained mostly intracellular. Time was the most important factor causing the release of the toxins into the growth medium. Time, nitrogen added into the growth medium, and light fluxes above 25 mumol m- 2 s- 1 significantly increased the concentrations of the dissolved toxins. According to the results, it thus seems that the reduction of phosphorus loads in bodies of water might play a role in preventing the health hazards that toxic cyanobacterial water blooms pose, not only by decreasing the cyanobacteria but also by decreasing their toxin content...|$|R
