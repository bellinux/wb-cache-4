40|$|Potential factors {{influencing}} antigen detection in immunoassays for measuring rat or mouse aeroallergen (i. e., assay setup, antigen specificities, <b>standard</b> <b>extracts</b> used, and antigen decay) were investigated in a three-country study (the UK, The Netherlands, Sweden). An inhibition enzyme immunoassay (EIA) setup gave nominal rat urinary allergen (RUA) sample values seven {{times higher than}} a sandwich EIA setup utilizing identical antibodies and standards. In immunoblotting experiments, pooled patient serum and polyclonal rabbit antibodies partly detected different rat antigens; monoclonal antibody specificity could not be determined. Immunoblot detection of mouse urinary antigens (MUA) by the polyclonal rabbit antibodies from all laboratories was similar. In both the RUA and the MUA assays, urinary antigen standards were detected with similar potency, except purified Rat n 1, which was an inefficient inhibitor in the RUA RAST inhibition. In the sandwich EIA RUA assays, a rat room-dust extract was detected with 700800 -fold less sensitivity than rat urine, whereas in the RAST RUA assay, dust inhibited equally with rat urine. Simulated decay did not decrease the potency of urinary antigen in any assay. Thus, assay setup and choice of detection antibodies strongly influence the nominal allergen levels. We recommend the use of standardized and characterized antibodies and <b>standard</b> <b>extracts</b> in sandwich EIAs to measure airborne rodent urinary allergens...|$|E

40|$|Impaired {{neutrophil}} function {{has been}} associated with increased infectious diseases in ruminants. Attachment of neutrophils to endothelium and superoxide production is critical features of their immune activity. Once the infection is cleared, programmed cell death ensures the rapid resolution of inflammation. To develop new natural therapeutics for ruminants, <b>standard</b> <b>extracts</b> of Echinacea angustifolia (Polinacea™), Butea frondosa and Curcuma longa (Curcuvet™) were first evaluated on ovine neutrophil functions. Curcuvet™ strongly reduced PMA-stimulated adhesion and superoxide production. Polinacea™ and B. frondosa extract also reduced these functions, but with less efficacy than Curcuvet™. We analyzed the effect of extracts on spontaneous apoptosis and gene expression in neutrophils aged in vitro for up to 22 h. IL 8 is critical for neutrophil recruitment and the immune response; Bcl 2 -related proteins, Bcl 2 A 1 and Bax, are key regulators of neutrophil fate. Spontaneous apoptosis strongly increased in ovine neutrophils cultured for 22 h (T 22), accompanied by an upregulation of IL 8 and a decreased Bcl 2 A 1 :Bax ratio. Curcuvet™ stimulated spontaneous apoptosis and inhibited IL 8 and Bcl 2 A 1 gene expression at T 22, whereas Polinacea™ and B. frondosa extract inhibited spontaneous apoptosis and stimulated IL 8 expression at T 22. These results suggest that Curcuvet™ has antiinflammatory activity, whereas Polinacea™ and B. frondosa have an immunomodulatory action on sheep neutrophils...|$|E

IgE sensitization to domestic mites {{has been identified}} worldwide as {{a major cause of}} respiratory allergic diseases. In Cuba, the most relevant species are: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp), D. siboney and Blomia tropicalis. The aim of this work was to determine the diagnostic efficacy of SPT, using an standardized allergen extract of Dp, of national production (VALERGEN-DP, BIOCEN) and two other well known foreign commercial products (A: ALK, Netherlands and B: Stallergenes, France). An analytical study involving 50 patients with allergic antecedents to domestic dust and positive serum IgE and 50 with identical antecedents, but negative serum IgE was conducted. Replicate punctures were performed in both arms of patients using a concentration of 20 000 BU/mL. SPT with VALERGEN-DP produced a wheal mean of 43. 5 mm 2, superior value statistically significant with respect to A product (p = 0. 002). Diagnostic coincidence among the three products was 98 - 99 %. SPT with VALERGEN-DP showed 98 % of specificity and 82 % of sensibility and significant differences were not detected (p> 0. 05) between products for these parameters.

40|$|Abstract—By {{the advent}} of IPTV and smart TV, the {{broadcasting}} is transmitted using Internet. Bi-directional programs are appeared on broadcasting services. The convergence service combining with communication, information and web service are appeared too. N-Screen service is a killer service of smart TV. It uses several terminals, either fixed or mobile, to provide bi-directional, convergence and personal services with broadcasting service. N-Screen service can be classified into three categories: first, OSMU (One Source Multi Use) case, providing same contents to terminals having different capabilities such as screen size, CPU speed, memory, codec, network speed, etc. Second case is a vertical handover, continuous watching of content using different terminal. Third case is a collaborative service among multiple terminals. For example, a customer is watching soap opera using TV, while watching a specific scene related information or advertisement using his PAD or smart phone. In ITU-T SG 13, the Y. sof (Service Scenario over FMC) was standardized. It defined detailed overall service scenarios using feature extraction of seamless mobile convergence service on several networks such as WiFi, 3 G, WiMAX/WiBro. This <b>standard</b> <b>extracts</b> key features of five key elements: person, terminal, network, content, and service. Then, it analyzes relationships among key elements and suggests overall service scenario model. The service scenario model can be easily adopted on describing N-Screen service scenario because Y. sof handles scenario cases among several fixed or mobile terminals. In this paper, I will introduce Y. sof and classification of N-Screen service scenarios described using the standard. Also I will refer the standardization issues of N-Screen and its technologies...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of sensitization to insect aeroallergens in allergic rhinitis patients in Yazd as a desert city in Iran. A cross-sectional study was undertaken on 95 allergic rhinitis patients who were referred to allergy clinic of Yazd city. Skin prick tests (SPT) by <b>standard</b> <b>extracts</b> of three insect aeroallergens including Mosquito, Corn moth, Cockroach and two species of mites as common aeroallergens in allergic rhinitis (Dermatophagoid Farina, Dermatophagoid Peteronysinus) were done. SPT results showed that the most common insect aeroallergens were: mosquito (32. 6 %) followed by corn moth (26. 3 %) and cockroach (13. 7 %). The prevalence of SPT positive response to Dermatophagoid Peteronysinus, Dermatophagoid Farina were 8. 4 % and 7. 4 %, respectively. These results demonstrated that sensitization to insect aeroallergens was significantly more common compared to mites in patients with allergic rhinitis in Yazd city, a city surrounded by deserts. High prevalence of skin reactivity to mosquito and corn moth as insect aeroallergens in Yazd city with hot and dry climate in contrast to humid regions such as north of Iran, where mites are more frequent, indicates differences in the prevalence of aeroallergen reactivity in various areas with different climates. Our study could highlight the importance of insect aeroallergens for clinicians for better diagnosis and management of patients with allergic rhinitis...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Environmental {{control of}} allergens and {{irritants}} {{is the essential}} part of allergy controland management. Molds are among important aeroallergens which can proliferate enormously in bothindoor and outdoor environments, especially in poor ventilated humid milieus. The prevalence of moldsensitization and some related factors in allergic rhinitis patients were investigated in the current study. Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, 300 patients with the signs and symptoms ofallergic rhinitis who referred to Semnan (Iran) allergy clinic during 2006 - 7 were selected and underwentskin prick test with <b>standard</b> <b>extracts</b> of allergens. "Wheal and Flare” reaction {{of each of the}} allergenswere compared with negative control and wheals of 3 mm larger than wheal of negative control and flaresof 10 mm larger than flare of the negative control were considered as positive and the patient wereregarded as sensitized to that allergen. Results: 26. 7 %(95 % Confidence Interval: 21 / 7 - 31 / 7 %) of patients demonstrated to have beensensitized to one or more allergenic molds. Aspergillus (12. 3 %) and Penicillium (8. 3 %) were shown to bethe most and the least commons allergenic molds, respectively. Cladosporium (11 %) and Alternaria(10. 7 %) were among the important allergenic molds. There was no relationship between the prevalence ofmold allergy with urban and rural environments, and also patients’ gender. A significant association wasonly observed between age and Alternaria sensitization (P= 0. 036), but not found with other molds(P> 0. 05). Conclusion: Mold sensitization is a relatively common finding among patients with allergic rhinitis. Elimination or reduction of mold exposure in allergic patients is of special consideration and measures toreduce environmental factors which facilitate mold growth and proliferation is very important...|$|E
