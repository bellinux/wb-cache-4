50|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that cells that undergo EMT gain stem cell-like properties, thus giving rise to Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). Upon transfection by activated Ras, a subpopulation of cells exhibiting the putative stem cell markers CD44high/CD24low increases with the concomitant induction of EMT. Also, ZEB1 is capable of conferring stem cell-like properties, thus strengthening the relationship between EMT and <b>stemness.</b> This property conferred by EMT is thus doubly dangerous duo for the patient, as it not only enables the carcinoma cells to enter the bloodstream, but also endows them with properties of <b>stemness</b> by virtue of which these cells have increased tumorigenic and proliferative potential.|$|E
50|$|Adult {{stem cells}} remain in an {{undifferentiated}} state throughout adult life. However, {{when they are}} cultured in vitro, they often undergo an 'aging' process in which their morphology is changed and their proliferative capacity is decreased.

The observed methylation pattern of CpG within intronic regions with enhancer-related chromatin marks in multiple myeloma is similar to undifferentiated precursor and stem cells. These results may represent a de novo epigenetic reprogramming in multiple myeloma, leading to the acquisition of a methylation pattern related to <b>stemness.</b>|$|E
50|$|The role of KLF4 in Epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) is also controversial.

Under conditions of TGFβ-induced EMT KLF4 {{was shown to}} suppress EMT in the same systems where it was shown to promote EMT, such as prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer.

50|$|Briefly, eCSCs {{have been}} first {{identified}} through {{the expression of}} c-kit, the receptor of the stem cell factor {{and the absence of}} common hematopoietic markers, like CD45. Afterwards, different membrane markers (Sca-1, Abcg-2, Flk-1) and transcription factors (Isl-1, Nkx2.5, GATA4) have been employed to identify and characterize these cells in the embryonic and adult life. eCSCs are clonogenic, self-renewing and multipotent in vitro and in vivo, capable of generating the 3 major cell types of the myocardium: myocytes, smooth muscle and endothelial vascular cells. They express several markers of <b>stemness</b> (i.e. Oct3/4, Bmi-1, Nanog) and have significant regenerative potential in vivo. When cloned in suspension they form cardiospheres, which when cultured in a myogenic differentiation medium, attach and differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes.|$|E
50|$|Analysis {{of cancer}} {{transcriptome}} databases (www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) showed that TEAD1 is dysregulated in {{several types of}} cancers. First in Kaposi sarcoma there is a 300-fold increase in TEAD1 levels. Moreover, the increase of TEAD expression can be detected in basal-like breast cancers, fallopian tube carcinoma, and germ cell tumors. Otherwise, in other types of cancer TEAD expression is decreased, for example in other breast cancer types and in renal or bladder cancers. This dual role {{can be explained by}} the different targets and the differential regulation of target genes by TEAD transcription factors. Finally recent studies showed that TEAD1 and YAP in ovarian cancer can induces cell <b>stemness</b> and chemoresistance. and that genetic variant of TEAD protein and YAP are enriched in some cancers.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{our knowledge of}} the FGFR1 system has resulted in attempts to discover therapeutic touch points in the pathway for use in drug development. FGFR-targeted drugs exert direct as well as indirect anticancer effects, because FGFRs on cancer cells and endothelial cells are involved in tumorigenesis and vasculogenesis, respectively. FGFR therapeutics are active as FGF affects numerous morphologies of cancers such as invasiveness, <b>stemness</b> and cellular survival. Primary among such drugs are antagonists. Small molecules that fit between the ATP binding pockets of the tyrosine kinase domains of the receptors. For FGFR1 numerous such small molecules are already approved for targeting of the structure of TKI ATP pocket. These include dovitinib and brivanib.

50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective of}} IHEC {{is to determine}} how the Epigenome has shaped human populations over generations and in response to the environment. The first phase of IHEC’s operations involves coordinating the production of at least 1,000 reference epigenomes from healthy and diseased human cells, as well as a limited number of model organisms relevant to specific human diseases. The initial focus is on cellular states including <b>stemness,</b> immortality, proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and stress.The reference epigenome for each sample comprises high resolution maps of DNA methylation and key regulatory histone modifications, with corresponding information about the type and expression level of all transcribed genes (protein coding as well as non-coding / small RNAs).The data produced are made freely available to the research community via the IHEC Data Portal, European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), and other venues.|$|E
5000|$|The neurosphere assay {{examines}} three fundamental {{characteristics of}} neural stem cells: proliferation, self-renewal, and multipotency. [...] Self-renewal and multipotency are {{the requirements for}} cells to be considered stem cells. The neurosphere assay, or <b>stemness</b> assay, {{has been used to}} confirm that neurospheres contain neural stem cells. Neurospheres are dissociated and distributed into single-cell wells to examine self-renewal through clonal analysis. A small percentage of cells reform into a secondary neurosphere. The secondary neurospheres are then transferred into a culture medium containing growth factors that promote cell differentiation. The presence of varying cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, confirms the multipotency of these precursor cells. The evidence of self-renewal and multipotency serves to confirm the presence of neural stem cells within neurospheres, and emphasizes that neural stem cells comprise {{only a fraction of the}} neurosphere.|$|E
50|$|Organoids are an {{excellent}} tool to study basic biological processes. Organoids enable to study how cells interact together in an organ, their interaction with their environment, how diseases affect them {{and the effect of}} drugs. In vitro culture makes this system easy to manipulate and facilitates their monitoring. While organs are difficult to culture because their size limits the penetration of nutrients, the small size of organoids limits this problem. On the other hand, they don't exhibit all organ features and interactions with other organs are not recapitulated in vitro. While research on stem cells and regulation of <b>stemness</b> was the first field of application of intestinal organoids, they are now also used to study e.g. uptake of nutrients, drug transport and secretion of incretin hormones. This is of great relevance in the context of malabsorption diseases as well as metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes.|$|E
50|$|In {{adult stem}} cells, p53 {{regulation}} {{is important for}} maintenance of <b>stemness</b> in adult stem cell niches. Mechanical signals such as hypoxia affect levels of p53 in these niche cells through the hypoxia inducible factors, HIF-1α and HIF-2α. While HIF-1α stabilizes p53, HIF-2α suppresses it. Suppression of p53 plays important roles in cancer stem cell phenotype, {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} and other stem cell roles and behaviors, such as blastema formation. Cells with decreased levels of p53 have been shown to reprogram into stem cells with a much greater efficiency that normal cells. Papers suggest that the lack of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis gives more cells the chance to be reprogrammed. Decreased levels of p53 were also shown to be a crucial aspect of blastema formation in the legs of salamanders. p53 regulation is very important in acting as a barrier between stem cells and a differentiated stem cell state, as well as a barrier between stem cells being functional and being cancerous.|$|E
50|$|The hair {{follicle}} stem cell niche {{is one of}} the more closely studied niches thanks to its relative accessibility and role in important diseases such as melanoma. The bulge area at the junction of arrector pili muscle to the {{hair follicle}} sheath has been shown to host the skin stem cells which can contribute to all epithelial skin layers. There cells are maintained by signaling in concert with niche cells - signals include paracrine (e.g. sonic hedgehog), autocrine and juxtacrine signals. The bulge region of the hair follicle relies on these signals to maintain the <b>stemness</b> of the cells. Fate mapping or cell lineage tracing has shown that Keratin 15 positive stem cells' progeny participate in all epithelial lineages. The follicle undergoes cyclic regeneration in which these stem cells migrate to various regions and differentiate into the appropriate epithelial cell type. Some important singals in the hair follicle stem cell niche produced by the mesenchymal dermal papilla or the bulge include BMP, TGF-β and Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands and Wnt inhibitors. While, Wnt signaling pathways and β-catenin are important for stem cell maintenance, over-expression of β-catenin in hair follicles induces improper hair growth. Therefore these signals such as Wnt inhibitors produced by surrounding cells are important to maintain and facilitate the stem cell niche.|$|E
50|$|Hypoxia {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the regulation of cancer stem cell niches and EMT through the promotion of HIFs. These HIFs help maintain cancer stem cell niches by regulating important <b>stemness</b> genes such as Oct4, Nanog, SOX2, Klf4, and cMyc. HIFs also regulate important tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and genes that promote metastasis. Interestingly, while HIFs increase the survival of cells by decreases the effects of oxidative stress, they have also been shown to decrease factors such as RAD51 and H2AX that maintain genomic stability. In the hypoxic condition there is an increase of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) which also promote CSCs survival via stress response. ROS stabilizes HIF-1α which promotes the Met proto-oncogene, which drives metastasis or motogenic escape in melanoma cells. All of these factors contribute to a cancer stem cell phenotype which is why it is often referred to as a hypoxic stem cell niche. Hypoxic environments are often found in tumors where the cells are dividing faster that angiogenesis can occur. It is important to study hypoxia as an aspect of cancer because hypoxic environments have been shown to be resistant to radiation therapy. Radiation has been shown to increase the amounts of HIF-1. EMT induction by hypoxia though interactions between HIF-1α and ROS is crucial for metastasis in cancers such as melanoma. It has been found that many genes associated with melanoma are regulated by hypoxia such as MXI1, FN1, and NME1.|$|E

Therefore, specific and efficient inhibitors of cancer <b>stemness</b> must be discovered for reducing tumor recurrence. YM 155 has been indicated to significantly reduce stemness-derived tumorsphere formation. However, the pharmaceutical mechanism of YM 155 against cancer <b>stemness</b> is unclear. This study investigated the potential mechanism of YM 155 against cancer <b>stemness</b> in lung cancer. Tumorspheres derived from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -mutant HCC 827 and EGFR wild-type A 549 cells expressing higher cancer <b>stemness</b> markers (CD 133, Oct 4, and Nanog) were used as cancer <b>stemness</b> models. We observed that EGFR autophosphorylation (Y 1068) was higher in HCC 827 - and A 549 -derived tumorspheres than in parental cells; this autophosphorylation induced tumorsphere formation by activating G 9 a-mediated <b>stemness.</b> Notably, YM 155 inhibited tumorsphere formation by blocking the autophosphorylation of EGFR and the EGFR-G 9 a-mediated <b>stemness</b> pathway. The chemical and genetic inhibition of EGFR and G 9 a revealed the significant role of the EGFR-G 9 a pathway in maintaining the cancer <b>stemness</b> property. In conclusion, this study not only revealed that EGFR could trigger tumorsphere formation by elevating G 9 a-mediated <b>stemness</b> but also demonstrated that YM 155 could inhibit this formation by simultaneously blocking EGFR autophosphorylation and G 9 a activity, thus acting as a potent agent against lung cancer <b>stemness...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) {{are a small}} {{population}} of cancer cells that exhibit <b>stemness.</b> These cells contribute to cancer metastasis, treatment resistance, and relapse following therapy; therefore, they may cause malignancy and reduce the success of cancer treatment. Nuclear factor kappa B- (NF-κB-) mediated inflammatory responses increase <b>stemness</b> in cancer cells, and CSCs constitutively exhibit higher NF-κB activation, which in turn increases their <b>stemness.</b> These opposite effects form a positive feedback loop that further amplifies inflammation and <b>stemness</b> in cancer cells, thereby expanding CSC populations in the tumor. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses when stimulated by carcinogenic microbes and endogenous molecules released from cells killed during cancer treatment. NF-κB activation by extrinsic TLR ligands increases <b>stemness</b> in cancer cells. Moreover, it was recently shown that increased NF-κB activity and inflammatory responses in CSCs {{may be caused by}} altered TLR signaling during the enrichment of <b>stemness</b> in cancer cells.

40|$|Cancer <b>stemness</b> is {{a concept}} used to {{describe}} a minorpopulation of cells (cancer stem cells-CSCs) residing in atumor, which possess self-renewal properties and are resistantto chemo/radiation therapy. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT), a major mechanism of cancer metastasis, is a processwhich generates cells with stem-like properties. The relationship between cancer <b>stemness</b> and EMT is well documentedbut without detailed mechanistic explanation. Bmi 1 belongs tothe polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC 1) which maintainsself-renewal and <b>stemness.</b> Recent results showed that Twist 1,an EMT regulator, directly activates Bmi 1 and these two molecules function together to mediate cancer <b>stemness</b> and EMT.

40|$|The {{existence}} of cancer cells with stem cell properties (Cancer Stem Cells, CSCs) and {{their association with}} tumor resistance and relapse {{has led to the}} search for active compounds to eliminate these cells or modulate their <b>stemness</b> in the hope of curing cancer.

40|$|Cancer pain is {{a common}} and severe {{complication}} of human breast cancer, and relieving pain is fundamental strategy in the treatment. Fentanyl, as an opioid analgesic, is widely used in breast cancer patients. However, {{little is known about}} its effects on <b>stemness</b> and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer cells. Aberrant protein glycosylation is involved in cancer malignancy. The α 1, 6 -fucosylation is an important type of glycosylation, and the elevated α 1, 6 -fucosylation catalyzed by fucosyltransferase VIII (FUT 8) is found in many tumors. However, whether 1, 6 -fucosylation is involved in regulating <b>stemness</b> and EMT, and stimulated by fentanyl is not clear. In this study, we found that fentanyl induced <b>stemness</b> and EMT in MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells by analysis of sphere formation, expression of <b>stemness</b> markers (Sox 2, Oct 4) and EMT markers (N-cadherin, E-cadherin and Vimentin). Results also showed that fentanyl upregulated FUT 8 gene and protein expression by qPCR, Western blot and immunofluorescent staining, as well as α 1, 6 -fucosylation level by Lectin blot and Lectin fluorescent staining. Furthermore, decreased or blocked α 1, 6 -fucosylation by FUT 8 siRNA transfection or LCA Lectin blockage reduced <b>stemness</b> and EMT. Additionally, fentanyl activated the key molecules and target genes in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. LGK- 974 (an inhibitor of Wnt ligands) suppressed fentanyl-mediated upregulation of α 1, 6 -fucosylation, <b>stemness</b> and EMT. The results of tumor xenograft demonstrated that fentanyl enhanced tumor growth, α 1, 6 -fucosylation, <b>stemness</b> and EMT. Taken together, our study reveals that fentanyl upregulated FUT 8 expression, which increased α 1, 6 -fucosylation level through activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby, induce <b>stemness</b> and EMT of breast cancer cells. This study suggest a potential side effect of fentanyl in the treatment of cancer, which may guide the safety of fentanyl in the clinical application...|$|E
40|$|Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) {{have been}} {{reported}} to play major roles in tumorigenesis, tumor relapse, and metastasis after therapy against colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Therefore, identification of colorectal CSC regulators could provide promising targets for CRC. Ligand-of-Numb protein X 1 (LNX 1) is one E 3 ubiquitin ligase which mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Numb. Although several studies indicate LNX 1 could be a potential suppressor of cancer diseases, the functions of LNX 1 in mediating cancer <b>stemness</b> remain poorly understood. In this study, LNX 1 was identified as a negative regulator of cancer <b>stemness</b> in CRC, which was downregulated in colonospheres or side population (SP) cells. Furthermore, the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) was found to be one critical downstream mediator of cancer <b>stemness</b> regulated by LNX 1. Interestingly, the anti-breast cancer drug tamoxifen was found to be an agonist of LNX 1 and suppress cancer <b>stemness</b> in CRC.

We found that this effect was by and large attributable to <b>stemness</b> related gene sets. Remarkably, this signature proved associated with recently described poor prognosis CRC subtypes exhibiting high <b>stemness</b> and/or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits. Consistent {{with the notion that}} high WNT signaling is required for <b>stemness</b> maintenance, ablating Bcl 9 / 9 l-β-catenin in murine oncogenic intestinal organoids provoked their differentiation and completely abrogated their tumorigenicity, while not affecting their proliferation.

40|$|Background: One {{hypothesis}} for thyroid cancer {{development is}} its derivation from thyroid cancer stem cells (CSCs). Such cells could arise via different paths including from mutated resident stem cells within the thyroid gland or via epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) from malignant cells since EMT {{is known to}} confer stem-like characteristics. Methods: To examine the status of <b>stemness</b> in thyroid papillary cancer we employed a murine model of thyroid papillary carcinoma and examined the expression of <b>stemness</b> and EMT using qPCR and histochemistry in mice with a thyroid-specific knock-in of oncogenic Braf (LSL-Braf(V 600 E) /TPO-Cre). This construct is only activated {{at the time of}} thyroid peroxidase (TPO) expression in differentiating thyroid cells and cannot be activated by undifferentiated stem cells which do not express TPO. Results: There was decreased expression of thyroid specific genes such as Tg and NIS and increased expression of <b>stemness</b> markers such as Oct 4, Rex 1, CD 15 and Sox 2 in the thyroid carcinoma tissue from 6 week old BRAFV 600 E mice. The decreased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and increased EMT regulators including Snail, Slug, and TGF-β 1 and TGF-β 3, and the mesenchymal marker vimentin demonstrated the simultaneous progression of EMT and the CSC-like phenotype. <b>Stemness</b> was also found in a derived cancer thyroid cell line in which overexpression of Snail caused up-regulation of vimentin expression and up regulation of <b>stemness</b> markers Oct 4, Rex 1, CD 15 with enhanced migration ability of the cells. Conclusions: Our findings support our earlier hypothesis that <b>stemness</b> in thyroid cancer is derived via EMT rather than from resident thyroid stem cells. In mice with a thyroid-specific knock-in of oncogenic Braf (LSL-Braf(V 600 E) /TPO-Cre) the neoplastic changes were dependent on thyroid cell differentiation and the onset of <b>stemness</b> must have been derived from differentiated thyroid epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs), {{a subset of}} tumor cells, {{contribute}} to an aggressive biological behavior, which is also affected by the tumor stroma. Despite the role of CSCs and the tumor stroma in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), features of <b>stemness</b> {{have not yet been}} studied in relation to tumor stromal alterations in multistep hepatocarcinogenesis. We investigated the expression status of <b>stemness</b> markers and tumor stromal changes in B viral carcinogenesis, which is the main etiology of HCC in Asia. <b>Stemness</b> features of tumoral hepatocytes (EpCAM, K 19, Oct 3 / 4, c-KIT, c-MET, and CD 133), and tumor stromal cells expressing α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), CD 68, CD 163, and IL- 6 were analyzed in 36 low grade dysplastic nodules (DNs), 48 high grade DNs, 30 early HCCs (eHCCs), and 51 progressed HCCs (pHCCs) by immunohistochemistry or real-time PCR. <b>Stemness</b> features (EpCAM and K 19 in particular) were progressively acquired during hepatocarcinogenesis in combination with enrichment of stromal cells (CAFs, TAMs, IL- 6 + cells). <b>Stemness</b> features were seen sporadically in DNs, more consistent in eHCCs, and peaked in pHCCs. Likewise, stromal cells were discernable in DNs, showed up as consistent cell densities in eHCCs and peaked in pHCCs. The <b>stemness</b> features and tumor stromal alterations also peaked in less differentiated or larger HCCs. In conclusion, progression of B viral multistep hepatocarcinogenesis is characterized by an enrichment of <b>stemness</b> features of neoplastic hepatocytes and a parallel alteration of the tumor stroma. The modulation of neoplastic hepatocytes and stromal cells was at low levels in precancerous lesions (DNs), consistently increased in incipient cancer (eHCCs) and peaked in pHCCs. Thus, in B viral hepatocarcinogenesis, interactions between CSCs and the tumor stroma, although starting early, seem {{to play a major role}} in tumor progression...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Malignant ovarian {{disease is}} characterised by {{high rates of}} {{mortality}} due to high rates of recurrent chemoresistant disease. Anecdotal evidence indicates {{this may be due}} to chemoresistant properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, our understanding of the role of CSCs in recurrent ovarian disease remains sparse. In this study we used gene microarrays and meta-analysis of our previously published microRNA (miRNA) data to assess the involvement of cancer <b>stemness</b> signatures in recurrent ovarian disease. Methods Microarray analysis was used to characterise early regulation events in an embryonal carcinoma (EC) model of cancer <b>stemness.</b> This was then compared to our previously published microarray data from a study of primary versus recurrent ovarian disease. In parallel, meta-analysis was used to identify cancer <b>stemness</b> miRNA signatures in tumor patient samples. Results Microarray analysis demonstrated a 90 % difference between gene expression events involved in early regulation of differentiation in murine EC (mEC) and embryonic stem (mES) cells. This contrasts the known parallels between mEC and mES cells in the undifferentiated and well-differentiated states. Genelist comparisons identified a cancer <b>stemness</b> signature set of genes in primary versus recurrent data, a subset of which are known p 53 -p 21 regulators. This signature is present in primary and recurrent or in primary alone but essentially never in recurrent tumors specifically. Meta-analysis of miRNA expression showed a much stronger cancer <b>stemness</b> signature within tumor samples. This miRNA signature again related to p 53 -p 21 regulation and was expressed prominently in recurrent tumors. Our data indicate that the regulation of p 53 -p 21 in ovarian cancer involves, at least partially, a cancer <b>stemness</b> component. Conclusion We present a p 53 -p 21 cancer <b>stemness</b> signature model for ovarian cancer. We propose that this may, at least partially, differentially regulate the p 53 -p 21 mechanism in ovarian disease. Targeting CSCs within ovarian cancer represents a potential therapeutic avenue. </p...|$|E

To test whether the endothelial cells (ECs) participate in the constitution of the stem cell niche for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), ECs derivatives including extracellular matrix (ECM) and conditioned medium (CM) prepared from aortic endothelial cells (AECs) and Mile Sven 1 endothelial cell line (MS 1) were investigated for the potential to maintain MSCs <b>stemness.</b> MSCs expanded on endothelial ECMs, especially on MS 1 -ECM, possessed a more juvenile morphology and showed delayed proliferation, when compared with untreated MSCs and MSCs on MSC-ECM and in CMs. Once induced, MS 1 -ECM group showed better tri-lineage differentiations indicating that MS 1 -ECM could better preserve MSC <b>stemness.</b> MSCs on MS 1 -ECM showed stronger immune-modulatory potential and had significantly higher H 3 K 27 me 3 with lower Kdm 6 b expression. Taken together, MS 1 -ECM shapes an inhibitory chromatin signature and retains MSCs <b>stemness.</b> Our work provided supportive evidence that MSCs can reside in a perivascular niche, and a feasible novel approach for MSCs expansion...|$|E
40|$|The <b>stemness</b> {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} all stem cells use common mechanisms to regulate self-renewal and multi-lineage potential. However, gene expression meta-analyses at the single gene level {{have failed to}} identify {{a significant number of}} genes selectively expressed by a broad range of stem cell types. We hypothesized that <b>stemness</b> may be regulated by modules of homologs. While the expression of any single gene within a module may vary from one stem cell type to the next, {{it is possible that the}} expression of the module as a whole is required so that the expression of different, yet functionally-synonymous, homologs is needed in different stem cells. Thus, we developed a computational method to test for stem cell-specific gene expression patterns from a comprehensive collection of 49 murine datasets covering 12 different stem cell types. We identified 40 individual genes and 224 <b>stemness</b> modules with reproducible and specific up-regulation across multiple stem cell types. The <b>stemness</b> modules included families regulating chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and Wnt signaling. Strikingly, the majority of modules represent evolutionarily related homologs. Moreover, a score based on the discovered modules could accurately distinguish stem cell-like populations from other cell types in both normal and cancer tissues. This scoring system revealed that both mouse and human metastatic populations exhibit higher <b>stemness</b> indices than non-metastatic populations, providing further evidence for a stem cell-driven component underlying th...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that mast cells (MCs) and their mediators {{are involved in}} the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. We have found that an increased density of MCs in thyroid cancer (TC) correlates with enhanced invasiveness. However, the MC-derived factors responsible for this activity and the mechanisms by which they enhance TC invasiveness remain unidentified. Here, we report that MCs, when activated by TC cells, produce soluble factors that induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and <b>stemness</b> features of TC cells. We identified CXCL 8 /interleukin (IL) - 8 as the main mediator contained in activated MC conditioned media (CM) capable of inducing both EMT and <b>stemness</b> of TC cells. Mechanistically, MC CM or exogenous IL- 8 stimulated Akt phosphorylation and Slug expression in TC cells. The inhibition of the Akt pathway or depletion of the Slug transcription factor by RNA interference, reverted EMT and <b>stemness</b> responses. TC cells stably transfected with exogenous IL- 8 underwent EMT, displayed increased <b>stemness</b> and enhanced tumorigenicity with respect to control cells. The analysis of TC surgical specimens by immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between MC density (Tryptase+ cells) and <b>stemness</b> features (OCT 4 staining). Taken together, our data identify an MC-dependent IL- 8 -Akt-Slug pathway that sustains EMT/stemness of TC cells. The blockade of this circuit might be exploited for the therapy of advanced T...|$|E
