40|$|In birds as in {{many other}} taxa, parasites can have {{deleterious}} effects on offspring development. Therefore, avian mothers have evolved responses to counteract parasite virulence in offspring via transgenerational defense mechanisms that is the transfer of immune-enhancing substances such as antibodies to their eggs. Another maternal pathway is suggested by the finding that infested great tit mothers produced eggs with lower androgens, since these yolk androgens are immunosuppressive and potentially affect parasite susceptibility of the nestlings. However, whether this pathway is a specific adaptation to infestation with parasites that affect the offspring or an epiphenomenon of lower androgen production in the female due to the parasite effects on the mother itself is as yet unclear. In this study we infested female great tits (Parus major) with <b>sheep</b> <b>ticks</b> (Ixodes ricinus), which are non-nidicolous ectoparasites with low vertical transmission capability, and evaluated the effects on yolk androgen deposition. Tick-infested females did not significantly reduce their deposition of androgens (androstenedione (A 4) and testosterone) compared to tick-reduced females, which is in contrast to a previous study showing a lowered deposition of A 4 and testosterone when females were exposed to the nidicolous hen flea. Thus, females alter their hormone deposition, and thus likely offspring phenotype, when exposed to parasites that also form the parasitic environment of their offspring, but not when temporarily infested with the field-dwelling <b>sheep</b> <b>ticks</b> with low transmission capability. This suggests that selection favored the evolution of an adaptive transgenerational effect by acting mainly on the parasite-induced maternal effect. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} role of {{the major}} histocompatibility complex (MHC) in immune recognition {{has led to a}} general consensus that the characteristically high levels of functional polymorphism at MHC genes is maintained by balancing selection operating through host–parasite coevolution. However, the actual mechanism by which selection operates is unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed: overdominance (or heterozygote superiority) and negative frequency-dependent selection. Evidence for these hypotheses was evaluated by examining MHC–parasite relationships in an island population of water voles (Arvicola terrestris). Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine whether individual variation at an MHC class II DRB locus explained variation in the individual burdens of five different parasites. MHC genotype explained a significant amount of variation in the burden of gamasid mites, fleas (Megabothris walkeri) and nymphs of <b>sheep</b> <b>ticks</b> (Ixodes ricinus). Additionally, MHC heterozygotes were simultaneously co-infected by fewer parasite types than homozygotes. In each case where an MHC-dependent effect on parasite burden was resolved, the heterozygote genotype was associated with fewer parasites, and the heterozygote outperformed each homozygote in two of three cases, suggesting an overall superiority against parasitism for MHC heterozygote genotypes.

Sequence analysis of 18 S rRNA showed 99. 7 % identity of roe deer Babesia EU 1 with the human EU 1 strain. B. divergens detected in cervids was 99. 6 % identical to bovine B. divergens. Human babesiosis is an emerging tick-transmitted disease caused by intraerythrocytic parasites of the genus Babesia. A bovine parasite, Babesia divergens has been implicated as the most common agent of this dangerous zoonosis in Europe (1). The life cycle of B. divergens is determined by cattle, the vertebrate host, and by European <b>sheep</b> <b>ticks,</b> Ixodes ricinus. Ticks are not only the vectors of B. divergens but also its most important nonbovine reservoir (2). Many questions regarding parasite epidemiology and biology and the host response to infection remain to be answered. Furthermore, molecular data for B. divergens are scarce; only 1 DNA sequence of this parasite from humans from mainland Europe has been recently deposited (3). Recently, 2 cases of human babesiosis {{have been reported in}} Italy and Austria. The etiologic agent was identified as Babesia EU 1, a pathogen closely related to, but clearly distinct from, B. divergens (4). The distinction was based on analysis of the complete babesial 18 S rRNA gene, which also showed that EU 1 is most closely related to B. odocoilei, a parasite of whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the United States (5). I. ricinus, the most prevalent and widely distributed tick species in Europe, has already been implicated as the vector of EU 1 (4, 6).

This is one of the busiest days in the shooting season, with large amounts of game being shot. The date itself is traditional; the current legislation enshrining it in England and Wales is the Game Act 1831 (and in Northern Ireland, the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985). Not all game (as defined by the 1831 act) have the same start to their open seasons - most begin on 1 September, with 1 October for woodcock and pheasant.Since English law says that the start of the season cannot fall on a Sunday, it is sometimes postponed to 13 August, as in 2001 and 2007.Because grouse are not and never have been reared to any extent for shooting, their numbers fluctuate naturally from year to year. In recent years, the Glorious Twelfth has also been hit by hunt saboteurs, the 2001 foot and mouth crisis (which further postponed the date in affected areas) and the effect of <b>sheep</b> <b>tick,</b> heather beetle, the gut parasite Trichostrongylus tenuis and severe flooding and bad weather.

Culling of sheep one year of age or older was greatest in the East South Central region (38. 3 percent of sheep) and lowest in the Mountain region (12. 7 percent of sheep). Old age was the reason most frequently given for culling or death in all regions except East South Central, where the reason most frequently given was economic. By region, the condition present on the greatest number of operations was stomach/intestinal worms, except in the Mountain and East South Central regions, in which the conditions present on the greatest number of operations were <b>sheep</b> <b>ticks</b> and footrot, respectively.

40|$|Bracken environments harbour the <b>sheep</b> <b>tick</b> (Ixodes ricinus), known vector of {{a number}} of diseases. Initial {{investigation}} indicated the presence of sheep ticks infected with the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi on open moorland areas of the North York Moors and the moorland areas of the South West of the U. K. Some aspects of the problem of Lyme disease on U. K. moorlands were explored in this study. A survey through the summer of 1993 of people using the North York Moors, Dartmoor and the Quantock Hills in Somerset for both work and leisure activities revealed a very high proportion of people (76 % of respondents had not heard of Lyme disease) who were unaware of the risk of Lyme disease or of how they might reduce that risk. An examination of three moorland vegetation communities as optimal tick habitats suggested that immature ticks are less dense on heather dominated communities than on either bracken or on Vaccinium dominated communities, and that this may be influenced by the fauna using heather dominated areas. Vaccinium sites showed high densities of all life stages of the <b>sheep</b> <b>tick,</b> as did bracken dominated sites. Ticks were collected throughout the winter months on South Western sites, but not on the North York Moors, emphasising the year round risk from infected ticks in the South West of the U. K. Vegetation management practices as tick control or reduction options in these moorland areas were investigated. Asulam spraying on bracken almost totally removed the above ground frond cover, substantially reduced live buds on the rhizome, but failed to reduce the rhizome dry weight. The density of frond cover was not affected by cutting, height and dry frond weight were reduced, live rhizome buds reduced in number and rhizome dry weight reduced. Short term control of bracken fronds was achieved by both treatments, but neither treatment provided sufficiently conclusive results on which to base long term recommendations. Comprehensive plans for after care on treated sites need to be in place before treatment is carried out. Tick densities were recorded over a two year period on these treated bracken sites. There was a proportional reduction in all tick life stages between 1993 and 1994 on sites sprayed with asulam and on cut sites compared with control sites.
