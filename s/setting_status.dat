40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of {{intraoral}} aging on the <b>setting</b> <b>status</b> of a resin composite and a glass ionomer adhesive, relative to control specimens stored in water. METHODS: Metallic brackets were bonded with resin composite orthodontic adhesive (Transbond XT; 3 M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) or a glass ionomer cement (Fuji I; GC, Tokyo, Japan) to recently extracted premolars and kept in water for 6 months. The same materials were also bonded to the premolars of orthodontic patients. After 6 months, the teeth were carefully extracted, with the brackets intact on their buccal surfaces. All teeth were embedded in epoxy resin and sectioned buccolingually. Fourier transform infrared microscopy and Raman microscopy were used for the estimation of the degree of cure in the composite and the salt yield in the glass ionomer adhesives. RESULTS: The control samples of the composite showed significantly lower degrees of cure than did the retrieved specimens (52. 40...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{individual}} agency in crafting meaningful work has attracted increasing interest in {{recent studies of}} careers and working life. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to make visible the role of the media in reproducing and shaping understandings of careers and agency. By analyzing narratives of career change in the Finnish media, we identify three types of narrative and show how they construct meaningful careers by juxtaposing the past and present work in terms of <b>setting,</b> <b>status,</b> meaning, pace, and workload. Overall, these narratives depict a shift from traditional careers toward work that is concrete, meaningful, of lower status, and less hectic. Moreover, the narratives represent career changers as self-reliant heroes taking “daring leaps. ” Hence, we argue that the media reproduces individualistic assumptions of careers and reinforces the dominant, neoliberal ideal of self-responsible, autonomous subjects. We conclude by calling for alternative narratives that recognize the need for more meaningful careers but help strengthen agency in a less individualistic fashion...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Liturgics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 The {{combination}} of observational, anecdotal and circumstantial evidence suggests that, in the present-day Christian church, older, traditional hymns are slowly but inexorably {{being replaced by}} modern, contemporary ones. Whilst it is a truism that hymnody, like every other aspect of civilisation, moves forward with the times, there still remains {{a large number of}} people, congregations and clergy for whom the early eighteenth century English hymn is a genre that remains ever-popular. This research focuses deliberately on the eighteenth century hymn for four main reasons. First, hymns from this period are widely used in most Christian denominations. Second, the eighteenth century was a particularly fertile period for hymnody. Third, this was the era of Watts and Wesley, arguably two of the greatest hymn writers of all time; their burgeoning popularity thrust the eighteenth century into a period of proclivity for hymn writing. Finally, the whole area of hymnody in the Church of Ireland appears to be under-researched. Thus, in seeking to determine why older, more traditional hymns continue to be published in Church of Ireland hymnals this research fills a very obvious gap. This study establishes that this resilience is real and not merely perceived. Eighteenth century hymns are still widely sung in today’s Church, irrespective of size, location, <b>setting,</b> <b>status,</b> leadership or congregation. The study explores the many reasons behind this resilience—reasons that go beyond the more obvious musical and liturgical ones and highlight the impact of hymnody from a variety of angles.
