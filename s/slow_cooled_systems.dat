40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of superconductivity at 26 K in oxy-pnictide LaFeAsO 1 -xFx, enormous interests have been stimulated {{in the field of}} condensed matter physics and material sciences. Among the many kind of structures in the iron pnictide superconductors, FeSe with the PbO structure has received special attention since there is not poisonous pnictogen element in chemical composition and its structure is the simplest one. However, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in iron chalcogenide compounds is not enhanced as high as other iron pnictide superconductors under ambient pressure until the superconductivity at above 30 K in potassium intercalated iron selenide KxFe 2 -ySe 2 was discovered. The insulating and the superconducting state are both observed in KxFe 2 -ySe 2 with different stoichiometries and some groups have tuned the system from insulating to superconducting state by varying the ratio of starting materials[10, 11]. The recent data from neutron scattering suggest that the superconductivity may be built upon an ordered state of Fe vacancies as well as the antiferromagnetic state with a very strong ordered magnetic moment 3. 4 B. Here we show that the superconductivity can actually be tuned on a single sample directly from an insulating state by post-annealing and fast quenching. Upon waiting for some days at room temperatures, the superconductivity will disappear and the resistivity exhibits an insulating behavior again. The spatial distribution of the compositions of the as-grown sample and the post-annealed-quenched one was analyzed by the Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrum (EDXS) and found to be very close to each other. Therefore it is tempting to conclude that the superconductivity is achieved when the Fe-vacancies are in a random (disordered) state. Once they arrange in an ordered state by relaxation or <b>slow</b> <b>cooling,</b> the <b>system</b> turns out to be an insulator. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Starting in equilibrium beneath the critical temperature Tc, the system freezes into small clusters of flipped spins, with the energy density related to the cooling rate by a power law (for most cooling programs). Cluster-dynamical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations show that, for exponential cooling, the freezing exponent approaches a one-cluster value, which depends upon the energy barrier and the lattice type, via an intermediate regime with a higher effective exponent. Starting in equilibrium above Tc, the frozen state consists of large domains of either phase. Simple interface-dynamical arguments suggest that the frozen correlation function should assume a scaling form, with a (universal) scaling exponent, {{which is the same}} as for domain growth after an instantaneous quench. Monte Carlo simulations find evidence for this scaling form at small values of the scaling variable only, suggesting the importance of initial correlations for a very wide regime of cooling rates.

District <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is widely used but its performance is rarely reported. The system performance compared with the individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> determines its future application. Performance assessment of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> is conducted by comparing with individual <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> in subtropical areas. Characteristics of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are summarized after quantitative energy performance analysis. Measures to handle the additional peak electricity load due to developing a new area and using district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are assessed. Application of ice storage systems in the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is evaluated under different tariffs and design strategies. The performance of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> integrated with PHES is analyzed. The operation costs of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> with and without combined cooling, heating and power system are compared. Comments and suggestions are summarized for the application of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> in the subtropical area. Information or data used in the system design at planning and design stages are often very different from that when the system is in operation. Such difference is taken as uncertainty. Uncertainty exists widely in the design process of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> It will affect the design options but is not sufficiently investigated yet. To ensure that the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> perform well in operation eventually, uncertainty-based optimal design methods are proposed. The performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> using the proposed methods is compared with that using the conventional design method. An optimal design method concerning uncertainty is developed based on mini-max regret theory. It achieves the optimal design considering uncertainty. Without the needs of probability distribution assumptions and introducing new models, this method can determine the uncertainty-based optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> very effectively. By comparing the regrets of each design option, the uncertainty-based optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can be identified, which is associated with the minimum maximum regret. The method is demonstrated {{in the design of the}} chiller plant and chilled water system of a building. By quantifying the uncertainty at planning and design stages, an uncertainty-based optimal design method is proposed and its application steps are introduced. Uncertainties in the outdoor weather, building design/construction and indoor conditions are concerned. Strategies to deal with the variables containing uncertainties are introduced. Based on the peak cooling load distribution, the capacity of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> can be determined with quantified risks. Based on the distribution of the annual energy consumption or cost, the configuration of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> can be selected with quantified confidence. The uncertainty-based optimal method is implemented in a district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and an individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> in Hong Kong respectively. By using the uncertainty-based optimal design method, stake holders can make decisions with quantified confidence. The components or sub-systems in a <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> cannot be always available due to failures or maintenance. A robust optimal design method considering both uncertainty and reliability is proposed. The robust optimal design can maintain the good performance under uncertainty or failures of components in the <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Steps to realize the robust optimal design method are presented. The availability risk cost is introduced to account for the losses caused by the unmet cooling load. By taking the total annual cost including the capital cost, operation cost and availability risk cost as the objective, the robust optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can be achieved. The proposed method is demonstrated in both the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> using the robust optimal design is compared with that using the conventional design method, uncertainty-based design method and reliability-based design method. The impacts of uncertainty on the design of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are compared. The influential factors for cooling loads of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are identified. Similarities and differences are summarized.

Eight x-ray diffraction specimens for each of six commercial dental porcelains and for the Component No. 1 frit of the Weinstein and Weinstein (1962) and Weinstein et al.

Specimens in the second group (termed slow-cooled) were cooled slowly by interrupting power to the furnace muffle and allow-ing them to cool inside the closed furnace. Quantitative x-ray diffraction was performed on the fast- and slow-cooled por-celain specimens with standards containing leucite volume fractions of 0. 111, 0. 223, 0. 334, and 0. 445.
