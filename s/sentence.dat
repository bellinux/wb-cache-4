The defendant does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution. If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the authorized <b>sentence</b> exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the defendant {{has a right to}} a jury. Further, the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual <b>sentence</b> exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized <b>sentence</b> (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E

Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life <b>sentence,</b> after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life <b>sentence</b> was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year <b>sentence,</b> so her <b>sentence</b> was not rejudged.|$|E

40|$|Drawing upon {{a recent}} study of felony jury <b>sentencing</b> in Kentucky, Virginia, and Arkansas, this essay {{highlights}} some of the similarities and differences between jury <b>sentencing</b> in capital cases and jury <b>sentencing</b> in non-capital cases. Unlike jury <b>sentencing</b> in capital cases, jury <b>sentencing</b> in non-capital cases includes functional differentials in judge and jury options for <b>sentencing,</b> and fewer controls on arbitrary decision-making. Jury <b>sentencing</b> in both contexts shares the potential for reluctance on the part of elected judges to reduce jury <b>sentences,</b> information gaps on the part of jurors in setting <b>sentences,</b> and, above all, service as a tool in negotiating settlements...|$|R
5000|$|Indeterminate <b>sentences</b> are <b>sentences</b> where a judge {{indicates}} a minimum and maximum {{time for an}} offender to be imprisoned. The prisoner may be released anytime between the established minimum and maximum time. Indeterminate <b>sentencing</b> expanded discretion into the prison system so that prisoner rehabilitation could be analysed on the individual level. Indeterminate <b>sentencing</b> is personalized opposed to determinate <b>sentencing</b> which is standardized. [...] "Advocates of determinate <b>sentencing</b> have argued that inmates support determinate <b>sentencing</b> because they strongly resent uncertainty of time to be served and <b>sentencing</b> inequity under indeterminate sentencing." [...] Because indeterminate <b>sentencing</b> expands discretion, offenders with similar crimes may serve vastly different prison times. Indeterminate <b>sentencing</b> exchanges equity of law for personalization of rehabilitation.|$|R

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a <b>sentence</b> generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the <b>sentence.</b> In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the <b>sentence,</b> frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft <b>sentence</b> where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula <b>sentence</b> with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex <b>sentence</b> constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment <b>sentence</b> structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

40|$|U radu se razmatra gramatički status poredbenih rečenica i njihov odnos prema načinskim rečenicama: postoje li poredbene rečenice, jesu li one vrsta načinskih ili su pak poseban strukturno-semantički tip priložnih rečenica? Poredbene se rečenice promatraju u korelativnim sintaktičkom sustavu. Istražuju se i opisuju njihove ustrojstvene, funkcionalne i značenjske osobitosti, posebno osobitosti onih poredbenih rečenica kojima se izriče jednakost. Po nekim svojim obilježjima poredbene su rečenice slične odnosnim rečenicama. Za opis poredbenih rečenica iznimno je važno proučavanje unutrašnjeg ustrojstva sintaktičkih skupina (pridjevske, imenske i glagolske), pa se tome posvećuje primjerena pozornost.

Their structural, functional and semantic characteristics are investigated and described, especially the characteristics of those comparative <b>sentences</b> which express similarity. By some of their characteristics, comparative <b>sentences</b> are similar to relational <b>sentences.</b> According to their structural, syntactic, and semantic features, we can distinguish on the one hand comparative <b>sentences,</b> which express similarity and the comparative <b>sentences,</b> which express difference (dissimilarity) and, on the other hand, restrictive comparative <b>sentences</b> from non-restrictive comparative <b>sentences.</b> All <b>sentences</b> described in traditional Croatian grammars as <b>sentences</b> of manner and comparative <b>sentences</b> or <b>sentences</b> of manner or comparative <b>sentences</b> are in this paper considered comparative <b>sentences.</b> Only those <b>sentences</b> introduced by the subjunctors tako da, tako to, time što and na taj način da/što are regarded as the <b>sentences</b> of manner...|$|R

2500|$|The primary {{development}} in <b>sentencing</b> law {{that gave rise}} to this case was the shift away from indeterminate <b>sentencing</b> and toward determinate <b>sentencing.</b> [...] Under an indeterminate <b>sentencing</b> scheme, statutory law provides {{for a wide range of}} authorized <b>sentences,</b> such as [...] "five years to life" [...] for burglary. [...] The power to determine the length of time a criminal actually spends in prison rests with a parole board or other prison officials, rather than with the courts. [...] In the 1970s, California replaced its indeterminate <b>sentencing</b> system with a determinate <b>sentencing</b> scheme. [...] In a determinate <b>sentencing</b> scheme, statutory law fixes authorized <b>sentences</b> of discrete lengths, and requires courts rather than prison officials to justify which of those discrete <b>sentences</b> is appropriate in any given case.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{positive}} political theory of criminal <b>sentencing</b> and test it {{using data from}} the U. S. <b>Sentencing</b> Commission. Under the U.

Our theory predicts that a <b>sentencing</b> judge politically aligned with the circuit court {{will be more likely to}} alter <b>sentences</b> through <b>sentencing</b> departures than a judge not so aligned with the circuit; by contrast, our theory predicts that judges can more freely use fact-oriented adjustments to alter <b>sentences,</b> regardless of the circuit court's <b>sentencing</b> policy preferences.
