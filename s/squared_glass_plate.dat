40|$|A commercially {{available}} latex agglutination test, Rotalex (Orion Diagnostics, Finland), for detecting rotaviruses was evaluated {{in comparison with}} four other tests (electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) routinely used in our laboratories. Although Rotalex was the least complex method, it showed lack of specificity and sensitivity when carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four basic modifications of Rotalex are described. These {{include the use of}} Hank's balanced salt solution, increasing the incubation time to 20 min, reading the agglutination result by an experienced observer, and the use of 50 mm <b>square</b> <b>glass</b> <b>plates.</b> The modified procedure gave results which were comparable with those obtained by electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The latter techniques, when used to detect rotavirus, all gave similar results...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} {{deposition}} of TiO 2 thin films onto different types and sizes of substrates, {{and some of these}} layers dope by iron or silver. During the work was range of TiO 2 layers created using a method of physical vapor deposition namely magnetron sputtering. For these processes was chosen the Dreva ARC 400 Hard Material Coating Plant device. The main aim of these depositions was to attempt to create TiO 2 thin films on a substrates of larger surface than its in average laboratory processes usual. For this purpose were TiO 2 layers deposited onto <b>square</b> <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> of side length 10 cm. For comparsion and analysis were also as a substrates used microscope slides and fragments of silicon wafers. These substrates were used for testing of photocatalytic activity and on surface morphology (SEM). The theoretical part of this thesis aims to a methods of deposition TiO 2 layers and their characteristics. In the experimental part is the used coating equipment and parameters of each deposition process described. Further the characteristics and results of individual experiments are described...|$|R

40|$|AbstractArchitectural {{designers}} frequently use <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> {{that have}} shapes other than rectangular in both {{residential and commercial}} buildings. Commonly, one sees <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> with trapezoidal, triangular, hexagonal, and circular shapes. For example; window glass in aircraft control tower cabs leans outward to enable ground controllers {{to have a good}} view of operations. Consequently, aircraft control tower cabs have <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> that have trapezoidal shapes. This paper deals with the structural behavior of <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> other than rectangular shapes. A higher order finite element model based upon Mindlin plate theory was employed to analyze different shapes of <b>glass</b> <b>plates.</b> First, a comparison between experimental and finite element results for a tested trapezoidal <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> is presented, which shows a very good agreement. Then, the finite element model was used to compare load-induced stresses with those for bounding rectangular shapes. Results of analysis are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Glass {{plates and}} pseudo {{hexagonal}} prismatic ZSM- 5 crystals tethered with 3 -aminopropylsilyl (APS) groups, respectively, were prepared by treating them with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Subsequent {{treatment of the}} APS-tethering <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> with terephthaldi-carboxaldehyde led to facile assembly of benzaldehyde (BA) units over the <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> via imine (–CHvN–) linkages. When the BA-tethering <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> and the APS-tethering zeolite crystals were allowed to contact in boiling toluene, the ZSM- 5 crystals strongly adhered onto the <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> {{in the form of}} closely packed monolayers with perfect one-dimensional orientation. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

30|$|The {{effects of}} low-salinity water and low-salinity nanofluids (adding SiO 2 {{nanoparticles}} to low-salinity water) on wettability alteration were investigated {{by measuring the}} contact angle between crude oil and brines or nanofluids on <b>glass</b> <b>plates.</b> Contact angle measurements were performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with a Kruss DSA- 100 contact angle analyzer with an accuracy of[*]±[*] 0.1 °. Measurements were conducted on <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> because <b>glass</b> is of the same material as glass beads filled in sand packs. After being cleaned with acetone, 18 pieces of <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> were immersed in brines at 333  K for 1  h to form a film of brine on the <b>glass</b> <b>plates.</b> The <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> were then aged in crude oil at 333  K for 4  weeks. In order to measure the contact angle, the oil-wetted <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> was immersed in the low-salinity water or the low-salinity nanofluid. Then, a crude oil drop {{was placed on the}} plate surface.|$|R
40|$|Achieving high {{fidelity}} chemical synthesis on <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> {{has become increasingly}} important, since <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> are substrates widely used for miniaturized chemical and biochemical reactions and analyses. DNA chips can be directly prepared by synthesizing oligonucleotides on <b>glass</b> <b>plates,</b> but the characterization of these micro-syntheses has been limited by the sub-picomolar amount of material available. Most DNA chip syntheses have been assayed using in situ coupling of fluorescent molecules to the 5 ′-OH of the synthesized oligonucleotides. We herein report a systematic investigation of oligonucleotide synthesis on <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> with the reactions carried out in an automated DNA synthesizer using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. The analyses were performed using 32 P gel electrophoresis of the oligonucleotides cleaved from <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> to provide product distribution profiles according to chain length of oligonucleotides. 5 ′-Methoxythymidine {{was used as the}} chain terminator, which permits assay of coupling reaction yields as a function of chain length growth. The results of this work reveal that a major cause of lower fidelity synthesis on <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> is particularly inefficient reactions of the various reagents with functional groups close to <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> surfaces. These problems cannot be detected by previous in situ fluorescence assays. The identification of this origin of low fidelity synthesis on <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> should help to achieve improved synthesis for high quality oligonucleotide microarrays...|$|R

40|$|A single, a low emissivity, and {{a double}} <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> were {{investigated}} {{with respect to}} their transmittances in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) range. Directional-hemispherical transmittances of these <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> were determined under laboratory conditions in the dry and the wet (i. e., condensate covered) states. The transmittance curve of the low emissivity <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> lay below the one of the single <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> and above the one of the double <b>glass</b> <b>plate.</b> The presence of a condensate layer caused a similar transmittance reduction for single and double glass. This reduction reached a maximum of 13 to 15 % at incidence angles of 50 - 65 degrees. The transmittance reductions determined for the wet low emissivity glass were smaller and restricted to at most 11 % at an incidence angle of 70 degrees. Assuming uniformly diffuse radiation, condensation was found to lower the transmittance by 8 % for single and double glass and 5 % for low emissivity glass...|$|R

40|$|Retouching <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives was a {{practice}} that emerged {{about the same time}} as the <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negative itself. How was photography being retouched in the early 20 th century? Today there are generally available known digital tools. A hundred years ago, the retouching was done by hand, by the photographer, or by specific professionals that don’t distance themselves, in technical demand, of the arts of drawing and painting. But the retouching was invisible in the final object, because the changes were done on the negative. Its contemporary books, in the form of manuals, are a window to the past telling us about the techniques and materials used. Existing archive collections of photographic <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives are testimony to the expertise of photographers and the practical use of those books. The present work will show examples of tools and materials used for retouching of photographic <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives, taking as an example a portrait collection at the Photographic Archive of Lisbon. Also some considerations are done about the conservation of retouched <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives in archive collections. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
