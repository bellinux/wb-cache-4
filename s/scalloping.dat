5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} {{is found}} in forested regions from south and central eastern Queensland to southeastern South Australia including a very small population persisting in the Eyre Peninsula. Two subspecies are recognised, although Tasmanian and southern mainland populations of the southern subspecies xanthanotus may be distinct enough from each other to bring the total to three. Birds of subspecies funereus (Queensland to eastern Victoria) have longer wings and tails and darker plumage overall, while those of xanthanotus (western Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania) have more prominent <b>scalloping.</b>|$|E
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint <b>scalloping,</b> which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. Geographic tongue does not usually cause any symptoms, {{and in those}} cases where there are symptoms, an oral parafunctional habit may be a {{contributory}} factor. Persons with parafunctional habits related to the tongue may show <b>scalloping</b> {{on the sides of}} the tongue (crenated tongue). Some suggest that hormonal factors may be involved, because one reported case in a female appeared to vary in severity in correlation with oral contraceptive use. People with geographic tongue frequently claim that their condition worsens during periods of psychologic stress. Geographic tongue is inversely associated with smoking and tobacco use. Sometimes geographic tongue is said to run in families, and it is reported to be associated with several different genes, though studies show family association may also be caused by similar diets. Some have reported links with various human leukocyte antigens, such as increased incidence of HLA-DR5, HLA-DRW6 and HLA-Cw6 and decreased incidence in HLA-B51. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) can cause several signs in the mouth, possibly including geographic tongue, although other sources state that geographic tongue is not related to nutritional deficiency. Fissured tongue often occurs simultaneously with geographic tongue, and some consider fissured tongue to be an end stage of geographic tongue.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} research, microsatellite markers {{have been}} used to geographically and phylogenetically characterize and identify populations of sea <b>scallops</b> (Placopecten magellanicus Gmelin). Given that sea <b>scallops</b> are a closely related species to bay <b>scallops</b> (Argopecten irradians Lamarck), we have investigated whether the flanking DNA sequences of sea <b>scallop</b> microsatellite loci have been conserved in the bay <b>scallop.</b> We found that in all seven sets of published sea <b>scallop</b> PCR primers (Pma 130, - 132, - 135, - 180, - 200, - 212, and - 275) that were tested with bay <b>scallop</b> DNA, there was sequence conservation and amplification of microsatellite regions.

2500|$|Sebenza: [...] {{production}} 1991–present. [...] Folding knife, {{introducing a}} stronger {{variation of the}} Walker linerlock called the Sebenza Integral Lock, also {{commonly known as the}} framelock. [...] The Sebenza is a utility knife with titanium handles and was originally introduced with an ATS-34 stainless steel blade, followed by BG-42 and as of this writing, CPM S35VN steel. [...] The Sebenza comes in two sizes, with blade lengths of 75mm/2.94" [...] (Small Sebenza) and 92mm/3.625" [...] (Large Sebenza). There are currently 3 different models out, in chronological order they are the regular, classic, and current 21 model. The major difference is between the regular and classic/21 model. The regular has <b>scalloping</b> and a smaller lock bar access cut out. The classic is very similar to the 21 (being its predecessor), with the main difference being the classic stamp on the lock side of the knife as well as having a rounded lock bar. They offer inlays ranging from micarta to wood to even ivory on the classic and 21 models. Even though the regular has been discontinued for a few years, they still offer it annually with different inlays every year.|$|E
6000|$|Although the Heliconidae present, on the whole, many {{varieties}} of coloration and pattern, yet, {{in proportion to}} the number of distinct species in each district, the types of coloration are few and very well marked, and thus it becomes easier for a bird or other animal to learn that all belonging to such types are uneatable. This must be a decided advantage to the family in question, because, not only do fewer individuals of each species need to be sacrificed in order that their enemies may learn the lesson of their inedibility, but they are more easily recognised at a distance, and thus escape even pursuit. There is thus a kind of mimicry between closely allied species as well as between species of distinct genera, all tending to the same beneficial end. This may be seen in the four or five distinct species of the genus Heliconius which all have the same peculiar type of coloration--a yellow band across the upper wings and radiating red stripes on the lower,--and are all found in the same forests of the Lower Amazon; in the numerous very similar species of Ithomia with transparent wings, found in every locality of the same region; and in the very numerous species of Papilio of the [...] "Aeneas" [...] group, all having a similar style of marking, the resemblance being especially close in the females. The very uniform type of colouring of the blue-black Euplaeas and of the fulvous Acraeas is of the same character.[107] In all these cases the similarity of the allied species is so great, that, when they are on the wing at some distance off, it is difficult to distinguish one species from another. But this close external resemblance is not always a sign of very near affinity; for minute examination detects differences in the form and <b>scalloping</b> of the wings, in the markings on the body, and in those on the under surface of the wings, which do not usually characterise the closest allies. It is to be further noted, that the presence of groups of very similar species of the same genus, in one locality, is not at all a common phenomenon among unprotected groups. Usually the species of a genus found in one locality are each well marked and belong to somewhat distinct types, while the closely allied forms--those that require minute examination to discriminate them as distinct species--are most generally found in separate areas, and are what are termed representative forms.|$|E
