25|$|Lawton {{was born}} at Dukinfield, Cheshire, the son of John Edward Lawton and his wife Ellen. His father owned a cotton {{spinning}} business at Dukinfield and in 1883 Frederic Charles Arkwright brought him to Matlock, Derbyshire to revive Masson Mill to meet the growing market for <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> generated by the popularity of sewing machines. Lawton senior built a substantial mansion Woodbank, later Cromford Court, overlooking Masson Mill.|$|E
50|$|High {{temperature}} <b>sewing</b> <b>threads</b> provide {{durability and}} resistance to extreme temperatures. Some threads {{can be used for}} applications up to 800 °C (1472 °F).

30|$|Both air-jet and steam-jet {{textured}} yarns were twisted, finished, lubricated and converted to <b>sewing</b> <b>threads</b> using industrial facilities. Commercial air-jet textured thread specifications for twisting, finishing, and lubrication {{were applied to}} all the samples. The yarns were twisted to a twist level of 400 turns per meter and made into single ply, Z twisted <b>sewing</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R

25|$|A long-standing home method {{involves}} using ice {{as a local}} anesthetic, {{a sewing}} needle as a puncture instrument, a burning match and rubbing alcohol for disinfection, and a semi-soft object, such as a potato, cork, bar of soap or rubber eraser, as a push point. <b>Sewing</b> <b>thread</b> may be drawn through the piercing and tied, as a device for keeping the piercing open during the healing process. Alternatively, a gold stud or wire earring may be directly inserted into the fresh piercing as the initial retaining device. Home methods are often unsafe and risky due to issues of improper sterilization or placement.|$|E
25|$|Doubling and twisting. The silk {{is far too}} fine to be woven, so now it is doubled {{and twisted}} to make the warp, known as {{organzine}} and the weft, known as tram. In organzine each single is given a few twists per inch (tpi), and combine with several other singles counter twisted hard at 10 to 14 tpi. In tram the two singles are doubled with {{each other with a}} light twist, 3 to 6 tpi. <b>Sewing</b> <b>thread</b> is two tram threads, hard twisted, and machine-twist is made of three hard-twisted tram threads. Tram for the crepe process is twisted at up to 80 tpi to make it 'kick up'.|$|E
25|$|The era of {{manufactured}} fibers {{began with}} the development of rayon in France in the 1890s. Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924. Nylon, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's acrylic in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's hosiery from nylon, {{but it was not until}} the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat. The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.|$|E
40|$|Here, we {{investigated}} photochromic glass fibre threads produced with the sol-gel coating technique {{and used it}} as <b>sewing</b> <b>threads</b> to produce stitched glass-polypropylene composites. The possibility of making sol-gel photochromic glass fibre threads, the morphology of the glass fibre thread and the tensile property of glass fibre <b>sewing</b> <b>threads</b> before and after sol-gel treatment have been studied in this work. The photochromic glass fibre thread was successfully stitched into glass-polypropylene composites as <b>sewing</b> <b>threads</b> and showed an efficient and effective response to UV light. Our results indicate that sol-gel coating is {{an efficient way to}} produce photochromic glass fibre. In addition, the sol-gel coating does not significantly affect the tensile performance of the glass fibre...|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} of this research work {{was to investigate the}} use of steam as a substitute fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing. The new substitute product holds the potential for competitive advantage, lower manufacturing costs and streamlined manufacturing capabilities. Generally high-pressure steam is known to be cheaper to produce than compressed air. An existing air-jet texturing machine was modified to supply either air or steam to the texturing nozzle. Using an identical nozzle, both air-jet and steam-jet textured yarns were manufactured. The influence of effect-yarn parameters on the steam-jet texturing performance has been studied. Furthermore, steam-jet texturing was compared with air-jet texturing in terms of the processing parameters and the textured yarn properties. The results show that spun-like textured yarn manufactured using steam has lower loop instability, lower loop density and higher tensile properties than air at comparable fluid pressures. SEM image analysis shows that the entangled structure of the steam-jet textured yarns is comparable to the air-jet textured yarns. To verify the commercial feasibility of the new product, <b>sewing</b> <b>threads</b> were manufactured using both steam-jet and air-jet textured yarns and tested for sewability under commercial specifications. Sewability results indicated that the steam-jet textured <b>sewing</b> <b>threads</b> can withstand <b>sewing</b> at high-speeds like air-jet textured threads and are therefore suitable for manufacture of <b>sewing</b> <b>threads.</b> Therefore, it can be concluded that steam can be used as an alternative fluid for air in making spun-like textured yarns.|$|R
