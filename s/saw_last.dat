25|$|Mid-May 1855 <b>saw</b> <b>last</b> minute {{works on}} the line before the {{scheduled}} inspection by the Board of Trade's Lt.-Col. George Wynne on 22 June. The station at East Grinstead was in its final stages and the line from Three Bridges was ready. Wynne found no fault with the line, requiring only an undertaking from the EGR {{to the effect that}} the line would only be worked by a single engine.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{draw for}} the semi-finals as the {{fixtures}} are pre-determined on a yearly rotation (which {{ensures that the}} provincial champions can only meet once every three years if they win their quarter finals). The pairings <b>saw</b> <b>last</b> years finalists Dublin and Mayo take on Donegal and Kerry respectively. Kerry became {{the first team to}} reach the 2014 final following a win in extra time in a replay at the Gaelic Grounds, while Donegal joined them the following day after seeing off the reigning champions Dublin by six points. The Kerry–Mayo replay was moved to Limerick because Croke Park had been booked for a college American football game between Penn State and UCF.|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time says [...] "It is {{the same}} show you <b>saw</b> <b>last</b> season, the same {{weaknesses}} and strengths intact, but, as it makes clear before the first hour is over, every bit as brutal and sanguinary." [...] According to Sara Smith of The Kansas City Star, [...] "The shock and delight of the showy storytelling ... has faded a bit". Smith says that Barnes, Skorsky, and Goodwin's [...] "investigation sucks them down a rabbit hole into a surreal underworld no sane reporter would explore". Regarding Frank, Smith says [...] "A show can successfully revolve around one man, but a flawless winning streak gets monotonous" [...] and that [...] "it's time for someone to take Frank down a notch".|$|E

500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we <b>saw</b> <b>last</b> season." ...|$|E

Mob brutality, the total loss of respect for human life was sickeningly sad ... What we <b>saw</b> <b>last</b> night and the night before in Los Angeles is not about civil rights. It's not about the great cause of equality that all Americans must uphold. It's not a message of protest. It's been the brutality of a mob, pure and simple." ...|$|E
