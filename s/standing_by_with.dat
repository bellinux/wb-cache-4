25|$|Medieval amulets show a {{variation}} on this iconography, with Abyzou trampled underfoot by a horseman. The rider is identified again either as Solomon or Arlaph; one example depicts the rider as Sisinnios, with the demon named as both Abizou and Anabardalea, and an angel named Araph (for Arlaph) <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>with</b> one raised wing. The medieval lead amulets that show the rider subduing the female often have a main image that resembles a gorgoneion and is likely a womb symbol (hystera).|$|E
500|$|The {{windmill}} was a 60-foot-tall forced-perspective exterior (visible to highway travellers miles away), a {{base and}} rooftop set and a quarter-scale miniature. The {{interior of the}} mill, which was about 30-feet high and 25-feet wide, featured wooden gears equipped with mechanisms for grinding flour. A wider view of the windmill was rendered on a Leavesden soundstage set with a quarter-scale windmill, complete with rotating vanes, painted sky backdrop and special-effects fire. [...] "It was scary for the actors who were having burning wood explode at them," [...] Heinrichs recalled. [...] "There were controls in place and people <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>with</b> hoses, of course, but there's always a chance of something going wrong." [...] For the final shot of the burning mill exploding, the quarter-scale windmill and painted backdrop were erected against the outside wall of the [...] "flight shed", a spacious hangar {{on the far side}} of Leavesden Studios. The hangar's interior walls were knocked down to create a 450-foot run, with a 40-foot width still allowing for coach and cameras. Heinrichs tailored the sets so cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki could shoot from above without seeing the end of the stage.|$|E

60|$|Her colour {{deepening}} by the exertion, {{he suggested}} that she should sit down again {{on one of the}} mossy boulders by the wayside. Nothing loth she did, De Stancy <b>standing</b> <b>by,</b> and <b>with</b> his cane scratching the moss from the stone.|$|R
60|$|Her {{face was}} {{suddenly}} grave. She was <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> his side <b>with</b> her hands loosely clasped behind her, her eyes upturned to his.|$|R
60|$|She shivered {{a little}} as his fingers touched hers, {{although}} her eyes still besought him. The vestiaire was <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>with</b> her lace coat. She rose slowly to her feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, mates," [...] said Long John, who was <b>standing</b> <b>by,</b> <b>with</b> his crutch {{under his}} arm, {{and at once}} {{broke out in the}} air and words I knew so well-- ...|$|E

60|$|The shorter yellow-legs, who {{had been}} <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>with</b> his friend, now made a remark. He evidently remembered Corny, on the Oclawaha steam-boat, {{although}} he had never become acquainted with her or her family.|$|E
6000|$|Stead {{had heard}} quite {{enough to make}} him very uneasy, and wish to get home with his tidings to his father. There was a girl <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>with</b> a baby in her arms, and she asked: ...|$|E

60|$|The other Horners {{who were}} <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> roared <b>with</b> {{laughter}} {{and seemed to}} like their Chief's joke {{as much as he}} did. Scraps thought it was odd that they could be so easily amused, but decided there could be little harm in people who laughed so merrily.|$|R
60|$|But {{he did not}} {{sit there}} long. This was what the soldier had planned for, {{and all the while}} he had been <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>with</b> his feather hat upon his head. Up he raised his foot, and down he set it upon the mouse.|$|E
60|$|It {{was just}} after {{employing}} his faculties in this way that he happened to notice the swelling in my limb. He immediately examined it with the utmost attention, and after doing so, despatched a boy, {{who happened to be}} <b>standing</b> <b>by,</b> <b>with</b> some message.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{coming down}} to dinner to-night," [...] he announced, [...] "and shall hope to find you in your places. What the {{mischief}} are you hanging about for, Brown?"

60|$|If you COULD {{but have}} seen Munseer Anatole! Instead of looking twenty, {{he looked a}} thousand.

6000|$|Yes, {{we were in}} {{the garden}} once more: and, to escape that horrid {{discordant}} voice, we hurried indoors, and found ourselves in the library--Uggug blubbering, the Professor <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>with</b> a bewildered air, and my Lady, with her arms clasped round her son's neck, repeating, over and over again, [...] "and did they give him nasty lessons to learn?
