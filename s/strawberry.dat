The first annual <b>strawberry</b> festival was held in 1932 to celebrate the city's <b>strawberry</b> growing industry, and has only been cancelled during World War II from 1942 to 1945 and a polio outbreak in 1949. The week-long event attracts over 100,000 visitors and is the largest <b>strawberry</b> festival in Washington state. In addition to the Marysville <b>Strawberry</b> Festival, the city holds other annual events, including the Merrysville for the Holidays celebration and grand parade in early December.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Strawberries</b> are non-climacteric fruits {{with a low}} {{respiration}} rate, but {{are subject}} to serious fungal deterioration during postharvest handling. The edible coatings based on chitosan (CH), quinoa protein-chitosan (Q/CH) and quinoa protein-chitosan-sunflower oil (Q/CH/SO) may provide {{a solution to this}} problem. Thus, in this work CH, Q/CH and Q/CH/SO were elaborated and applied to fresh <b>strawberries,</b> and its effect on the <b>strawberries</b> shelf life during storage for 15  d was evaluated by mold and yeast count, fungal decay, carbon dioxide rate, physicochemical properties, and sensory evaluation. Results: On all analysis days, the <b>strawberries</b> coated with the film-forming CH, Q/CH and Q/CH/SO solutions presented a significant lower amount of mold and yeast growth than the uncoated <b>strawberries.</b> Coated <b>strawberries</b> with Q/CH/SO decreased the CO 2 emission rate by 60 % compared to the uncoated <b>strawberries.</b> The color of the <b>strawberries</b> was not influenced by the films. There {{was no significant difference between}} the different coating groups and the uncoated group in the physicochemical parameters.

Research published in 2001 showed that <b>strawberries</b> actually occur in three basic flowering habits: short-day, long-day, and day-neutral.
