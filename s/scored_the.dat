40|$|REBA was {{proposed}} by Hignett and McAtamney {{as a means}} to assess posture for risk of workrelated musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs). Consider critical tasks of a job. For each task, assess the posture factors by assigning a score to each region. The following data sheet provides a format for this process. Areas on the data sheet with a light gray background are for data entry. <b>Score</b> <b>the</b> Group A (Trunk, Neck and Legs) postures and the Group B (Upper Arms, Lower Arms, and Wrists) postures for left and right. For each region, there is a posture scoring scale plus adjustment notes for additional considerations. Then <b>score</b> <b>the</b> Load / Force and Coupling factors. Finally, <b>score</b> <b>the</b> Activity Find <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> from Table A for the Group A posture scores and from Table B for the Group B posture <b>scores.</b> <b>The</b> tables follow the data collection sheet. <b>Score</b> A is <b>the</b> sum of <b>the</b> Table A <b>score</b> and <b>the</b> Load / Force score. <b>Score</b> B is <b>the</b> sum of <b>the</b> Table B <b>score</b> and <b>the</b> Coupling <b>score</b> for each hand. Score C is read from Table C, by entering it with <b>the</b> <b>Score</b> A and <b>the</b> <b>Score</b> B. <b>The</b> REBA <b>score</b> is <b>the</b> sum of <b>the</b> <b>Score</b> C and <b>the</b> Activity <b>score.</b> <b>The</b> degree of risk is found in the REBA Decision table...|$|R
