50|$|LVX also {{contains}} a supposed potexvirus <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> sequence (GGTTAAGTT---GAA) upstream (5’) of the 24 kDa protein. This sequence is also found upstream of initiation codons of coat proteins in similar viruses, most notably lily symptomless virus. Researchers looked at LVX-infected lily leaves and found the presence of subgenomic RNAs. These RNAs were about 2000 and 850 nucleotides in length, which matched up with the presumed subgenomic promoters. From this, {{it was determined that}} they likely function as messengers for both the 24 kDa and 22 kDa proteins (coat protein). In the LVX sequence, there is a region between the 12 kDa ORF and the 22 kDa (coat protein) ORF that is not translated. In other potexvirus sequences, this region contains respective 7 kDa and 11 kDa ORFs; however, in this region of the LVX sequence, there is an uninterrupted reading frame. This reading frame begins at nucleotide position 1236 and ends at position 1646. If this region were to be translated, the protein encoded would be similar to the 7 kDa and 11 kDa proteins mentioned above, ending 18 nucleotides inside of LVX's coat protein ORF. Translation of this LVX ORF does not get translated because the genome is missing an initiation codon.|$|E

40|$|Based {{solely on}} in vitro results, two {{contrasting}} {{models have been}} proposed for {{the recognition of the}} brome mosaic virus (BMV) <b>subgenomic</b> core <b>promoter</b> by the replicase. The first posits that the replicase recognizes at least four key nucleotides in the core promoter, followed by an induced fit, wherein some of the nucleotides base pair prior to the initiation of RNA synthesis (S. Adkins and C. C. Kao, Virology 252 : 1 - 8, 1998). The second model posits that a short RNA hairpin in the core promoter serves as a landing pad for the replicase and {{that at least some of}} the key nucleotides help form a stable hairpin (P. C. J. Haasnoot, F. Brederode, R. C. L. Olsthoorn, and J. Bol, RNA 6 : 708 - 716, 2000; P. C. J. Haasnoot, R. C. L. Olsthoorn, and J. Bol, RNA 8 : 110 - 122, 2002). We used transfected barley protoplasts to examine the recognition of the <b>subgenomic</b> core <b>promoter</b> by the BMV replicase. Key nucleotides required for subgenomic initiation in vitro were found to be important for RNA 4 levels in protoplasts. In addition, additional residues not required in vitro and the formation of an RNA hairpin within the core promoter were correlated with wild-type RNA 4 levels in cells. Using a template competition assay, the core promoter of ca. 20 nucleotides was found to be sufficient for replicase binding. Mutations of the key residues in the core promoter reduced replicase binding, but deletions that disrupt the predicted base pairing in the proposed stem retained binding at wild-type levels. Together, these results indicate that key nucleotides in the BMV <b>subgenomic</b> core <b>promoter</b> direct replicase recognition but that the formation of a stem-loop is required at a step after binding. Additional functional characterization of the <b>subgenomic</b> core <b>promoter</b> was performed. A portion of the promoter for BMV minus-strand RNA synthesis could substitute for the <b>subgenomic</b> core <b>promoter</b> in transfected cells. The comparable sequence from Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV) could also substitute for the BMV <b>subgenomic</b> core <b>promoter.</b> However, nucleotides in the CCMV core required for RNA synthesis are not identical to those in BMV, suggesting that the <b>subgenomic</b> core <b>promoter</b> can induce the BMV replicase in interactions needed for subgenomic RNA transcription in vivo...|$|R

Live, attenuated RUB vaccines have been successfully used in vaccination programs for over 25 years, making RUB an attractive vaccine vector. In this study, such a vector was constructed using a recently devel-oped RUB infectious cDNA clone (Robo). Using a standard strategy employed to produce expression and vac-cine vectors with other togaviruses, the <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> was duplicated to produce a recombinant con-struct (termed dsRobo) that expressed reporter genes such as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the second <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter.</b> However, expression of the reporter genes, as exemplified by GFP expression by dsRobo/GFP virus, was unstable during passaging, ap-parently due to homologous recombination between the subgenomic promoters leading to deletion of the GFP gene.

40|$|Promoter regions {{required}} for minus-strand and subgenomic RNA synthesis have been mapped for several plus-strand RNA viruses. In general, {{the two types}} of promoters do not share structural features even though they are recognized by the same viral polymerase. The minus-strand promoter of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), a plant virus of the family Bromoviridae, consists of a triloop hairpin (hpE) which is attached to a 3 ′ tRNA-like structure (TLS). In contrast, the AMV <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> consists of a single triloop hairpin that bears no sequence homology with hpE. Here we show that hpE, when detached from its TLS, can function as a <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> in vitro and can replace the authentic <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> in the live virus. Thus, the AMV subgenomic and minus-strand promoters are basically the same, but the minus-strand promoter is linked to a 3 ′ TLS to force the polymerase to initiate at the very 3 ′end...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{templates}} of 33 nucleotides {{containing the}} brome mosaic virus (BMV) core <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> {{were used to}} determine the promoter elements recognized by the BMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to initiate RNA synthesis.

Changes to every other nucleotide at these four positions allow predictions for the base-specific functional groups required for RdRp recognition. RdRp contact of the nucleotide at position − 17 was suggested with a template competition assay. Comparison of the BMV <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> to those from other plant and animal alphaviruses shows a remarkable degree of conservation of the nucleotides required for BMV subgenomic RNA synthesis.

In order to generate a Semliki Forest virus (SFV) noncytopathic vector we introduced mutations previously described to turn Sindbis virus noncytopathic into a conserved position in an SFV vector expressing LacZ. Interestingly, mutant P 718 T in replicase nsp 2 subunit was able to replicate in {{only a small percentage}} of BHK cells, producing β-gal-expressing colonies without selection. Puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (pac) gene was used to replace LacZ in this mutant allowing selection of an SFV noncytopathic replicon containing a second mutation in nsp 2 nuclear localization signal (R 649 H). This latter mutation did not confer a noncytopathic phenotype by itself and did not alter nsp 2 nuclear translocation. Replicase synthesis was diminished in the SFV double mutant, leading to genomic and subgenomic RNA levels that were 125 -fold and 66 -fold lower than in wild-type vector, respectively. Interestingly, this mutant expressed β-gal levels similar to parental vector. By coexpressing pac and LacZ from independent <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoters</b> this vector was able to generate stable cell lines maintaining high expression levels during at least 10 passages, indicating that it could be used as a powerful system for protein production in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|A {{reporter}} open {{reading frame}} (ORF) coding for a fusion of bacterial β-glucuronidase (GUS) with a proteinase domain (Pro) derived from tobacco etch potyvirus was utilized for tagging individual genes of beet yellows closterovirus (BYV). Insertion of this reporter ORF {{between the first and}} second codons of the BYV ORFs encoding the HSP 70 homolog (HSP 70 h), a major capsid protein (CP), and a 20 -kDa protein (p 20) resulted in the expression of the processed GUS-Pro reporter from corresponding subgenomic RNAs. The high sensitivity of GUS assays permitted temporal analysis of reporter accumulation, revealing early expression from the HSP 70 h promoter, followed by the CP promoter and later the p 20 promoter. The kinetics of transcription of the remaining BYV genes encoding a 64 -kDa protein (p 64), a minor capsid protein (CPm), and a 21 -kDa protein (p 21) were examined via Northern blot analysis. Taken together, the data indicated that the temporal regulation of BYV gene expression includes early (HSP 70 h, CPm, CP, and p 21 promoters) and late (p 64 and p 20 promoters) phases. It was also demonstrated that the deletion of six viral genes that are nonessential for RNA amplification resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of transcription from one of the two remaining <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoters.</b> Comparison with other positive-strand RNA viruses producing multiple subgenomic RNAs showed the uniqueness of the pattern of closterovirus transcriptional regulation...|$|R
40|$|Numerous RNA viruses {{generate}} subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) for {{expression of}} their 3 *-proximal genes. A major step {{in control of}} viral gene expression is the regulation of sgRNA synthesis by specific promoter elements. We used {{barley yellow dwarf virus}} (BYDV) as a model system to study transcriptional control in a virus with multiple sgRNAs. BYDV generates three sgRNAs during infection. The sgRNA 1 promoter has been mapped previously to a 98 -nucleotide (nt) region which forms two stem-loop structures. It was determined that sgRNA 1 is not required for BYDV RNA replication in oat protoplasts. In this study, we show that neither sgRNA 2 nor sgRNA 3 is required for BYDV RNA replication. The promoters for sgRNA 2 and sgRNA 3 synthesis were mapped by using deletion mutagenesis. The minimal sgRNA 2 promoter is approximately 143 nt long (nt 4810 to 4952) and is located immediately downstream of the putative sgRNA 2 start site (nt 4809). The minimal sgRNA 3 core promoter is 44 nt long (nt 5345 to 5388), with most of the sequence located downstream of sgRNA 3 start site (nt 5348). For both promoters, additional sequences upstream of the start site enhanced sgRNA promoter activity. These promoters contrast to the sgRNA 1 promoter, in which almost all of the promoter is located upstream of the transcription initiation site. Comparison of RNA sequences and computer-predicted secondary structures revealed little or no homology between the three sgRNA promoter elements.

Both approaches yielded VP 6, which retained the ability to form trimers. VP 6 expressed from the <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> assembled into paracrystalline sheets and tubes. Expression as a fusion protein yielded PVX rods that presented an external “overcoat” of VP 6, but unexpectedly, some rotavirus protein also assembled into icosahedral viruslike particles (VLPs).

40|$|Most plant viruses {{rely on the}} {{production}} of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) {{for the expression of}} their genes and survival in the plant. Although this is a widely adopted strategy among viruses, the mechanism(s) whereby sgRNA production occurs remains poorly defined. Turnip yellow mosaic tymovirus (TYMV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus that produces an sgRNA for the expression of its coat protein. Here we report that the <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> sequence of TYMV is located on a 494 -nucleotide fragment, containing previously identified highly conserved sequence elements, which are shown here to be essential for promoter function.

40|$|The minus-strand {{promoter}} of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), a tripartite plant virus {{belonging to the}} family Bromoviridae, is located within the 3 ′-terminal 145 nucleotides (nt), which can adopt a tRNA-like structure (TLS). This contrasts with the <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> for RNA 4 synthesis, which requires ∼ 40 nt and forms a single triloop hairpin. Detailed analysis of the minus-strand promoter now shows that a similar triloop hairpin, hairpin E (hpE), is crucial for minus-strand synthesis. The loop sequence of hpE appeared to not be essential for RNA synthesis, whereas the identity and base-pairing capability of bases below the triloop were indeed essential. Reducing {{the size of the}} bulge loop of hpE triggered transcription from an internal site similar to the process of subgenomic transcription. Similar effects were observed when deleting (part of) the TLS, suggesting that tertiary contacts between hpE and the TLS prevent internal initiation. The data indicate that the minus-strand promoter hpE and the <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> hairpin are equivalent in binding the viral polymerase. We propose that the major role of the TLS is to enforce the initiation of transcription by polymerase at the very 3 ′ end of the genome...|$|E

Considerable changes in the stem and the loop are tolerated for RNA synthesis, including replacement with a different stem-loop. In a template competition assay, the stem-loop and the initiation cytidylate are sufficient {{to interact with the}} CMV replicase.

40|$|Barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (BYDV) -PAV serotype, an {{economically}} important virus of small grain cereals, has a positive-sense RNA genome encoding {{at least six}} open reading frames (ORFs). The goal of the research {{was to determine the}} genes and sequences involved in the viral replication and to design efficient antiviral strategies to BYDV-PAV. Genetically engineered resistance is essential for BYDV as the natural resistance is inadequate. Antiviral constructs such as sense RNA, antisense RNA and viral polymerase gene were tested for their ability to reduce virus titre in oat protoplasts as monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All antiviral constructs yielded low levels of viral antigen. However, none of the above constructs showed decrease in viral RNA accumulation in Northern blot analysis. Deletion and mutation analyses were performed to determine genes and cis-acting signals involved in translation, replication and encapsidation of BYDV-PAV. ORFs 1 and 2, which encode the putative polymerase gene, were required for replication. Deletion of the coat protein (CP) gene reduced the accumulation of genomic RNA. The carboxy-terminally extended form of the CP was not necessary for replication or encapsidation. Cis-acting RNA signals in and around ORF 6 were essential for viral replication. BYDV-PAV replication may be coupled to translation because defective RNAs containing various deletions were not replicated in trans by the co-inoculated wild-type helper genome. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to map the subgenomic RNA 1 (sgRNA 1) <b>promoter</b> because <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoters</b> are putative hotspots of viral recombination and putative replication origin. Mutating the sgRNA 1 transcription initiation base, G at 2670, or the nucleotides immediately flanking it, reduced sgRNA 1 accumulation. Computer-predicted secondary structures in the putative sgRNA 1 promoter regions of many members of subgroup I luteovirus has revealed a conserved stem-loop structure near the sgRNA 1 start site. Altering the conserved ACAAA motif reduced both the genomic RNA and sgRNA 1 accumulation.

These data provide evidence that the RNA can induce RdRps to alter the mode of promoter recognition...|$|E
40|$|IL- 12 {{can enhance}} the {{development}} of effective immune responses against tumors as well as against certain infectious agents. It is therefore a potential candidate for therapeutic use in cancer therapy and {{in the design of}} vaccines against several infectious diseases. Several studies have demonstrated that IL- 12 could efficiently induce tumor regression in animal models. To investigate the antitumor effect of direct gene transfer of human IL- 12 into tumors, human IL- 12 p 35 and p 40 cDNAs were cloned into the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) vector pSFV 1. In order to express the two subunits from the same vector, the p 35 and the p 40 cDNAs were cloned into pSFV 1, each under the control of a <b>subgenomic</b> SFV <b>promoter.</b> Recombinant RNA produced by in vitro transcription of SFV-IL- 12 construct, was packaged into SFV viral particles {{with the use of a}} non-packageable helper RNA. We show that human tumor cell lines infected in vitro in vivo with recombinant SFV-IL- 12 viral particles secrete high levels of biologically active heterodimeric p 35 /p 40 IL- 12, as demonstrated using ELISA and biological assays.

40|$|Alphavirus vectors {{are being}} {{developed}} for possible human vaccine and gene therapy applications. We have sought to advance this field by devising DNA-based vectors and approaches {{for the production of}} recombinant vector particles. In this work, we generated a panel of alphavirus vector packaging cell lines (PCLs). These cell lines were stably transformed with expression cassettes that constitutively produced RNA transcripts encoding the Sindbis virus structural proteins under the regulation of their native <b>subgenomic</b> RNA <b>promoter.</b> As such, translation of the structural proteins was highly inducible and was detected only after synthesis of an authentic subgenomic mRNA by the vector-encoded replicase proteins. Efficient production of biologically active vector particles occurred after introduction of Sindbis virus vectors into the PCLs. In one configuration, the capsid and envelope glycoproteins were separated into distinct cassettes, resulting in vector packaging levels of 107 infectious units/ml, but reducing the generation of contaminating replication-competent virus below the limit of detection. Vector particle seed stocks could be amplified after low multiplicity of infection of PCLs, again without generating replication-competent virus, suggesting utility for production of large-scale vector preparations. Furthermore, both Sindbis virus-based and Semliki Forest virus-based vectors could be packaged with similar efficiency, indicating the possibility of developing a single PCL for use with multiple alphavirus-derived vectors...|$|R
40|$|Sindbis virus (SIN) {{is a small}} positive-strand enveloped RNA {{virus that}} infects {{a broad range of}} {{vertebrate}} and insect cells. A SIN vector (called dsSIN), designed for transient expression of heterologous RNAs and proteins, was engineered by inserting a second <b>subgenomic</b> mRNA <b>promoter</b> sequence into a nonessential region of the SIN genome. By using this vector, dsSIN recombinants have been constructed that express either bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, a truncated form of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA), or mini-genes encoding two distinct immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) HA epitopes. Infection of murine cell lines with these recombinants resulted in the expression of approximately 10 (6) - 10 (7) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polypeptides per cell and efficient sensitization of target cells for lysis by appropriate major histocompatibility complex-restricted HA-specific CTL clones in vitro. In addition, priming of an influenza-specific T-cell response was observed after immunizing mice with dsSIN recombinants expressing either a truncated form of HA or the immunodominant influenza CTL epitopes. This SIN expression system allows the generation of high-titered recombinant virus stocks {{in a matter of days}} and should facilitate mapping and mutational analysis of class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted T-cell epitopes expressed via the endogenous pathway of antigen processing and presentation...|$|R
40|$|Caliciviruses use reinitiation of {{translation}} {{governed by a}} ‘termination upstream ribosomal binding site ’ (TURBS) for expression of their minor capsid protein VP 2. Mutation analysis allowed to identify sequences surrounding the translational start/stop site of the feline calicivirus (FCV) that fine tune reinitiation frequency. A selection of these changes was introduced into the infectious FCV cDNA clone to check the influence of altered VP 2 levels on virus replication. In addition, full length constructs were established that displayed a conformation, in which VP 2 expression occurred under control of a duplicated <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter.</b> Viable viruses recovered from such constructs revealed a rather broad range of VP 2 expression levels but comparable growth kinetics showing that caliciviruses can tolerate gross changes of the VP 2 expression level...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of host-cell nucleic acid-binding proteins with the genomes of positive-stranded RNA viruses {{is known to}} play a role in the translation and replication of many viruses. To date, however, the characterisation of similar interactions with the genomes of members of the Caliciviridae family has been limited to in vitro binding analysis. In this study, feline calicivirus (FCV) and murine norovirus (MNV) have been used as model systems to identify and characterise the role of host-cell factors that interact with the viral RNA and RNA structures that regulate virus replication. It was demonstrated that RNA-binding proteins such as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), poly(C) -binding proteins (PCBPs) and La protein interact with the extremities of MNV and FCV genomic and subgenomic RNAs. PTB acted as a negative-regulator in FCV translation and is possibly involved in the switch between translation and replication during the late stages of the infection, as PTB is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where calicivirus replication takes place. Furthermore, using the MNV reverse-genetics system, disruption of 5 ' end stem-loops reduced infectivity ~ 15 - 20 fold, while disruption of an RNA structure that is suspected to be part of the subgenomic RNA synthesis promoter and an RNA structure at the 3 ' end completely inhibited virus replication. Restoration of infectivity by repair mutations in the <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> region and the recovery of viruses that contained repressor mutations within the disrupted structures, in both the <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> region and the 3 ' end, confirmed a functional role for these RNA secondary structures. Overall this study has yielded new insights into the role of RNA structures and RNA-protein interactions in the calicivirus life cycle. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Genetic RNA {{recombination}} {{plays an}} important role in viral evolution, but its molecular mechanism is not well understood. In this work we describe homologous RNA recombination activity that is supported by a <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoter</b> (sgp) region in the RNA 3 segment of brome mosaic bromovirus (BMV), a tripartite plus-strand RNA virus. The crossover frequencies were determined by coinoculations with pairs of BMV RNA 3 variants that carried a duplicated sgp region flanked by marker restriction sites. A region composed of the sgp core, a poly(A) tract, and an upstream enhancer supported homologous exchanges in 25 % of the analyzed RNA 3 progeny. However, mutations in the sgp core stopped both the transcription of the sgp RNA and homologous recombination. These data provide evidence for an association of RNA recombination with transcription...|$|E
40|$|Plus-strand RNA viruses such as Potato virus X (PVX) {{are often}} used as high-yielding {{expression}} vectors in plants because they tolerate the expression of an extra transgene without disrupting normal virus functions. However, sequence redundancy caused by promoter duplication often leads to genetic instability. The tendency of plant viruses to delete foreign genes is often regarded as a safety advantage, because the transgene would be rapidly lost during infection. Recently, the development of plant viral expression systems has focused on higher biocontainment by deleting unnecessary genes. Additionally, {{there is a growing}} demand for inexpensive vaccines, and plant virus particles or coat proteins are ideal for the presentation of epitopes. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, PVX-based vectors were stabilized by combining heterologous <b>subgenomic</b> <b>promoters</b> (SGPs) from related potexviruses with an N-terminal coat protein (CP) deletion. The SGPs from Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), Cassava common mosaic virus (CsCMV) and Hosta virus X (HVX) were recognized by the PVX replicase. The BaMV SGP combined with an additional N-terminal CP deletion achieved highest vector stability. Furthermore, we aimed to develop a safe production system using a combination of modified vectors based on Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and PVX. High-level expression was achieved with a PVXΔCP vector by agroinfiltration and much better co-expression of different PVXΔCP vectors was possible compared to TMVΔCP vectors. An expression system with TMV-PVX CP-exchange mutants was constructed and systemic infection was only possible if both vectors were inoculated together and thus could mutually complement the CPs. Surprisingly, the complementing pair (PVX-CPTMVΔCP and TMV-CPPVXΔCP) allowed systemic co-infection with additional PVXΔCP vectors. Moreover, hybrid chimeric PVX particles were created by the co-expression of different CPPVX fusions by TMV and PVX vectors. The co-expression of the CPPVX fusions in the same cells was confirmed by epifluorescence microscopy. We used specific antibodies to identify hybrid chimeric particles displaying green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mCherry on their surface. Vector modifications were first tested with fluorescent proteins and the improvements were confirmed with endoglucanase Cel 12 A and the antibody 2 G 12 as a model for the expression of functional multimeric proteins. The yields of antibody 2 G 12 were similar to those reported in earlier publications for this antibody produced in plants. This thesis confirms the first utilization of heterologous SGPs in PVX and provides the first description of systemic co-infection using potexvirus-based vectors. Furthermore, this was the first demonstration of heterologous CPPVX expression in full-sized PVX vectors. When CPPVX was delivered by a TMV-based expression system, the particles assembled with PVX RNA. Two different structures could therefore be displayed on the PVX virion. These developments will allow the further exploitation of plant virus-based expression vectors in planta...|$|R
40|$|In planta {{production}} of recombinant proteins, including vaccine antigens and monoclonal antibodies, continues gaining acceptance. With the broadening range of target proteins, {{the need for}} vectors with higher performance is increasing. Here, we have developed a single-replicon vector based on beet yellows virus (BYV) that enables co-delivery of two target genes into the same host cell, resulting in transient expression of each target. This BYV vector maintained genetic stability during systemic spread throughout the host plant, Nicotiana benthamiana. Furthermore, we have engineered a miniBYV vector carrying the sequences encoding heavy and light chains of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against protective antigen (PA) of Bacillius anthracis, and achieved {{the expression of the}} full-length functional anti-PA mAb at similar to 300 mg/kg of fresh leaf tissue. To demonstrate co-expression and functionality of two independent proteins, we cloned the sequences of the Pfs 48 / 45 protein of Plasmodium falciparum and endoglycosidase F (PNGase F) from Flavobacterium meningosepticum into the miniBYV vector under the control of two <b>subgenomic</b> RNA <b>promoters.</b> Agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana with this miniBYV vector resulted in accumulation of biologically active Pfs 48 / 45 that was devoid of N-linked glycosylation and had correct conformation and epitope display. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the new BYV-based vector is capable of co-expressing two functionally active recombinant proteins within the same host cell...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{replicon}} particles {{derived from}} a vaccine strain of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) were used as a vector for expression of the major envelope proteins (GL and M) of equine arteritis virus (EAV), both individually and in heterodimer form (GL/M). Open reading frame 5 (ORF 5) encodes the GL protein, which expresses the known neutralizing determinants of EAV (U. B. R. Balasuriya, J. F. Patton, P. V. Rossitto, P. J. Timoney, W. H. McCollum, and N. J. MacLachlan, Virology 232 : 114 – 128, 1997). ORF 5 and ORF 6 (which encodes the M protein) of EAV were cloned into two different VEE replicon vectors that contained either one or two 26 S <b>subgenomic</b> mRNA <b>promoters.</b> These replicon RNAs were packaged into VEE replicon particles by VEE capsid protein and glycoproteins supplied in trans in cells that were coelectroporated with replicon and helper RNAs. The immunogenicity of individual replicon particle preparations (pVR 21 -GL, pVR 21 -M, and pVR 100 -GL/M) in BALB/c mice was determined. All mice developed antibodies against the recombinant proteins {{with which they were}} immunized, but only the mice inoculated with replicon particles expressing the GL/M heterodimer developed antibodies that neutralize EAV. The data further confirmed that authentic posttranslational modification and conformational maturation of the recombinant GL protein occur only {{in the presence of the}} M protein and that this interaction is necessary for induction of neutralizing antibodies...|$|R
