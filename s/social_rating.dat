40|$|The {{risk-adjusted}} <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> {{of return}} remains substantially lower for housing than for {{other types of}} investment. Savvy investors allocate their resources across different types of investment to maximize their returns; savvy societies do likewise. Just as with the private sector, society’s returns are maximized when risk-adjusted <b>social</b> <b>rates</b> of return equalize across all types of investment (Auerbach 1983; Hendershott 1987). After all, if these rates of return are not equal, society could increase its income by shifting resources from low-return investments into those with a higher return. Unfortunately, while market arbitrage ensures that risk-adjusted private rates of return equalize, no similar mechanism exists to guarantee that <b>social</b> <b>rates</b> of return do the same. Thus, society may invest relatively too much in some types of capital and relatively too little in others. History suggests that the United States overinvests in housing.

40|$|The present paper compares {{estimates}} of the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return to education for Indigenous Australians with those for non-Indigenous Australians. The <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return measures the net benefits to society of educating its citizens. If education is treated as an investment by society in its people, then Australian society will be made better off {{by an increase in}} educational investment as long as the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return is higher than that for other public investments. This paper provides a discussion of the concept of the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return to education and some estimates for Indigenous Australians. Higher levels of education, in general, lead to an increased probability of finding employment and higher levels of income in employment. Hence, an increased level of education for an Indigenous person would be of advantage in economic terms; the private rate of return to education is likely to be quite high. In addition, we argue that increasing education has important social benefits (so-called 'externalities') for Indigenous people, and society in general: improved education would lead to better nutrition, to better living conditions, to better access to health services, and hence to a longer and healthier life. This means that productivity would be higher for Indigenous people and they would have higher incomes {{over a longer period of}} time. In addition, we argue that improved levels of education have the capacity to contribute to a decrease in the numbers of Indigenous people who are imprisoned, and thus lead to a direct reduction in the costs of imprisonment. Thus, increased education increases the earnings span, decreases prison costs and hence increases the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return. We find that the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return for education is generally higher for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians. This suggests, from a public policy perspective, that government should allocate increased funding for the education of Indigenous people since this <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return is greater than the Department of Finance recommended cut-off rates for government investment projects. ...|$|R

Such people acting as evaluators might have different levels of skill and expertise, sometimes insufficient for evaluating particular content. They may also have various and even biased interests and incentives and consequently cast unfair evaluations. Moreover, several pieces of evidence show that <b>social</b> <b>rating</b> systems have been widely subject to unfair evaluations posted individually or collaboratively to promote or demote particular items based on their personal or group interest and benefits.

We first propose methods for identifying both individual and collaborative unfair evaluators in <b>social</b> <b>rating</b> systems. After analyzing existing collusion detection systems and finding some fundamental limitations when dealing with massive or intelligent collusion attacks, we propose a novel iterative method for collusion detection which helps to solve such problems. This method builds on the idea of detecting the real sentiment of a community of evaluators and using it to robustly evaluate people and content in such a community. To do so, we first present a novel model for reducing a rating task into an election (a voting) activity and then using this technique to detect the sentiment of the community. Our model depends on neither the values of cast evaluations nor their order. We rely on the distributions of cast votes as well as the opinion of the community on the helpfulness of such votes and reviews. In addition to rating products, we use community sentiment along with the voting behavior of people to assess their trustworthiness. Our people evaluation approach employs seven behavioral factors and uses them to distinguish between random voters, genuine users, honest people with low expertise, expert users, etc. We employ a fuzzy logic model to combine these behavioral factors and obtaining one value for trustworthiness of evaluators.

40|$|Most {{discussions on}} the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of {{discount}} have assumed that the economy under consideration is isolated {{from the rest of}} the world, and that there are no capital movements. This paper explicitly analyzes the determination of the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of discount in a small open developing economy. It is shown that under general conditions, the discount rate will bea weighted average of the marginal return to capital in the private sector(p), the rate of time preference (r), and the marginal cost of foreign indebtedness (n). It is also shown that unless the country faces an upward-sloping supply curve for foreign funds the weights of p and r will be zero. Finally, it is shown that if the country in question faces a foreign borrowing constraint imposed from abroad, the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of discount becomes equal to a weighted average of the domestic marginal return to capital and the rate of time preferences. Data for a group of LDCs is then used to show that financial markets have indeed attached a default country risk premium to LDCs. This provides some evidence in favor of the hypothesis that developing countries face an upward-sloping supply curve of foreign funds, and that, in general, the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of discount should be a weighted average of p, r and n. Finally,some numerical examples are used to show that ignoring the open economy aspects can result in a substantial overstatement of the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of discount. ...|$|R
