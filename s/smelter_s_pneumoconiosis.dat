The barrier was constructed and tested above ground at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Pittsburgh Research Laboratory longwall gallery test facility. A 96 -percent reduction of respirable dust occurred at the headgate sampling position when tested at 2. 4 m/sec (480 ft/min).

40|$|Korea has industrialized {{since the}} 1970 <b>s.</b> <b>Pneumoconiosis</b> in coal miners {{was the most}} common {{occupational}} disease in the 1970 s to 1980 s. With the industrialization, the use of many chemicals have increased since the 1970 s. As a consequence, there were outbreaks of occupational diseases caused by poisonous chemicals, such as heavy metal poisoning, solvent poisoning and occupational asthma in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s with civil movement for democracy. Many actions have been taken for prevention by the government, employers and employees or unions. In the 1990 s most chemical related diseases and pneumoconiosis have rapidly decreased due to improving work environment. In the late 1990 s, cerebro-cardiovascular diseases related to job stress or work overloads have abruptly increased especially after the economic crisis in 1998. After the year 2000, musculoskeletal disorders became a major problem especially in assembly lines in the manufacturing industry and they were expanded to the service industry. Mental diseases related to job stress have increased. Infectious diseases increased in health care workers and afforestation workers. Occupational cancers are increasing because of their long latency, although the use of carcinogenic substances are reduced, limited, and even banned...|$|R
40|$|Faced with {{persistent}} and emerging health risks in 2016, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) continued its mission {{to develop and}} transfer into practice new knowledge about occupational safety and health. Challenges NIOSH faced in 2016 included coal worker 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> or black lung disease. Black lung disease cases reached historic lows in the 1990 s after the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act became law in 1969 and was amended in 1977. Recent years, however, have seen rising numbers of current and former coal miners diagnosed with the disease. Other diseases became emerging risks for workers in 2016, including Zika virus and the debilitating lung disease obliterative bronchiolitis, which may be a risk for {{people who work in}} the coffee processing industry. Throughout the year, NIOSH translated these and other research priorities into informative communication and research products, promoting occupational safety and health for all workers.

40|$|Abstract: A {{continuous}} production aluminum <b>smelter</b> produces <b>S</b> tons/day of molten metal which is cast as long cylindrical rods and swan into logs according to customer's specification for the dimensions and {{the composition of}} the logs. Orders for each month are known {{at the beginning of the}} month and have to be met by the end of that month. The rods about L feet long, are cast simultaneously, T rods / unit time and then swan into logs of a variety of order lengths. Meeting demand leads to the over production of order lengths (inventory) and sawing yields unwanted off cuts (scrap) which have to be recycled. The price of aluminum and the competitiveness of the industry mean that inventory and scrap costs have to be minimized while meeting demand. This leads to a multiobjective cutting stock problem which, in its general form, is an integer nonlinear problem. It is considered that the scrap is a fuzzy parameter and a technique for the solution is presented. A practical problem example of the method implementation for the solution algorithm is proposed...|$|R
40|$|We {{quantify}} the theoretical potential for CDM projects to improve energy-efficiency in selected heavy industrial sectors (iron and steel, cement, aluminium, {{pulp and paper}} and ammonia) in China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa and discuss {{the likelihood of the}} potential emission reductions materialising under CDM. Promising project types are: near net shape casting and pulverized coal / natural gas injection in iron and steel, cement blending, changes in aluminium <b>smelter</b> technology from <b>S</b> 6 derberg to prebaked anodes, continuous digestion process in pulp and paper, complete process integration in ammonia production. The total annual emission reduction potential of the iron and steel, cement and aluminium could reach more than 800 million CERs for China, India, Brazil and South Africa. While industrial boiler refurbishment could be widely replicated, reductions per boiler are relatively limited and overall potential is difficult to estimate...|$|R
40|$|Sulphuric acid {{obtained}} as {{a byproduct}} of non-ferrous metal ore smelting is often the mandatory result of stringent environmental policies adopted in the industrialized countries to limit sulphur dioxide emissions. For the primary copper industry in the southwestern U. S., improvement of sulphuric acid marketing and distribution economies is a critical factor. In this thesis, through {{a comparison of the}} European and U. S. sulphuric acid market structure and organization, both the opportunity and the implications of adopting European acid marketing practices are discussed. A more centralized system of acid distribution, as in the European model, if applied to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>smelter</b> acid market, proves to be potentially beneficial for net revenue enhancement. A rationalization of the logistic aspects could substantially reduce acid transportation costs, allow repayment of at least average variable costs of production and improve southwestern smelter acid competitiveness in the domestic markets...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} 60 a of SO 2 {{emissions}} from a Ni-Cu {{plant in the}} Kola Peninsula (Russia) on soil S contents was assessed in podzols under pine forests. Sulphate desorption and the possible delay of acidification reversal was investigated, because the plant will be reconstructed in 2006 with an expected emission reduction of 90 %. Sites were sampled along a pollution gradient in the prevailing wind direction from 1 to 66 km. The investigated podzols stored S mostly in the organic form. The concentrations of total and organic S in soil organic horizons tended to be higher near the smelter but were only weakly correlated with S deposition. No relationship between distance to <b>smelter</b> and <b>S</b> contents was found for the mineral horizons. Sulphate content and desorption behavior were highly variable due to natural variations of texture and extractable Al and Fe contents of the soils. The lack of a clear strong trend with distance from the smelter except in the organic layer indicated that long range transport and diffuse input of SO 4 {{played a major role}} rather than point source impact. It was concluded that biological turnover is most likely the regulating process in these soils and thus low to medium release of SO 4 is expected under decreasing deposition scenarios because organic S was the dominant fraction of total S in all soils.

40|$|Alcan 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>smelter</b> in Kitimat is {{equipped}} with 50 year old technology and is therefore {{close to the end}} of its operating life. A major capital investment will be required sometime in the future, to extend operations at this location. Each year, approximately 1 00 million is spent on sustaining projects and maintenance to support smelter operations. Sustaining projects fall into two categories, one is the replacement or upgrading of existing equipment and the other is the addition of new equipment to meet changing environmental, health and safety regulations. Managing the projects generated by these sustaining expenditures is a challenge for the engineering department. With limited manpower resources, Alcan engineering has to rely on the services of engineering consulting firms. Consulting engineering firms {{play a key role in}} managing these sustaining projects by providing manpower and expertise for all project phases. An isolated location further complicates the availability of support resources for all three major industries operating in Kitimat. Finding a satisfactory solution for both industry and consulting firms is a challenging task. For Alcan, a long term planning strategy cannot be fully developed without consideration and promotion of a long-term business plan...|$|R
40|$|The {{boreal forest}} area around Flin Flon, MB, and Creighton, SK, {{has been the}} site of a metal mining and {{smelting}} complex since the 1930 <b>s.</b> <b>Smelter</b> emissions, coupled with forest logging, forest fires, and subsequent soil erosion, have led to severe vegetation dieback and the development of soils containing a mixture of metals in varying concentrations. In affected areas, existing vegetation typically is stunted. Limestone applications to affected soils have served to increase pH and, in some instances, the vegetation has responded positively; however, in some areas limestone application has failed to restore vegetation, leading to an interest in examining the suitability of other soil amendments to affect revegetation in these areas. Typically revegetation programs focus on aboveground vegetation responses; however, healthy plant growth often is dependent on the presence of an equally healthy soil microbial community. Thus, this study attempted to link revegetation success with responses of the soil microbial community structure to various soil amendments. Two studies were conducted to determine the influence of soil amendments (biochar, municipal and manure compost, glauconite, and an arbuscular mycorrhizal/ectomycorrhizal inoculant) on plant growth and microbial community structure in two soils from the Flin Flon area, classified as containing high and low metal concentrations. The two studies evaluated the growth of boreal forest understory species American vetch (Vicia americana) and tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa) and overstory species jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) after addition of soil amendments, and the subsequent effects on microbial community structure. Greenhouse experiments evaluated plant growth for a period of 8 weeks (understory species) or 19 weeks (overstory species), after which plants were analyzed for changes in biomass and metal accumulation in plant tissue. Soils were analyzed for available metal concentrations, as well as microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and phospholipid fatty acid concentration, which is a measure of microbial community structure. Significant effects were seen on plant growth and microbial community structure due to the metal concentrations in the soil, but no one amendment consistently impacted plant growth or metal uptake, or any measured microbial parameter. The results of this study indicate the variability of plant growth and microbial functioning in soils from the study site, as well as the inherent challenges associated with revegetating heavy metal affected soils, and underline the need for further research on plant growth and microbial community structure at this site...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} {{reciprocal}} relationship between metals and wild-growing macromycetes. An inter-diciplinary approach was {{needed in order}} to reveal, on the molecular level, how these organisms respond to, and are affected by, potentially toxic metals. This was accomplished by applying a selection of techniques from the fields of analytical chemistry and molecular biology. Samples were collected in the years 1998, 2000, and 2002 near two metal smelters: the still active Outokumpu Norzink zinc (Zn) <b>smelter</b> at Odda, <b>S.</b> W. Norway and the former copper (Cu) smelter at Sulitjelma, N. Norway. In the 1998 collection round, reference samples were collected several km from the emission sources. For subsequent rounds of sampling, reference samples were collected from rural areas in Central Norway. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS, flame mode) and high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS) were used to determine cadmium (Cd), Zn, and Cu in soil and fruiting body tissues. Mercury (Hg) was determined in samples collected at Odda and the reference areas in Central Norway, by cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS). Cytosolic compounds were separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC, =gel permeation chromatography) and anion exchange chromatography, and distribution of endogenous metals was investigated by AAS and CVAFS. Parallel runs of samples spiked with the radiotracer 109 Cd were performed to further study binding of Cd to cytosolic components. Cd-binding proteins from the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) were analyzed with respect to amino acid composition, whereas the N terminal amino acid sequence was determined for a Cd-binding protein from the king bolete (penny bun, Boletus edulis). Cd-binding components from cytosolic extracts, separated by SEC, were further separated and characterized by highperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) Cytosolic Cd-binding capacity (CCBC) was determined, to investigate whether increased synthesis of metal-binding compounds is part of the direct defense against metal toxicity in macromycetes. Furthermore, cytosolic extracts of B. edulis were analyzed with respect to activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), two enzymes important in the cellular defense against free radicals. In the same species, heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP 70, a molecular chaperone), as well as concentrations of glutathione (GSHTOT=GSH + 0. 5 GSSG) and free proline were determined. Two markers of oxidative damage to cellular molecules were determined in B. edulis, in order to make possible conclusions about the effectiveness of the defense systems expressed in this species in handling the increased metal toxicity. These markers were frequency of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA and concentration of lipid hydroperoxides. The results showed elevated concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Cu in surface soil close to both smelters. Hg was elevated near the Outokumpu Norzink Zn smelter at Odda (not determined at Sulitjelma, see above). Metal concentrations in fruiting body tissues were more dependent on species-specific accumulation potentials for metals than on metal concentrations in substrate. Determinations of amino acid composition of Cd-binding proteins of A. muscaria, revealed that these compounds do not belong to the metallothionein (MT) family. The same applies to a Cd-binding protein from B. edulis. HPLC-MS demonstrated the presence of phytochelatins (PCs) in B. edulis growing near the Zn smelter at Odda. This is the first report of PCs in a macromycete. CCBC correlated quite well with exposure to Cd, Zn, Hg, and Cu in 42 samples of B. edulis (Spearman’s p< 0. 001 for all four metals). Furthermore, the difference in CCBC between the exposed group (growing near the Zn smelter at Odda) and the reference group was also statistically significant (Mann Whitney’s p< 0. 001), indicating the induction of Cd-binding cytosolic compounds as a response to metal exposure in this species. In 48 samples of B. edulis, expressions of SOD, CAT, and HSP 70 were significantly positively correlated to the degree of exposure (Spearman’s p< 0. 01 for the association between Cd and SOD, p< 0. 001 for all other correlations between SOD, CAT, or HSP 70 on one side and Cd, Zn, Hg, or Cu on the other). These results indicate that toxic effects arising from metal exposure, are not effectively alleviated by direct defense mechanisms (e. g. PCs) alone. GSHTOT correlated negatively with exposure, suggesting that the intracellular pool of GSH is reduced as a result of PC synthesis. Determination of frequency of AP sites and concentration of lipid hydroperoxides in 31 fruiting bodies of B. edulis showed that both damage parameters were significantly elevated in the exposed group (growing near the Zn smelter at Odda) relative to the reference group (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, the two damage parameters correlated significantly positively with exposure to the four metals (p< 0. 05) and with each other (p< 0. 001). From this, it is concluded that although a host of direct and indirect defense mechanisms is induced against metal toxicity in B. edulis, damage to vital cellular components do occur. Dr. philos.
