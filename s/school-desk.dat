It was to be seen not only in parlors, but on the armchair at the Jute Bank, in the gauger's gig, in the Spittal factor's dog-cart, on a shoemaker's form, protruding from Dr. McQueen's tail pocket and from Mr. Duthie's oxter pocket, on Cathro's <b>school-desk,</b> in the Rev. Mr. Dishart's study, in half a dozen farms. Miss Ailie compelled her little servant, Gavinia, to read the Mentor, and stood over her while she did it; the phrase, [...] "this week's," [...] meant this week's Mentor. Yet the secret must be told: only one copy of the paper came to Thrums weekly; it was subscribed for by the whole reading public between them, and by Miss Ailie's influence Tommy had become the boy who carried it from house to house.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{the medical}} care for {{schoolchildren}} in The Netherlands 1796 - 1904 The foundations of the school medical service {{can be found at}} the end of the eighteenth century. In conformity with the ideas of the Enlightenment the middle class wanted their thoughts on virtue, education, health and social welfare put into practice. During the nineteenth century several laws on primary education were enacted that have been of importance to the medical and hygienical care of the schoolchild and its environment. In 1806 an Act on primary education was accepted that was operative until 1857. The most important change, however, was imposed by the Act of 1900 that introduced compulsory primary education. Improvement of the environment in which children were educated, was the main aim of nineteenth century physicians. They devoted themselves to the improvement of the school climate, light, air, ventilation, heat and <b>school-desks</b> and for the schoolchild more bodily exercise and gymnastics in combination with a reduction of lessons and homework. They argued for lessons in hygiene for pupils as well as for teachers, but got few results on these subjects. In the twentieth century the school physician made his entry into the school. From 1904 on physicians were appointed in an increasing number of municipalities. Their work became part of the municipal health services that were founded during these years...|$|R
6000|$|They were by {{no means}} the worst boys who did such things, but only the most thoughtless. Still, there was a public opinion in the Boy's Town which ruled out certain tricks, and gave the boys who played them the name of being [...] "mean." [...] One of these was boring a hole in the edge of your <b>school-desk</b> to meet a shaft sunk from the top, which you filled with slate-pencil dust. Then, if you were that kind of boy, you got some little chap to put his eye close to the shaft, with the hope of seeing Niagara Falls, and set your lips to the hole in the edge, and blew his eye full of pencil-dust. This was mean; and it was also mean to get some unsuspecting child to close the end of an elderwood tube with his thumb, and look hard at you, while you showed him Germany. You did this by pulling a string below the tube, and running a needle into his thumb. My boy {{discovered}} Germany in this way long before he had any geographical or political conception of it.|$|E

Simion's mother, Berta née Berman, later arranged for her own relatives to settle in the new country. They lived in Galați, where Simion and Fima began their schooling, until 1923, then moved to Bucharest. Simion enlisted at the Matei Basarab High School, where he was colleagues with poet Gherasim Luca. Sharing a <b>school-desk,</b> the two became close friends. They also associated with Aurel Baranga, who was in the same school, but slightly younger. Their circle also included female colleagues and admirers, among them Henriette Iacobsohn, future wife of the cartoonist Saul Steinberg, and Amelia Pavel, later an essayist and art historian. Pavel, who vacationed with Simion at Sovata in summer 1930, remembered him as a [...] "nice and well-behaved youth".|$|E
40|$|Ecoinnovation {{strategies}} are increasingly adopted {{to ensure the}} minimization of environmental impacts. Nonetheless, only a comprehensive integrated assessment along the life cycle stages of a product may ensure a robust analysis of {{the benefit of the}} innovation. The object of the present study is the environmental assessment of furniture prototypes produced using certified wood and integrating eco-design criteria in their conception. The aim of the study was twofold: firstly, to evaluate the environmental profile of the furniture, highlighting possible hot-spots of impacts; and secondly, to evaluate the capability of LCA to identify the environmental benefit associated to the adoption of life-cycle management and ecodesign strategies, such as: ensuring short supply chain from raw material to production; using wood coming from certified forests (according to PEFC scheme); and the implementation of ecodesign principles, also associated with green public procurement requirements. Methods LCA has been applied in a case study related to the wood furniture sector in the alpine region of Northern Italy is presented. Every activity was modeled using primary data, related to the inputs and outputs of the processes, provided directly by the designers and by woodworking firms. Input data related to forestry activities and wood extraction were collected and processed in a previous phase of the study. The life cycle of a prototype <b>school-desk</b> from the cradle-to-gate perspective was analyzed. A woodworking plant was examined in detail, dividing the whole manufacturing process into four phases: panels production, woodworking, painting and steel parts processing. The system boundaries included all the activities which take place inside the plant as well as energy inputs, transports and ancillary products used. Results and discussion The results highlighted that the working phases showing the greatest environmental burdens were: the production of solid wood panels and the processing of iron parts. No concerns about chemicals, glues and paints were raised, due to the eco-design principles implemented in the production of the furniture. The choice of a short supply chain allowed for drastic reductions in the impacts associated to long distance transports. Three sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the robustness of results concerning: 1) glue options; 2) drying phase and VOC emissions; 3) transport options. Conclusions This study proves to which extent eco-design criteria implemented in practice improve the environmental performance of products. All positive effects due to decisions taken in school desk design and conception were supported by evidence. JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|E
