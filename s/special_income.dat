60|$|Probably {{it would}} be found best that the payment {{should be made to}} the mother, as the {{administrator}} of the family budget, that its amount should be made dependent upon the quality of the home in which the children are being reared, upon their health and physical development, and upon their educational success. Be it remembered, we do not want any children; we want good-quality children. The amount to be paid, I would particularly point out, should vary with the standing of the home. People of that excellent class which spends over a hundred a year on each child ought to get about that much from the State, and people of the class which spends five shillings a week per head on them would get about that, and so on. And if these payments were met by a <b>special</b> <b>income</b> tax there would be no social injustice whatever in such an unequality of payment. Each social stratum would pay according to its prosperity, and the only redistribution that would in effect occur would be that the childless people of each class would pay for the children of that class. The childless family and the small family would pay equally with the large family, incomes being equal, but they would receive in proportions varying with the health and general quality of their children. That, I think, gives the broad principles upon which the payments would be made.|$|E

Then, when her child is born, there will begin an allowance for its support, and these payments will continue monthly or quarterly, and will be larger or smaller according first to the well-being of the child, and secondly to the need the State may have for children--so long as the children are in their mother's care. All this money for maternity will be the wife's independent income, and normally she will be the house ruler--just as she is now in most well-contrived households. Her personality will make the home atmosphere; that is the woman's gift and privilege, and she will be able to do it with a free hand. I suppose that for the husband's cost in the household the present custom of cultivated people of independent means will continue, and he will pay over to his wife his share of the household expenses....|$|E

While other Tories were forced to flee to Nova Scotia after the war, Honeyman remained in New Jersey.

5000|$|Malena {{identifies}} Tilde to be Enrique's secret girlfriend. Upon realizing this, Malena relentlessly drags {{the young}} lady out of the monastery to confront her regarding the matter. Tilde fails to deny the allegation, thus causing Malena {{to make a big}} scene in front of everybody. The said revelation further heightens up her hatred towards her husband; and on her personal enumeration of all the troubles Enrique caused her, truth has been told that Enrique is in fact Santino's real father. Meanwhile, fed up with his parents’ constant warring, Rico suddenly decides to run away. Upon learning this, Santino together with three of his other friends decide to chase him and convince him to go back home. Enrique, the priests and the children's families mistakenly believe the kids were kidnapped. The children then succeed on convincing the boy but they faced trouble on their way back to town. Aside from being lost {{in the middle of nowhere}} without food and water, Rico ends up being caught in quicksand. On Santino's way to help the poor boy out, he too falls in the trap. Their other friends rescued them, but they haven't returned yet to Bagong Pag-asa. It is also revealed that the place they are in is the hideout of insurgents and criminals. The kids then seek help from someone living in the forests, but it turns out that he is a member of the gang, [...] "Batang Iwahid" [...] (Iwahid Kid). Batang Iwahid is a group of young teenage boys based in the town of San Isidro who rob people and/or kidnap them for ransom. However, they never kill citizens, they are only getting blamed for what the other gangs do. They shoot Enrique while he and the policemen were finding Santino and the other kids; Enrique survives as Santino prays over him while he was with the kidnappers, and the search for the children goes on. Some of the other children were able to be rescued, but Santino was still being held captive. It seems that the rebel group's leader, Froilan, has a <b>special</b> <b>income</b> generating plan for the child. Upon learning this, Enrique hassles the authorities’ search and rescue operation, in order to save their town’s hailed child, and promote his political agenda as well. On the other hand, Malena runs out of town with her son Rico to get Enrique, and her growing love for him, out of her mind once and for all, which immediately infuriates the latter. Santino, however, was then rescued by the police, with Froilan and his men going to jail.|$|E

It is thus established that in the distributions analyzed here, as personal inequality increases, so does inequality between subgroups. This general inequality parameter also governs Lorenz dominance and all quantities in the decomposition of Theil’s mean logarithmic deviation into between-subgroup and within-subgroup components in the Pareto case. Thus, the general inequal-ity parameter captures the ‘‘deep structure’ ’ of inequality. Finally, a whole-distribution graphical tool is introduced for assessing personal and subgroup inequality.

3000|$|Finally, the German social {{insurance}} scheme {{is part of}} a larger context of protections and expectations for worker with disabilities. Germany has a coexisting Disability Classification System (DCS) which is codified in Social Code Book IX (SGB IX) and entitled “Rehabilitation and Participation of Handicapped Workers.” 24 This DCS system identifies citizens with health impairments and assigns them a handicap rating by medically-based impairment categories. Only permanent health impairments lead to a classification. For example, a mild form of Parkinson disease without imbalance issues but “mild motion disorders” yields a disability degree of 30 – 40 [*]% whereas more severe forms of Parkinson lead to degrees of 50 [*]% and above (BMAS, 2009). A person with a rating of 50 [*]% and above is officially classified as “severely handicapped.” 25 The SGB IX then provides disadvantage compensations (Nachteilsausgleich) for severely handicapped people such as: <b>special</b> <b>income</b> tax deductions, the ability to retire two years earlier without deductions, or parking lots for wheelchair users.

American Economic Review, 102 (1) : 504 - 23; 2012) {{presents}} {{evidence against}} {{the existence of}} convergence in global poverty rates despite convergence in household mean income levels and the close linkage between income growth and poverty reduction. We show that this finding is driven by a specification that demands more than simple convergence in poverty headcount rates and assumes a growth elasticity of poverty reduction, which is well-known to accelerate with low initial poverty levels. If we motivate the poverty convergence equation using an arguably superior growth semi-elasticity of poverty reduction, we find highly significant and robust evidence of convergence in absolute poverty headcount ratios and poverty gaps. Relatedly, we show that the results in Ravallion (2012) are driven by the <b>special</b> <b>income</b> growth and poverty dynamics in Central and Eastern European transition economies that started with low initial poverty rates and thus observed a high elasticity of poverty reduction. Once we control for their abnormal poverty dynamics, we again find robust evidence of global convergence in poverty, even in the original specification by Ravallion (2012).

40|$|Social {{scientists}} study {{two kinds}} of inequality: inequality between persons (as in income inequality) and inequality between subgroups (as in racial inequality). This paper analyzes the mathematical connections between the {{two kinds of}} inequality. The paper proceeds by exploring a set of two-parameter continuous probability distributions widely used in economic and sociological applications. We define a general inequality parameter, which governs all measures of personal inequality (such as the Gini coefficient), and we link this parameter to the gap (difference or ratio) between the means of subdistributions. In this way we establish that, {{at least in the}} two-parameter distributions analyzed here, and for the case of two nonoverlapping subgroups, as personal inequality increases, so does inequality between subgroups. This general inequality parameter also governs Lorenz dominance. Further, we explore the connection between subgroup inequality (in particular, the ratio of the bottom subgroup mean to the top subgroup mean) and decomposition of personal inequality into between-subgroup and within-subgroup components, focusing on an important decomposable measure, Theil's MLD, and its operation in the Pareto case. This allows us to establish that all the quantities in the decomposition are monotonic functions of the general inequality parameter. Thus, the general inequality parameter captures the deep structure of inequality. We also introduce a whole-distribution graphical tool for assessing personal and subgroup inequality. Substantively, this work suggests that in at least some societies, characterized by <b>special</b> <b>income</b> distributions, whenever inequality disrupts social harmony and social cohesion, it attacks on two fronts, via subgroup inequality as well as personal inequality...|$|E
