He brings to light the tension between preservation and access: which should be the priority? Are libraries responsible for keeping books whole, for retaining books that may be in danger of falling apart, or are they mandated to do whatever is in their power to increase access to their holdings, possibly moving them to other mediums through methods such as microfilm or digitization, and sometimes destroying them in the process? Baker claims these goals need not conflict: [...] "Why can't we have the benefits of the new and extravagantly expensive digital copy and keep the convenience and beauty and historical testimony of the original books resting on the shelves, where they've always been, thanks to the <b>sweat</b> and <b>equity</b> of our prescient predecessors?"

40|$|Abstract – There are {{a growing}} number of curricular and extra-curricular {{programs}} that focus on developing appropriate technologies {{to address the needs of}} marginalized communities at the Base of the Pyramid (BOP). Technology ventures in developing communities often fail because of disconnects between the designer, the implementer, and the end-user. Finding an optimal distribution of time, money, and sweat across the stakeholders is pivotal to achieving sustainable impact for the communities. The design-space and business-strategy exploration tool described in this paper, the E-Spot canvas, identifies a technology venture’s stakeholders, defines their individual roles, and suggests the forms of equity they might offer to meet the venture’s overarching objectives while fulfilling their own needs. The E-Spot canvas facilitates consensus-building among stakeholders on how to match project requirements with time, money, <b>sweat,</b> and other <b>equities</b> to sustain their project socially, economically, and environmentally. Several case studies that apply the canvas to real-world ventures are discussed. Index Terms – Design space, business strategy, E-Spot canvas, technology-based social entrepreneurshi...|$|R

2500|$|In March 2010, a {{consortium}} of investors led by Rendezvous Sports World (RSW) won a bid for the Kerala-based Kochi Tuskers Kerala franchise. Indian National Congress leader and External Affairs minister Shashi Tharoor was involved in bringing together the various companies in this consortium. At that time, both Modi and Tharoor stated that the minister had no stake in the franchise, and was only facilitating a team for his native state Kerala. On 11 April 2010, when a formal agreement was being signed between BCCI and the Kochi franchise, Modi asked the Kochi representatives about {{the identities of the}} <b>sweat</b> <b>equity</b> holders in the franchise. According to Modi, he received [...] "evasive replies", and subsequently, a call from Tharoor instructing him not to probe the identities of Kochi's stakeholders. One of the <b>sweat</b> <b>equity</b> holders was Sunanda Pushkar, a close friend (and later wife) of Shashi Tharoor. Shortly after the agreement was signed, Modi disclosed the names of Kochi's stakeholders via a tweet. Modi alleged that Pushkar's shares were actually a hidden gift to Tharoor. RSW threatened to sue Modi for violating confidentiality agreement, and claimed that Modi was creating problems for Kochi because he wanted other bidders to win. Tharoor denied that he had any financial stake in the Kochi franchise, and stated that his role was limited to offering [...] "encouragement, blessings and expert advise" [...] to the RSW-led group of bidders. Tharoor argued that {{there was no reason for}} the investors to bribe him, since he had no influence over the auction. Sunanda Pushkar stated that she would give up her stake in the Kochi franchise. Ultimately, Tharoor had to resign as a minister amid allegations of corruption.|$|E
2500|$|Cost-effectiveness, however, is not Habitat for Humanity’s only concern, and {{additional}} benefits {{arise from the}} Habitat model that differentiate it from other low-cost housing. [...] For example, involving volunteers {{in the construction of}} houses not only makes the homes more affordable, but it also builds community understanding, awareness and support for affordable housing and generates revenue for local Habitat organizations. [...] Focusing solely on cost effectiveness also does not address another important aspect—the education and training of the homebuyers. [...] Habitat’s homebuyers are also involved in the construction of their home and the homes of others in the program. Many Habitat organizations also provide training in budget management and other skills. [...] These requirements, known as “sweat equity,” teach low-income homebuyers valuable construction and other skills that help them to maintain their home over the long-term. [...] Another major aspect of Habitat’s program is Habitat’s revolving “Fund for Humanity.” [...] Habitat does not give homes away; rather, in addition to contributing <b>sweat</b> <b>equity,</b> Habitat homebuyers pay an affordable no-profit mortgage based on their ability to pay. [...] These mortgage payments are used to support building additional homes in partnership with low-income families, thus contributing to the sustainability of Habitat’s homebuilding program.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sweat</b> <b>equity</b> is a party's {{contribution}} to a project {{in the form of}} effort and toil, as opposed to financial equity such as paying others to perform the task. <b>Sweat</b> <b>equity</b> has an application in business for example where the owners put in effort and toil to build the business, in real estate where owners can do D.I.Y. improvements and increase the value of the real estate and in other areas such as an auto owner putting in their own effort and toil to increase the value of the vehicle. The term <b>sweat</b> <b>equity</b> explains the fact that value added to someone's own house by unpaid work results in measurable market rate value increase in house price. The more labor applied to the home, and the greater the resultant increase in value, the more <b>sweat</b> <b>equity</b> has been used. The concept of <b>sweat</b> <b>equity</b> was first employed in the United States by the American Friends Service Committee in the Penn Craft self-help housing project beginning in 1937. The AFSC began using the term in the 1950s when helping migrant farmers in California to build their own homes. It is perhaps most popularly associated today with a successful model used by Habitat for Humanity, in which families who would otherwise be unable to purchase a home contribute <b>sweat</b> <b>equity</b> hours to the construction of their own home, the homes of other Habitat for Humanity partner families, or by volunteering to assist the organization in other ways. Once living in their new home, the family then make interest-free mortgage payments into a revolving fund which then provides capital to build homes for other families.|$|E

The use of <b>sweat</b> <b>equity</b> decreases the amount of government funding needed to make affordable units available, and for more complex building skills such as architecture or engineering Homes Not Jails has historically relied on volunteer work. The underlying principle is to have residents do the work on their own housing and greatly reduce the cost of running a large non-profit organization that would contract out or source volunteers to help in construction efforts.|$|E
