5000|$|The {{requirement}} for accurate maps in Australia {{led to the}} development of a control network of Trig stations. The word [...] "trig" [...] is short for trigonometric. Trig stations can be located on landmarks such as hills or high man-made structures such as buildings, or grain silos or water reservoirs. The process of triangulation was used as the method to provide the locations of the trig stations, which were then used to connect to smaller scale surveys or for mapping.The geodetic infrastructure in New South Wales incorporates approximately 6,000 traditional trigonometric stations that formed the backbone of the <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> network before the introduction of more than 160 CORSnet-NSW stations.TP5865 - Collaroy Trig station is located on top of the heritage Collaroy Reservoir.|$|E
5000|$|The {{position}} of surveyor-general {{was created in}} the royal instructions of 1840. The first regulations for surveying were established in 1842, when surveyors were required to deposit their licenses with the surveyor general's office to be returned upon completion of a survey. In 1852, provinces were established and each established a survey department. These were often underfunded and most failed to systemise surveys in their territory, making boundaries unreliable because of gaps and overlaps between abutting surveys. Some small triangulation networks were established, and some cities established <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> points on routes known as standard traverses that surveyors could use as a basis for local surveys. In Otago, true north was determined at six points throughout the province. Local surveys could be linked to these points so that their angle measurements were consistent throughout the district. The districts were known as meridional circuits, a term that has persisted in New Zealand surveying.|$|E
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} recent {{trends in the}} {{placement}} of permanent survey marks in Queensland, and reviews suitable methods of connecting cadastral surveys to these marks. Many organisations utilising land information now require more accurate spatial data for their operation. This necessitates the cadastre being accurately connected to the geodetic mapping system which means coordination of land boundaries. To achieve the above aim an overall review of the existing <b>Survey</b> <b>Control</b> Database (SCDB) has been made, both {{in the field and}} related to the various directions given to Surveyors. The <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> infrastructure of two areas in South East Queensland has also been analysed. The methods employed in the past for connection of surveys will be analysed to develop the most suitable and cost effective method for today. The initial results show that to provide suitable and efficient connections between the <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> and land boundaries, there must be appropriate regulations and shared responsibility between surveyors and Local Authorities. A major consideration in applying new regulations is the cost and the expected timeframe for results to take effect...|$|E

The results remain consistent when the model is reestimated and the change in the probability at the mean of the independent variable is calculated. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{existing}} <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> infrastructure is paramount {{to the work}} carried out by surveyors when undertaking many projects. Due to the limited availability {{of existing}} <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> infrastructure throughout regional Australia; surveyors require a means to obtain coordinates in the relevant national datum. The method routinely used by surveyors in Australia involves recording GNSS observations and submitting these observations to a free online service GNSS postprocessing service run by Geoscience Australia- AUSPOS. The accuracy of AUSPOS has been investigated through {{a limited number of}} research papers. This project investigates the performance of AUSPOS and other on-line GNSS post-processing services that are available internationally: CSRS-PPP, SCOUT, AUTO GIPSY and OPUS. The performance of the services is investigated in two different respects. Firstly a comparison of the on-line postprocessing services by analysis of the results obtained from each service from identical input data. Secondly, the post processing services are also evaluated in terms of the positional accuracy expected when using any of the on-line GPS services, in relation to existing <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> infrastructure. It was found that the differences between the services AUSPOS, SCOUT and CSRS-PPP are negligible when compared to the residual difference to a known <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> mark. Trends in the consistency of the processed coordinates showed that baseline processing services were marginally more accurate than the PPP processing services, although the inconsistent results of GIPSY may have contributed to this trend. It was found that the accuracy of the processed solutions of each of the services did not significantly improve with observations longer than 4 hours. The accuracy of coordinates in relation to existing control marks is found to be in the order of 2 - 3 cm in the horizontal component and 100 - 150 mm in the vertical component. ...|$|E

40|$|Cadastral {{surveying}} {{is concerned}} with the process of gathering evidence in the form of position information that is used to define the location of objects or land boundaries for the purposes of identifying ownership and/or the value of land parcels. The advent of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), has revolutionised the way 3 -dimensional positions are determined and GPS surveying techniques, particularly Real Time Kinematic (RTK), are increasingly being adopted by cadastral surveyors. This paper presents a methodology for using RTK GPS observations to improve the existing cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> infrastructure, based on an extensive survey carried out in New South Wales, Australia.

40|$|To update {{a portion}} of an {{existing}} cartographic database, the common practice is to relate the new data file to the existing file by means of <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> points that are included in both files. In {{the absence of such}} <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> points, well-defined points such as building corners can be used. This paper presents an algorithm to perform recognition of common buildings represented as vector data. The algorithm starts with a Fourier-based initial matching. A sequence of validity checks combined with robust estimation provides a complete recognition of common buildings. The two maps may have different scales, different coordinate systems, and no identifying cartographic labels. Experimental results have demonstrated the robustness of the algorithm. 1 INTRODUCTION This paper presents an algorithm for the automatic updating of existing digital cartographic data files by the recognition of common polygonal features, such as buildings, in the two files.
