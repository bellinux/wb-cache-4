Siena Barnes, Amanda Benson, Anna Boggon, Andy Cohen, Ann Course, Marnie Clark Course, Emily Glass, Keran James, Max Mason, Gill Ord, Kay Walsh, Rosie West, Mandy Worster Places exist as talismanic {{for the artist}} – the studio of course, the retreat, the mountain, the street, the cave… the interface between the artist and artifice. Where is the subject found,where the ‘elsewhere’ that haunts us? The context changes whatever it includes; inelegant Moses, stumbling after the words he lacks, falls prey to suave Aaron who can betray the truth in making it more comprehensible. <b>Secondary</b> <b>shadows</b> can falsify the ideal… There are slogans, defiant stands are taken, or comfort in the (un) familiar. Always a dialogue with oneself hoping someone is listening in – the cave echoes with voices...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a fast GPU-based {{algorithm}} for ray-tracing point-based models, which includes an efficient computation of <b>secondary</b> and <b>shadow</b> rays, contrary to previous work which supported ray-surface intersections for primary rays only. Volumetric effects {{are added to the}} models by means of scattered data interpolation in order to combine point-based surface and volume rendering in the same scene. This allows us to obtain effects such as refraction within volumetric objects. The flexibility of our method is demonstrated by combining shadows, textured objects, refraction and volumetric effects in the same scene comprised uniquely by point sets.

5000|$|Convergence is {{the process}} of {{controlling}} the CRT beam deflection to keep the red, green and blue beams properly overlapped when scanning the raster (area illuminated by the scan lines on a CRT). As the electron gun scans across the screen, the shape of electron beams slightly varies as the beam reaches the outer edges of the screen. Misconvergence, the technical term used when this process is not completely accurate, appears as color fringing on the edge of an image displayed on the screen. For example, a CRT monitor with misaligned electron beams will show a white [...] "H" [...] on a black background with one of the primary or <b>secondary</b> colors <b>shadowing</b> its edges. Cromaclear provides deterrents to misconvergence, including the ELA guns and their tight mask pitch.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the presidential}} {{election}} of 2008, Carle argued in an influential Washington Post article that Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, had overstated the threat of “radical Islamic extremism." [...] Carle wrote that jihadists are “small, lethal, disjointed and miserable opponents” and that “We do not face a global jihadist [...] "movement" [...] {{but a series of}} disparate ethnic and religious conflicts involving Muslim populations, each of which remains fundamentally regional in nature and almost all of which long predate the existence of al-Qaeda.” He went on to say, [...] "Osama bin Laden and his disciples are small men and <b>secondary</b> threats whose <b>shadows</b> are made large by our fears." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for {{interactive}} rendering general procedurally defined functionally represented (FRep) objects using the acceleration with graphics hardware, namely Graphics Processing Units (GPU). We obtain interactive rates by using GPU acceleration for all computations in rendering algorithm, such as raysurface intersection, function evaluation and normal computations. We compute primary rays as well as <b>secondary</b> rays for <b>shadows,</b> reflection and refraction for obtaining high quality of the output visualization and further extension to ray-tracing of FRep objects. The algorithm is well-suited for modern GPUs and provides acceptable interactive rates with good quality of the results. A wide range of objects can be rendered including traditional skeletal implicit surfaces, constructive solids, and purely procedural objects such as 3 D fractals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMetaballs [Bloomenthal 1997] are {{effective}} to represent fluids and similar complex and deformable geometries, but their implicit nature makes difficult their visualization in real time. A common {{strategy is to}} tessellate the resulting isosurface and to render it on GPU, but it scales poorly {{as the number of}} metaballs increases. Kanamori et al. [2008] efficiently raycast thousands of metaballs without intermediate representations. Their method assumes that rays are shot from a single viewpoint, thus preventing <b>secondary</b> effects (no <b>shadows,</b> reflections, etc.), and is limited to polynomial density functions. We propose to exploit the culling capacity of dynamic bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) [Wald 2007], the secant method for ray-surface intersection, and CPU-GPU parallelism to alleviate the restrictions of their method. This results in a general raytracing method, allowing arbitrary ray intersection (visibility, shadow, reflection, refraction, etc.) with metaballs of any finite-support at interactive performances...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{a banking}} model of {{maturity}} transformation in which regulatory arbitrage induces the coexistence of regulated commercial banks and unregulated shadow banks. We derive three main results: First, the relative {{size of the}} shadow banking sector determines {{the stability of the}} financial system. If the shadow banking sector is small relative to the capacity of <b>secondary</b> markets for <b>shadow</b> banks' assets, shadow banking is stable. In turn, if the sector grows too large, it becomes fragile: an additional equilibrium emerges that is characterized by a panic-based run in the shadow banking sector. Second, if regulated commercial banks themselves operate shadow banks, a larger shadow banking sector is sustainable. However, once the threat of a crisis reappears, a crisis in the shadow banking sector spreads to the commercial banking sector. Third, in the presence of regulatory arbitrage, a safety net for banks may fail to prevent a banking crisis. Moreover, the safety net may be tested and may eventually become costly for the regulator...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo (MC) {{ray-tracing}} for photo-realistic rendering {{often requires}} hours to render a single image {{due to the}} large sampling rates needed for convergence. Previous methods have attempted to filter sparsely sampled MC renders but these methods have high reconstruction overheads. Recent work has shown fast performance for individual effects, like soft shadows and indirect illumination, using axis-aligned filtering. While some components of light transport such as indirect or area illumination are smooth, they are often multiplied by high-frequency components such as texture, which prevents their sparse sampling and reconstruction. We propose an approach to adaptively sample and filter for simultaneously rendering primary (defocus blur) and <b>secondary</b> (soft <b>shadows</b> and indirect illumination) distribution effects, based on a multi-dimensional frequency analysis of the direct and indirect illumination light fields. We describe a novel approach of factoring texture and irradiance {{in the presence of}} defocus blur, which allows for pre-filtering noisy irradiance when the texture is not noisy. Our approach naturally allows for different sampling rates for primary and secondary effects, further reducing the overall ray count. While the theory considers only Lambertian surfaces, we obtain promising results for moderately glossy surfaces. We demonstrate 30 x sampling rate reduction compared to equal quality noise-free MC. Combined with a GPU implementation and low filtering over-head, we can render scenes with complex geometry and diffuse and glossy BRDFs in a few seconds. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

60|$|Hence shadows are in reality, {{when the}} sun is shining, the most {{conspicuous}} thing in a landscape, next to the highest lights. All forms are understood and explained chiefly by their agency: the roughness of the bark of a tree, for instance, is not seen in the light, nor in the shade: it is only seen between the two, where the shadows of the ridges explain it. And hence, if we have to express vivid light, our very first aim must be to get the shadows sharp and visible; and this is not to be done by blackness, (though indeed chalk on white paper is the only thing which comes up to the intensity of real shadows,) but by keeping them perfectly flat, keen, and even. A very pale shadow, if it be quite flat--if it conceal the details of the objects it crosses--if it be gray and cold compared to their color, and very sharp edged, will be far more conspicuous, and make everything out of it look a great deal more like sunlight, than a shadow ten times its depth, shaded off at the edge, and confounded with the color of the objects on which it falls. Now the old masters of the Italian school, in almost all of their works, directly reverse this principle: they blacken their shadows till the picture becomes quite appalling, and everything in it invisible; but they make a point of losing their edges, and carrying them off by gradation; in consequence utterly destroying every appearance of sunlight. All their shadows are the faint, secondary darknesses of mere daylight; the sun has nothing whatever to do with them. The shadow between the pages of the book which you hold in your hand is distinct and visible enough, (though you are, I suppose, reading it by the ordinary daylight of your room,) out of the sun; and this weak and <b>secondary</b> <b>shadow</b> is all that we ever find in the Italian masters, as indicative of sunshine. Even Cuyp and Berghem, though they know thoroughly well what they are about in their foregrounds, forget the principle in their distances; and though in Claude's seaports, where he has plain architecture to deal with, he gives us something like real shadows along the stones, the moment we come to ground and foliage with lateral light, away go the shadows and the sun together. In the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca, in our own gallery, the trunks of the trees between the water-wheel and the white figure in the middle distance, are dark and visible; but their shadows are scarcely discernible on the ground, and are quite vague and lost in the building. In nature, every bit of the shadow would have been darker than the darkest part of the trunks, and both on the ground and building would have been defined and conspicuous; while the trunks themselves would have been faint, confused, and indistinguishable, in their illumined parts, from the grass or distance. So in Poussin's Phocion, the shadow of the stick on the stone in the right-hand corner, is shaded off and lost, while you see the stick plain all the way. In nature's sunlight {{it would have been the}} direct reverse--you would have seen the shadow black and sharp all the way down, but you would have had to look for the stick, which in all probability would in several places have been confused with the stone behind it.|$|R
40|$|A 56 -year-old {{white male}} present to Emergency Department with severe watery {{diarrhea}} and abdominal pain for 24 hours. Sudden onset of diffuse cramping pain began {{a few hours}} after eating freshly bought ham, cheese, and hamburger. No prior history of similar pain was noted. Patient had associated nausea, but denied vomiting, fever or chills. He has significant medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 with neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and foot amputation. Other significant issues include hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, and hypertension (HTN). On physical examination, patient was found to be hypotensive with BP of 60 / 44. On abdominal examination, non-specific right upper quandrant (RUQ) pain was elicited on deep palpation. Initial CBC revealed elevated WBC of 21. 3 K/mm 3 with bands of 8 %. BMP showed hyponatremia with indication of volume depletion. Other labs were total bilrubin 0. 9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0. 5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 91 units/L, ALT 12 units/L, AST 17 units/L and amylase 35 units/L. RUQ ultrasound showed distended gallbladder and <b>shadowing</b> <b>secondary</b> to pneumobilia with no stones. Thickening of gallbladder wall with peri-cholecystic fluid was suggestive of acute acalculous cholecystitis and pneumobilia. CT of abdomen revealed pneumobilia and moderate gallbladder distention. It was difficult to assess Murphy's sign due to patient's body habitus. Open cholecystectomy revealed gangrenous gallbladder with localized infection and inflation consistent with emphysematous cholecystitis. Culture result of surgical specimen grew C. perfringens as primary pathogen...|$|R
