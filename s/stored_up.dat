25|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} an {{modernization}} of the upstream logistics. A breakthrough occurred when it was established that lumber {{did not have to}} be air-dried for two years before being made to pulp, freeing up a storage site at Veden which had <b>stored</b> <b>up</b> to one million logs. Trucks were introduced in transport and hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles) of lumber roads were built to ease extraction. For instance they were used to truck lumber from Store Le to Øymarkasjøen, thus closing the Otteeid Canal. Increased lumber demand was covered through procurement from Värmland and the Glomma watershed. Log driving was eliminated on tributaries and limited to the main course of Haldenvassdraget.|$|E

500|$|Merit is a [...] "beneficial and {{protective}} force which extends {{over a long}} period of time" [...] (B.J. Terwiel)—and is the effect of good deeds ( [...] , [...] ) done through physical action, words, or thought. As its Pāli language (the language of Theravada Buddhism, as practiced in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, etc.) definition indicates, this force is associated with goodness and purity of mind. In traditional Buddhist societies, it is believed that merit is more sustainable than that of magical rites, spirit worship or worldly power. The way merit works, is that acts of merit bring good and agreeable results, whereas demeritorious acts bring bad and disagreeable results. A mixture of the two generates mixed results in a person's life. This [...] (...) or [...] "automatic cosmic reaction" [...] (Brokaw) is a common idea found in Buddhist texts and Buddhist societies, and explains why people are different and lead different lives in many ways. Karma is self-regulatory and natural: it operates without divine intervention and human intention is fundamental to it. Internally, merit makes the mind happy and virtuous. Externally, present good circumstances, such as a long life, health and wealth, as well as the character and abilities someone is born with, arise from merits done in the past and vice versa, with demerits. The merits and demerits a person has done may take a while to bear fruit. Merit or demerit may cause a good or bad future respectively, including in the next lives to come. A bad destination after rebirth may be caused by demerit, but merely a lack of merit may also lead a person to be born in an unhappy destination. When someone is reborn in a happy destination, however, one can only stay there as long as merits last. Thus, it is stated in the Tipiṭaka that people cannot take anything with them when they die, except for whatever merit and demerit they have done, which will affect their future. Merit can be accumulated in different quantities, and <b>stored</b> <b>up,</b> but also has an impermanent character: it can run out. Summarizing from the Buddhist text Milinda Pañhā, some scholars conclude that merit is inherently stronger than demerit. Moreover, many merits together have the power to prevent demerits from having an effect, by pushing them [...] "to the back of the queue" [...] (Richard Gombrich), though demerits can never be undone.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph's Granaries is a {{designation}} for the Egyptian pyramids {{often used}} by early travelers to the region. [...] The {{notion of a}} granary (horreum, [...] ) being associated with the Hebrew patriarch Joseph derives from the account in Genesis 41, where “he gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty {{in the land of}} Egypt, and <b>stored</b> <b>up</b> food in the cities ... And Joseph <b>stored</b> <b>up</b> grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured” (vv. 48-9, RSV). “So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses ( [...] Vulgate, [...] LXX) ("storehouses"); see J. Skinner, [...] and sold to the Egyptians”(v. 56). [...] Similarly, in the Quran: [...] "(Joseph) said: 'Give me charge of the granaries (...) of the land. [...] I shall husband them wisely'" [...] (12:55). [...] The designation was used throughout the Middle Ages and only really abated in the Renaissance when travel to the region became easier and closer investigation revealed the implausibility of the structures serving as storehouses for foodstuffs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were known}} for their poor pitch handling characteristics. The famous aerodynamicist Irv Culver told Albatross owner Jeff Byard that the problem came from three sources. First, the rotation axis of the all flying horizontal tail was located at 35% chord instead of slightly {{in front of the}} aerodynamic center at 25% chord. [...] Second, the horizontal tail rotation hinge had high friction. Third, the relatively soft pitch axis cable control system stored elastic energy reacting the friction in the tail hinge. As the pilot tried to input pitch controls into the unstable tail, the friction of the tailplane hinge prevented initial movement which then <b>stored</b> <b>up</b> energy in the control cables. The pilot then applied more force to get the desired reaction. Eventually, the high friction would break loose and the horizontal tail would move much farther than desired due to the higher than necessary force applied by the pilot and releasing the force in the control cables. The resulting over control often resulting in PIO and when near the ground would likely damage the aircraft. [...] Culver instructed the owner to move the hinge axis forward to 24.5%, add a downspring to the pitch control, and liberally lubricate the hinge axis before each flight to reduce friction. According to Byard, the plane flies significantly better with the improvements.|$|E
