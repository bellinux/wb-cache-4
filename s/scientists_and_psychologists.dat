50|$|Affect is {{considered}} by some social <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> to be a critical building block of feelings and emotions in both conscious and non-conscious states. Some argue that affect is pre-cognitive and some contend that affect is post-cognitive, based on likes, dislikes, preferences, and sensation. Affect is also a factor in emotional development, mood, arousal, and consideration of the present moment.|$|E
50|$|Virtual Reality offers social <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> a {{cost-effective}} tool {{to study and}} replicate interactions in a controlled environment. In addition, virtual reality enables {{a new form of}} perspective-taking by allowing an individual to embody the form of a virtual avatar. Research in this area suggests that embodying another being presents a very different experience from solely imagining one's self as a form. Researchers have used the immersion of virtual reality to investigate how digital stimuli can alter human perception, emotion and physiological state, and how digital interaction can enact social change in the physical world.|$|E

She saw this {{as a key to}} a child's future happiness and well being. Her earliest research led her to identify 4 main personality types in 1917: meditative types, spontaneous types, executive types, and sociable types, which later developed into the MBTI terms Ixxx, ExxP, ExTJ, and ExFJ. [...] However, while investigating the works of various philosophers, <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists,</b> she was unable to identify one definitive theory of type that encompassed all aspects. From the lack of findings, she decided to begin to distinguish her own theory of type.|$|E

50|$|Humans learn, {{think and}} work in {{completely}} different ways. Therefore {{the first step in}} the development of a user interface is to analyze the users, their tasks and their work environment in order to identify the requirements and needs of these users. This step forms the basis for a user- and task-oriented user interface. Both humans and machines are considered as interaction partners. The analysis of the users and their behavior employs different methods like e.g. structured interviews, observations, card sorting etc. They should give a preferably complete image of the working task, the various groups of users and their working environment. To use these methods several professional experts, e.g. engineers, computer <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> should be involved. Especially in the analysis phase, task models are generated for documentation and user interface generation, which implicitly contains a function model of the process and/or of the machine (Meixner and Goerlich, 2008).|$|E

At the same time, Tal is conflicted over how he can be [...] "disturbed by gruesome imagery showcased in the news, but thrives on blood and guts found in movies, books, music, graphic novels and video games" [...] and as such sets out to try to find how horror affects his mind.

5000|$|One {{possible}} origin is {{the reserve}} energy theories by Harvard psychologists William James and Boris Sidis in the 1890s who tested the {{theory in the}} accelerated raising of child prodigy William Sidis; thereafter, James told audiences that people only meet a fraction of their full mental potential, which is a plausible claim. In 1936, American writer Lowell Thomas summarized this idea (in a foreword to Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People) by adding a falsely precise percentage: [...] "Professor William James of Harvard {{used to say that}} the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability". This book was not the first to use the 10 percent figure, which was already circulating within the self-help movement before then; for example, the book Mind Myths: Exploring Popular Assumptions About the Mind and Brain includes a chapter on the ten percent myth that shows a self-help advertisement from the 1929 World Almanac with the line [...] "There is NO LIMIT to what the human brain can accomplish. <b>Scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> tell us we use only about TEN PERCENT of our brain power." ...|$|E

50|$|Boys marry at 15 {{years of}} age or less in 10 percent of 58 societies. Another 42 percent marry between 16 and 19 {{years of age}}. Thirty-eight percent marry in their twenties, and 10 percent marry when they are 30 years of age. (Ayer) <b>Scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> made a {{discovery}} in 1963 that in traditional societies, boys and girls have usually begun to do serious work well before they reach puberty. Girls are often doing womanly work at a certain age: cooking, weaving, gardening, and taking care of their siblings from the age of six to the age of nine. Some girls have to do these chores at an even earlier age like three or four. Boys on the other hand, learn how to farm, herd, and hunt before they reach manhood. Some mothers and fathers attempt to let their children to choose their potential loved ones. However, about 70% of decisions regarding marriage of children are made by their parents. Parents who fail to marry a child at the proper age are thought to be neglecting their responsibilities. These parents usually have their reputations ruined. Across cultures, females tend to be married earlier than males. Boys are married later than girls in 85 percent of 45 cultures. In the remaining 15 percent, both sexes marry at a roughly the same age. The differential in age of marriage for males and females is from one to five years in 78 percent of 37 societies and between six and ten years in another 18 percent.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, moral {{philosophers}} have {{distinguished between}} doing and allowing harm, and have normally proceeded {{as if this}} bipartite distinction can exhaustively characterize all cases of human conduct involving harm. By contrast, cognitive <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> studying causal judgment have investigated the concept ‘enable’ as distinct from the concept ‘cause’ and other causal terms. Empirical work on ‘enable’ and its employment has generally not focused on cases where human agents enable harm. In this paper, we present new empirical {{evidence to support the}} claim that some important cases in the moral philosophical literature are best viewed as instances of enabling harm rather than doing or allowing harm. We also present evidence that enabling harm is regarded as normatively distinct from doing and allowing harm when it comes to assigning compensatory responsibility. Moral philosophers should be exploring the tripartite distinction between doing harm, allowing harm, and enabling harm, rather than simply the traditional bipartite distinction. Cognitive <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> studying moral judgment, who have so far largely adopted the bipartite distinction in this area of research, should likewise investigate the tripartite distinctio...|$|E

This article argues for a renewed behavioural economic geography that builds on research in behavioural economics but also addresses one of its main shortcomings: a lack of engagement with the social context of decision-making.

This paper draws on the UK ‘pensions crisis ’ to argue that geographical approaches can enrich the behaviouralist understanding of economic decision-making by insisting on the importance of context. The paper sets out a research agenda that bridges the gap between economics and economic geography in the area of decision-making and invites methodological innovation to meet the challenge of taking context seriously...|$|E
