5|$|In {{the music}} video, {{it begins with}} an {{out-of-focus}} view of Wade, <b>seemingly</b> alone, coming up a hill towards the camera. When he stops and starts singing, the camera comes into focus and the other band members come out from behind him and start lip-synching his vocals. A group of people (In which {{one of them is}} YouTube star, Wendy McColm) pull up in cars and they also lip-synch the song, in addition to performing other activities throughout the video. The video's effects allow people to <b>seemingly</b> appear out of nowhere throughout the video.|$|E

5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow <b>seemingly</b> maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E
5|$|After Gabe {{eliminates}} Benton, he saves Phagan from assassination only to {{have him}} escape. Mara Aramov, now in custody, had attempted to locate PharCom's virus labs.

5|$|Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially {{received}} in Spain and Rome, {{it happened at}} a time when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity.

Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy <b>seemingly</b> ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.|$|E
5|$|As {{the quarter}} {{came to an}} end, the Hokies gained two quick first downs and {{advanced}} the ball 26yards, <b>seemingly</b> having regained the momentum lost with the blocked kick. With onequarter remaining in the game, however, Kansas still had a three-point lead, 1714.|$|E

5|$|Compared to the {{original}} source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, <b>seemingly</b> less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald. The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including misaligning the joining of {{the contours of the}} waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of white space.|$|E

5|$|He <b>seemingly</b> {{rejected}} {{some aspects}} of van Eyckian realism, notably in his depictions of shadows, and his unwillingness to apply transparent glazes. As a colourist, Lochner was more inclined towards the International Gothic style, even if this inhibited realism. He did not utilise the newly developed Netherlandish techniques of representing perspective, but rather indicated distance through the diminution of parallel objects.|$|E
5|$|He {{was finally}} able {{to gain access to the}} Adriatic by {{capturing}} Lissus and its <b>seemingly</b> impregnable citadel, after which the surrounding territories surrendered. Perhaps the capture of Lissus rekindled in Philip hopes of an Italian invasion.

5|$|In places, the <b>seemingly</b> at odds {{architectural}} styles can {{be viewed}} simultaneously; this is particularly so in the chimney stacks which resemble Islamic minarets.
