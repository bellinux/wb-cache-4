50|$|Upon his {{returning}} to Sarawak, the rebellion against Brunei's rule {{was still in}} progress. He managed to completely suppress the rebellion and pardoned the rebels for joining his side, providing positions in some administrative authority while limiting their power. Despite the initial refusal of Hashim to pardon them and wanting to execute all the rebels, Hashim was convinced by Brooke to forgive them as {{he had taken the}} major part in their <b>supression.</b> In exchange for Brooke's continuous support towards the Sultanate and rental payment of £500, he was awarded the Kuching area from the Sultanate of Brunei; which later became Sarawak First Division. Hashim, however, began to think twice about giving the territory to Brooke, a doubt fanned by Mahkota who had been deprived of his power in the area in favour of Brooke. This led Hashim to constantly delay the recognition of concession and angered Brooke. On 24 September 1841, Brooke, with Royalist fully armed, went ashore to Hashim's audience chamber and called on him to negotiate. With little choice, and putting the blame mainly on Mahkota, Hashim proclaimed Brooke as the Rajah. Brooke issued new laws for the territory banning slavery, headhunting and piracy; and by July 1842, his appointment was confirmed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II.|$|E

Interferences were studied for electrochemical hydride generation with electrolytic cell and also for chemical hydride generation using sodium tetrahydroborate as a reduction agent. The study included the comparison with oxygen influences. Hydride-forming elements (selenium and arsenic), transition metals (zinc, copper and nickel), different anions (chlorides, sulfates and nitrates) and sodium were tested as interferents. The most serious interferents were hydride-forming elements and nickel, where 100 % signal <b>supression</b> was observed in high interferent concentrations. As opposed to sodium and nickel, where almost none signal <b>supression</b> was observed at all concentrations.

The correlation between diarrhea and immune suppression level has not well known yet, particularly in Saiful Anwar Hospital. The aim of this study is to determine relation between immune suppression level and prolonged or persistent diarrhea in AIDS/HIV infected child. Method: Retrospective crosssectional research were conducted on 68 medical records taken from patients who were admitted between February 2008 and August 2011. The characteristic of data taken were: age, sex, nutritional status, CD 4 + counts, duration of diarrhea, other comorbid diseases beside diarrhea (pneumonia, tuberculosis, moniliasis) and the patient outcome. National Guidelines Clinical Management of HIV/AIDS in Children were used to diagnose HIV/AIDS. Immune <b>supression</b> level was determined using CDC guidelines. Immune <b>supression</b> level was ranked in to four categories: no immune deﬁcient, mild suppression, moderate suppression, and severe immunodeﬁcient.

40|$|Differential {{rotation}} {{between a}} neutron star crust and the more rapidly rotating interior superfluid leads to frictional heating that affects the star's long-term thermal evolution and surface emission. The frictional heating rate {{is determined by the}} mobility of the vortex lines that thread the rotating superfluid, and which likely pin to the inner crust lattice. Vortex lines move through the lattice through quantum tunneling or thermal activation, depending on the temperature. Here we present the results of thermal evolution simulations based on two models of the vortex pinning forces. We consider standard and accelerated (URCA process on quarks) processes, the effects of superfluidity, magnetic fields, and temperature gradients. If frictional heating is ignored, the effective temperature deduced observationally for PSR 0656 + 14 lies between the standard and accelerated cooling models, suggesting severe <b>supression</b> of a rapid neutrino emission process; if frictional heating is accounted for, less severe <b>supression</b> is required...|$|E
