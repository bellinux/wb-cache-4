Temperature-activity relationship of cytochrome oxidase elaborated at the permissive temperature by the mutant strain is modified as far as the particulate enzyme is concerned, but no difference is observed after partial solubilization of the enzyme by non ionic surfactant.

40|$|In {{the search}} for new {{diagnostic}} methods that would distinguish Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense from T. b. brucei and T. b. gambiense, we have developed two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets. The first primer set {{was derived from the}} serum resistance-associated (SRA) gene of T. b. rhodesiense that confers resistance to lysis by normal human serum (NHS). The specificity of the SRA-based PCR was tested on 97 different trypanosome populations originating from various taxonomic groups, host species, and geographic regions. Only one of 25 T. b. rhodesiense samples was negative in this PCR, and none of 72 other samples were positive in this assay. Interestingly, a reference T. brucei strain (TREU 927 / 4) currently used for genome sequencing was negative for the SRA gene; however, this strain was resistant to lysis by NHS. The second primer set was derived from a specific variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) expression site where the SRA gene is expressed (R-ES). This primer set identified the strain as T. b. rhodesiense in 17 of 17 SRA gene-positive strains in which it was tested. These data strongly suggest that expression of the SRA gene is generally involved in resistance to lysis by NHS in T. b. rhodesiense <b>strains.</b> <b>Evaluation</b> StudiesJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|Thin silver interconnectors {{are used}} in the space {{communication}} industry to ensure electrical conductivity between neighbouring electronic modules. In order to accommodate a large range of strains, these interconnectors are manufactured with a stress-relief loop shape. The main goal of this thesis is the study of the experimental aspects of the low cycle fatigue of these interconnectors. The development of an in-situ automated fatigue testing procedure is described in detail. This procedure, which involves a miniature cycling device situated inside the vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM), was applied to several pure silver interconnectors with different loop heights. The use of the SEM enables observation, at high magnification, of the interconnector while it is being tested. A new parameter, $ kappa$, which includes the interconnector's geometrical characteristics, is introduced. The experimental results show that the fatigue life of interconnectors can be predicted from a knowledge of $ kappa$. A new approach to the measurement of strain at the top of interconnectors' loop is also proposed. The technique requires the use of the SEM and the deposition of 2 $ mu$m spheres as surface markers. In addition to the experimental technique, a three-dimensional linear finite element analysis of the interconnectors is performed. This analysis is carried out using more than 2, 000 elements and three different materials. <b>Strain</b> <b>evaluations</b> are found to be in good agreement with those experimentally obtained...|$|R
