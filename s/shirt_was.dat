5|$|The club's home colours {{of royal}} blue shirts, white shorts, and either white or royal blue socks {{have been used}} for the team's kits {{throughout}} most of its history. The first sponsorship logo to appear on a Leicester <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> that of Ind Coope in 1983.

5|$|Bristol Rovers {{are known}} for their {{distinctive}} blue and white quartered shirts, which they have worn for most of their history. The current home kit consists of a light blue and white quartered shirt and white shorts, while the away kit is black and gold with the same colours as the trim. During the 2008–09 season a special third strip, which is black with a gold sash, and is a reproduction of the original Black Arab <b>shirt,</b> <b>was</b> used for a single match to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the club.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shirts</b> <b>are</b> {{no longer}} {{available}} on the English website. However, the <b>shirts</b> <b>are</b> still available to buy on the official Chinese website.|$|R

5|$|East Stirlingshire's home colours {{have been}} {{black and white}} hoops {{for most of its}} {{existence}} since 1882. The club's first strip was thin blue and white hoops between 1880 and 1882, before changing to colours similar to the present day. An all-black <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> introduced between 1960 and 1962, and again between 2008 and 2010, while the club's centenary strip in 1981 was all-white. In 1996–97, the stripes were changed from horizontal to vertical for a full season; a similar design featured for one month in August 1982 before changing back.|$|E
5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though {{this has not}} always been the case. The choice of red is in {{recognition}} of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E
5|$|Since 2012, Leicester City's kit {{has been}} {{manufactured}} by Puma.

50|$|Rugby <b>shirts</b> <b>were</b> {{traditionally}} {{made out}} of cotton, but as synthetic fabrics became cheaper they have become incorporated into rugby shirts. The two most common materials are a mix between cotton and polyester (many of these <b>shirts</b> <b>are</b> meant for supporter use, though {{they can be used}} in a rugby game), and pure polyester (these <b>shirts</b> <b>are</b> generally designed for game use).|$|R

5|$|Stansfield {{continues}} to be remembered by fans of his former teams. On 9 August 2014, as Exeter started the new season against Portsmouth, a giant flag resembling his club <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> displayed by the crowd. Hereford F.C., the phoenix club of Hereford United, gave a minute's applause to Stansfield in the 9th minute – his number for the Bulls – in the 2016 FA Vase Final. Exeter and Yeovil agreed that on their meeting at St James Park on 8 August 2015, {{there would be a}} minute's applause in the seventh minute and ninth, for the numbers he wore at each club. Earlier the same day, there was also a match between the two clubs' supporters in Topsham, Devon, to raise funds for his foundation.|$|E
5|$|The crest was {{modified}} in 1995 after consultation with a Supporters Forum, with the turrets of the Wolsey Gate {{moved to the}} top of the crest, the yellow background changed to red, the Suffolk Punch given a more dominant physique and the F.C. expanded to Football Club. Three stars were added to the sleeve of the team's away shirt for the 2004–05 season, and also to the home kit for the 2005–06 season. These stars were added to represent the three major trophies which Ipswich Town have won; the FA Cup, the UEFA Cup and the old Division One. The stars were relocated directly above the crest when the <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> redesigned prior to the 2007–08 season.|$|E

Subsequent sponsors have been Bedford Trucks (1982 to 1990), Vauxhall (1990 to 1991), Universal Salvage Auctions (1991 to 1999), SKF (1999 to 2003), Travel Extras (2003 to 2005), Electrolux (2005 to 2008), Carbrini Sportswear (2008 to 2009), EasyJet and NICEIC (concurrently, 2009 to 2015), and Barnfield College and NICEIC (concurrently, 2015 to 2016).

5|$|As of 2008, Del Piero has captained Italy {{seven times}} (including during UEFA Euro 2008). He also {{initially}} regularly wore the number 10 shirt, in particular under Maldini and Zoff, but later {{gave it to}} Totti after Euro 2000, and switched to No. 7 for the 2002 World Cup, {{as it was the}} first number he wore at the start of his career. Even though the number 10 <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> vacated after Totti retired from the national team in July 2007, Del Piero denied any interest in taking back the number, saying he was satisfied with No. 7. In May, he was recalled by popular demand to Italy's UEFA Euro 2008 squad in Austria and Switzerland under manager Roberto Donadoni, after a nine-month absence from international duty, and thus became the second Italian player, after Paolo Maldini, to participate in seven major international tournaments (Euro 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008; World Cup 1998, 2002, 2006).|$|E
5|$|With Brescia, Baggio scored 46 {{goals in}} 101 {{appearances}} in all competitions, scoring 45 goals in 95 Serie A appearances, and one goal in two European matches. Baggio also made four Coppa Italia appearances with Brescia. Baggio retired as Brescia's all-time leading goalscorer in Serie A. He ended {{his career with}} 205 goals in Serie A, making him the seventh-highest scorer of all time, behind Silvio Piola, Francesco Totti (who overtook him in 2011), Gunnar Nordahl, Giuseppe Meazza, José Altafini and Antonio Di Natale (who overtook him in 2015). Baggio's number 10 <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> retired by Brescia in his honour, and he is considered the club's greatest ever player. Before Baggio had joined Brescia, {{they had never been}} able to avoid relegation after being newly promoted to Serie A, in over 40 years. During the four years under Baggio, Brescia recorded their best ever Serie A run and were never relegated.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Headington United, orange and blue striped shirts were worn with navy shorts and socks. The {{design of the}} shirt changed regularly, with the stripes being changed every few seasons. After joining the Southern League, the blue stripes were lost for good and a lighter shade of orange {{was used for the}} shirt. The yellow kit was first worn during the 1957–58 season, with black shorts and yellow socks. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the black shorts were first {{replaced}} with yellow ones, and then with light blue shorts. Since the early 1990s, the strip has been composed of the yellow shirt and navy coloured shorts and socks. A large variety of away kits has been used over the years, ranging from red and black stripes on the shirts, to a fully white kit. The first sponsor to appear on the <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> Sunday Journal, a local newspaper, in 1982. Between 1983 and 1985, there were three sponsors: BPCC, Pergamon and the Sunday People. Following those were Wang Laboratories (1985 to 1989), Pergamon (1989 to 1991), Unipart (1991 to 2000), Domino (2000 to 2001) and Buildbase (from the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001 to 2010). Following the return to the Football League, Bridle Insurance were announced as new shirt sponsors. The Bridle deal ended after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season. The home sponsor for the 2013–14 season was announced as Animalates, with the away kit being sponsored by Isinglass Consulting for that same season after winning an innovative prize draw. That one-year deal with Isinglass was extended for the 2014–15 season, again featuring on the away kits only.|$|E
