25|$|Binary may be {{converted}} to and from hexadecimal somewhat more easily. This is because the radix of the hexadecimal system (16) is a power of the radix of the binary system (2). More specifically, 16 = 24, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> four digits of binary to represent one digit of hexadecimal, {{as shown in the}} adjacent table.|$|E

25|$|Binary is also easily {{converted}} to the octal numeral system, since octal uses a radix of 8, {{which is a}} power of two (namely, 23, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> exactly three binary digits to represent an octal digit). The correspondence between octal and binary numerals {{is the same as}} for the first eight digits of hexadecimal in the table above. Binary 000 is equivalent to the octal digit 0, binary 111 is equivalent to octal 7, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|The Moon orbits the Earth in {{the same}} {{direction}} as the Earth rotates on its axis, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> slightly more than a day—about 24 hours and 50 minutes—for the Moon to return to the same location in the sky. During this time, it has passed overhead (culmination) once and underfoot once (at an hour angle of 00:00 and 12:00 respectively), so in many places the period of strongest tidal forcing is the above-mentioned, about 12 hours and 25 minutes. The moment of highest tide is not necessarily when the Moon is nearest to zenith or nadir, but the period of the forcing still determines the time between high tides.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{inhibits}} {{the effects}} of mineralocorticoids, namely, aldosterone, by displacing them from MR in the cortical collecting duct of renal nephrons. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water while limiting the excretion of potassium (A K+ sparing diuretic). The drug has a slightly delayed onset of action, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> several days for diuresis to occur. This is because the MR is a nuclear receptor which works through regulating gene transcription and gene expression, in this case, to decrease the production and expression of ENaC and ROMK electrolyte channels in the distal nephrons. In addition to direct antagonism of the MRs, the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone may also in part be mediated by direct inactivation of steroid 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase), enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of mineralocorticoids. If levels of mineralocorticoids are decreased then there are lower circulating levels to compete with spironolactone to influence gene expression as mentioned above. The onset of action of the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone is relatively slow, with the peak effect sometimes occurring 48 hours or more after the first dose.|$|E

2500|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} usually rely on uranium to {{fuel the}} chain reaction. [...] Uranium is a very heavy metal that is abundant on Earth and is found in sea water {{as well as most}} rocks. [...] Naturally occurring uranium is found in two different isotopes: uranium-238 (U-238), accounting for 99.3% and uranium-235 (U-235) accounting for about 0.7%. [...] Isotopes are atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons. [...] Thus, U-238 has 146 neutrons and U-235 has 143 neutrons. [...] Different isotopes have different behaviors. [...] For instance, U-235 is fissile which means that it is easily split and gives off a lot of energy making it ideal for nuclear energy. [...] On the other hand, U-238 does not have that property despite it being the same element. [...] Different isotopes also have different half-lives. [...] A half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a sample of a radioactive element to decay. [...] U-238 has a longer half-life than U-235, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> longer to decay over time. [...] This also means that U-238 is less radioactive than U-235.|$|E

It is from this consideration, that I could be glad to spare you the trouble, which I am now giving you, of a postscript, if I were not obliged, by many reasons, to write somewhat concerning our present plays, and those of our predecessors on the English stage. The truth is, I have so far engaged myself in a bold epilogue to this play, wherein I have somewhat taxed the former writing, {{that it was necessary}} for me either not to print it, or to show that I could defend it. Yet I would so maintain my opinion of the present age, as not to be wanting in my veneration for the past: I would ascribe to dead authors their just praises in those things wherein they have excelled us; and in those wherein we contend with them for the pre-eminence, I would acknowledge our advantages to the age, and claim no victory from our wit. This being what I have proposed to myself, I hope I shall not be thought arrogant when I enquire into their errors: For we live in an age so sceptical, that as it determines little, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> nothing from antiquity on trust; and I profess to have no other ambition in this essay, than that poetry may not go backward, when all other arts and sciences are advancing.

But oh! my dear Ernest, to sit next to a man who has spent his life in trying to educate others! What a dreadful experience that is! How appalling is that ignorance which is the inevitable result of the fatal habit of imparting opinions! How limited in range the creature's mind proves to be!
