5|$|Mauna Kea's <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the best}} sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E

5|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside the swell. At the <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> another view area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River. The <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down. About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the swell, the San Rafael Reef. Just as the highway exits the swell it passes {{to the north of}} Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits the swell near Green River.|$|E

5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been limited to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from summer grazing. The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E
5|$|The Rhyd Ddu path, {{also called}} the Beddgelert Path, leads {{from the village of}} Rhyd Ddu, west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge {{dropping}} west from the summit. It {{is considered one of the}} easier routes to the summit, with the advantage that the <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> visible from the start, but is one of the least used routes. It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest of the summit, from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres from the summit. An alternative start begins at Pitt's Head on the A4085 road.|$|E

5|$|The hill {{is formed}} in layers {{from a variety}} of {{sedimentary}} rocks of Jurassic age. In common with the Cotswold plateau to the north, the <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> formed from rocks ascribed to the Chalfield Oolite Formation. The oolite together with the Fuller's Earth Formation which underlies it, forms a part of the Great Oolite Group of rocks of Bathonian age. Beneath these are, successively, Bajocian age limestones of the Inferior Oolite Group and sandstones of the Bridport Sand Formation. The last-named unit forms a part of the Lias Group of rocks of Toarcian age. Beneath all of these is the relatively thick Charmouth Mudstone Formation sequence rising {{from the edge of the}} valley floor alluvium. All faces of the hill are subject to large areas of landslip.|$|E
5|$|The {{last three}} eruptions at Mount Hood {{occurred}} {{within the past}} 1,800 years from vents high on the southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily {{to the south and}} west along the Sandy and Zigzag rivers. The last eruptive period took place around 220 to 170 years ago, when dacitic lava domes, pyroclastic flows and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions. The prominent Crater Rock just below the <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now-eroded domes. This period includes the last major eruption of 1781 to 1782 with a slightly more recent episode ending shortly before the arrival of the explorers Lewis and Clark in 1805. The latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907.|$|E
5|$|The main access {{route to}} the summit leads {{through one of the}} ramps to the saddle between the main summit and its western trabant. The passage on the top cone is secured by ropes for {{unprepared}} tourists. One of the variants of the Polar Route follows the coast of Amerloq Fjord {{at the base of the}} southern wall of Nasaasaaq. The main <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> visited for its long-range view of the coast, although more limited to the north than that of Palasip Qaqqaa to the north of the town airport. An alternative {{route to the}} top of interest to mountaineers leads through the hard to find low pass to the east of the main summit, and from there directly on the summit cone ridge.|$|E

50|$|The Y8 and Y20 Summits - {{formerly}} G8 and G20 Youth <b>Summits</b> - <b>are</b> international youth conferences gathering young leaders. These <b>Summits</b> <b>are</b> {{the official}} youth counterpart to the Group of Eight (G8) and the Group of Twenty (20). The goal of these <b>summits</b> <b>is</b> {{to allow the}} young generation to speak up. Young adults are able to provide solutions to the global agenda, promote cross-cultural understanding and build global friendships. The conclusions of the <b>Summits</b> <b>are</b> then passed on to international policy-makers to make the young people heard.

25|$|The Volcanic Seven <b>Summits</b> <b>are</b> {{the highest}} volcanoes {{on each of}} the seven continents, just as the Seven <b>Summits</b> <b>are</b> the highest peaks {{on each of the}} seven continents. <b>Summiting</b> all seven <b>is</b> {{regarded}} as a mountaineering challenge, first postulated as such in 1999.|$|R
5|$|The {{summit and}} {{surrounding}} areas of Nethermost Pike contain many species and communities which are of biological interest. North {{east of the}} <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> Nethermost Cove which contains some of England's best arctic-alpine and tall-herb vegetation, including {{one third of the}} English population of Downy Willow (Salix lapponum). Similarly Ruthwaite Cove contains Arctic-alpine and tall-herb communities, and it is believed that the cove may contain very rare species of plants in very small, and therefore precarious, populations. The lower eastern slopes form Grisedale Common, a large expanse of dwarf shrub heath. The lower slopes are grazed by sheep, which has a significant effect on the type of vegetation which grows. Certain areas, such as Eagle Crag, are inaccessible to sheep due to their steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|I-470 {{begins in}} {{southern}} Kansas City at the Grandview Triangle interchange with I-49, I-435, US50, and US71. The freeway, concurrent with US50, travels east through grasslands before meeting the westernmost interchange, a diamond interchange with Blue Ridge Boulevard. A rail line belonging to Kansas City Southern Railway passes under the freeway {{west of the}} interchange. The concurrent highways continue east through lightly populated Jackson County past a light residential zone, towards an interchange with Raytown Road. Raytown Road provides access to Longview Lake {{to the south of}} I-470. Crossing into urbanized Lee's Summit, the Kansas City Metropolitan Junior College is accessible from the View High Drive interchange. The city line between Kansas City and Lee's <b>Summit</b> <b>is</b> near View High Drive. Exit7 consists of a cloverleaf interchange with the southern end of Route 350 and US50, as well as Northwest Blue Parkway and Northwest Pryor Road. Two rail lines surround the cloverleaf interchange, both operated by the Union Pacific Railroad, however only the eastern line is operational. US50 leaves the freeway and travels southeast as I-470 curves to the north near the Lee's Summit Municipal Airport.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a cycle occurs in which {{volcanic}} activity at the <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> dominant for several hundred years, after which activity shifts to the rift zones for several more centuries, {{and then back to}} the summit again. Two cycles have been clearly identified, each lasting 1,500–2,000years. This cyclical behavior is unique to Mauna Loa among the Hawaiian volcanoes. Between about 7,000 and 6,000years ago Mauna Loa was largely inactive. The cause of this cessation in activity is not known, and no known similar hiatus has been found at other Hawaiian volcanoes except for those currently in the post-shield stage. Between 11,000 and 8,000years ago, activity was more intense than it is today. However, Mauna Loa's overall rate of growth has probably begun to slow over the last 100,000years, and the volcano may in fact be nearing the end of its tholeiitic basalt shield-building phase.|$|E

5|$|Whether {{or not the}} <b>summit</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{important for}} its content, the meeting held some symbolic importance. First of all, {{it was the first}} NATO summit between the leaders of the North-American and Western European states, and Eastern European states, states that were finally, after decades of Cold War tensions, together in the same alliance. The media attention that these new members received during the summit, opened public debates about whether there was still a consensus about the purpose, the perceived threats and the future borders of NATO among its 26 members. That this was not the case, became clear {{in the run-up to the}} 2006 Riga Summit. Secondly, the holding of the summit in Istanbul made it the most eastern summit in NATO's history. It marked the increasingly key role played by Turkey as a major strategic hub due to its location close to the hotbeds of tension and conflict in the South Caucasus and the Middle East. The location of the summit made clear that NATO’s security concerns had shifted towards the southeastern part of the European continent. By shifting eastwards, the Alliance’s centre of gravity ventured into very different areas from those on which the Cold War military NATO had focused.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the church}} has nine bays, again divided by buttresses. In the third bay from the west is a porch. The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads. The porch is in two storeys, with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles. The lower storey contains a doorway with a pointed arch, and the upper storey has a two-light window. The doorway and window are set slightly {{to the west of}} the centre, as the east wall contains a stairway. Inside the porch are stone seats and the remains of two stoups (holy water fonts). The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones. On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial. The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style, and has five bays. At its centre is another porch, this one with three storeys. At the west front are diagonal buttresses, and in the bottom storey is a double doorway, over which is a canopied niche containing the weathered image of a saint.
