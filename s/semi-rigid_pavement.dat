A clear understanding of distress mechanisms is the cornerstone for extending pavement service life. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to provide guidance for the design of <b>semi-rigid</b> long-life <b>pavements.</b> The potential distress mechanisms in <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> were revisited in order to synthesize the primary factors affecting performance. One key observation from the literature was that, while thickness primarily controls fatigue cracking, material requirements are the primary factor governing other distress mechanisms. Semi-rigid sections proposed for the heaviest traffic conditions in Spain were analytically evaluated from the long-life perspective. Results showed that only some sections met the structural requirements to be considered long-life pavements; however, two of them were clearly overdesigned. In addition, thick asphalt lifts are used to delay the onset of reflective cracking, which is not a cost-effective approach.

40|$|Road {{safety is}} one of the most common issues {{involving}} many countries worldwide, as for the increasing mobility demand. In order to guarantee safety for a long time, both quality and durability are to be achieved for flexible and <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> wearing courses. From this viewpoint this study proposes the use of splittmastixasphalt SMA bituminous layers, which are widely employed in the northern countries of Europe, where the severe winter climatic conditions as well as the heavy traffic of studded tyres vehicles magnify the good performances (strength, durability, noise reduction) of such materials. In order to get to an increased diffusion of SMA layers also in Italy, the structural response is thereby characterised in this paper, the specific climatic and environmental conditions of our country being obviously taken into account. For this purpose such characterisation should well get to a performance analysis based on traditional equipments (Marshall and Brazilian tests) as well as on innovative means, such as the UNIBAS M. P. T. apparatus (triaxial tests machine). In particular, the UNIBAS M. P. T. apparatus is fundamental for the scope, as the results allow to find, for each mixture and test temperature, the corresponding yielding/rupture domain, which is the indispensable surveying instrument for the rational design of both flexible and <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>pavements.</b> As a consequence, the Authors propose the implementation of a new system which could automate the M.

40|$|Abstract: Because of {{the high}} {{strength}} and sound stability, the cement stabilized base has been widely used in high grade pavement in China. But shrinkage cracking are easy {{to occur in the}} cement stabilized base. Under the repeating action of traffic loads and temperature loads, this kind of cracks are easy to propagate towards the asphalt surface, being called “reflective crack”. Shrinkage cracks are not normally avertable in the cement stabilized base, in contrast with a few wide cracks of broad spacing, numerous thin cracks of narrow spacing contribute little to the severe reflection cracking. On the basis of this thinking, the pre-cracking technique as a promising approach is brought forward. Several vibratory roller passes to the cement-treated base at a short curing stage, typically 1 to 3 days after placement, to create a fine network of cracks, which avoids the wide and/or long cracks and creates the ideal crack model. Comparing to wide cracking, the degree of the stress concentration resulting from thin cracking is by far mitigated. The Finite Element Method is used to predict the ideal crack model, and then the mechanical responses of the <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> of single wide cracking and net hairline cracking under vehicle loading are numerically simulated, simultaneously compared and analyzed. The simulation analyses indicate that the pre-cracking technique is a very useful tool to mitigate the reflective cracks...|$|E

Cracking predicting and its control are key components in design of new and exiting pavements. From this point of view the possibility of evaluating the damage by an incremental calculation over the entire target of design life is very interesting. The M-E PDG 2002 (Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide v. 1. 003) software allows to assess {{the effectiveness of}} a trial design relating to performance criteria defined by the designer, predicting the service life of the considered pavement system.

In this paper the Authors show the results obtained using the above-mentioned software, adopting different pavements typologies (conventional, full-depth, semi-rigid, inverted-section), in order to determinate design solutions which are suitable for inhibiting or limiting the cracking phenomenon and the rutting, evaluating the influence of design parameters. In such way, the study offers useful suggestions that can be used by asphalt pavement designers to reduce in particular the possibility of premature cracking, so as to increase the service life of pavement system...|$|E

This research is focused on transverse cracks edges daily and seasonal variation of Load Transfer (LT, %), Relative Deflection (RD, micrometer/micrometer) and Maximum Deflection (MD, micrometer), of four types of situations: thin cracks (width 80 %) measuring at any time in summer condition (average temperature 5 cm below the surface ≥ 20 °C). •Crack sides MD measured with pavement temperature close to 20 °C (reference temperature for Spanish standardized deflections) in winter condition (average temperature 5 cm below the surface < 20 °C), could also show a good pavement structural state, MD < 300 micrometer. •If the worst structural pavement state needs to be evaluated, deflections should be measured on the front side cracks except for block shape cracks in winter condition and thinner cracks in both conditions. •Wide cracks LT experiences the greatest daily variation range among all crack types, from more than 20 % to more than 30 % in winter condition and thin cracks unseat them in summer condition with a daily variation range from almost 10 % to less than 20 %. •Besides, wide cracks RD daily variation is the highest among all crack types in both conditions, ranging from a decrease of more than 0. 30 micrometer/micrometer to more than 0. 60 micrometer/micrometer in winter condition and half this range of values in summer condition...|$|R

40|$|Cold {{recycling}} with emulsified or foamed asphalt {{has been}} widely used in China to convert the existing asphalt surface layer to an asphalt base layer. A new asphalt surface layer between 12 and 18 cm is then paved. Since these <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> were originally built with cement treated base, this reconstruction practice {{has resulted in a}} special pavement structure: cement treated subbase + cold recycled asphalt base + new asphalt surface. This paper reports the long-term performance of such pavement structure on two expressways located in Jiangxi, China. In-situ distress survey and coring were conducted, as well as data collection of traffic and load spectra. Laboratory testing was then carried out on materials collected from the site. Numerical modelling was also conducted to investigate the possible influence from different materials and design options. Results from this study indicated that the main reason of premature failure of this type of pavement structure was the weakening and fatigue of the cold-recycled asphalt base layer. Poor quality control during construction might be the cause since the air voids of the cold-recycled base layer was found to be much higher than the limit. Structural analysis showed that increasing the new asphalt surface layer from 14 cm to 16 cm on top of a 12 cm cold-recycled asphalt base layer could increase the fatigue life and traffic endurance (in terms of equivalent single axle load) 1. 6 - 3. 2 times. Therefore, it was concluded that increasing the thickness of the new asphalt surface layer could significantly improve the long-term performance of flexible pavements with cold-recycled asphalt base layer.

Much of works were focused on actualization of vehicles load equivalency factors. For this purpose data delivered from weigh-in-motion were analyzed. Four methods of determination of load equivalency factors for pavement structure design were compared. The analysis showed that fourth power equation, AASHTO, 1993 and French LCPC methods derived load equivalency factors at similar level and these obtained factors can be underestimated in comparison to results delivered from mechanistic-empirical method. The paper presents {{a new approach to}} determine load equivalency factors with consideration of several issues which {{have a significant impact on}} traffic load assessment for pavement design.

The weigh-in-motion derives archival data and it is known from long-term observations that vehicles weights and axle loads increase while pavement life period. Legal axle load limit and the percentage of overloaded vehicles have significantly impact on load equivalency factors.

The paper discusses the diagnostic abilities of the 3 D imaging technique on the base of data collected over historic pavement section with complex structure of layers. The method of horizontal slices were used to present and analyze the data. The method is particularly efficient in the detection of reinforcement and large infrastructural objects of linear shape. In the case of tested pavement section it is interesting that slices allowed for the detection of joints and cracks characterized by very weak GPR response. In this case several questions appear as to the nature of response generation and the features of the medium structure which are represented in the scattered signal.

The long-term research lead to estimation of deformational characteristics and fatigue {{of different types of}} asphalt mixtures. The tests have shown a positive impact of additives (ground rubber, hydrate lime component) on the results of these mixtures. This article is focused on assessment of deformational {{properties and}} fatigue of selected types of asphalt mixtures...|$|R
40|$|This paper used dynamic FEM model {{instead of}} {{continuum}} elastic layered system to simulate whole or broken <b>semi-rigid</b> base asphalt <b>pavement</b> response under FWD. Calculating {{results indicated that}} the sublayer strength can be evaluated by special FWD deflection basin parameter. Subgrade modulus (Esg) can be well evaluated by Curvature Index CI 7 and Shape Factor F 8 and the estimated results were not affected by pavement structure cracking condition. Whether Esg greater than 170 MPa or not is defined as pavement subgrade failure criteria. Curvature Index CI 3 can use to indicate the semi-rigid base layer structural condition and its criteria is CI 3 value greater than 60 um. This method have been applied and validated successfully in Jialiu Expressway rehabilitation project in Shanghai. It can more precisely distinguish weak sections for pavement rehabilitation design...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{comparatively}} study the design of a road structure, using parameters provided by standards and their practically measured counterparts. This aspect has multiple consequences, and the ones emphasised are mainly the economical costs and the environmental impact. The location of this study is the Western edge of the city of Cluj Napoca, Romania. Using the trafϐic data provided by a weigh-in-motion (WIM) system installed on site, a series of parameters used for the design of road structures were evaluated. These parameters are also provided by Romanian standards, and their values were used in this comparative approach. The aim was to establish which procedure provides the best solution, considering different theoretical and practical approaches. After setting up ϐive work hypotheses, the standardised road design procedure was applied. The geotechnical, climatic and hydrological data were used to establish the bearing capacity of the soil. <b>Semi-rigid</b> road <b>pavements</b> were chosen and the 3 (three) eligibility criteria were veriϐied. Different results for the considered hypotheses were obtained. The study emphasises the technical and economical aspects, providing at the same time an environmental point of view. The obtained results support the idea that WIM trafϐic data is a useful tool for road pavement design, as long as trafϐic conditions are similar for the studied sectors. Using the effective trafϐic values as the basis for pavement design leads to economical advantages and less harmful effects on the environment...|$|R
40|$|Weak layers, interlayers, {{laminations}} and/or interfaces in {{the upper}} structural layers of road pavements are specifically prohibited in most road-building specifications. However, such layers are extremely common and often lead to premature pavement distress. In Part 1 of this two-part set of papers, it is shown that from experience with heavy vehicle simulator (HVS) and dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) testing, the presence of such layers and/or conditions at any depth in the structural layers of a flexible or semi-flexible pavement is far more deleterious than is commonly appreciated. In Part 2 {{the effects of these}} weak layers are further modelled and discussed using various examples based an HVS testing and mechanistic pavement analyses. In particular, a weak upper base course of a cemented pavement under a thin bituminous surfacing may lead to severe surfacing (and upper base) failure within a matter of weeks to months after opening to traffic, not excluding failure even during construction. In this paper (Part 1), the causes of weak layers, interlayers, laminations and/or interfaces, together with simple methods for their detection during construction and analyses of their effects on the structural capacity of flexible and <b>semi-rigid</b> (cemented) road <b>pavements,</b> are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Key words: road engineering; open-graded {{large stone}} asphalt mixes; coupled {{numerical}} analysis; Anti-crack Mechanism; reflective crack; road performance Abstract. The reflective cracking in asphalt surface is a technical problem {{that exists in}} the <b>semi-rigid</b> base asphalt <b>pavement</b> structure and the rigid base asphalt pavement structure, how to control its emergence and development is still a major problem for road engineering. At present, researches on the anti-cracking performance for Open-graded Large Stone asphalt Mix (OLSM) in China almost remain in the test road observations, very few study the mechanism of its anti-cracking from the mechanical point. Aiming at this problem, a method of using OLSM as the cracking relief layer is proposed, large mineral aggregate, low asphalt content {{and a great deal of}} void in OLSM can dissipate or absorb stress and strain around the crack. The 3 -D finite element method is used to analyze the crack-alleviating layer of ordinary asphalt concrete and OLSM, and the large-scale commercial finite element software of ABAQUS is used to do numerical simulation analysis for the lean concrete base asphalt pavement structure with OLSM, the analysis result indicates that temperature-load coupling stress of OLSM are less than that of ordinary asphalt concrete. Depending on the test road on an expressway, research on the anti-crack mechanism o...|$|R
