5|$|Alton Towers {{conceived}} {{the concept of}} a flying roller coaster in 1990, twelve years before Air eventually opened. Following the opening of Nemesis in 1994, a flying coaster was planned by the park to open in 1998, but was delayed due to technological limitations. During its development, Alton Towers marketed the ride as <b>Secret</b> <b>Weapon</b> 5 (abbreviated to SW5), following the naming pattern established for previous major park developments. The ride was developed in part by ride designer John Wardley, the producer of many attractions at Alton Towers and other former Tussauds Group theme parks.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, the player character's {{parachute}} fails to open. Awakening hours later, the character finds almost all his equipment inoperable. Reaching the pyramid on foot {{hours after the}} rest of the team entered the structure, the player must complete the team's mission before the god awakens in five days. In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of Spanish-speaking treasure hunters, and fallen members of a Nazi expedition from the 1930s who were looking for a <b>secret</b> <b>weapon</b> but never returned. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by an item attainable early in the game, the yellow crystal.|$|E

5|$|The two 20th Century Fox films—The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes—had survived {{complete}} {{and in good}} condition, but those in the Universal series suffered badly over the years, as they passed through the hands of different copyright owners. In 1993 the UCLA Film and Television Archive started a restoration project on the series after the unstable cellulose nitrate film {{was found to be}} suffering from deterioration. Restoration on the first six films—The Woman in Green, The Pearl of Death, Sherlock Holmes and the <b>Secret</b> <b>Weapon,</b> The Scarlet Claw, Terror by Night and The Spider Woman—took four years from 1993; the costs for the restoration were met by UCLA and Hugh Hefner, who was a fan of the Rathbone-Holmes series. From 1998 Warner Bros. matched Hefner's funding and the remaining six films—Dressed to Kill, Pursuit to Algiers, Sherlock Holmes Faces Death, The House of Fear, Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror and Sherlock Holmes in Washington—were then restored, a process that was completed in 2001.|$|E

25|$|The 42cm Big Bertha howitzer, the <b>secret</b> <b>weapon</b> of the German army in 1914, {{quickly became}} widely celebrated. The {{destruction}} of the Fort de Loncin was immediately used for propaganda by the Germans, precipitating the surrender {{of the last two}} Liège forts, Fort de Flémalle and Fort de Hollogne. The propaganda did much to cement the reputation of the Big Bertha.|$|E
25|$|Had an {{invasion}} taken place, the Bf 110 equipped Erprobungsgruppe 210 would have dropped Seilbomben {{just prior to}} the landings. This was a <b>secret</b> <b>weapon</b> which would have been used to blackout the electricity network in south-east England. The equipment for dropping the wires was fitted to the Bf 110 aeroplanes and tested. It involved dropping wires across high voltage wires, and was probably as dangerous to the aircraft crews as to the British.|$|E

25|$|Plans {{to build}} The Smiler were {{submitted}} to the local authority in December 2011. Permission was granted on 15 March 2012 following a Staffordshire Moorlands Council meeting, despite some local opposition to its construction. Gerstlauer, a German manufacturing company, was hired to build the roller coaster. Less {{than a month after}} obtaining permission, Alton Towers launched a website announcing a new ride – codenamed <b>Secret</b> <b>Weapon</b> 7 (SW7) – for the 2013 season. Its codename followed a similar format used for other roller coasters during their teaser campaigns, such as SW4 for Oblivion and SW6 for Thirteen.|$|E
25|$|This {{one-shot}} {{reveals that}} before {{she joined the}} G.I. Joe team, {{she was a member}} of the Army. She was given training above and beyond what a female was allowed to receive at the time, as the generals putting G.I. Joe together wanted a <b>secret</b> <b>weapon</b> that enemies would not suspect. It is revealed that during her time in the CIA she is first given a mini-crossbow, which eventually becomes her weapon of choice. Also, much of her history with martial arts is revealed. Her last mission before joining the G.I. Joe team faces her off against Destro for the first time. It is because of the intelligence that she gathers, as well as her skills, that she is brought into the team.|$|E

25|$|Since the Byzantine {{army was}} still holding on after this defeat the sultan {{thought it was time}} to set up his <b>secret</b> <b>weapon,</b> a huge mobile tower. This tower could hold many {{soldiers}} who could be at the same level as the walls of the city, making it easier for them to break into Constantinople. The first group of Ottomans who entered the city were killed almost immediately, with the effect that the other Muslims began to retreat. Witnessing this, the sultan encouraged his soldiers. Soon after the sultan's encouragement the Muslims broke the wall in two places and entered the city. In a last attempt to protect it, Constantine attacked the enemy sword raised; however he was defeated and killed.|$|E
25|$|Gary Grice {{developed}} {{an interest in}} hip-hop by attending block parties {{as a child in}} the early 1970s. He was involved in breakdance, graffiti, and DJing. Early on he {{developed an}} interest in writing, studying Mother Goose and nursery rhyme. In 1974-76 he listened to The Last Poets, however he was attracted by profanity rather than content, and didn't understand the underlying messages until many years later. The Last Poets, as well as songs by The Isley Brothers, the Commodores, and the O'Jays had a big part in his early life, especially regarding the tone and cadence of speech. Later on, he began to listen to hip hop and R, for example by <b>Secret</b> <b>Weapon</b> and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.|$|E
