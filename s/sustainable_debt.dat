40|$|Rising {{deficits and}} high debt ratios characterised {{currency}} crises {{in countries with}} low private savings rates and low population densities. But in emerging markets with large population transferring to more productive employment, <b>sustainable</b> <b>debts</b> and deficits may be higher. Debt ratios fall with growth rates. Higher private savings can compensate for government dissaving. An optimising model of such an economy with dualistic labour markets and two types of consumers demonstrates these features but also shows debt ratios tend to rise in high growth phases.

50|$|Paraguay is {{a member}} of the Common Market of the South (Mercado Común del Sur or Mercosur). Most of Paraguay’s trade takes place with Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina. In 2002 Paraguay {{conducted}} more than US$400 million in trade with Argentina and nearly US$800 million with Brazil. Paraguay is also a member of the Inter-American Development Bank, Latin American Integration Association, and Latin American Economic System and a signatory to the agreement creating the South American Community of Nations. In 2004 Paraguay signed an energy cooperation agreement with Venezuela to purchase oil and petroleum. Venezuela agreed to concessional financing that allowed Paraguay to pay over a 15-year period at a nominal interest rate. Imports totaled US$3.3 billion in 2004. Principal import commodities included automobiles, chemical products, consumer goods, tobacco, petroleum, and machinery. Brazil was the leading source of imports to Paraguay (24.3 percent), followed by the United States (22.3 percent), Argentina (16.2 percent), China (9.9 percent), and Hong Kong (5 percent). Experts note that import statistics are difficult to confirm for Paraguay because as much as half of all imports are illegally re-exported to Argentina or Brazil. Imports from Mercosur countries continue to rise, up to 57 percent in 2003. Paraguay’s export revenues totaled about US$2.9 billion in 2004. Agricultural commodities continue to drive Paraguay’s export totals. Soybeans are particularly vital, accounting for 35 percent of total export revenues in 2003. Other agricultural cash crops include cotton, sugarcane, cassava, sunflowers, wheat, and corn. Other significant exports include feed, meat, edible oils, electricity, wood, and leather. Even as Paraguayan export revenue has fluctuated, Brazil remained Paraguay’s principal export destination (27.8 percent in 2004), followed by Uruguay (15.9 percent), Italy (7.1 percent), Switzerland (5.6 percent), Argentina (4.3 percent), and the Netherlands (4.2 percent). In 2003 nearly 60 percent of Paraguayan exports went to Mercosur countries. Paraguay had a negative trade balance of about US$400 million in 2004. Higher earnings from soybeans and cotton could not offset the surge in imported consumer goods and petroleum products. After years of negative balances, Paraguay achieved a positive balance of payments totaling US$234 million in 2003. In 2004, however, the current account had an estimated deficit of US$35.1 million. Paraguay has a <b>sustainable</b> <b>debt</b> level according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). External debt totaled about US$3.4 billion in 2004, low compared to most Latin American countries. Continued reductions in Paraguay’s debt to gross domestic product ratio are expected in coming years. Paraguay paid US$412 million in debt service to the IMF in 2004. Foreign investment in Paraguay nearly disappeared in 2002. After direct foreign investment of US$84 million in 2001, only US$9 million in investment came from abroad in 2002. This drop was largely the result of the financial crisis in Argentina and the banking collapse in Paraguay. Direct foreign investment rebounded in 2003, reaching US$90.8 million for the year. Paraguay has depended on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank for economic development assistance. The World Bank has promised Paraguay assistance totaling US$325 million between 2003 and 2007. Projects currently underway in Paraguay aim to improve education, transportation, and rural development.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{models of}} {{sovereign}} debt assume that governments seek {{to maximize the}} long terminterests of their countries. We assume instead that governments borrow and default {{according to their own}} political interests. In particular they often have limited horizons and are reluctant to default strategically.

We find that maximum <b>sustainable</b> <b>debt</b> varies a lot across countries, consistent with the notion of country specific debt (in) tolerance. Actual debt ratios are below their maximum sustainable levels, as governments seeking further terms in office fear debt-induced default that may jeopardize their prospects for reelection. The difference between actual and maximum <b>sustainable</b> <b>debt</b> ratios creates a "margin of safety" that allows governments to increase debt if necessary with little corresponding increase in default risk.

40|$|Rising fiscal {{deficits in}} the context of high debt ratios can trigger a sudden stop or {{reversal}} of capital inflows in an emerging market.

Second, in high population density emerging markets in a catch-up phase, <b>sustainable</b> <b>debts</b> and deficits may be higher. Analysis of the evolution of government debt shows how debt ratios fall with growth rates. An optimizing model of a small open emerging market economy (SOEME) with dualistic labour markets and two types of consumers, shows debt ratios would tend to be higher in high growth phases in such emerging markets, and the conditions under which fiscal and monetary coordination can occur.

40|$|The {{debt burden}} facing {{a number of}} low-income {{countries}} has received considerable international attention. The international development community has begun to recognize that options aimed at providing debt relief to countries where debt is not sustainable needs to be seriously explored. In this paper, the authors build on the Branson model of debt sustainability {{and apply it to}} a severly indebted, low-income country, Ethiopia. They provide a simplified framework where debt sustainability (both domestic and external) is an integral element of macroeconomic stability. Interactions between different policy variables (such as debt, fiscal, and interest rate policies), outcome variables (such as GDP and export growth), and international economic conditions (international interest rates) jointly define whether a country is on a <b>sustainable</b> <b>debt</b> path. Equations on debt sustainability can be estimated under this framework, thus providing a good starting point for examining debt sustainability. There are three lessons from the empirical analysis of Ethiopia: 1) a strong reform program is critical in bringing the country back on a <b>sustainable</b> <b>debt</b> path; 2) the issue of debt relief requires serious consideration by the international development community; and 3) growth and resource mobilization need adequate emphasis to ensure that debt is repaid.

The research findings suggest that the reaction of the public debt to GDP ratio to the real growth rate of the output increased after the financial crisis.

40|$|The paper first {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the sustainability of debt growth by examining the behavior of taxation implied by fiscal rules that respect a government's intertemporal budget constraint. <b>Sustainable</b> <b>debt</b> growth may require the tax burden to rise above some socially acceptable level. In this case, whereas drastic remedies may prove ineffective, a more relevant choice concerns the degree of monetary financing of the deficit (as distinct from monetization of the debt), which affects the dynamics of taxation implied by the constraint. Monetary financing is then introduced into a model by Blanchard, and the effects of monetary financing on the interest rate and capital intensity are examined. Finally, some policy implications are considered. ...|$|E
40|$|Ratios {{of public}} debt {{as a share}} of GDP in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico were 10 {{percentage}} points higher on average during 1996 - 2002 than in the period 1990 - 1995. Costa Rica's debt ratio remained stable but at a high level near 50 percent. Is there reason to be concerned for the solvency of the public sector in these economies? We provide an answer to this question based on the quantitative predictions of a variant of the framework proposed by Mendoza and Oviedo (2004). This methodology yields forward-looking estimates of debt ratios consistent with fiscal solvency for a government that faces revenue uncertainty and can issue only non-state-contingent debt. In this environment, aversion to a collapse in outlays leads the government to respect a "natural debt limit" equal to the annuity value of the primary balance in a "fiscal crisis". A fiscl crisis occurs after a long sequence of adverse revenue shocks and public outlays adjust to a tolerable minimum. The debt limit also represents a credible commitment to be able to repay even in a fiscal crisis but is not, in general, the same as the <b>sustainable</b> <b>debt,</b> which is driven by the probabilistic dynamics of the primary balance. The results of a baseline scenario question the sustainability of current debt ratios in Brazil and Colombia, while those in Costa Rica and Mexico seem inside the limits consistent with fiscal solvency. In contrast, public debt ratios are found to be unsustainable in all four countries for plausible changes to lower average growth rates or higher real interest rates. Moreover, <b>sustainable</b> <b>debt</b> ratios fall sharply when default risk is taken into account. ...|$|E
