50|$|Slurry {{walls are}} {{typically}} constructed by {{starting with a}} set of guide walls, typically 1 m deep and 0.5 m thick. The guide walls are constructed on the ground surface to outline the desired <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> and guide the excavation machinery. Excavation is done using a special clamshell-shaped digger or a hydromill trench cutter, suspended from a crane. The excavator digs down to design depth (or bedrock) for the first wall segment. The excavator is then lifted and moved along the trench guide walls to continue the trench with successive cuts as needed. The trench is at all times kept filled with slurry to prevent its collapse, but the liquid filling allows the excavation machinery and excavation spoil to be moved without hindrance.|$|E

The <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> method {{is well known}} for creating impermeable groundwater barriers and has been used for decades to create economical and positive cutoff walls in the core or foundation soils beneath dams and dikes of many types and sizes. This paper examines three innovative modifications of the <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> method and their applications in the {{rehabilitation of}} three small dams. Case histories of each dam and <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> method are described. The <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> technique uses an engineered fluid for support of trench walls. Usually the fluid is bentonite slurry that coats the trench walls and permanently blocks the free flow of water. If, however, the fluid is degradable, a permeable backfill, such as sand or gravel can be backfilled in the trench to create a permeable zone such as a toe drain or chimney drain. This method is known as the bio-polymer trench drain method and has been used {{for more than a decade}} in the waste remediation industry to collect contaminated groundwater, and more recently in the rehabilitation of dams.

The authors give the results of numerical modeling of a stress-strain state of 69 m high dam, where a diaphragm {{in the form of}} a <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> cutoff wall cuts the whole dam body and a 23 m deep gravel-pebble foundation. The co-authors describe a dam design where the diaphragm is constructed in three lifts. The diaphragm lifts are connected by slabs made of clay-cement concrete or clay. Numerical modeling was carried out with the use of the author’s computer program with consideration of non-linearity of soils deformation. Analyses showed that clay-cement concrete of a <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> cutoff wall is in a favorable stress state, as clay-cement concrete by its deformation characteristics (E = 100 МPа) is close to gravel-pebble soil. The diaphragm deflections turned to be small; therefore, tensile stresses will not occur in it. In the diaphragm the clay-cement concrete is in a state of triaxial compression, therefore, its strength will be higher than unconfined compression strength (1 - 2 МPа).

40|$|Introduction An {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} a site in Greenville County, South Carolina which detected contaminants in the groundwater.

The contaminants and their location in the groundwater led to the selection of an in-situ air sparging system to be installed at approximately thirty-four feet deep. Due to design depth requirements and other site conditions, the bio-polymer <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> (B-P drain) Method was utilized in the air sparging system installation. The two trenches were installed using a biodegradable slurry {{in lieu of the}} bentonite slurry commonly utilized in the more traditional <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> technique. The slurry temporarily supported the trench walls while the air sparging components were submerged and set at the proper elevations.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} soil–bentonite <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> cut-off walls is {{highly dependent on}} the hydraulic conductivity of the soil–bentonite backfill, which according to laboratory tests can decrease significantly as consolidation pressure increases due to corresponding reductions in void ratio. Consequently a reliable estimate of the hydraulic conductivity of backfill in the field requires proper calculation of effective stresses. A model is proposed to predict the steady-state horizontal and vertical effective stresses in the backfill after consolidation. The arching effect is considered by way of force equilibrium, and the lateral squeezing effect of inward displacement of the trench side walls is considered by assuming the cut-off wall is surrounded by soil, which is represented by a Winkler idealisation. The proposed model is applied to consider a soil–bentonite <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> cut-off wall in New South Wales, Australia, and the predicted stress profile is in good agreement with that calculated from cone penetration test data. Compared to those predicted by geostatics and other alternative models, the proposed method offers a significant improvement in the prediction of stress in soil–bentonite <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> walls. The obtained stresses are then used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in the backfill. It is found that the hydraulic conductivity is relatively high in the shallow region owing to the low state of effective stresses, which requires consideration in cut-off wall design, and decreases slightly with the depth in the deeper region. Finally a parametric study identifies the side wall friction and the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction of surrounding soil as having the most {{significant impact on the}} estimated stresses...|$|E

The wall of the shell is comprised of slurry wall panels made of concrete. The cylindrical shape was selected for its efficiency in resisting externally applied pressure.

40|$|Soil-bentonite (SB) <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> cutoff walls {{have been}} used for over 30 years as {{subsurface}} vertical barriers to control ground water flow and contaminant transport. Despite the millions of square feet of cutoff wall that have been constructed, {{little is known about the}} time-dependent behavior of the backfill and, in particular, the change in shear strength with aging. From experience, practitioners know that the backfill, which is initially placed as a semi-fluid material, gains strength with time. What has not been known is whether this time-related strength gain is due entirely to consolidation of the backfill or some other mechanism. This paper presents the results of laboratory and field testing of a SB <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> cutoff wall. Laboratory studies included consolidation and slump testing. Field studies included testing a constructed wall using vane shear, earth pressure cells, and settlement plates. The results of these tests demonstrate an increase in shear strength within a few days of backfill placement. This initial increase in shear strength is attributed to consolidation of the low-permeability backfill. The shear strength continues to increase with time, behavior that the authors attribute to two factors. The first is secondary consolidation or creep. The second is broadly termed “aging ” and is attributed in part to the thixotropic nature of the bentonite used in the backfill mixture. Recommendations for the design shear strength for SB backfill are also included...|$|E

The paper describes the centrifuge modelling technique, with reference to features such as the high initial in situ lateral earth pressures in overconsolidated clay deposits, and the stress and drainage boundary conditions imposed at the interface between the trench and the soil. The changes in pore water pressure and ground movements observed during the simulation of <b>slurry</b> <b>trenching</b> and concreting in a number of centrifuge model tests are described, and the influence of groundwater level and trench geometry is discussed. Ground movements were found to depend on a number of factors, including the initial groundwater level and the geometry (length/depth ratio) of the panel. The initial groundwater level is particularly important: soil surface settlements were reduced by a factor of 10 when a plane strain excavation was carried out with the water-table 10 m below ground level rather than at the soil surface. For a diaphragm wall trench 18 · 5 m deep and 1 m wide, three-dimensional effects were found to reduce the displacements at the centre-line of a single panel by a factor of 3 (compared with the plane strain case) for a panel 5 m long, but the benefit for a panel 10 m long was much smaller...|$|R

Corrugated paperboard represents a large fraction of the municipal solid waste generated and discarded in the United States. Alternative applications for reuse can provide a significant benefit by reducing the volume of waste being disposed and by reducing the use of raw materials. Four civil engineering applications were examined for potential beneficial reuse of corrugated paperboard: <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> construction, vertical drilling, directional drilling, and controlled low strength materials (CLSM). For {{the purpose of this}} project, corrugated paperboard was pulped and added to bentonite slurry or CLSM mixtures. Bentonite slurry mixtures were tested for viscosity, density, filtrate loss, and permeability. The behavior of the bentonite slurries was greatly influenced by interaction and interlocking of corrugate fibers; in general resulting in increased viscosity, filtrate loss, and permeability and decreased density. CLSM mixtures were tested for flow consistency, unit weight, air content, and compressive strength. CLSM mixtures prepared with corrugated paperboard showed an increased water demand due to high absorption of the corrugate. The higher water content was a significant factor contributing to decreased unit weight and compressive strength. CLSM mixtures containing corrugated paperboard also exhibited increased air contents, possibly due to entrapment of air within the corrugate pulp. Corrugated paperboard was used to successfully replace up to 27 % of bentonite for <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> applications, 60 % of bentonite for vertical drilling applications, and 59 % of bentonite for directional drilling applications while maintaining acceptable engineering properties. For CLSM mixtures up to 1 % of fine aggregate was replaced with corrugated paperboard while maintaining satisfactory engineering properties.

40|$|To reduce traffic {{problems}} {{and to improve}} the social climate in Maastricht a tunnel will be constructed for the A 2 motorway. The tunnel will be construction with the cut-and-cover method. Before the constructions starts first a ground improvement campaign is performed. Afterwards sheet pile walls will be installed in cemented <b>slurry</b> <b>trenches</b> and the building pit will be excavated dry wherever possible. The subsurface in Maastricht consist of a top soil of sand and clay and a thick gravel layer on top of limestone. The water level in Maastricht is generally high. Goal of this report {{is to determine the}} geotechnical and geological risks related to the tunnel construction. The Formation of Maastricht consists of weak porous limestone with flint and hardground layers. The limestone can be affected by dissolution, weathering by groundwater flow, erosion due to the Meuse River or be faulted and reduced to carbonate sand. Problems with excavation, leakage of slurry, lack of bearing capacity and passive resistance and uplift of the building pit floor or high groundwater inflow are expected. In this report the extensive preliminary site and laboratory investigation is described. This investigation had the goal to assess geohazards and to identify the most promising techniques for further investigation phases. Various databases were exploited to map the fluctuations of the gravel-calcarenite interface. Characteristic horizons made it possible to make a member division for the Formation of Maastricht. Vertical displacement of members between adjacent boreholes revealed the presence of a fault. The cores did not only contain rocks but also carbonate sands. Pocket penetrometer test performed on cores at close spacing allowed an objective mapping of the spatial distribution of carbonate sands, very weak and weak calcarenite along the tunnel alignment. These results have been correlated to the UCS results. Beside that a correlation between carbonate sand and fault zones has been detected. At the fault location, analyses of groundwater chemistry confirmed the connection between deep and shallow limestone layers. Many geophysical test methods were performed in a pilot zone, above the detected fault. The seismic reflection conducted with a low energy airsound source was found to be useful to image the fault. It revealed the presence of a complex fault zone rather than a single fault. The north east orientation of the fault zone was interpreted based on regional fault trends and correlated to fractures measured in boreholes {{with the help of a}} borehole camera. Estimating in situ permeability and deformability remained difficult. Primary permeability was found to vary over 3 orders of magnitude, up to the in situ permeability measured with the Lugeon test. In the fault zone a higher permeability is expected. For each member the distribution of material properties is studied and the flint content per member is estimated based on the borehole logs. Of the stratigraphy, lithofacies and some material properties a 3 D model has been constructed, to image and analyse the subsurface. These models are found to be useful since stronger and weaker zones can be recognized and since they can be used for future investigations of for example groundwater flows.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In situ {{reactive}} barriers {{have been}} constructed {{by a variety of}} means and with a range of reactive materials. Zero valent iron reactive permeable barriers have been installed to remediate chlorinated solvent contaminated groundwater by abiotic degradation of the halogenated volatile organic compounds into harmless daughter products. Alternative reactive materials are used for precipitation, sorption or biodegradation of various groundwater contaminants. The conventional means of installing such reactive barriers in a funnel and gate configuration is by braced gate excavation, and for continuous permeable barriers by <b>slurry</b> wall, augering, <b>trenching,</b> jet grouting and hydraulic fracturing techniques. This paper addresses those monitoring activities necessary to ensure a reactive barrier is constructed as envisaged, and that the barrier performs as designed. Construction monitoring activities involve quantifying barrier geometry and in situ properties, and impact of the barrier on the surrounding groundwater flow regimes. Performance monitoring activities involve groundwater chemistry data, up and down gradient of the barrier, tracer and hydrogeological tests, and field sampling and analysis of barrier in situ materials.

40|$|Tailings are {{the waste}} {{products}} produced during {{extraction of minerals}} from the ore. The particle size of tailings varies from medium sand to silt or clay size. Tailings are used as a construction material for raising of embankments called tailings dams. During spigotting, the coarse particles (sands) lie close to the embankment, while the fine particles (slimes) move downwards to the impoundment. The rate of failure in tailings dams is higher than that for the conventional water dams. In the past, tailings dams have failed due to various causes such as meteorological incidents, slope instability, piping/seepage, weak foundations, and seismic liquefaction etc. The statistics shows that the tailings dams are not safe even in their construction stages. The closure and reclamation measures require that the tailings dams and impoundments should be stable {{for a long time}} (more than 1000 years). Hence, the proper understanding of the mechanical properties (i. e., permeability, stiffness and strength) of tailings is essential in order to make reliable predictions for the long time stability of tailings dams and impoundments. The purpose of the literature survey carried out is: (a) to understand the mechanical properties of tailings material regarding anisotropy, cyclic loading, particle crushing and creep effects; (b) to know the current design practice and identify the factors that may have strong influence on the long time stability of tailings dams and impoundments, and (c) to find from literature, an appropriate constitutive model that can predict realistic behaviour of tailings material. There is similarity in properties of coarse tailings and loose to medium dense natural sands. Slimes are complex material and may show resemblance to natural sands, clays, or a combination of both. The hydraulic conductivity of tailings varies from point to point in a deposit. Tailings are more compressible than the natural soils. The coefficient of consolidation of slimes is in the range shown by natural clays. Due to high particle angularity, the sands and slimes show higher drained shear strength than that for similar natural soils. Undrained strength of sands is important in evaluation of liquefaction behaviour. The embankments can be raised with upstream, downstream or centreline construction methods. The upstream method is susceptible to liquefaction, whereas the downstream and centreline methods are relatively seismic resistant. The stability of the tailings embankments can be enhanced by keeping the phreatic surface low within the embankment body. The phreatic surface can be lowered with the application of cores, drainage zones, and the use of sand tailings in the embankment construction. Cut-off <b>trenches,</b> <b>slurry</b> walls, grout curtains, and liners can control seepage in tailings dams. The pore water pressures develop during construction of tailings embankments. These pore pressures are described as initial static pore pressure, initial excess pore pressure, and pore pressure due to shearing. The stability analyses conditions for conventional water dams (such as end of construction, staged construction, and long term) are also applicable to the tailings dams. The end of construction condition, and staged construction condition of a tailings dam can be analysed with undrained strength analysis. The drained analysis can be used for the long-term condition of a tailings dam (when an embankment attains maximum height and is constructed slowly). The aim of reclamation measures for tailings dams and impoundments is to achieve long time mass stability, environmental safety, and productive land use. Tailings impoundments can be stabilized with ripraps, chemicals, vegetation, and dry/wet covers etc. Most natural soils show anisotropy in strength due to their depositional history. Due to low density and high degree of saturation, tailings show large cyclic strains in a few cycles of stress reversal. The cyclic strength of tailings can increase with decreasing void ratio. Creep occurs in all soils. Clays show more creep than sands. Loose sands creep more than dense sands. The loads due to high tailings embankments may cause particle crushing and creep. The long time stability of tailings dams and impoundments can be predicted with finite element analysis with suitable constitutive models. The numerical analysis needs to be carried out for severe conditions of rainfalls, floods, and earthquakes. Godkänd; 2010; 20100609 (muhauc...|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} was used to examine the lateral soil deformation behavior of soft soils during the construction of levee improvements along the Sacramento River East Levee (SREL) in the Natomas Basin just north of Sacramento, CA. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, it was found that Sacramento had the greatest risk of flooding due the ageing and inadequately maintained levee systems. An executive order was declared and agencies began to evaluate and mitigate levee conditions. Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) evaluated the levee conditions and then designed and executed levee improvements along a 10 mile stretch of the SREL from 2005 - 2011. To meet United States Army Corps of Engineers Standards, a new adjacent levee was required. For underseepage control for much of this length, a soil-bentonite cutoff wall (SB wall) under the future adjacent levee crest was to be excavated near the toe of the existing 2 H: 1 V embankment. Prior to construction, inclinometers were installed at the adjacent levee toe and between the existing levee and <b>slurry</b> <b>trench.</b> Inclinometer data showed unexpected horizontal movements of up to 10 mm, away from the trench during the excavation under a bentonite-slurry mixture. After the soil-bentonite fill was placed, horizontal movements shifted towards the trench and greater than 25 mm of movement were observed to distances nearly two times the <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> depth from the cutoff wall alignment. A study was developed to evaluate the key parameters affecting lateral deformation of the soft Sacramento River soils. The model was implemented in multiple steps to mimic the actual phased construction performed in the field. The steps included the initial working platform fill, excavation and subsequent filling of the trench with bentonite-slurry mixture, backfilling of the trench and final filling of the embankment. Soil and ground conditions in the model were established from field and laboratory testing. Developing accurate stress-strain response was crucial to understanding the key parameters attributing to the lateral movement in the field. Results obtained in the model were compared with recorded field measurements determined from inclinometer readings. The initial movement away from the trench was likely dependent on stiffness of the natural deposits. The amount and rate of lateral movement toward the trench, after backfilling, trended with horizontal consolidation of the soil-bentonite backfill. This study can be useful in understanding the lateral behavior of the soft soils for making lateral deformation predictions in the case of construction excavations...|$|E
40|$|Cut-off {{slurries}} used in {{the construction}} of <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> and thin walls tend towards shifting of solid matter. This influences the construction procedure and the sealing properties of the cut-off wall. These solid matter shift processes include the sedimentation of single particles or of particle size ranges, penetration of the suspension into the ground pore space and filtration as a phase separation on the interface between the suspension and the ground. Laboratory investigations which can be used to demonstrate these particle movements qualitatively on both a small and large scale will be presented. It is possible to estimate the loss of suspension caused by such movements. Test specimens can also be produced for use in examining soil-mechanical characteristic values such as stress-deformation behaviour, hydraulic efficiency and chemical resistance. Sedimentation can usually be excluded to a large extent by use of an appropriate suspension. Penetration causes large losses of suspension, however the penetration zone can increase the impermeability as the pore space will be partly filled up. Filtration causes a thickening of the suspension and filter cake growth which impede the construction procedure. It may also lead to a deficiency of water within hydraulic active components in the suspension above the groundwater table. On the other hand a filter cake can increase safety owing to its hydraulic efficiency and stability. (orig.)

40|$|PhDThe {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of slurry trenching (diaphragm wall installation) in an overconsolidated clay, with particular emphasis on the changes in lateral stress which occur. A review of the literature on diaphragm wall installation in stiff overconsolidated clay was carried out, with particular reference to the measurement of changes in stress and the application of finite element analyses. The problem was investigated by means of centrifuge model tests and finite element analyses. The main body of the thesis details the development and results of a series of centrifuge tests. A model at 1 to 100 scale was tested at 100 gravities, enabling both the long and short term effects of <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> walling to be investigated. The technique adopted used a fluid-filled neoprene rubber bag in the place of the trench that was drained to ground level to simulate excavation under bentonite slurry. A mixture of plaster of Paris, iron-filings, fine sand and cement powder was then deposited into the bag to simulate wall placement. By using different fluid heights of different densities in the rubber bag, a series of initial earth pressure coefficients were modelled. The effects of both a stress and strain controlled boundary at the remote end of the model were also investigated. Finally, simulated concretes of different densities were adopted to see what effect this would have on placement stresses. A technique was developed to enable the measurement of changes in total lateral stress changes at up to 10 locations within the model. Pore water pressures were measured at the same positions, and ground settlements were measured at the surface of the model. A series of finite element analyses was carried out to extend the scope of the centrifuge model results by varying further the initial in situ conditions. The conclusions and suggestions for further work are presented {{at the end of the}} thesis...|$|E
40|$|PhDDiaphragm {{walls are}} being used {{increasingly}} in connection with building basements and road improvement schemes, particularly in urban areas. Many of these walls retain overconsolidated clay, and {{the magnitude of the}} lateral stresses which will act on the wall under service conditions is uncertain. One of the reasons for this is that, although the initial in situ lateral effective earth pressures in an overconsolidated clay deposit will be high, they will be affected to some extent by the process of installation of the wall. Stress relief which occurs during installation should be taken into account, since it will influence the starting point for analysis of the post-construction behaviour. Ground movements which occur during installation are important in their own right, and might for a diaphragmtype retaining wall be more significant than those which occur during and after excavation in front of the wall. The investigation of this problem using a centrifuge modelling technique is the principal aim of the current research. An extensive literature review has been carried out to collate field data concerning the stress history and in situ lateral stresses of overconsolidated clay deposits. These were used to confirm that the proposed centrifuge modelling technique would achieve realistic stress states and changes in stress. A series of centrifuge tests has been carried out at the London Geotechnical Centrifuge Centre (operated jointly by Queen Mary & Westfield College and City University), on samples of overconsolidated speswhite kaolin, simulating the effects of excavation under a <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> and concreting the diaphragm wall. The background to the tests, and the geometry and design of the model are discussed. The influence of the groundwater level and panel width on ground movements and changes in pore water pressures during diaphragm wall installation have been investigated, and the results are presented. The centrifuge test results are compared with field data from various sites. The development of a simplified analytical method is presented, which may be used to estimate the installation effects of diaphragm walls in clay. The results of this analysis are compared with the centrifuge test results and field data. Finally, some areas of continuing uncertainty are highlighted and some suggestions for further research are made...|$|E
40|$|The need {{of using}} the {{underground}} space was limited in the human history, {{but in the last}} century and due to the increase of world population, the use of the underground space has become essential. Underground metro stations, deep garages, tunnels and basements, etc [...] . are examples {{of using the}} underground space inside the cities. The use of underground space is conducted through deep excavation or tunneling. Several techniques are used to conduct the deep excavation {{and one of the most}} popular and well known techniques used for deep excavation is the diaphragm walling technique which is widely used specially inside the cities to safe space because it requires a very small space to conduct a deep reinforced concreted wall under the ground. However, the construction of such walls causes deformation of the surrounding ground and it could also affect the nearby existing structures. In some recorded cases the <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> failed and causes a great deformation which effect the nearby structures. However, Minor damages and cracks were observed in buildings near stable slurry trenches, because the soil deformation was high. The existing structures inside the cities have been constructed on shallow or deep foundations and this research was oriented to study the effect of diaphragm wall installation on the existing adjacent piled foundation. Very limited studies were made to investigate such an effect. At Cambridge university centrifuge model tests were conducted to investigate the effect of slurry reduction on single piles. Field observation was conducted in several projects and showed the settlement and deformation of buildings located on deep foundation during the diaphragm wall trenching. Numerical analysis was conducted using FLAC 3 D to simulate the laboratory and the available field works. FLAC 3 D is a commercial software and it depend in its analysis on finite difference method. The purpose of the simulation was to verify the used numerical analysis method. The results from the numerical analysis were in a good agreement with the available field data results, and they were also in good agreement with the laboratory test results regarding soil settlement but it was not in such good agreement when they were compared regarding the pile. Generally, from the verification the numerical analysis method is considered to be reliable. A parametric study was performed using the verified numerical analysis method. The flexible nature of the numerical analysis allows to simulate different cases and to study a variety of parameters. The output of the parametric study was the pile deflection, the bending moment and the shaft friction. The study was divided into three main parts while each part contains several parameter combinations. The first part studied the effect of the single and double panel(s) on the single pile group that has different piles numbers and formations. The second and third parts studied the effect of multiple panels on connected pile groups and piled raft foundation, respectively. Generally, the studied parameters can be divided into three main groups. The first is related to the trench which includes the panel dimension, the number of panels and the slurry level inside the panel. The effect of slurry pressure reduction at some levels inside the trench was also studied. The second group concerned the soil type and ground water level. The third group is related to the deep foundation which includes pile characteristics, location, and formation within the group. The results from the parametric study showed that the pile behavior was greatly affected by panel length, groundwater level, slurry level inside the trench and steadiness of the slurry pressure. The piles were also affected by the different stages of construction related to the pile location from the constructed panel. The piles within the group act together so they behave different from each other according to their position. The effect of the pile on the trench stability is presented through a simple analytical approach which is based on the wedge analysis. The analytical approach provided equations that calculate the factor of safety in two and three dimensions. The pile location was governing the equation that calculate the factor of safety because the pile could be fully inside the failure wedge or intersect with the failure surface. A comparative study was conducted to find out the effect of the different pile location and other parameters on the safety factor. Generally, this comparative study showed that the pile located within the failure wedge reduces the factor of safety, while the pile that intersects the failure surface could increase it. The pile row near a trench that contains piles inside the failure wedge and others intersects the failure surface act together to balance the failure wedge. The factor of safety results of some cases from the analytical approach were also compared with those calculated from the numerical analysis. In general, the factor of safety from the numerical analysis was higher than that calculated from the proposed analytical approach. This research helped to understand the trenching effect on the ground surface and on the nearby piled foundations. It provided charts that could help to predict the soil deformation and earth pressure coefficient which could be used in the design. It showed through the parametric study the precautions that should be taken into consideration during trenching process near piled foundation. This research provided a design method for the <b>slurry</b> <b>trench</b> panel near piled foundation...|$|E
