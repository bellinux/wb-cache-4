5|$|In the 2003 Battlestar Galactica miniseries/pilot, a ship {{resembling}} <b>Serenity</b> {{appears in}} the background of the scene with Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell). <b>Serenity</b> is one of several spaceships inserted as cameos into digital effects scenes by Zoic Studios, the company responsible for digital effects in both Firefly and Battlestar Galactica.|$|E
5|$|Written by Johnny Byrne, a plot outline {{for this}} story, {{also known as}} The Place of <b>Serenity,</b> was {{submitted}} to the production office by Byrne in July 1983. The two-part story {{would have seen the}} Doctor visit the planet <b>Serenity,</b> {{which is part of the}} same union that Traken belonged to. The rulers of <b>Serenity</b> are assisted by a computer known as Prophecy and the villains of the piece, Auga and Mura, are attempting to overthrow the rulers. It was later adapted by Jonathan Morris for Big Finish as part of their The Lost Stories series in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal <b>Serenity,</b> after they explain to the crew about their need {{to get off the}} planet. The problem is that unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, <b>Serenity</b> would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E

50|$|The album itself {{focuses on}} {{historical}} figures and events, just as its predecessor Death & Legacy had done, keeping true to <b>Serenity's</b> historical concept. Characters stories, such as Beethoven, Napoleon, {{and others have}} their tales told through <b>Serenity's</b> words and melodic tone.|$|R
5000|$|Angry Metal Guy states, [...] "To <b>Serenity's</b> credit, there isn’t a weak {{track in}} the bunch. Although {{everything}} sounds like it was lifted from better known contemporaries, it’s all high quality, memorable and very easy to like," [...] and [...] "This is by far <b>Serenity's</b> best release and a very enjoyable dose of symphonic power." ...|$|R
5|$|NASA Browncoat {{astronaut}} Steven Swanson {{took the}} Firefly and <b>Serenity</b> DVDs {{with him on}} Space Shuttle Atlantis's STS-117 mission in June 2007. The DVDs {{were added to the}} media collection on the International Space Station as entertainment for the station's crews.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the short-lived series served as the launching point for a media franchise within the Firefly universe, including the feature film <b>Serenity,</b> which addresses many plot points left unresolved by the series' cancellation.|$|E
5|$|The post-airing {{success of}} the show led Whedon and Universal Pictures to produce <b>Serenity,</b> a 2005 film which {{continues}} from {{the story of the}} series, and the Firefly franchise expanded to other media, including comics and a role-playing game.|$|E
50|$|Visual {{effects for}} <b>Serenity’s</b> movie {{appearance}} were again created by Zoic, {{this time with}} Emile Edwin Smith in charge.|$|R

5|$|These {{and other}} {{continuing}} fan activities eventually persuaded Universal Studios {{to produce a}} feature film, <b>Serenity.</b> (The title of <b>Serenity</b> was chosen, according to Whedon, because Fox still owned {{the rights to the}} name 'Firefly'). Numerous early screenings of rough film cuts were held for existing fans starting in May 2005 as an attempt to create a buzz to increase ticket sales when the final film cut was released widely on September 30, 2005. The film was not as commercially successful as fans had hoped, opening at number two and making only $40 million worldwide during its initial theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Years later, in 2005, Chia-yi {{suddenly}} calls Ching-teng to {{tell him}} that she is getting married. All of her old friends gather at the wedding, making jokes and trying to embarrass her somewhat-older husband. They are surprised that their past emotions have transformed into deep friendship and <b>serenity.</b> Ching-teng begins to work on a web novel about his experiences with Chia-yi.|$|E
5|$|On {{or about}} January 13, a title key was posted on pastebin.com {{in the form}} of a riddle, which was solved by {{entering}} terms into the Google search engine. By converting these results to hexadecimal, a correct key could be formed. Later that day, the first cracked HD DVD, <b>Serenity,</b> was uploaded on a private torrent tracker. The AACS LA confirmed on January 26 that the title keys on certain HD DVDs had been published without authorization.|$|E
50|$|In this story, {{written by}} Chris Roberson with art by Stephen Byrne, River entertains Zoe and Wash's infant {{daughter}} with a bedtime story as the remaining crew (sans Inara) {{go out on}} a mission. Her story parallels the formation of <b>Serenity's</b> crew albeit in a fantastical, fairy-tale-like setting, with the majority of the artwork inspired by an earlier piece of fan-art by Byrne which reimagined <b>Serenity's</b> crew as animated Disney characters. The book was released by Dark Horse Comics on May 7, 2016 for Free Comic Book Day.|$|R
50|$|Words Untold & Dreams Unlived {{has all the}} {{elements}} and strong points of a power metal album, but not as many melodic and symphonic tones as in <b>Serenity's</b> later albums.|$|R
50|$|War of Ages can be {{considered}} a concept album of sorts as its tracks are based on historical figures and events in history, coinciding with <b>Serenity's</b> previous album Death & Legacy.|$|R
5|$|Throughout their travels {{they studied}} art and visited churches and museums, which appealed to Bauer's eclectic mind. In the evenings {{they went to}} small tavernas to enjoy the ambiance; {{all of which is}} {{recorded}} in the letters they sent home to Bauer's family. Bauer's sketchbooks are full of studies of antique objects and Renaissance art, some of which he used for his illustrations. A portrait of Ghirlandaio by Sandro Botticelli {{is said to be the}} basis for Svanhamnen (The Swan maiden), and Piero della Francesca's work was the inspiration for Den helige Martin (Saint Martin, the Holy). He also became intrigued by frescoes. He was exuberant in the study of art, but he also became homesick for the quiet <b>serenity</b> of the Swedish forest which resulted in some of his best winter pictures with white snow, dark woods and the sky glittering with tiny stars.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Mal {{acquired}} his own ship, a derelict 03-K64 Firefly-class transport. Mal {{named the}} ship <b>Serenity</b> after the Battle of <b>Serenity</b> Valley, the decisive {{battle of the}} Unification War.|$|E

25|$|The Operative {{provides}} {{medical aid}} {{and resources to}} repair <b>Serenity.</b> The Operative tells Mal the broadcast has weakened the Alliance government.

25|$|After {{continually}} thwarting the Dark Kingdom and defeating {{several of}} its generals, Usagi awakens as the moon princess — Princess <b>Serenity</b> — and acquires the Silver Crystal. However, Mamoru is captured by the Dark Kingdom and brainwashed to work for them. The Sailor Soldiers learn of their past lives on Silver Millennium, an ancient kingdom on the moon. The Sailor Soldiers served as Serenity's friends and bodyguards, and <b>Serenity</b> {{fell in love with}} a prince from Earth named Endymion (Mamoru's past identity). However, the Dark Kingdom attacked and destroyed Silver Millennium, resulting in the deaths of <b>Serenity,</b> Endymion, and the Sailor Soldiers. Serenity's mother — Queen <b>Serenity</b> — used the power of the Silver Crystal to vanquish Queen Metaria and end the war. She also used the crystal to send the fallen into the future to be reborn on Earth, hoping to give them a second chance at peace.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Message" [...] was {{the last}} Firefly episode filmed, by which time {{the cast and crew}} knew the show had been canceled. The final scene, in which <b>Serenity's</b> crew return Tracey's body to his family, marking an end to the former soldier's journeys, {{therefore}} had an extra poignancy for them.|$|R
25|$|In 2016 a {{new record}} was set when the cruise ship Crystal <b>Serenity</b> transited with 1,700 passengers.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} the {{abundance}} and <b>serenity</b> of the enchanted mountain complements Maria's own persona.|$|E

50|$|This line up {{brought some}} subtle musical changes, {{including}} introducing a new lead voice, basing {{the songs on}} a more 'metal' riffing with a high demand on melodies and orchestral parts. With this line up, <b>Serenity's</b> first crucial test took place on August 2, 2004, when they successfully supported Ronnie James Dio.|$|R
50|$|Zen danced at the Crazy Horse in Myrtle Beach for six months.

25|$|<b>Serenitys</b> {{international}} {{box office}} results were mixed, with strong {{openings in the}} UK, Portugal and Russia, but poor results in Spain, Australia, France and Italy. United International Pictures canceled the film's theatrical release in at least seven countries, planning to release it directly to DVD instead. The box office income outside the United States was $13.3 million, with a worldwide total of $38.9 million.|$|R
