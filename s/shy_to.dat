He mentioned Navenby {{in a letter to}} a friend at the time, saying: I'm too <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> go looking for dirt. That's why I can't go off stewing into the Lincoln or Navenby brothels with the fellows. They think it's because I'm superior: proud, or peculiar or 'posh', as they say: and its because I wouldn't know what to do, how to carry myself, where to stop. Fear again: fear everywhere.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, deHavilland {{appeared}} in William Wyler's period drama The Heiress (1949), the fourth {{in a string}} of critically acclaimed performances. After seeing the play on Broadway, deHavilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to see what she felt would be a perfect role for her. Wyler obliged, loved the play, and with deHavilland's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights. Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James, the film is about a young naïve woman who {{falls in love with a}} young man, over the objections of her cruel and emotionally abusive father, who suspects the young man of being a fortune seeker. As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn, deHavilland portrayed her character's transformation from a shy, trusting innocent to a guarded, mature woman over a period of years. Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements, gestures, and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman. Her timid voice, nervous hands, downcast eyes, and careful movements all communicate what the character is too <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> verbalize. Throughout the production, Wyler pressed deHavilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character. When Catherine returns home after being jilted, the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script. The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics. For her performance, she received the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actressher second Oscar.|$|E

25|$|British writer Arthur C.

He believed the remedy is for the <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E

Chick heard from missionary Bob Hammond, who had broadcast in Asia on the Voice of America, that the Communist Party of China had gained significant influence among ordinary Chinese in the 1950s through the distribution of small comic books. Chick also began working with a prison ministry and created a flip chart of illustrations to use with his presentation. He hit upon the idea of creating witnessing tracts, which could be given to people directly or indirectly.|$|E

Excessive secrecy surrounding activities and rare declassification of the information are considered to be the major reasons behind this.|$|E

When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward, Troy offers to sing with her, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late.

At first, he uses Amaar's forgiving nature to build his congregation and eventually kicks the mosque out, but brings them back because the Archdeacon likes having a mosque in the church to show cultural diversity. It is revealed he feels a great shame over being adopted and dislikes his older brother. Thorne eventually takes Amaar's help in becoming a better person and begins trying to convince Amaar to be his friend. He is jealous of Rev. Magee when he returns to be Amaar's best man because Amaar clearly prefers the old reverend. Thorne shows some weakness when it is revealed that he has a crush on Rose, the town librarian, but is too <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> ask her out.

25|$|Around {{the time}} that Phillips was eleven, she heard a sermon given {{by a member of}} the London Missionary Society. After hearing the sermon, Phillips began to ponder the idea of {{becoming}} a missionary in the future. After she decided that she was too <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> preach, though, Phillips abandoned the idea. As a young woman, Phillips also developed many different medical conditions, including haemorrhages and fibroids, eventually needing a hysterectomy. Due to her frequent visits to the hospital, Phillips then developed the ambition to become a doctor. Both of Phillips aspirations came together when Phillips was short on money. A friend of Phillips advised her to apply to receive a scholarship from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge to help to pay for her school tuition. To qualify for the scholarship, Phillips needed to go abroad as a missionary doctor and apply to a specific mission. Phillips decided to take the offer and applied to the Society for the Propagation of Gospel (SPG). Originally wishing to go to India, Phillips instead got assigned to do her mission trip in China and arrived in China on 23 October 1905.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the story, Piro {{had seen}} Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller's restaurant, {{where she is}} a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there. Later on, Piro {{encounters}} Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered {{the next time they}} meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt. Piro works undercover as a busboy {{to get rid of all}} cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.|$|E

[...] Goodrem worked with the writers to incorporate her music into the show, and Wheatley used the exposure that Neighbours gave Goodrem to relaunch her singing career. Nina had a powerful voice and wrote her own songs, but she was too <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> sing them in public. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) discovered Nina's singing talent one day, and Connor entered one of her songs, [...] "Born To Try", in a talent contest at UniFM, where it won. As Nina was too <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> go and receive the prize, Tahnee Coppin (Anna Jennings-Edquist) tried to take credit for the song instead.

500|$|Meanwhile, Sydney Chaplin {{had joined}} Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, {{he was one}} of their key performers.

[...] However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract. Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909. In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, Jimmy the Fearless. It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.|$|E
