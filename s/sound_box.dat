25|$|The Q of {{a musical}} {{instrument}} is critical; an excessively high Q in a <b>sound</b> <b>box</b> will not amplify the multiple frequencies an instrument produces evenly. For this reason, string instruments often have curvy soundboxes with complex shapes, {{so that they will}} amplify a range of frequencies fairly evenly.|$|E
50|$|In summer 2005, a lift was {{installed}} to give disabled {{access to the}} bar and auditorium. In addition, a corridor was constructed to give audience access to both sides of the auditorium. A bar extension and bar roof terrace were constructed on top of the toilet block built in the previous phase. The installation of the lift meant that the previous ladder access to the lighting and <b>sound</b> <b>boxes</b> could no longer be used. The lighting and <b>sound</b> <b>boxes</b> were rebuilt to allow access to them from the lift.|$|R

25|$|Gradually, {{electrical}} reproduction {{entered the}} home. The spring motor {{was replaced by}} an electric motor. The old <b>sound</b> <b>box</b> with its needle-linked diaphragm was replaced by an electromagnetic pickup that converted the needle vibrations into an electrical signal. The tone arm now served to conduct a pair of wires, not sound waves, into the cabinet. The exponential horn was replaced by an amplifier and a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s Sweeney {{became the}} first white {{performer}} to play the banjo on stage. His version of the instrument replaced the gourd with a drum-like <b>sound</b> <b>box</b> and included four full-length strings alongside a short fifth string. This new banjo was at first tuned d'Gdf♯a, though by the 1890s this had been transposed up to g'cgbd'. Banjos were introduced in Britain by Sweeney's group, the American Virginia Minstrels, in the 1840s and became very popular in music halls.|$|E
25|$|The Erhu {{consists}} of a long vertical stick-like neck, {{at the top of}} which are two large tuning pegs, and at the bottom is a small resonator body (<b>sound</b> <b>box)</b> which is covered with python skin on the front (playing) end. Two strings are attached from the pegs to the base, and a small loop of string (Qian Jin) placed around the neck and strings acting as a nut pulls the strings towards the skin, holding a small wooden bridge in place.|$|E

The third Our Gang short made with <b>sound,</b> <b>Boxing</b> Gloves was advertised as [...] "all-talking," [...] although much of the film is silent footage without overdubbed sound. It is the earliest Our Gang entry included in the Little Rascals television syndication package.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "Smart Guitar" [...] is {{included}} in GarageBand, which includes 4 guitars: an acoustic guitar, two electric guitars, and a distortion guitar. Each guitar (except for the acoustic one) has two optional <b>sound</b> <b>boxes.</b> The instrument is set up like the smart keyboard, where multiple chords are playable. Also, each note in a chord can be played separately, or muted by holding {{the left side of}} the string.|$|R
50|$|Standing waves {{can also}} occur in two- or {{three-dimensional}} resonators. With standing waves on two-dimensional membranes such as drumheads, {{illustrated in the}} animations above, the nodes become nodal lines, lines on the surface at {{which there is no}} movement, that separate regions vibrating with opposite phase. These nodal line patterns are called Chladni figures. In three-dimensional resonators, such as musical instrument <b>sound</b> <b>boxes</b> and microwave cavity resonators, there are nodal surfaces.|$|R
25|$|The {{accompaniment of}} the choirs also {{included}} a guitar and the percussion was executed over the <b>sound</b> <b>box</b> of an American banjo from which the strings were removed, {{due to the fact}} that African drums performance was strictly forbidden in Cuban cities. The style of the Coros de Clave music, and particulally its rhythm, originated at a later time a popular song genre called Clave, which most probable served as the original prototype for the creation of the Criolla genre. Both genres, the Clave and the Criolla became very popular within the Cuban vernacular theater repertoire.|$|E
25|$|Paganini met Berlioz in Paris, {{and was a}} {{frequent}} correspondent as a penfriend. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was {{not satisfied with the}} resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato Harold en Italie. He never performed it, and instead it was premiered a year later by violist Christian Urhan. He did however write his own Sonata per Gran Viola Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in Harold, Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of Beethoven and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its <b>sound</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
500|$|The [...] "singing" [...] of male cicadas is not stridulation such as many {{familiar}} {{species of}} insects produce, crickets, for example. Instead, male cicadas have a noisemaker called a tymbal below {{each side of}} the anterior abdominal region. The tymbals are structures of the exoskeleton formed into complex membranes with thin, membranous portions and thickened ribs. Contraction of internal muscles buckles the tymbals inwards, thereby producing a click; on relaxation of the muscles, the tymbals return to their original position, producing another click. The male abdomen is largely hollow, and acts as a <b>sound</b> <b>box.</b> By rapidly vibrating these membranes, a cicada combines the clicks into apparently continuous notes, and enlarged chambers derived from the tracheae serve as resonance chambers with which it amplifies the sound. The cicada also modulates the song by positioning its abdomen toward or away from the substrate. Partly by the pattern in which it combines the clicks, each species produces its own distinctive mating songs and acoustic signals, ensuring that the song attracts only appropriate mates.|$|E
5000|$|These are idiophones {{consisting}} of keys struck with mallets with heads made of rubber or felt. They are played like a xylophone or vibraphone. The difference between Uakti's marimbas and these instruments {{is that the}} keys are located above two independent <b>sound</b> <b>boxes</b> that can be inverted or moved. This allows the playing of chords or sequences that would be quite difficult using the traditional design. Uakti uses two kinds of marimbas: ...|$|R

500|$|The jejy voatavo is a chordophone that {{traditionally}} has two sisal strings, three frets and a calabash resonator, although modern versions may {{have as many}} as eleven or thirteen strings, typically made of steel. [...] A maximum of four of these are strung over the frets, while the rest are strung lengthwise down the sides of the neck and are strummed with the fingers in accompaniment to the primary melody which is played with a bow. This more elaborate jejy voatavo is especially popular among the Betsileo of the southern Highlands and the Betsimisaraka of the southeast, who play it in accompaniment to their sung epic poems, called rija. In 19th-century Highlands society under the Kingdom of Imerina, the jejy voatavo was considered to be a slave instrument which only mature men were permitted to play. The lokanga, an evolved jejy with the <b>sound</b> <b>box</b> carved to resemble a three-stringed fiddle, is popular among the Southern Antandroy and Bara ethnic groups. The simplest form of instrument in this family is the jejy lava (musical bow), believed to have been brought to Madagascar by settlers from mainland Africa.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional Tuvaluan {{songs are}} very short poems which are repeated. These songs have strong rhythm, which the {{performers}} would maintain by clapping or hitting {{their hands on}} the floor or a <b>sound</b> <b>box,</b> such as a tea chest; with the tempo increasing as the song was repeated. While Tuvaluan songs convey a dramatic story, the concentrated song structure often omitted reference to key events in the story. Gerd Koch describes traditional Tuvaluan songs: ...|$|E

Carnatal takes place sometime in November or December, in the streets around Machadão Stadium (traffic around the stadium changes radically during Carnatal days). The transit department isolates about [...] of streets, creating a ring, along which the party takes place. During the days of party, a huge truck (called [...] "trio elétrico"), with a band on the top and <b>sound</b> <b>boxes</b> all around, drives slowly along the streets. The crowd follows the trio elétrico singing, dancing, jumping to the sound of the music.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} sound depends on many factors, {{including}} the lengths, gauges, {{and types of}} strings, {{the character of the}} wind, and the material of the resonating body. Metal-framed instruments with no sound board produce a music very different from that produced by wind harps with wooden <b>sound</b> <b>boxes</b> and <b>sound</b> boards. There is no percussive aspect to the sound like that produced by a wind chime; rather crescendos and decrescendos of harmonic frequencies are played in rhythm to the winds. Their vibrant timbres produce an ethereal, almost mystical, music that many people find alludes to higher realms.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{relative}} of the guitar the Colombian tiple is built with many materials also used for guitars. The <b>sound</b> <b>box</b> for instance is made of walnut or cedar. The neck is also made of cedar. The frets are made of red or yellow copper. [...] The instrument is about 3/4 {{the size of a}} standard classical guitar. [...] The stringing pattern constitutes one of the main differences between the Colombian tiple and other chordophones such as the twelve string guitar: [...] the metal strings are laid out in 4 courses of 3 strings (triple strung courses).|$|E
2500|$|The theorbo is a plucked string {{instrument}} of the lute family, with an extended neck and a second pegbox. Like a lute, a theorbo has a curved-back <b>sound</b> <b>box</b> (a hollow box) with a wooden top, typically with a sound hole, and a neck extending out from the soundbox. As with the lute, the player plucks or strums the strings {{with one hand while}} [...] "fretting" [...] (pressing down) the strings with the other hand; pressing the strings in different places on the neck produces different pitches (notes), thus enabling the performer to play chords, basslines and melodies.|$|E
2500|$|Attaching a small metal, rubber, leather, or wooden {{device called}} a mute, or sordino, {{to the bridge}} of the violin gives a softer, more mellow tone, with fewer audible overtones; the sound of an entire orchestral string section playing with mutes has a hushed quality. The {{conventional}} Italian markings for mute usage are con sord., or con sordina, meaning 'with mute'; and senza sord., meaning 'without mute'; or via sord., meaning 'mute off'. Larger metal, rubber, or wooden mutes are widely available, known as practice mutes or hotel mutes. [...] Such mutes are generally not used in performance, but are used to deaden the sound of the violin in practice areas such as hotel rooms. (For practicing purposes there is also the mute violin, a violin without a <b>sound</b> <b>box.)</b> Some composers have used practice mutes for special effect, for example, at the end of Luciano Berio's Sequenza VIII for solo violin.|$|E

2500|$|Dancing {{songs are}} {{the most common type of}} {{traditional}} Tuvaluan song. [...] Older style dancing songs were performed while sitting, kneeling or standing. The two primary traditional dances of Tuvalu are the fakanau (for men) and oga (for women) and fakaseasea. Of these, the fakanau was a Niutao and Nukufetau dance performed primarily by the men, which was performed while sitting, or on Niutao while kneeling or standing, but without moving from the spot – the story of the song was illustrated by movements of the arms, hand and upper body. An elder could stand in the middle of a circle of performers keeping time. [...] The fakanau, oga and the fakaseasea were used for celebrations and for praising fellow islanders. The only instrument was the use of a small wooden slit drum or a <b>sound</b> <b>box,</b> such as a tea chest; or the time was beaten with a fan or small rolled mat or the use of the palm of the hand on the floor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} pipa in Chinese texts appeared {{late in the}} Han Dynasty around the 2nd century AD. According to Liu Xi's Eastern Han Dynasty Dictionary of Names, the word pipa may have an onomatopoeic origin (the word being similar to the sounds the instrument makes), although modern scholarship suggests a possible derivation from the Persian word [...] "barbat", the two theories however are not necessarily mutually exclusive. [...] Liu Xi also stated that the instrument called pipa, though written differently ( [...] or [...] ) in the earliest texts, originated from amongst the Hu people (a general term for non-Han people living {{to the north and}} west of ancient China). [...] Another Han Dynasty text also indicates that, at that time, pipa was a recent arrival, although later 3rd-century texts from the Jin Dynasty suggest that pipa existed in China as early as the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). [...] An instrument called xiantao (弦鼗), made by stretching strings over a small drum with handle, was said to have been played by labourers who constructed the Great Wall of China during the late Qin Dynasty. [...] This may have given rise to the Qin pipa, an instrument with a straight neck and a round <b>sound</b> <b>box,</b> and evolved into ruan, an instrument named after Ruan Xian, one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove and known for playing similar instrument. [...] Yet another term used in ancient text was Qinhanzi (秦漢子), perhaps similar to Qin pipa, but modern opinions differ on its precise form.|$|E
