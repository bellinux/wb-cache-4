5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and <b>shampoos</b> containing it.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{grown as}} {{industrial}} crops {{are the source}} {{of a wide range of}} products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, <b>shampoos,</b> perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time.|$|E
5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff <b>shampoos),</b> zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E
40|$|Farmers {{in rural}} areas practiced cocktailed {{herbicides}} to control weed in their farms. Cocktailed herbicides Paranox 13 with <b>shampoo</b> had been tested to identify the effectiveness in controlling weed. Herbicides Paranox 13 was mixed with <b>shampoo</b> and applied on weed. Seven treatments were prepared based on the ratio of Paranox 13 and <b>shampoo</b> for positive control, five ratios (12 m 1 Paranox 13 : 0 m 1 <b>shampoo,</b> 10 m 1 Paranox 13 : 2 m 1 <b>shampoo,</b> 8 m 1 Paranox 13 : 4 m 1 <b>shampoo,</b> 6 m 1 Paranox 13 : 6 m 1 <b>shampoo,</b> 4 m 1 Paranox 13 : 8 m 1 <b>shampoo,</b> 2 m 1 Paranox 13 : 10 m 1 <b>shampoo)</b> and negative control. The weeds became died and turned brown for treatments contained Paranox 13. No effect for negative control treatment. There is no significance difference between negative and positive control (p> 0. 05). Cocktailed herbicides Paranox 13 with <b>shampoo</b> did not show effective result in controlling weed. For the conclusion there is no effectiveness of cocktailed herbicides in controlling weed. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel is essential to plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, <b>shampoos,</b> detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{elements}} less often recognised as metalloids, beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity; lead arsenate {{has been extensively}} used as an insecticide. Sulfur {{is one of the}} oldest of the fungicides and pesticides. Phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, selenium and iodine are essential nutrients, and aluminium, tin and lead may be. Sulfur, gallium, selenium, iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications. Sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs, still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. Gallium nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer; gallium citrate, a radiopharmaceutical, facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas. Selenium sulfide is used in medicinal <b>shampoos</b> and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor. Iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms. Bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{compounds}} {{were probably}} used by early humans, in processed and unprocessed forms, as a paint or medicinal ointment, but their composition is uncertain. The use of pushpanjan, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds, is {{mentioned in the}} Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before. Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD.) Avicenna mentions zinc oxide in The Canon of Medicine (1025 AD), which mentioned it as a preferred treatment {{for a variety of}} skin conditions, including skin cancer. Though it is no longer used for treating skin cancer, it is still widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions, in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti-dandruff <b>shampoos,</b> and antiseptic ointments.|$|E
