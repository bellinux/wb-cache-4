2500|$|In Arizona, {{a sheriff}} is an elected {{official}} and the chief law enforcement officer in any given county. There exists one sheriff for each of Arizona's 15 counties, with a varying number of deputies and assorted staff (usually dependent on population). A sheriff's office (the term [...] "department" [...] is used in Pima County) generally provides law enforcement services to unincorporated towns and cities {{within the boundaries of}} their county, maintains the county jail, and conducts all <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> for the Superior Court of the county. In addition, many sheriff's offices have agreements with the Arizona Department of Corrections (AZDOC) and local police agencies to provide for the transport and detention of prisoners. After sentencing, many convicted persons are handed over to the AZDOC to serve their sentence, but this has not always been the case.|$|E

Hence, the&# 13; assumption that inter arrival, and <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> are Poisson in nature does not always hold true, as it does not represent the real dynamics&# 13; involved in service level cloud. The proposed paper has recognized the distribution pattern dynamically and scheduled the processes based on&# 13; the distribution characteristics thus making the system more robust and dynamic. A fault tolerant mechanism has been built by rescheduling the&# 13; failed processes...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{examining}} the contending issues {{about the proper}} mode <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> originating <b>processes</b> on Registered Companies in Nigeria. A review of Company and Allied Matters Acts (CAMA) 1999 relavant common law rules was adopted. It was observed that although some judicial decisions {{support the view that}} Registered Companies can only be validly served with originating processes at their registered or head offices, this study argued that those decisions were wrong, and influenced by the courts' inability to distill the true purport of Section 78 (b) of CAMA, whilst ignoring the extant provisions of the applicable High Court Rules. It is the view of this study that <b>services</b> <b>of</b> originating <b>processes</b> on branch offices of companies remain valid so long as they ultimately reach the principal officers of the company.

These differences may be vast. For example, in New York, <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> may require licensing of the process server; in Pennsylvania, process may only be served by the sheriff or a sheriff's deputy in most cases (except in Philadelphia, where process may be served [...] "by any competent adult"); and in New Jersey, process is effected if, after making an affidavit that diligent efforts to effect personal service had failed, the party sends two copies of the pleading by mail - one by regular mail and one by certified mail, return receipt requested - and either the certified mail receipt is returned signed or the certified mail envelope is returned unclaimed and the regular mail is not returned to the sender. Generally, there are specific procedures and rules for most courts, from local small claims courts to United States District courts. Each court has specific rules, forms, guidelines and procedures which must be followed in order to successfully effect <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>process.</b> Failure to follow these guidelines may deem the attempted service improper. Indeed, many defendants in court hearings use the affirmative defense of [...] "I was not served" [...] as an often successful line of defense in any lawsuit. Not surprisingly, this defense tends {{to be effective in}} many cases because <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> upon defendant did not follow legal procedure.
