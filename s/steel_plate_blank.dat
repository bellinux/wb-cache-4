Experimental tests revealed the onset and growth of plate instability in the case of impact both on <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and on enameled <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> The instability was mainly located on the free edges and was particularly evident on the longer side of rectangular plates. The impactor initial energy that caused the instability onset in the case of enameled <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> was about six times higher than the one that induced the instability in the <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> Numerical simulations were performed to better understand and study the experimentally observed instability phenomenon. Four numerical models were developed in order to study the influence of plate thickness and residual stresses acting on the enameled <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> on plate instability.

40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a fracture criterion for the impact fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> of a bolted joint used in a car body. For the accurate prediction of crash characteristics of car bodies by computer-aided engineering (CAE), it is also necessary to examine the behavior and fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> subjected to impact loads. Although the actual impact fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> of a bolted joint used in cars is complicated, for simplifying the problem it might be classified into the shear fracture and the extractive fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> Attention is given to the extractive fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in this study. The extractive behavior and fracture of three kinds of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> used for cars are examined in experiments and numerical simulations. The impact extraction test of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> jointed by a bolt is performed using the one-bar method, together with the static test. In order to understand the mechanism of extractive fracture process of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> numerical simulations by a FEM code LS-DYNA are also carried out. The obtained results suggest that a stress-based fracture criterion may be developed for the impact extractive fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> of a bolted joint used in a car body. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Double skin {{composite}} (DSC) panels are constructed by filling concrete between two <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> welded with stud shear connectors at a regular spacing. <b>Steel</b> <b>plates</b> in DSC panels used as two-way slabs or shearwalls may buckle locally between stud shear connectors when subjected to in-plane biaxial compression. This paper investigates {{the local and}} post-local buckling behaviour of biaxially compressed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> restrained by shear connectors and concrete in DSC panels by using the finite element modelling technique. Local buckling coefficients are obtained for <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> with various aspect ratios, biaxial loading and boundary conditions by incorporating the shear stiffness effect of stud shear connectors. These buckling coefficients {{can be used to}} determine limiting width-to-thickness ratios for <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and the distribution of stud shear connectors.

The initial imperfections of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and non-linear shear-slip characteristics of stud shear connectors are taken into account in the post-local buckling analysis.

40|$|In {{order to}} quantitatively {{evaluate}} the shear-bearing capacity of shear connectors of square concrete filled steel tube (CFST), push-out tests on 14 square CFSTs with shear connectors {{have been carried}} out. Among the 14 CFSTs, there are 13 specimens with <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> connectors and one specimen with steel bar connectors. The following factors are investigated to figure out their influences {{on the performance of}} CFSTs, which are the width to thickness ratio of steel tube, thickness of <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> length of <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> strength of concrete, welding condition of <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> number of <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> layer and interlayer spacing. The test results show that the ultimate bearing capacity and the elastic stiffness increase with decreasing width to thickness ratio of the steel tube, and increasing thickness and length of the <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> With increasing concrete strength, the ultimate bearing capacity also increases. However, the welding condition has no effect on the ultimate bearing capacity.

(Civil Engineering) Abstract: The use of epoxy-bonded <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> (EBSP) is {{becoming}} a well-known solution {{in the field of}} civil engineering around the world for strengthening structural elements such as beams, columns and slabs. This thesis presents an experimental study aimed at investigating the flexural behaviour (structural behaviour) of simply supported under-reinforced concrete (URC) beams, strengthened in flexure by externally-bonded <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> (EBSP) with varying width-to-thickness ratio. This required an experimental investigation, which took place at the material laboratories at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa. The experimental program was carried out on 17, 175 x 300 x 3200 mm rectangular reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Two beams were not strengthened with <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and they were considered as control specimens, whilst the remaining beams were categorised into three groups with five (5) beams in each group. The first group of beams was externally strengthened with 4 mm <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> the second group was externally strengthened with 6 mm <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and the third group was externally strengthened with 8 mm <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> in flexure. Furthermore, in each group, the width of the bonded <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> varied from 75 mm to 175 mm, with increments of 25 mm. All the beams were tested simply supported under two-point static loadings until failure over a clear span of 3000 mm. To achieve the goals of this experimental investigation, the load-deflection response, strain distribution at the mid-span of the bonded <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> cracking load, crack patterns and associated failure modes of the tested specimens were recorded. From the experimental results, it is observed that the externally bonded <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> led to an increase in flexural stiffness, maximum load carrying capacity, cracking load, decrease in vertical deflections and crack-widths as compared to the control beams. Furthermore, {{there is a limit to}} width-to-thickness ratio of the <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> which the premature shear or bond failure occurs without beams achieving their full flexural capacity...|$|R
