25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the global}} war, the first peacetime ball at Rideau Hall was held for President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower, after which life within the {{household}} returned to normal. The transition from war to peace was marked by the appointment as governor general of the Viscount Alexander, whose son, Brian, reportedly used the portraits of former governors general throughout the hall as targets for his water pistol. During Alexander's tenure, Government House's first post-war Canadian royal visitors were the heiress presumptive to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), and her husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who came in late 1951 and, amongst other activities, took part in a square dance in the ballroom (replete with checked shirts). Churchill, once again Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, returned to Rideau Hall in January of the next year, where, <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> a sofa with a cigar {{in one hand and a}} brandy in the other, he persuaded Alexander to join the British Cabinet.|$|E

25|$|The rear {{battalion}} was the 4th Sikh Infantry, {{which reached}} Candeapar {{in the early}} hours of 19 December, and not to be bogged down by the absence of the Borim bridge (already blown up), went across the Zuari river in their military tankers and then waded across a small creek, in chest high water, to reach a small dock known as Embarcadouro de Tembim in Raia, presently under survey No.44/5 of Raia Village, from where there exists a connecting road to Margão (Old Portuguese Planta 4489 & 4493). At Tembim the 4th Sikh Infantry rear battalion, took some rest in a cattle shed on the small dock, and <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> the ground and in the balcony of a house adjacent to the dock, drank some water, retrieved their tankers and then proceeded to Margão—the administrative centre of Southern Goa—by 12:00. From here, the column advanced towards the harbour of Mormugão. En route to this target, the column encountered fierce resistance from a 500-strong Portuguese unit at the village of Verna, where the Indian column was joined by the 2nd Bihar. The Portuguese unit surrendered at 15:30 after fierce fighting, and the 4th Sikh then proceeded to Mormugão and Dabolim Airport, where the main body of the Portuguese Army awaited the Indians.|$|E
500|$|In old age, Bush {{continued}} to lead {{an active and}} productive life, punctuated by periodic commemorations {{of his life and}} works. [...] In November 1975 his 50 years' professorship at the RAM was marked in a concert there, and in January 1976 the WMA gave a concert to honour his recent 75th birthday. In 1977 he produced his last major piano work, the Twenty-four Preludes, Op. 84, of which he gave the first performance at the Wigmore Hall on 30 October 1977. A later [...] reviewer described this piece as [...] "music I'd like to have playing beside me as I <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> the grass beneath the trees with an ice-cream, watching a county cricket match on a golden afternoon".|$|E

2500|$|The artwork, which {{features}} a naked man <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> a bed was lifted from one of Anderson's old photo books. Taken by American photographer Joanne Leonard in 1971, the front cover picture was originally titled [...] "Sad Dreams on Cold Mornings" [...] and the rear photo [...] "Lost Dreams". Anderson says, [...] "I just liked the image, really, of the bloke {{on the bed in}} the room. It's quite sort of sad and sexual, I think, like the songs on the album." [...] The image on the window of the back cover is the same image on Quintessence' 1972 album Self.|$|E

Two helicopters were downed over the landing zone, {{one of which}} crashed around [...] from Company C's positions. A rescue helicopter was prevented from landing due to fierce enemy fire, and a squad was sent out to rescue the pilot and crew. Upon reaching the crash site, they saw a badly wounded soldier <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> the ground, and McCloughan ran [...] to him through an open field, dodging the fire of his unit and a charging NVA platoon. After reaching the wounded soldier, McCloughan carried him {{over his shoulder and}} ran back to Company C, thus saving the man from capture or death.|$|E
2500|$|In two {{accounts}}, Smith {{said that}} the Lord told him his sins were forgiven, that he should obey the commandments, {{that the world was}} corrupt, and that the Second Coming was approaching. Later accounts say that when the personages appeared, Smith asked them [...] "O Lord, what church shall I join?" [...] or [...] "Must I join the Methodist Church?" [...] In answer, he was told that [...] "all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom." [...] All churches and their professors were [...] "corrupt", and [...] "all their creeds were an abomination in his sight." [...] Smith was told not to join any of the churches, but that the [...] "fulness of the gospel" [...] would be made known to him at a later time. After the vision withdrew, Smith said he [...] "came to myself" [...] and found himself <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> his back.|$|E

2500|$|Anderson {{had told}} Starr on the {{sideline}} that he could pick up 8 to 10 yards on dump passes since the Dallas linebackers were laying back. [...] Starr used this tip to complete two passes to Anderson for 12 and 9 yards, gaining a key first down on the Dallas 30. Anderson juked linebacker Chuck Howley on both plays and ran by him as Howley <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> the icy turf. Mercein told Starr he was also open on the left, and Starr flipped him a pass that the fullback carried down to the Cowboys 11-yard line and out of bounds with 1:11 to play. Then Starr called a play he had kept ready for the right situation, 54-Give, a play that Lombardi frankly called the [...] "sucker" [...] play in the Packer playbook. Left guard Gale Gillingham pulled to his right {{like it was a}} typical sweep, and Cowboy right tackle Bob Lilly with his great reflexes instantly followed him. The Packers' left tackle Bob Skoronski blocked Cowboy end George Andrie and Mercein shot through the hole to the 3-yard line.|$|E
2500|$|On , Catherine rose {{early in}} the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon {{settling}} down to work on papers at her study. Her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, had asked the Empress if she had slept well, and Catherine reportedly replied she had not slept so well in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 that morning, Catherine went to her dressing room and collapsed from a stroke while on the toilet. Worried by Catherine's absence, her attendant, Zakhar Zotov, opened the door and peered in. Catherine was <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> the floor. Her face appeared purplish, her pulse was weak, and her breathing was shallow and laboured. The servants lifted Catherine from the floor and brought her to the bedroom. Some 45 minutes later, the royal court's Scottish physician, Dr. John Rogerson, arrived and determined that Catherine had suffered a stroke. Despite all attempts to revive the Empress, she fell into a coma from which she never recovered. Catherine was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45. An autopsy performed on her body the next day confirmed the cause of death as stroke. (Later, several unfounded stories circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Reports {{initially}} {{stated that}} Nagai {{was hit by}} stray bullets fired by soldiers or possibly shot from the front. The [...] "stray bullet" [...] explanation was proposed {{by the government of}} Myanmar as an explanation for Nagai's death. However, video footage obtained by Japanese television appears to show a Burmese soldier shoving Nagai to the ground and shooting him at point-blank range. A still image photographed by Adrees Latif showed the soldier standing over Nagai, who was <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> the ground and still clutching his camera. This photograph appeared {{on the front page of}} The New York Times on September 28, 2007. A subsequent shot showed Nagai's body sprawled in the street as the soldier walked away. Judging from the patch, the soldier responsible is believed to be from one of the Light Infantry Divisions (possibly LID 66) in charge of crowd control in Yangon at the time of protests. At the Japanese embassy in Myanmar, a physician established the trajectory of the fatal bullet that killed Nagai, determining that the bullet entered Nagai's chest from the lower right side and pierced his heart before exiting from his back.|$|E
