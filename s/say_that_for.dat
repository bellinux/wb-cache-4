25|$|Let's <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> at {{a certain}} {{ionization}} voltage, a singly charged hydrogen ion acquires a resulting velocity of Xms−1. A singly charged deuterium ion under the sample conditions would have acquired roughly X/1.41ms−1. If a detector was {{placed at a distance}} of 1m, the ion flight times would be 1/X and 1.41/Xs. Thus, the time of the ion arrival can be used to infer the ion type itself, if the evaporation time is known.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the radical}} anion is {{initially}} protonated determines {{the structure of}} the product. With an electron donor such as methoxy (MeO) or with an alkyl group, protonation has been thought by some investigators as being ortho (i.e. adjacent or 1,2) to the substituent. Other investigators have thought the protonation is meta (1,3) to the substituent. Arthur Birch favored meta protonation. With electron withdrawing substituents, protonation has been thought to occur {{at the site of the}} substituent (ipso), or para (1,4). Again, there has been varied opinion. A. J. Birch's empirical rules <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the donor substituents the final product has the maximum number of substituents on the final double bonds. For electron withdrawing groups the double bonds of the product avoid the substituents. The placement preference of groups in the mechanism and in the final product is termed regioselectivity.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{women in}} {{fundamentalist}} groups are often expected to rear children and other domestic tasks, {{it is not}} accurate to assume that all women in polygamous relationships in Mormon fundamentalist groups are powerless. Mormon women in fundamentalist groups experience their gender roles differently than women in the LDS church. In fundamentalists sects, sex {{is viewed as a}} necessary evil for reproduction. Women who are menstruating, lactating, or pregnant are not expected to have sex with their husbands. One fundamentalist women said that because her husband had other wives, she didn't feel pressured to sexually satisfy her husband. Fundamentalist women help their husbands seek other wives, and many <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> their husbands to look for a wife without consulting existing wives would be akin to infidelity. Some wives in polygamous marriages feel closer to their sister wives than to their husbands. In some polygamous relationships, a wife nurtures her husband's relationship with his other wives by encouraging her husband to spend time with them. Sister wives help each other with childrearing, cooking, and other domestic tasks. Women in polygamous relationships have their own bedrooms, while their husbands are treated as visitors. Sister wives also often control the household's finances. The studies that examined the experience of fundamentalist women did not examine underage marriage, which the authors felt was a separate issue. The 2008 police raid of the FLDS Texas compound found that 12 girls were married before age 16 and sexually abused.|$|E

Amanda Yeo of the website Gizmodo {{said that if the}} reader liked the Naga Hex, the Naga Hex v2 is a definite upgrade. She noted that newer users might be thrown off by the button configuration. Marshall Honorof's biggest criticism of the mouse was that [...] "most people won't need one", though he continued to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> those who do, it would work exactly as expected. He said that at first, the button arrangement threw him off. Michael Crider of Digital Trends said that once the user gets used to the button layout, the actions are [...] "quick and responsive." [...] Matthew Buzzi of PC Magazine also believed that the user would like it if they play MOBAs, but if not, another mouse might be a better option. He also asserted that the Naga Hex v2 is reliable and well made. Kane Fulton from Techradar listed the Naga Hex v2 as one of the ten best gaming mice.|$|E
500|$|The episode's plot is {{loosely based}} on the American comedy film Paper Moon, which was also the {{inspiration}} for Bart and Homer's swindle of Ned Flanders in the episode. The title of the episode is a parody of the 1981 film The Great Muppet Caper. The title was pitched by Simpsons writer Matt Selman. The episode's ending lampoons the cliche of having twist endings {{at the end of}} heist films. ”Magic Palace”, the magic-themed restaurant that the Simpsons visit {{in the beginning of the}} episode, is a parody on The Magic Castle, a nightclub in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles, California. Marge's line [...] "I didn't <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> clapping" [...] is a reference to a speech given by John Wayne while he was intoxicated. Homer wants to buy a singing rubber fish after their first con. At the end of the episode, Bart exclaims “Cowabunga!”, a catch-phrase of the main characters in the animated television series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In the scene where Grampa joins Bart and Homer, Grampa mentions the film The Sting II.|$|E
500|$|Michael Liedtke and George Avalos of the Contra Costa Times {{were pleased}} with the episode and wrote, [...] "The latest episode also {{contained}} many {{of the elements of}} a classic mythology episode. The stakes were huge and the heroes faced the greatest of hazards. The use of the oil rig created a sense of isolation for Mulder and Doggett, and the paranoia levels were sky-high. We still can't figure out why we haven't seen more episodes along the lines of Vienen during the past three seasons." [...] Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B–". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave Vienen a positive review, and wrote, [...] "after watching 'Vienen', I can honestly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> once of the few times this season, it felt good to be an X-Files fan again". Kessenich praised the significant development in Mulder and Scully's relationship and the return of the [...] "fourth season version" [...] of the black oil; the 1998 movie had dramatically altered the nature of the substanceinfected hosts gestate aliens inside their bodies rather than merely being taken over.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing the PSP port, Eric L. Patterson of Play {{was highly}} {{positive}} about the game's old-school mechanics {{and the chance to}} replay it with an improved localization and the Snow Queen route reinstated. He did <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> fans of the PlayStation 2 Persona games, [...] " [...] could very well feel like a punch to the face and a boot to the crotch." [...] Jeremy Parish, writing for 1UP.com, said that the way Persona broke away from RPG norms through the communication with demons during battle made it essential playing for fans of the genre. He was generally positive about most aspects apart from its visuals. Game Informers Joe Juba, despite noting awkward navigation and the inability to appreciate character and enemies designs due to their small sprite size, generally praised the game for improving on the original game's flaws. Ben Reeves, giving a second opinion on the game as part of the review, generally shared Juba's points of praise, though found the minimap inadequate. GameSpot's Lark Anderson was more critical than most, praising the story and improved localization, but finding the combat, navigation and graphics fairly dated compared to both recent and contemporary RPGs. IGN's Sam Bishop shared critiques about the graphics with other reviewers, but enjoyed most other parts of the game, and particularly appreciated the inclusion of the Snow Queen route. RPGamer's Glenn Wilson and RPGFan's Neal Chandran generally echoed other reviewers' sentiments: Wilson cited it as a less enjoyable game than the PlayStation 2 Persona entries while still being a quality project, and Chandran called it [...] "a killer trip down memory lane with a pair of high-definition rose-colored glasses." [...] Shin Megami Tensei: Persona was also awarded RPGFan's Editor's Choice Award.|$|E

And anything of value must accept this because it must not prostitute itself; its strength is to be prepared to waste itself, if it does not get its opportunity.

2500|$|Issues {{with the}} {{originally}} released figures were raised following an appraisal of large scale bombing raids during the Second World War.

James Corum uses the figure of forty tons of bombs dropped on Guernica, and calculates that if the figure of 1654 dead is accepted as accurate then the raid caused 41 fatalities per ton of bombs. By way of comparison the Dresden air raid during February 1945 which saw 3,431tons of bombs dropped on the city caused fewer deaths per ton of bombs: 7.2–10.2 fatalities per ton of bombs dropped.
