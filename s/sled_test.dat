"Mass {{transportation}} systems and specifically bus systems {{are a key}} element of the national transportation network. According to the Traffic Safety Facts report from 1999 - 2001, total of 333 fatal involvements of transit bus operators in fatal crashes have been reported from 284, 000 bus related traffic accidents. Thus bus occupant safety research is an effort for the enhancement of bus operator safety. Crashes resulting in injuries were distributed between front, door side, driver side and rear collisions. This study is aimed at the evaluation of potential bus operator injuries during different accident scenarios of a mass transit bus in frontal, side and rear crashes. Dynamic <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> of the bus operator and its environment are first conducted at National Institute for Aviation Research. From Numerical models of the crash event including bus and bus operator are developed using the MADYMO and LSDYNA codes, and validated against the experimental <b>sled</b> <b>tests.</b> Validation is carried out by comparing the kinematics of the bus operator represented by a Hybrid III ATD in actual <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> and simulations.

40|$|For {{persons with}} disabilities, access to {{transportation}} {{is necessary for}} integration into society. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) {{has been instrumental in}} assuring transportation access to individuals with disabilities for purposes of employment, education, and recreation. A substantial number of wheelchair users {{may not be able to}} transfer from their wheelchair to a motor vehicle seat during transportation. It is necessary to afford these wheelchair users the same level of safety as occupants seated in motor vehicle seats. The purpose of this study was to investigate the response of a manual wheelchair used as a motor vehicle seat, while the motor vehicle is subjected to rear impact. The specific aims of the study were to (1) identify the most common wheelchair failure mechanisms in a forward facing manual wheelchair subjected to rear impact, (2) develop and validate a computer simulation model of a wheelchair and seated occupant in rear impact, (3) develop wheelchair manufacturer transportation safety design guidelines under rear impact conditions for adult manual wheelchairs, by defining critical loads, wheelchair response, and common failure mechanisms, and (4) develop Wheelchair Tiedown and Occupant Restraint System (WTORS) manufacturer safety design guidelines under rear impact conditions for securing adult manual wheelchairs, by defining critical loads. In the first part of the study, several rear impact <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with a commercial, WC 19, manual wheelchair in its original configuration.

Buses are one of the safest forms of transportation. Nonetheless, bus crashes resulting in occupant injuries and fatalities do occur. Each year, more than 5, 800 children die, nearly 120, 000 are permanently disabled, and more than 14 million are hurt seriously enough to require emergency medical care due to unintentional injury. Therefore, effort is needed to improve the performance of bus interior and structure. Child Safety is a continuing effort to improve the safety of children in mass transit buses. This project provides an overview of the implementation of two types of attachment systems Child Restraint Systems (CRS) in a mass transit buses. A series of <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the Child Restraint Systems for typical frontal, side and rear crash scenarios. The results of the test indicate that the implementation of ISOFIX or LATCH attachments in transit bus seats mitigates the risk of severe injuries to the 12 month-old, and 3 year-old occupants; while not increasing the risk of severe injuries due to CRS interactions to other unrestraint adult passengers. In the next phase of this research, results from these <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were validated using the multibody analysis tool MADYMO to evaluate the performance of child safety in mass transit buses using the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS 208) injury criteria.

Extensive validations of the human body model have been made against Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHS) responses for the frontal and side impacts, as well as belt and surrogate airbag loading under various conditions of fifteen sets of pendulum tests performed and published by various researchers.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance of CSS in far-side impacts through a series of <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> conducted at varying test speeds. Forty eight <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted at three speeds (24 km/h, 29 km/h and 36 km/h), under two different CSS attachment conditions (LATCH and seat belt attached), using rear facing and forward facing CSS from four different manufacturers. Analyses were conducted to examine head retention within the CSS, velocity of the head as it passes an imaginary plane (cross over into other occupant space or door), lateral trajectory of the head and knee; head, chest and pelvis accelerations; neck and lumbar loads and moments. In addition to these parameters, the CSS were visually inspected for structural integrity after each test. Results from these <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> highlighted the differential performance of CSS in far-side impacts. During the tests, all CSS experienced significant lateral movement irrespective of attachment type. In rear facing CSS tests, one of the designs failed as the seat disengaged from its base. In forward facing CSS tests, it was observed that the seat belt attached CSS experienced less rotational motion than the LATCH attached CSS. ATD head retention within the seat was not achieved with either CSS attachments at any speed.

The {{aircraft}} seat dynamic performance standards as per CFR 14 FAR Part 23, and 25 requires the seat to demonstrate crashworthy performance as evaluated using two tests namely Test-I and Test-II conditions. Test-I dynamic test includes a combined vertical and longitudinal dynamic load to demonstrate the compliance of lumbar load requirement for a Hybrid II or an FAA Hybrid III Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD). The purpose of this test is to evaluate {{the means by which}} the lumbar spine of the occupant in an impact landing can be reduced. This test requirement is mandatory with every change in the seat design or the cushion geometry. Experimental full-scale crash testing is expensive and time-consuming event when required to demonstrate the compliance issue. A validated computational technique in contrast provides an opportunity for the cost effective and fast certification process. This study mainly focuses on the characteristics of DAX foams, typically used as aircraft seat cushions, as obtained both at quasi-static loading rate and at high loading rate. Nonlinear finite element models of the DAX foam are developed based on the experimental test data from laboratory test results conducted at different loading rates.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance of CSS in far-side impacts through a series of <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> conducted at varying test speeds. Forty eight <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted at three speeds (24 km/h, 29 km/h and 36 km/h), under two different CSS attachment conditions (LATCH and seat belt attached), using rear facing and forward facing CSS from four different manufacturers. Analyses were conducted to examine head retention within the CSS, velocity of the head as it passes an imaginary plane (cross over into other occupant space or door), lateral trajectory of the head and knee; head, chest and pelvis accelerations; neck and lumbar loads and moments. In addition to these parameters, the CSS were visually inspected for structural integrity after each test. Results from these <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> highlighted the differential performance of CSS in far-side impacts. During the tests, all CSS experienced significant lateral movement irrespective of attachment type. In rear facing CSS tests, one of the designs failed as the seat disengaged from its base. In forward facing CSS tests, it was observed that the seat belt attached CSS experienced less rotational motion than the LATCH attached CSS. ATD head retention within the seat was not achieved with either CSS attachments at any speed. The findings from this study augment the current efforts to define regulatory sled setup procedure for far-side impact crashes involving children in CSS, which currently does not exist and will eventually further the protection of children in automobiles.
