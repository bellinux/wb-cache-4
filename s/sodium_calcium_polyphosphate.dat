40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{influence}} of the addition of some dispersing agents employed for maximizing the solid loading of calcium carbonate suspensions has been investigated. Three commercial deflocculants were used: trisodium orthophosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate and <b>sodium</b> <b>polyphosphate,</b> <b>Calcium</b> carbonate aqueous suspensions were prepared at various solid volume fractions (0. 270 to 0. 382). Rheological tests were carried out at 25 °C by using the rate controlled coaxial cylinder viscometer Rotovisko-Haake 20, system M 5 -osc., measuring device MV 1 P with serrated surfaces. The tests were performed under both continuous and oscillatory flow conditions. All the suspensions prepared without deflocculant show a rheological behavior of the shearthinning type; good correlations between relative viscosity and shear rate data were found by applying the Quemada model. The application of rheological techniques permitted to evaluate the efficiency of the dispersing agents employed. The sodium polyphosphate proved to be the most effective for the calcium carbonate slurries studied; the highest efficiency of polyphosphate can be explained {{on the basis of its}} oligomeric nature...|$|R
40|$|Current {{problems}} associated with bone allografts include risk of disease transmission, limited availability, and cost. Synthetic scaffolds have been proposed as substitute graft materials to address these issues. <b>Calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> is a novel synthetic scaffold material that has shown good mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Here, we evaluated <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> {{in terms of its}} ability to support cell proliferation and differentiation in vivo. Calcium polypho-sphate, morsellized cancellous bone, and hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate particles were seeded with marrow stro-mal cells and implanted subcutaneously in the back of NOD/Scid mice. At 7, 14, and 28 days the samples were harvested and the proliferation characteristics and gene expression were analyzed. All tested graft materials had similar prolifer-ation characteristics and gene expression. The subcutaneous environment had a stronger impact on the proliferation and differentiation of the cells than the scaffold material itself. However, it was shown that <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> is superior to hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate and bone in its ability to support cell survival in vivo. The study confirmed that <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> has potential for replacing morsellized cancellous bone as a graft material for bone regeneration...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{degradation}} kinetics of <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> bioceramic was studied. Liquid state 31 P {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to characterize the product. The in vitro degradation test was carried out at 37 °C for up to 48 hours for both the simulation solution and the extreme solution.

The {{results indicated that the}} degradability of <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> increased with the decrease of pH value, and the sample showed a rapid loss of ion concentration within the initial period of immersion followed by a slower loss ratio.

We herewith present data that demonstrate unambiguously that the completely synthetic complex forms channels that are indistinguishable in their voltage-dependent conductance, in their selectivity for divalent cations, and in their blocking behavior (by La 3 +) from channels isolated from Escherichia coli.

50|$|It is now {{becoming}} clear that ankyrin-B {{exists in a}} biomolecular complex with the sodium potassium ATPase, <b>sodium</b> <b>calcium</b> exchanger and inositol triphosphate receptor which is localized in T-tubules within discrete microdomains of cardiomyocytes that are distinct from dyads formed by dihydropyridine receptors complexed to ryanodine receptors. The human ankyrin-B arrhythmogenic mutation (Glu1425Gly) blocks the formation of this complex, which provides a mechanism behind cardiac arrhythmias in patients. Studies from other labs have {{shed light on the}} requirement of ankyrin-B in the targeting and post-translational stability of the <b>sodium</b> <b>calcium</b> exchanger in cardiomyocytes, which is clinically important because elevated expression of the <b>sodium</b> <b>calcium</b> exchanger is a factor related to arrhythmia and heart failure. Ankyrin-B forms a membrane complex with ATP-sensitive potassium channels, which is necessary for normal channel trafficking and targeting the channel to sarcolemmal membranes; this interaction is also important in the response of cardiomyocytes to cardiac ischemia and metabolic regulation.|$|R
40|$|Biomaterials are {{non-viable}} substances formulated {{to interact}} with biological systems. An ideal biomaterial will be cytocompatible – it will not cause an adverse response in the body – and will have similar physical properties to the material it is replacing. Group 2 metal phosphates make good biomaterials as they are chemically similar to bone and teeth. The synthesis and structure of magnesium acid pyrophosphate, MgH_ 2 P_ 2 O_ 7 is reported. Attempts to dope calcium and magnesium acid pyrophosphates with metal cations to alter their physical and biological properties are described. The properties of a material can be modified by producing a composite. The interactions between a naturally occurring polymer, polyhydroxybutrate and <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> were investigated {{to see if a}} composite could be formed. It was found that polyhydroxybutrate decomposed at too low a temperature for a <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> composite to occur. The small piezoelectric properties of bone may assist the healing of any damage. γ-calcium polyphosphate may exhibit a piezoelectric effect. To measure this aligned crystals are required. γ-calcium polyphosphate was synthesised in magnetic and electric fields in an attempt to produce alignment. Although it was found fields did affect the product, it has not so far been possible to quantify or explain this effect...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{models for}} {{predicting}} build-up of solute on membrane surface were formulated in this paper.

Feed water used in the experiments contained varying concentrations of <b>sodium,</b> <b>calcium,</b> combined <b>sodium</b> and <b>calcium.</b> In order to study the effect of <b>sodium</b> and <b>calcium</b> ions on membrane performance, experiments with ground water and secondary effluent wastewater were also performed. Build-up of salts on the membrane surface was calculated by measuring concentrations of <b>sodium</b> and <b>calcium</b> ions in feed water permeate and reject streams using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Multiple linear regression of natural logarithmic transformation was used to develop the model based on four main parameters that affect the build-up of solute in a small scale of RO namely applied pressure, permeate flux, membrane resistance, and feed concentration. Experimental data obtained in a small scale RO unit were used to develop the empirical model. The predicted values of theoretical build-up of <b>sodium</b> and <b>calcium</b> on membrane surface were found in agreement with experimental data.
