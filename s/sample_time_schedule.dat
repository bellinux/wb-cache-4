40|$|This {{study is}} to assess {{pharmacokinetic}} (PK) <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> <b>schedules</b> and trial size requirements of drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies for CYP 2 C 9, based on S-warfarin population PK models. S-warfarin plasma concentrations from eight DDI studies were utilized to develop S-warfarin population PK models. Optimal PK <b>sampling</b> <b>times</b> were obtained that minimized mean squared error of geometric mean of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0 -∞)). The powers and type I error rates of testing the equivalences of the geometric means of AUC(0 -∞) only and AUC(0 -∞) and maximum concentration (C (max)), jointly, were assessed via simulation for two-by-two cross-over designs. The results were compared to those from three bioequivalence sample size calculation methods. Two-compartment population PK models with first order absorption were established for non-Asian and Asian subjects. The optimal PK <b>sampling</b> <b>times</b> of size 17 per individual per period {{were found to be}} 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0, 6. 0, 10. 0, 12. 0, 16. 0, 24. 0, 36. 0, 48. 0, 60. 0, 72. 0, 96. 0, 120. 0, 144. 0 h post a single oral dose of 25 mg warfarin. For non-Asian subjects, the minimum numbers of subjects required per trial with the optimal PK sampling schedule to achieve 80 % power and 5 % type I error rate, ranged from 6 to 19 for the equivalence of AUC(0 -∞) and C (max) jointly. It has been demonstrated that appropriately selected PK <b>sampling</b> <b>time</b> points can greatly increase the corresponding power of the study without increasing the number of subjects, especially when the true ratio is near the default bioequivalence boundary (0. 8 - 1. 25) ...|$|R
40|$|Networked Control System (NCS) {{has gained}} the {{popularity}} recently due to low {{installation and maintenance}} cost, high reliability, and less wiring. This control approach of NCS differs from traditional control system since controller and plant are physically separated and connected through a communication network. Despite these advantages that the system offers, the main challenge of NCS is networkedinduced delay that occurs while data is exchanged between components. Data <b>Sampling</b> <b>Time</b> <b>scheduling</b> with Offset (DSTOS) algorithm is an existing method {{and one of the}} effective approaches developed to handle time delays by allocating data according to priority for linear order system. In this work, the NCS of non-linear 2 -link planar robot is developed based on Controller Area Network (CAN) where Proportional and Derivative (PD) controller is adapted to form a closed loop system. Based on this configuration, DSTOS algorithm is reconfigured for non-linear system and implemented such that the assignment of message priority is assigned according to the calculated Maximum Allowable Loop Delay (MALD) in every loop to reduce network delay. The NCS of 2 -Link planar robot is formed based on two loops which consist of two sensor nodes, two actuator nodes and two controller nodes that perform data exchange in CAN 2. 0 A data frames under various CAN speeds. Simulations are performed by using MATLAB/SIMULINK with TrueTime Toolbox. Analysis of simulation results shows that the CAN-based non-linear system is able to accommodate this method and meets the real time and control requirements. By using DSTOS algorithm, the maximum data latency of control loops is reduced by almost 15 % as compared to system without DSTOS. The reduction in link angle error is evident based on low value of IAE index. DSTOS also promotes lower energy consumption of DC servomotor which is important especially for industr...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{perspectives}} {{offered by}} multi-channel SDR set, digital signal processors (DSP) need to simultaneously execute several radio physical layer (PHY) components. One major challenge in integrating together such DSP applications {{is the real}} time requirements that must be satisfied.

Designers of such DSP applications have resort to ad hoc methods and perform pre-runtime real <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> by hand. Since the complexity, due to the different combinatorial of waveforms, keeps growing, ad hoc and manual methods will prone to errors, time consuming and will often fail to find feasible schedule even when one exists.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of virtual <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> to the request admission mechanism used in the IEEE 802. 14 MAC protocol. For each contention minislot, arrivals within a certain interval are allowed to contend for transmission. The length of this interval is determined using one of two clock increments, {{depending on whether the}} virtual time lags behind the actual time or not. The virtual time is based on a mapping involving the unused contention minislots, and the frame length. It is shown through simulation that virtual <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> enhances the system performance and results in a close to FCFS strategy. In addition, through the differential handling of virtual clocks of the different user classes, virtual <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> can be used to implement prioritized access.

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of its active metabolites 4 -methylamino-antipyrine (MAA) and 4 -amino-antipyrine (AA) in male piglets after a single intramuscular injection of MT. Eight healthy male piglets were administered MT (100 mg/kg) intramuscularly. Blood was <b>sampled</b> at <b>scheduled</b> <b>time</b> intervals, and drug plasma concentrations evaluated by a validated HPLC method. MAA and AA plasma concentrations were quantitatively detectable from 0. 25 to 48 h and 0. 50 to 72 h, respectively, in 6 of 8 and 7 of 8 animals. The average maximum concentrations of MAA and AA were of 47. 59 and 4. 94 mg/mL, respectively. The average half-lives were 8. 57 and 13. 3 h for MAA and AA, respectively. This study showed that the amount of MAA and AA produced in piglets is different to that in the animal species previously investigated. Further studies are necessary to understand whether these differences in MAA and AA plasma concentrations between animal species necessitate diverse therapeutic drug dosing. 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

Piglets might experience pain following castration, tooth clipping and tail docking and experimental procedures. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the pharmacokinetics of T and its active metabolite M 1 in male piglets after a single intramuscular injection. Six healthy male piglets were administered T (5 mg/kg) intramuscularly. Blood was <b>sampled</b> at <b>scheduled</b> <b>time</b> intervals and drug plasma concentrations evaluated by a validated HPLC method. T plasma concentration was quantitatively detectable from 0. 083 to 8 h. M 1 was quantified over a shorter time period (0. 083 – 6 h) with a Tmax at 0. 821 h. The study demonstrated that piglets produce a larger amount of M 1 compared with dogs, horses and goats. The human minimum effective con- centration of M 1 (40 ng/mL) was exceeded for over 3 h in piglets. If it is assumed to also apply to piglets, it could be speculated that the drug efficacy might exert its action over 3 h or longer. This assumption has to be con- firmed by further specific pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies...|$|R

We have arguments that it is not possible. Therefore we study UCTP with the assumption that each room belongs to exactly one type of room. A type of room is a set of rooms, which have similar properties. We prove that in this case UCTP is polynomially reducible to <b>time</b> <b>scheduling.</b> Hence we solve UCTP with the following method: at first we solve <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> and subsequently we solve space scheduling with a polynomial O(n 3) algorithm. In this way we obtain a radical (exponential) speed-up of algorithms for UCTP. The method was applied at P. J. Šafárik University...|$|R

Following the approach by Battese and Coelli (1995), we estimate a stochastic production frontier and the determinants of technical efficiency simultaneously. The innovation of our study is that we draw on technical efficiency instead of productivity to appraise the success of flexible working hours. The results indicate that while the use of work <b>time</b> <b>schedules</b> with moderate flexibility is positively related to technical efficiency, highly flexible work time arrangements seem to be negatively correlated with an efficient organization of the work flow. However, these efficiency losses should not be interpreted as causal effects, because highly flexible work <b>time</b> <b>schedules</b> {{are most likely to be}} introduced in struggling firms.
