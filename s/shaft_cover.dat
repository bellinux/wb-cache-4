50|$|Internally {{the first}} floor of the Customs House is {{arranged}} with a large central space, the Long Room, under the dome, and two long rooms flanking this along the sides of the building and articulated externally as the end bays. The flanking rooms are long spaces with plastered ceilings and walls, elaborate cornice and high timber skirting. Generally these rooms retain much of their original fittings, including joinery, plaster ceiling roses, ventilation <b>shaft</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shaft {{must pass}} a test before being hired for the job; the test {{involves}} him surviving in a small, overheated room without water, and a floor covered in deep sand, mimicking the supposed conditions of Africa. <b>Shaft</b> <b>covers</b> {{himself with the}} sand, thereby avoiding heatstroke and winning the contract from his employer. Shaft must then embark upon a mission to infiltrate and destroy a human trafficking and slavery ring in West Africa and France.|$|R

5000|$|The Sandscale Mining Company {{was formed}} in 1877 {{by members of the}} Millom & Askham Company. The lease was signed by the then {{landowner}} Thomas Woodburne. [...] Thomas Woodburne also built Sandscale cottages in 1882, which were rented to the mine captains. The mines were taken over by Kennedy Brothers in 1893 and worked until 1905 but the pumps were kept running at Sandscale No2 to assist at Roanhead. The steam pumping engine was replaced by an electric pump in 1928. The headgear was removed and the <b>shaft</b> <b>covered</b> in 1937.|$|R

50|$|The Wico Command Control {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of a stick that differed radically from the Atari pattern in mechanical terms. Wico was a major supplier of arcade game joysticks and adapted these mechanisms for home use. These replaced the membrane switches with leaf switches that were much more robust and provided the reentering force internally. A large block of plastic provided the moving surface similar to the hemisphere in the CX40, but was shaped to provide more obvious directions when pressed. The stick, a steel <b>shaft</b> <b>covered</b> in a bat-like red plastic moulding, featured a button on top that pressed a shaft running {{through the center of the}} stick to another switch below the main assembly.|$|R
25|$|The caves {{under the}} {{enclosure}} are not themselves generally accessible; the waqf have historically prevented {{access to the}} actual tombs {{out of respect for}} the dead. Only two entrances are known to exist, the most visible of which is located to the immediate southeast of Abraham's cenotaph {{on the inside of the}} southeastern section. This entrance is a narrow <b>shaft</b> <b>covered</b> by a decorative grate, which itself is covered by an elaborate dome. The other entrance is located to the southeast, near the mihrab, and is sealed by a large stone, and usually covered by prayer mats; this is very close to the location of the seventh step on the outside of the enclosure, beyond which the Mamelukes forbade Jews from approaching.|$|R
50|$|Supporting {{pillars of}} cannel were accidentally ignited in the Cannel seam in March 1737 and the {{underground}} fire was still {{burning in the}} October despite the ventilation <b>shafts</b> being <b>covered.</b> The fire was eventually extinguished in 1738 after the sough was dammed and the workings flooded.|$|R
50|$|Most mine shafts are capped, {{meaning a}} large {{concrete}} plug around 3 feet thick is {{placed over the}} <b>shaft</b> to <b>cover</b> it and stop fatal accidents from occurring. Some mines are capped using large metallic grills, this usual occurs on deep level shafts so airflow through the deep tunnels helps prevent subsidence.|$|R
50|$|Limewash was {{normally}} {{applied to}} magazines' exterior walls. Care {{was taken to}} minimise and isolate the explosives from damp, heat and grit. The magazine structures incorporated insulated walls and were designed to create a naturally and reasonably cooled and ventilated environment. Their ventilation <b>shafts</b> were <b>covered</b> by metal ventilation louvers, coupled with spark arrestors and dust deflectors.|$|R
50|$|Male galagos species possess very {{distinctive}} penile morphology {{that can}} be used to classify species. In O. crassicaudatus, the penis is on average 20 mm in length and increases in width towards the distal tip. The baculum clearly protrudes from the end. The glans and <b>shaft</b> are <b>covered</b> in single keratinized penile spines that point towards the body.|$|R
50|$|The {{heating and}} {{ventilating}} {{system of the}} Mark 2 was not considered adequate for the more upmarket S-Type and was replaced with an improved system. Separate control of ventilation direction was provided for both driver and front seat passenger. Warm air could also be directed to the rear passengers through an outlet situated on the propeller <b>shaft</b> tunnel <b>cover</b> between the two front seats.|$|R
5000|$|Unique to {{this world}} is a {{peculiar}} type of quartz-like crystal {{that can be found}} in various caves throughout the Land. The Sleestaks often use Pakuni slave labor to mine these special crystals which can function as an energy source. In [...] "Kevin vs. the Volcano", Kevin falls down a <b>shaft</b> <b>covered</b> in Sleestak markings (often marked by pictographs of lizards) and finds a huge shard nearly twice his size. Exposure to the sun reactivates this crystal and it causes it to pulsate, exerting a force which draws Kevin towards it when he tries to climb out of the shaft. Tom posits that the Sleestaks probably used these giant crystals to power their underground cities. It also might have been placed as a controlling device (not unlike the pylons from the 1970s series) for a nearby volcano as its destruction somehow reverses the volcano's eruption. In [...] "Power Play", the Porters use the smaller pieces to act as surrogate [...] "batteries" [...] to run their flashlights and portable devices, but larger crystals (like Shung's) are much more powerful.|$|R
50|$|The penile {{morphology}} of {{some types}} of strepsirrhine primates has provided information about their taxonomy. Male galago species possess very distinctive penile morphology {{that can be used}} to classify species. In O. crassicaudatus, the penis is on average 20 mm in length and increases in width towards the distal tip. The baculum clearly protrudes from the end. The glans and <b>shaft</b> are <b>covered</b> in single keratinized spines that point towards the body.|$|R
60|$|With great caution we {{approached}} the <b>shaft,</b> under <b>cover</b> of darkness. At a distance of several miles I caused the fleet to be halted, and from there Carthoris went ahead alone upon a one-man flier to reconnoitre. In perhaps half an hour he returned to report {{that there was no}} sign of a patrol boat or of the enemy in any form, and so we moved swiftly and noiselessly forward once more toward Omean.|$|R

During mating, {{the heads}} {{on one side}} [...] "shut down" [...] and do not grow in size; {{the other two are}} used to release semen into the female's two-branched reproductive tract. Each time it copulates, it alternates heads in sets of two. When not in use, the penis is retracted inside a preputial sac in the cloaca. The male echidna's penis is [...] long when erect, and its <b>shaft</b> is <b>covered</b> with penile spines. These may be used to induce ovulation in the female.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the filming, the Vampire dugout {{entrance}} <b>shaft</b> was <b>covered</b> {{again to}} ensure its preservation, and the dugout allowed to refill with water. Having been preserved in this manner for 90 years, the archaeologists felt that this was the best course of action. This was in light of previous experience with similar structures, such as the Bremen Redoubt, which were lost due to timber degradation in the dry atmosphere. Vampire, inaccessible to the public as it is located on private property, is inspected every year by local battlefield historians.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of the pottery vessels are low, outflaring-sided vessels with a matte orange slipped surface (Aquilla Orange). Some darkening occurring from firing is evident. Also, a blotchy post-fire darkening is apparent {{on some of the}} vessels. It appears that artifacts were placed {{in the bottom of the}} vessels. The vessels placed in, rather than around, the <b>shaft</b> were <b>covered</b> with incense which was burnt long enough to darken the vessels before their deposition. Also, several cylindrical censers were recovered which are similar to those later placed in the shaft.|$|R

[...] They run beneath North Bergen, Union City, and Weehawken, to the east portals at the east edge of 10th Avenue at 32nd Street in Manhattan. (Since 1968 the east portals have been hidden beneath 450 West 33rd Street {{on the east side of}} 10th Ave.) When the top of the Weehawken <b>Shaft</b> was <b>covered</b> is a mystery; the two tracks may have {{remained}} open to the sky until catenary was added circa 1932.|$|R
50|$|High-resolution {{multiturn}} potentiometers {{are used}} in a few precision applications. These have wirewound resistance elements typically wound on a helical mandrel, with the wiper moving on a helical track as the control is turned, making continuous contact with the wire. Some include a conductive-plastic resistance coating over the wire to improve resolution. These typically offer ten turns of their <b>shafts</b> to <b>cover</b> their full range. They are usually set with dials that include a simple turns counter and a graduated dial, and can typically achieve three digit resolution. Electronic analog computers used them in quantity for setting coefficients, and delayed-sweep oscilloscopes of recent decades included one on their panels.|$|R

50|$|After the Second World War, {{members of}} the Slovene Home Guard and other armed groups {{subordinate}} to the German forces were killed and buried in a mass grave east of the village known as the Double Shaft by Cink Cross Mass Grave (Grobišče Dvojno brezno pri Cink križu). The victims {{are believed to have}} been transported to the site from the prison in Novo Mesto. The shafts are located at the crossroads to Cink on the road from Podstenice. The opening is 21 m long, starting below an old beech grove and continuing along a fence. The bottoms of both <b>shafts</b> are <b>covered</b> by large rocks that fell there from the surface and the entryways to the shafts were dynamited.
