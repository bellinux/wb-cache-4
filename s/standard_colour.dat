5|$|The {{decision}} to adopt blue as the <b>standard</b> <b>colour</b> was subsequently reversed and Brunswick green {{was introduced in}} November 1951 with No. 46232 Duchess of Montrose. Between October 1955 and December 1957, all 38 locomotives carried it concurrently, the only livery the entire class carried.|$|E
5|$|From 1879, more {{locomotives}} were needed, and {{the design}} was updated and 24 were delivered between 1879 and 1885. Originally they were painted bright olive green lined in black and yellow, chimneys copper capped with the locomotive number in brass figures at the front and domes of polished brass. In 1885, the colour changed to a dark red known as Midcared, and this was to remain the <b>standard</b> <b>colour,</b> taken up as the colour for the Metropolitan line by London Transport in 1933. When in 1925 the Met classified its locomotives by letters of the alphabet, these were assigned A Class and B Class. When the M was being built, it was considered that they would struggle on the gradients and five Worcester Engine 0-6-0 tank locomotives were delivered in 1868. It was soon found that A and B Classes could manage trains without difficulty and the 0-6-0Ts were sold to the Taff Vale Railway in 1873 and 1875.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1859 {{there was}} no <b>standard</b> <b>colour,</b> {{although}} {{there is evidence that}} the lettering and Royal Cypher were sometimes picked out in gold. In 1859, a bronze green colour became standard until 1874. Initially, it was thought that the green colour would be unobtrusive. Too unobtrusive, as it turned out — people kept walking into them. Red became the <b>standard</b> <b>colour</b> in 1874, although ten more years elapsed before every box in the UK had been repainted.|$|E

25|$|A long gown (a bit {{similar to}} a cassock) with a long row of buttons (traditionally, 33, but {{nowadays}} usually fewer) in front and a train at the back (which in the current costume is not visible but attached with a button in the inner side of the gown).

25|$|Standard fibres {{used for}} the frock coat {{included}} wool and vicuña. The most common weave was known as broadcloth. The <b>standard</b> <b>colour</b> of a frock coat was solid black, but later, in the Victorian era, charcoal grey became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the revers was lined with black silk facings (either satin or grosgrain). For funerals black frock coats without self-faced revers were worn with a matching black waistcoat.|$|E
25|$|K3, {{introduced}} in 1929, again by Giles Gilbert Scott, {{was similar to}} K2 but was constructed from concrete and intended for nationwide use. Cheaper than the K2, it was still significantly more costly than the K1 and so that remained the choice for low-revenue sites. The <b>standard</b> <b>colour</b> scheme for both the K1 and the K3 was cream, with red glazing bars. A rare surviving K3 kiosk can be seen beside the Penguin Beach exhibit at ZSL London Zoo, {{where it has been}} protected from the weather by the projecting eaves and recently restored to its original colour scheme. There is also one other in use at Rhynd in Perthshire.|$|E

25|$|The {{system was}} finally {{identified}} for replacement following an accident at Kensal Green, when a main line train {{ran into the}} back of Bakerloo Line train. The driver had apparently mistaken the calling on aspect for a normal yellow aspect (the signal was temporarily operating on a maximum yellow due to track side work). The indications were that the driver was distracted as his pay slip and its envelope were recovered from the wreckage – but this was never proved as the cause. It was also suggested that the driver may not even have checked the indications having observed the fall of the train stop. The entire line was resignalled to the <b>standard</b> <b>colour</b> light system in 1988.|$|E
25|$|This scheme, on {{the face}} of it, was a fairly <b>standard</b> <b>colour</b> light system, with each stop signal (which could show red or green) having an {{attendant}} repeater signal (showing red, yellow or green – the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). What made the scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional signal head ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This marker light was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the marker light was offset to the left-hand side of the post to indicate that the 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two.|$|E

K8 was introduced in 1968 designed by Bruce Martin. It was used primarily for new sites; around 11000 were installed, replacing earlier models only when they needed relocating or had been damaged beyond repair. The K8 retained a red colour scheme, but it was a different shade of red: a slightly brighter [...] "Poppy Red", which went on to be the <b>standard</b> <b>colour</b> across all kiosks.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 February 1943, 3801 {{worked the}} Newcastle Flyer {{for the first}} time. When joined by 3802 in April 1943, these engines were allotted to working the Melbourne Limited expresses between Sydney and Goulburn. In early 1947 3801 was given a heavy {{overhaul}} and was painted in its <b>standard</b> <b>colour</b> scheme of green with yellow lining. A Waratah emblem {{was added to the}} top of the nose cone in later years. In 1955 3801 was overhauled again, being painted black with red lining as a cost-cutting measure. It was around this time that diesel locomotives started appearing on the rails of NSW. These would take the [...] "glamour workings" [...] away from the 38 class, who would be confined to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. In December 1956 3801 was the first in its class to accrue 1 million miles (1.61 million kilometres).|$|E

2500|$|The {{zeal for}} {{modernisation}} in the Beeching era drove the next rebranding exercise, and BR management wished to divest the organisation of anachronistic, heraldic motifs {{and develop a}} corporate identity to rival that of London Transport. BR's design panel set up a working party led by Milner Gray of the Design Research Unit. They drew up a Corporate Identity Manual which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation, specifying Rail Blue and pearl grey as the <b>standard</b> <b>colour</b> scheme for all rolling stock; Rail Alphabet as the standard corporate typeface, designed by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert; and introducing the now-iconic Corporate Identity Symbol of the [...] "Double Arrow" [...] logo. Designed by Gerald Barney (also of the DRU), this arrow device was formed of two interlocked arrows across two parallel lines, symbolising a double track railway. It was likened to {{a bolt of lightning}} or barbed wire, and also acquired a nickname: [...] "the arrow of indecision". A mirror image of the double arrow was used on the port side of BR-owned Sealink ferry funnels. [...] The new BR corporate identity and Double Arrow were rolled out in 1965, and the brand name of the organisation was truncated to [...] "British Rail".|$|E
