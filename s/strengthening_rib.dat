40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper was the {{optimization}} design of heavy strength carriage for 50 t heavy-duty truck. Two optimization schemes B and C were provided based on original scheme A, which have different thickness of sole/side plate and main longitudinal girder and different number of <b>strengthening</b> <b>ribs.</b> ANSYS was used to do the finite element analysis of equivalent stress and elastic displacement of truck carriages. The equivalent stress of main longitudinal girder, soleplate and transverse bars of soleplate will increase when the soleplate’s thickness was reduced. The maximum of equivalent stress will increase 13 %~ 15 % with 1 mm reduction. When the thickness of side plate or the number of side plate’s <b>strengthening</b> <b>ribs</b> was reduced, the elastic displacement of side plate would increase. Scheme C fulfilled the requirement of structure strength, in which the elastic displacement increases in the allowable range and the lightening ratio was 12. 6 %. Scheme B didn’t fulfill the requirement of structure strength.

50|$|Other {{signs of}} the Morris origins of the design were the {{crankcase}} being cast with <b>strengthening</b> <b>ribs</b> (a feature not introduced to the A-Series until 1980) and the big end bearings being split diagonally rather than horizontally. The C-Series also had a hydraulic tensioning unit for its timing chain and had the oil pump and distributor driven via separate sets of skew-cut gears on the camshaft. This was relatively unusual for mass-produced engines of the time; the A- and B-Series engines, and most of their contemporaries, had both oil pump and distributor driven by one shaft driven from one skew gear. The C-Series' arrangement reduced load on the gears and therefore wear, preventing the ignition timing falling out of specification over time.|$|R

40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, increasing ecological concerns and demands for higher performance have become lightweight construction a key aspect. Due to the gradual introduction of high strength materials {{on the one}} side, and greater consideration with regard to continuous manufacturing technologies on the other side, it is possible nowadays to address the demands that structural and complex automotive parts have to face, {{from the standpoint of}} lightweight manufacturing. Thickness, shape and impact conditions constitute the main aspects to consider for such parts and shape conditions in particular require from complex, costly and lengthy procedures, especially when discontinuous forming operations such as stamping and hydro forming procedures are selected. However, continuous forming operations like Roll Forming (RF) can prove to be advantageous and suited for scalable parts (e. g in length) {{and at the same time}} be economically reasonable. RF lines as well generally incorporate additional installations to perform multiple forming operations destined to imprint <b>strengthening</b> <b>ribs</b> perform punching operations or weld certain parts. It is in this context where the usefulness of the electromagnetic forming technology for completion of auxiliary operations can be proven, given its flexibility and reasonable investment costs. Electromagnetic forming (EMF) is a contact-free technique where large forces can be imparted to a conductive metallic workpiece by a pure electromagnetic interaction. The produced electromagnetic pressure can produce stresses in the workpiece that are several times larger than the material flow stress. Ultimately this can cause the workpiece to deform plastically and to be accelerated achieving high velocities. Once the velocity is imparted to the workpiece, the shape can be developed either by free or die forming. The work described in this paper explores the potential of the EMF process to adequately form shallow longitudinal ribs or stiffeners in components previously formed utilizing an innovative concept called Flexible Roll Forming, developed at The Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany, by means of magnetic pulse forming, maintaining the integrity of the workpiece while trying to meet industry standard tolerances. Profiles exhibiting hat-like cross sections made of AHSS steels were subjected to localized impulses in order to achieve strengthening features in the roll formed part. ZStE 340 steel alloy profiles were first roll formed and then inserted in the EM forming installation designed for the occasion. A high strength copper alloy (Cr-Zr-Cu) was used as a conductor for the single turn coil, placed opposite to the sidewall in the moment of the energy delivery. Formed specimens were subsequently measured to account for existing dimensional deviations...|$|R

40|$|Uncinate {{processes}} are ossified projections that extend posteriorly from the proximal {{surface of the}} vertebral ribs (Fig. · 1) in all extant birds except the emu Dromaius novaehollandiae and the screamers (Anhimidae) (Bellairs and Jenkin, 1960). The function of the uncinate processes and associated muscle (Mm appendicocostales) is unknown. Based on a two-dimensional model reconstruction, Zimmer (1935) concluded that uncinate processes facilitate {{the movement of the}} ribs forward, which he interpreted as aiding inspiration. Alternatively, uncinate processes have been hypothesised to be an adaptation for flight (Welty and Baptista, 1988), a site for the attachment of respiratory and shoulder muscles (Hildebrand, 1982) or to <b>strengthen</b> the <b>rib</b> cage mechanically (Kardong, 1988). These hypotheses, however, remain untested. The hypotheses that the uncinates are a prerequisite for flight, or components of an air-sac system, are refuted by the existence of the screamers (Anhimidae). Screamers are widespread in the wetlands of South America and consist of at least four species, all of which lack uncinates but are capable of powered flight, walking and swimming (Del Hoyo et al., 1992 - 1999). As for the importance of uncinate processes as sites of attachment for respiratory or locomotor muscles, these functions are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and definitive experiments have yet to be conducted to test hypotheses regarding breathing and locomotion in birds. There is, however, evidence that the hypaxial muscles contribute to locomotion in birds (Boggs, 1997; Nassar et al., 2001). There are few electromyographic (EMG) studies on the activity of the respiratory muscles in birds and, perhaps as the appendicocostalis muscle has traditionally been seen {{as an extension of the}} external intercostal musculature (Georg...|$|R

40|$|Globacrochordiceras transpacificum gen. et sp. nov. is an ammonoid (Ammonoidea, Cephalopoda) with a shell {{characterized}} by plicate ribbing (rounded and undulating <b>ribs</b> <b>strengthening</b> on the venter without interruption), increasing involution through ontogeny, overhanging and deep umbilical wall, absence of tuberculation, subtriangular whorl section, globose adult shape with a closed umbilicus {{followed by an}} abrupt egressive coiling, and a subammonitic adult suture line. This new taxon occurs in Nevada (USA) and in Guangxi (South China). It has its typical occurrence within the Neopopanoceras haugi Zone of late Spathian age (Early Triassic). The plicate ribbing, suture line and general shell shape are diagnostic of the family Acrochordiceratidae. The large adult size, high degree of involution and subammonitic suture line of Globacrochordiceras markedly contrast with the next younger genus of the family (Paracrochordiceras of early Anisian age, Middle Triassic), which is evolute and displays a ceratitic suture shape. Shell coiling and suture line of Globacrochordiceras are closer {{to that of the}} youngest member of the family: Acrochordiceras carolinae (late middle Anisian). The latter is the end-member of a long-term morphological evolutionary trend of the family during the early and middle Anisian. This trend composed of classical increases in adult size (Cope's rule), shell involution and suture indentation, lasted ca. four Myr. The sudden morphological evolutionary jump between Globacrochordiceras and Paracrochordiceras at the Spathian/Anisian (Early/Middle Triassic) boundary may correspond to a generalized morphological reset of long-term trends, a process that differs from classic paedomorphic transformations. A dramatic global sea level change and carbon isotope positive excursion at the Early/Middle Triassic boundary both indicate stressful environmental changes that may have triggered this evolutionary jump. doi: 10. 1002 /mmng. 201300010 </a...|$|R
