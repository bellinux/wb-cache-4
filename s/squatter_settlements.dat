5|$|The lack of {{good public}} housing, poor sanitation, and high {{unemployment}} led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. The Housing Development Board set up before independence {{continued to be}} largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters. Within a decade, {{the majority of the}} population had been housed in these apartments. The Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|According to the Provisional Population Totals 2011 {{census of}} India, the {{population}} of Gangtok Municipal Corporation has been estimated to be 98,658. Males constituted 53% {{of the population and}} females 47%. The Gangtok subdivision of the East Sikkim district had a population of 281,293, Gangtok has an average literacy rate of 82.17%, higher than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 85.33%, and female literacy is 78.68. About 8% of Gangtok's population live in the nine notified slums and <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements,</b> all on Government land. More people live in areas that depict slum-like characteristics but have not been notified as slums yet because they have developed on private land. Of the total urban population of Sikkim, Gangtok Municipal Corporation has a share of 55.5%. Including Gangtok, East District has a share of 88% of the total urban population. The quality of life, the pace of development and availability of basic infrastructure and employment prospects has been the major cause for rapid migration to the city. With this migration, the urban services are under pressure, intensified by the lack of availability of suitable land for infrastructure development.|$|E

The other deleterious effect of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> was that many of these were built of highly flammable materials, were poorly constructed and thus posed a high fire risk. A prominent example in this case is the Bukit Ho Swee Squatter Fire that broke out in 1961. In addition, there was poor sanitation, which led to the spread of infectious diseases.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{development}} and growth of <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> in African cities and the factors involved. It is argued that under intense urbanization, the number of urban migrants far exceeds {{the capacity of the}} receiving city to provide sufficient employment and housing opportunities. A certain segment of migrants, especially those with low level of skills, educational background, and support in the city of destination settle in the squatter area. Tema, an industrial and port city in Ghana, and its associated <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> of Ashaiman provide the test ground for this study. Analysis indicates while most of the initial settlers in the <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> came from the city, more and more urban migrants came directly to the settlement rather than through the city as the <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> established itself as a township. The socio-economic status of the respondents particularly their educational level and income was found to be crucial factors in their residential location decisions. Another important factor was ethnic ties in the city, which was found to reflect in the channels of information flow to prospective migrants and sources of assistance provided to them on arrival in the city...|$|R

The city originally planned on 20,000 citizens, but by 1992, the city had 138,000 people. This has led to many <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> on undeveloped land.

25|$|Following {{decades of}} immense and {{sustained}} immigration, {{the shortage of}} housing in the territory was intolerable. Many lived in <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> or boats, and were susceptible to typhoons, fires and landslides. To {{improve the quality of}} public housing and relieve overcrowded conditions, the government announced the Ten-year Housing Programme (十年建屋計劃) in 1972, with the goal of providing quality housing for 1.8million people in 10 years. The Hong Kong Housing Authority was thus formed to spearhead the programme. The government also introduced the Home Ownership Scheme (居者有其屋計劃) in 1976, building houses and selling them at below-market prices to help people own property.|$|E
25|$|The {{property}} {{sector has}} expanded twenty-threefold since 2001, particularly in metropolises like Lahore. Nevertheless, the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated in late 2006 {{that the overall}} production of housing units in Pakistan has to be increased to 0.5 million units annually to address 6.1 million backlog of housing in Pakistan for meeting the housing shortfall in next 20 years. The report noted that the present housing stock is also rapidly aging and an estimate suggests that more than 50% of stock is over 50 years old. It is also estimated that 50% of the urban population now lives in slums and <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements.</b> The report said that meeting the backlog in housing, besides replacement of out-lived housing units, is beyond the financial resources of the government. This necessitates putting in place a framework to facilitate financing in the formal private sector and mobilise non-government resources for a market-based housing finance system.|$|E

25|$|Employment {{trends in}} Bogotá {{indicate}} that rates of unemployment have fallen while {{a growing number}} of citizens are looking for work. This paradox can largely be explained by ongoing urbanization into Bogotá, therefore poverty remains a substantial problem. Jobs have been created in some sectors, and women are gaining more opportunities for employment, but more progress is needed. Overall, poverty since 1970 has decreased; however, data collected and presented in 2006 by UN-HABITAT at the World Urban Forum in Vancouver, Canada reveal that 50% of the population still live in poverty and many of those live in slums. A separate UN-HABITAT report from 2003 describes three types of slums in Bogotá: inner-city, those lying on the perimeter, and <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements.</b> The total number of those living under these conditions is around 700,000. Additional data by UN-HABITAT shows that wealth is very unevenly distributed and that pockets of poverty exist in Bogotá that are poorer than the poorest regions of the country as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Past {{projects}} {{financed by}} KfW include a water supply project in Wadi Musa; an integrated poverty-oriented project targeted at refugees and squatters which included investments in {{water supply and}} sanitation; sewage disposal for Greater Irbid; and a trunk sewer and associated pumping stations linking up to the wastewater treatment plant As-Samra near Amman. In Wadi Musa the Euro 11.3 million project achieved, for a brief period, continuous water supply {{as well as a}} reduction in distribution losses. The project was co-financed by France and, concerning sanitation, by the US. The Euro 16.3 m poverty-oriented infrastructure project implemented by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) of Jordan increased access to water and sanitation in two <b>squatter</b> <b>settlements</b> and four refugee camps. The investments in the camps were chosen in close dialogue with the residents who were organized in Community Improvement Committees, and were carried out between 1999 and 2002. The project complemented the World Bank-financed Community Infrastructure Development Project. The Euro 60.1 m Greater Irbid sewage disposal project (1994–2002) included the construction of two wastewater treatment plants and the associated sewer infrastructure connecting 202,000 residents, as well as training for operational staff. Both treatment plants operated satisfactorily four years after they had been completed. Residual sludge is being properly disposed on a landfill.|$|E

The project proved an impetus to the socio-economic development {{of the population of the}} area. As the project director, Khan proved to be a dynamic and innovative leader. The project initially focused on creating a system of underground sewers, using local materials and labour, and succeeded in laying hundreds of kilometres of drainage pipes along with auxiliary facilities. Within a decade of the initiative, local residents had established schools, health clinics, women's work centres, cooperative stores and a credit organisation to finance enterprise projects. By 1993, OPP had managed to provide low-cost sewers to more than 72,000houses. The project subsequently diversified into a number of programmes, including a people's financed and managed low-cost sanitation programme; a housing programme; a basic health and family planning programme; a programme of supervised credit for small family enterprise units; an education programme; and a rural development programme in the nearby villages.|$|E

[...] - The Illegal City {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between space, law and gendered subjectivity through {{a close look at}} an ‘illegal’ <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> in Delhi. Since 2000, a series of judicial rulings in India have criminalised squatters as ‘illegal’ citizens, ‘encroachers’ and ‘pickpockets’ of urban land, and have led to a spate of slum demolitions across the country. This book argues that in this context, it has become vital to distinguish between illegality and informality since it is those ‘illegal’ slums which are at the receiving end of a ‘force of law’, where law is violently encountered within everyday spaces.

40|$|Background: While the {{prevalence}} of tobacco use has been slowly declining in the developed countries, rates have been steadily rising in the developing countries. This {{has led to a}} rapid rise in tobacco related lung diseases among women. Objective: Determine {{the prevalence}} of tobacco use (both smoking and smokeless) among women in an urban <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> (Orangi Town) in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 19, 325 females aged between 15 and 80 years in Orangi Town, an urban <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> in Karachi, Pakistan. Modified questionnaire, developed by World Health Organization WHO and Global Adult Tobacco survey (GATS), was used in Urdu. A total of 16, 987 women agreed to participate. Results: The mean age was 37. 3 ± 9. 8 years amongst whom 15, 255 (89. 80 %) were married, 9143 (53. 82 %) admitted that at least one person uses tobacco in some form in their homes. The prevalence of smokeless tobacco was 42. 25 % (7178). The prevalence of smoking tobacco was low as compared to smokeless tobacco i. e. 18. 0 % (3058). Among smokers, 85. 47 % (1789) admitted that they had tried to quit smoking during last 12 months but failed. Conclusion: Tobacco use among women in an urban <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> is very high and alarming.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the construction of}} a "cosmopolitan neighbourliness" which emerges in a Delhi <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> in the context of communal violence. Through interviews with over 80 inhabitants, I suggest that an openness to "others" in the settlement is produced in order to construct a home for oneself in an exclusionary city through a series of relational constructs-between the "cosmopolitan" city and the "parochial" village; between the "murderous" city and the "compassionate" slum; between the exclusionary urban public sphere and the "inclusive" neighbourhood sphere. The <b>squatter</b> <b>settlement</b> is internalised as a microcosm of a "mongrel city", a place which through its set of oppositional constructs becomes inherently "urban". "Cosmopolitan neighbourliness", however, remains fragile and gendered. It is a continuous strategic practice that attempts to bridge across differences of caste and religion through gendered performances that avert and discourage communal violence even when the city becomes murderous...|$|R
