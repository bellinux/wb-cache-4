25|$|A {{precision}} scale is a near necessity for reloading. While {{it is possible}} to load using nothing but a powder measure and a weight to volume conversion chart, this greatly limits the precision with which a load can be adjusted, increasing the danger for accidentally overloading cartridges with powder for loads near or at the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>load.</b> With a powder scale, an adjustable powder measure can be calibrated more precisely for the powder in question, and spot checks can be made during loading {{to make sure that the}} measure is not drifting. With a powder trickler, a charge can be measured directly into the scale, giving the most accurate measure.|$|E

2500|$|Two teams {{investigated}} the failure, the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force (IPET) and the Independent Levee Investigation Team (ILIT). [...] The studies {{confirmed that the}} canal floodwall failed at significantly lower water level than {{the top of the}} floodwall due to faulty design.

2500|$|The {{animals in}} a large team have {{different}} tasks. [...] The wheelers are the pair (or in tandem, the single animal) closest to the vehicle. [...] They provide the main braking effort, slowing the vehicle and controlling it downhill by pulling back on the pole or shafts. [...] The strength of the wheelers is often the limiting factor in determining the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>load</b> for a vehicle [...] while all the animals can pull uphill, only the wheelers can hold the vehicle downhill. [...] For this reason, the strongest pair in a team may be chosen as the wheelers. [...] Wheelers also steer the vehicle by turning the pole or shafts.|$|E
2500|$|Mark II canoes, {{which were}} given the codename of Cockle, were {{selected}} for the raid. The Mark II was a semi rigid two-man canoe, with the sides made of canvas, a flat bottom, and [...] in length. When collapsed {{it had to be}} capable of negotiating the narrow confines of the submarine to the storage area then, before it was ready to be taken on deck, erected and stored ready to be hauled out via the submarine torpedo hatch. [...] During the raid each canoe's load would be two men, eight limpet mines, three sets of paddles, a compass, a depth sounding reel, repair bag, torch, camouflage net, waterproof watch, fishing line, two hand grenades, rations and water for six days, a spanner to activate the mines and a magnet to hold the canoe against the side of cargo ships. The total <b>safe</b> <b>load</b> [...] for the 'Cockle' Mark 2 was 480lbs. The men also carried a [...]45 ACP pistol and a Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Safe</b> <b>Load</b> Indicator (SLI) or an Automatic <b>Safe</b> <b>Load</b> Indicator (ASLI) is {{a device}} which is {{installed}} on mobile or portal cranes {{to alert the}} operator if the lift is exceeding the safe operating range of the machinery. In some cases, the device will physically lock the machinery in circumstances it determines to be unsafe. SLI systems are usually composed of a microprocessor connected to various sensors on the crane itself.
