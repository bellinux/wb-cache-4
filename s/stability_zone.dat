40|$|A new {{stability}} criterion {{that can}} be used to assess the standing condition of a subject from center of pressure (CoP) measurements is presented. This criterion can be applied, for example, to control a standing prosthesis, which should allow a paraplegic subject to stand up, sit down and stand safely without using hands for support. Experiments conducted with able-bodied subjects enabled us to establish a relationship between its stability and the subject's CoP position. Four CoP <b>stability</b> <b>zones</b> were identi"ed: high preference, low preference, undesirable and unstable zones. The high preference zone is de"ned as the area where the CoP is found 99 % of the time during quiet standing. The area where the CoP is found during the remaining 1 % of the time is called the low preference zone. The undesirable zone is de"ned as the CoP area where the subject is forced to change posture in order to maintain balance, and the unstable zone is de"ned as the CoP area in which the subject is forced to step forward, backward or sideways to maintain stability. A general model of the proposed four <b>stability</b> <b>zones</b> was derived, which can be used to compute <b>stability</b> <b>zones</b> a priori for any subject and thus allows one to assess the subject's stability condition from the CoP measurements. � 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5000|$|The {{upper and}} lower limits of the HSZ, {{as well as its}} thickness, depend upon the local {{conditions}} in which the hydrate occurs. The conditions for hydrate stability generally restrict natural deposits to polar regions and deep oceanic regions. In polar regions, due to low temperatures, the upper limit of the hydrate <b>stability</b> <b>zone</b> occurs at a depth of approximately 150 meters.1 The maximum depth of the hydrate <b>stability</b> <b>zone</b> is limited by the geothermal gradient. Along continental margins the average thickness of the HSZ is about 500m.1 [...] The upper limit in oceanic sediments occurs when bottom water temperatures are at, or near 0° celsius, and at a water depth of approximately 300 meters.1 The lower limit of the HSZ is bounded by the geothermal gradient. As depth below seafloor increases, the temperature eventually becomes too high for hydrates to exist. In areas of high geothermal heat flow, the lower limit of the HSZ may become shallower, therefore decreasing the thickness of the HSZ. Conversely, the thickest hydrate layers and widest HSZ are observed in areas of low geothermal heat flow. Generally, the maximum depth of HSZ extension is 2000 meters below the earth’s surface.1,3 Using the location of a BSR as well as the pressure-temperature regimen necessary for hydrate stability, the HSZ may be used to determine geothermal gradients.2 ...|$|E

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of the paper is to give {{discrete}} time counterpart for some strong (robust) stability results concerning periodic linear Hamiltonian systems. In the continuous-time version, these results go back to Liapunov and Žukovskii; their deep generalizations are due to Kreĭn, Gel'fand, and Jakubovič and obtaining the discrete version {{is not an easy}} task since not all results migrate mutatis-mutandis from continuous time to discrete time, that is, from ordinary differential to difference equations. Throughout the paper, the theory of the <b>stability</b> <b>zones</b> is performed for scalar (2 nd-order) canonical systems. Using the characteristic function, the study of the <b>stability</b> <b>zones</b> is made in connection with the characteristic numbers of the periodic and skew-periodic boundary value problems for the canonical system. The multiplier motion ("traffic") on the unit circle of the complex plane is analyzed and, in the same context, the Liapunov estimate for the central zone is given in the discrete-time case.|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{asymptotic distribution}} of characteristic constants in periodic and antiperiodic boundary-value {{problems for the}} second-order linear equation with periodic coefficients. It allows getting asymptotics of <b>stability</b> and instability <b>zones</b> of solutions. It was shown that {{in the absence of}} turning points (r(t) > 0) the instability zones lengths converge to zero with their number increasing, and the <b>stability</b> <b>zones</b> lengths converge to a positive quantity. The situation, when (r(t) ≥ 0) and there are zeroes r(t), results {{in the fact that the}} lengths of <b>stability</b> and instability <b>zones</b> have a finite nonzero bound at an unbounded increase of the number of the corresponding zone. But if the function r(t) is alternating, the lengths of all <b>stability</b> <b>zones</b> converge to zero, and the lengths of instability zones converge to some finite quantities. These conclusions allowed to formulate a series of interesting criteria of stability and instability of solutions of the second-order equation with periodic coefficients. The results given are illustrated by a substantial example. The methods of investigation are based on a detailed study of the so-called special standard equations and the consequent reduction of original equations to any particular type of standard equations. Here, asymptotic methods of the theory of singular perturbance, as well as certain properties of a series of special functions are used. </p...|$|R
50|$|These {{deposits}} {{are located}} within a mid-depth zone around 300-500 m thick in the sediments (the gas hydrate <b>stability</b> <b>zone,</b> or GHSZ) where they coexist with methane dissolved in the fresh, not salt, pore-waters. Above this zone methane is only present in its dissolved form at concentrations that decrease towards the sediment surface. Below it, methane is gaseous. At Blake Ridge on the Atlantic continental rise, the GHSZ started at 190 m depth {{and continued to}} 450 m, where it reached equilibrium with the gaseous phase. Measurements indicated that methane occupied 0-9% by volume in the GHSZ, and ~12% in the gaseous zone.|$|E
5000|$|If {{processes}} such as sedimentation or subduction transport hydrates {{below the}} lower limit of the HSZ, the hydrate will become unstable and disassociate, releasing gas. This free gas may become trapped beneath the overlying hydrate layer forming gas pockets, or reservoirs. The pressure from the presence of gas reservoirs impacts {{the stability of the}} hydrate layer. If this pressure is substantially changed, the stability of the methane layer above will be altered and may result in significant destabilization and disassociation of the hydrate deposit. Landslides of rock or sediment above the hydrate <b>stability</b> <b>zone</b> may also impact the hydrate stability. A sudden decrease in pressure can release gasses, or destabilize portions of the hydrate deposit. Changing atmospheric and oceanic temperatures may impact the presence and depth of the hydrate stability zone; however to what extent is still uncertain. In oceanic sediments, increasing pressure due to a rise in sea level may offset some of the impact of increasing temperature upon the hydrate stability equilibrium.1 ...|$|E
5000|$|Most {{deposits}} of methane clathrate are in sediments too deep to respond rapidly, and modelling by Archer (2007) suggests the methane forcing should remain a minor {{component of the}} overall greenhouse effect.

[...] The highest estimates (e.g. 3 m³) were {{based on the assumption that}} fully dense clathrates could litter the entire floor of the deep ocean. Improvements in our understanding of clathrate chemistry and sedimentology have revealed that hydrates form in only a narrow range of depths (continental shelves), at only some locations in the range of depths where they could occur (10-30% of the Gas hydrate <b>stability</b> <b>zone),</b> and typically are found at low concentrations (0.9-1.5% by volume) at sites where they do occur.

[...] This estimate, corresponding to 500-2500 gigatonnes carbon (Gt C), is smaller than the 5000 Gt C estimated for all other geo-organic fuel reserves but substantially larger than the ~230 Gt C estimated for other natural gas sources.

Two wells were drilled in order to develop an appropriate casing program. The third well was drilled to 3,000 meters below sea-level in order to analyze the composition of the different strata and assess the contained gas. Seismic data showed a well-defined bottom simulating reflector, marking the bottom of the gas hydrate <b>stability</b> <b>zone,</b> found in a depth of 290 meters below the seafloor (1,240 meters below sea-level). Cores were taken in a depth between 1,152 and 1,210 meters, revealing the presence of gas hydrates in three different zones, with the hydrates accounting for 20% of the bulk volume and 80% of the pore space. These three different zones mostly consist of heterogeneous turbiditic sandstones that show permeabilities between 30 and 40% and are either continuous or discontinuous. The gas trapped inside the clathrates is predominantly biogenic and hints to a progressive decrease in microbial activity with depth and an additional upward migration throughout the sediment column.
