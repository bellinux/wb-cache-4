5|$|In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested {{power back}} in the state {{legislature}} from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes, followed by white primaries; these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans. In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could vote. As a result, the Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the century, imposing racial <b>segregation</b> <b>and</b> white supremacy.

5|$|Mississippi was {{the poorest}} {{state in the}} U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} {{were some of the}} poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For black families, the figure was $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial <b>segregation</b> <b>and</b> Jim Crow laws.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a research on the effects of incorporating silica fume or fly ash on the performance of self-consolidating concrete. The flowability, <b>segregation</b> stability, <b>and</b> passing ability of the self-consolidating concrete mixtures were evaluated using slump flow test, sieve <b>segregation</b> test <b>and</b> U-box test respectively. It was found that at the same level of flowability, the superplasticizer demand increases with the content of silica fume. Compared with concrete produced with pure cement, incorporation of 5 % silica fume in the concrete mixtures reduces the <b>segregation</b> stability <b>and</b> passing ability of the concrete, but the reduction is less significant when the silica fume content is increased to 10 %. On the other hand, incorporation of 25 % fly ash in the concrete mixture improves both the <b>segregation</b> stability <b>and</b> passing ability, but the mixtures require higher superplasticizer dosage for a given flowability. Finally, the design considerations for self-consolidating concrete are discussed...|$|R

In this study, the meiotic pairing <b>and</b> <b>segregation</b> of a trisomic chromosome in a diploid (2 n + 1) yeast strain was examined. We find that trivalent pairing <b>and</b> <b>segregation</b> is the favored arrangement. However, insertions near the centromere in one of the trisomic chromosomes leads to preferential pairing <b>and</b> <b>segregation</b> of the "like" centromeres of the remaining two chromosomes, suggesting that bivalent-univalent pairing <b>and</b> <b>segregation</b> is favored for this region...|$|R

5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of race and}} of ethnic relations is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society.

This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
5|$|The RF {{claimed that}} the bloody civil wars, {{military}} coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black nationalist leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black nationalist rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and <b>segregation,</b> <b>and</b> argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.|$|E

At the time, these schools conducted studies to monitor the treatment of African American players and how the schools reacted to certain situations involving <b>segregation</b> <b>and</b> prejudice. The teams that were in favor of African Americans participating in football gave players a chance to speak out against the racism {{that took place in the}} sport.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the 1991 and 2001 Censuses, I examine {{patterns}} of ethnic diversity <b>and</b> <b>segregation</b> in England’s metropolitan regions. Diversity is measured using the Shannon entropy index <b>and</b> <b>segregation</b> is measured using the Theil index. Both indices can be decomposed into contributions due to region, district, and ward, which may indicate the processes responsible for patterns of ethnic diversity <b>and</b> <b>segregation.</b> The results show that ethnic diversity increased from 0. 533 in 1991 to 0. 731 in 2001. Between 1991 and 2001 the share of diversity contributed by Inner London and the West Midlands declined and the share contributed by Outer London and the Outer Metropolitan Area rose. Decomposition of total diversity shows that regional and district differences in ethnic diversity increased between 1991 and 2001 but differences between wards declined in importance. Within-ward diversity contributed more than 75 % of total diversity at each census. Between 1991 and 2001 {{there was a slight}} increase in the overall level of segregation. Decomposition of total <b>segregation</b> into between-district <b>and</b> within-district components for each region shows that the contribution of within-district segregation to total segregation fell between 1991 and 2001. However, the contribution of between-district segregation to total <b>segregation</b> remained important <b>and</b> increased significantly in Inner London. Across the area investigated wards have on average become more ethnically diverse but there remain significant differences in diversity <b>and</b> <b>segregation</b> between regions <b>and</b> districts. ...|$|R
