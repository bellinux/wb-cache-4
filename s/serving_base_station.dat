In this work, femto <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> possess sensing capabilities and are able to overhear uplink communication between close by macro and pico users to their <b>serving</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> This assumption is highly advised in order to enable interference management and guarantee QoS; as in [16], the authors have shown that low-power sensing of LTE signals is possible, and if the femto <b>base</b> <b>station</b> is able to sense which RBs the interfered user is been assigned, then it can reduce power on those specific resources. The femto access point then determines the channel gain between itself and the macro or pico neighbouring base stations; it also determines the channel gains between the itself and the macro (or pico) users nearby. The femtocell is then able to use water-filling to reduce the transmit power on the RBs assigned to the macro (or pico) user.|$|R
