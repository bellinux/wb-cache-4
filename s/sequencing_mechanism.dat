40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has emphasized the linkage between performance in immediate serial recall of lists, nonword repetition, and word learning. Recently, {{it has been reported that}} primacy and recency effects are obtained in repetition of individual syllables within nonwords (Gupta, in press). Five experiments examined whether such within-nonword primacy and recency effects are attributable to common <b>sequencing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that are shared with immediate list recall. Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that the primacy and recency effects are not simply due to greater morphological salience at the beginnings/endings of nonwords, and that the serial position effects generalize to different stimuli and across a variety of stimulus lengths. Experiment 3 indicated that the primacy and recency effects are similar to those obtained in list recall. Experiments 4 and 5 examined alternative hypotheses for the observed serial position effects, concluding that the alternative hypotheses fail to account for the obtained pattern of results. These results provide support for the common <b>sequencing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> hypothesis. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the relationship between list recall and nonword repetition, and in terms of broader issues in word learning. Ó 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The global {{competitive}} {{environment and the}} growing demand for personalised products have increased the interest of companies in producing similar product models on the same assembly line. Companies are forced to make significant structural changes to rapidly respond to diversified demands and convert their existing single-model lines into mixed-model lines {{in order to avoid}} unnecessary new line construction cost for each new product model. Mixed-model assembly lines {{play a key role in}} increasing productivity without compromising quality for manufacturing enterprises. The literature is extensive on assembling small-sized products in an intermixed sequence and assembling large-sized products in large volumes on single-model lines. However, a mixed-model parallel two-sided line system, where two or more similar products or similar models of a large-sized product are assembled on each of the parallel two-sided lines in an intermixed sequence, has not been of interest to academia so far. Moreover, taking model sequencing problem into consideration on a mixed-model parallel two-sided line system is a novel research topic in this domain. Within this context, the problem of simultaneous balancing and sequencing of mixed-model parallel two-sided lines is defined and described using illustrative examples for the first time in the literature. The mathematical model of the problem is also developed to exhibit the main characteristics of the problem and to explore the logic underlying the algorithms developed. The benefits of utilising multi-line stations between two adjacent lines are discussed and numerical examples are provided. An agent-based ant colony optimisation algorithm (called ABACO) is developed to obtain a generic solution that conforms to any model sequence and it is enhanced step-by-step to increase the quality of the solutions obtained. Then, the algorithm is modified with the integration of a model sequencing procedure (where the modified version is called ABACO/S) to balance lines by tracking the product model changes on each workstation in a complex production environment where each of the parallel lines may a have different cycle time. Finally, a genetic algorithm based model <b>sequencing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is integrated to the algorithm to increase the robustness of the obtained solutions. Computational tests are performed using test cases to observe the performances of the developed algorithms. Statistical tests are conducted through obtained results and test results establish that balancing mixed-model parallel two-sided lines together has a significant effect on the sought performance measures (a weighted summation of line length and the number of workstations) in comparison with balancing those lines separately. Another important finding of the research is that considering model sequencing problem along with the line balancing problem helps algorithm find better line balances with better performance measures. The results also indicate that the developed ABACO and ABACO/S algorithms outperform other test heuristics commonly used in the literature in solving various line balancing problems; and integrating a genetic algorithm based model <b>sequencing</b> <b>mechanism</b> into ABACO/S helps the algorithm find better solutions with less amount of computational effort...|$|E

The execution of loads down the wrongly predicted branch path within a thread unit or in a wrongly forked thread can result in an indirect prefetching effect for correct execution. This is possible even after the outcome of a control speculation is known. By allowing mispredicted load instructions to continue execution even after the instruction or thread level control speculation is known to have failed, we show that we can reduce the cache misses for the correctly predicted paths and threads. However, these additional loads also can increase the amount of memory traffic and can pollute the cache. Our results show that the performance of a concurrent multithreaded architecture can be improved as much as 14 %, while reducing the number of L 1 data cache misses up to 35 %. ...|$|E

Workload control is a production planning and control approach designed to meet the need of the MTO companies. In this dissertation, a multi-agent workload control methodology that simultaneously deals with due date setting, job release and scheduling is proposed to discourage job early or tardy completions. The earliness and tardiness objectives are consistent with the just-in-time production philosophy which has attracted significant attention in both industry and academic community. This methodology consists of the order entry agent, job release agent, job routing and sequencing agent, and information feedback agent. Two new due date setting rules are developed to establish job due dates based on two existing rules. A feedback mechanism to dynamically adjust due date setting is introduced. Both new rules are nonparametric and easy to be implemented in practice. A job release mechanism is applied to reduce job flowtimes (up to 20. 3 %) and work-in-process inventory (up to 33. 1 %), without worsening earliness and tardiness, and lead time performances.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to present}} {{solutions}} {{to improve the}} performance of SQLite library on mobile systems. In particular, two approaches are presented to add lightweight locking mechanisms to the SQLite library and improve concurrency of the SQLite library on Android operating system. The impact on performance is discussed after each section. Many applications on the Android operating system rely on the SQLite library to store ordered data. However, due to heavy synchronization primitives used by the library, it becomes a performance bottleneck for applications which push large amount of data into the database. Related {{work in this area}} also points to SQLite database as one of the factors for limiting performance. With increasing network speeds, the storage system can become a performance bottleneck, as applications download larger amounts of data. The following work in this thesis addresses these issues by providing approaches to increase concurrency and add light-weight locking mechanisms. The factors determining the performance of Application Programming Interfaces provided by SQLite are first gathered from IO traces of common database operations. By analyzing these traces, opportunities for improvements are noticed. An alternative locking mechanism is added to the database file using byte-range locks for fine-grained locking. Its impact on performance is measured using SQLite benchmarks as well as real applications. A multi-threaded benchmark is designed to measure the performance of fine grained locking in multi-threaded applications using common database operations. Recent versions of SQLite use write ahead logs for journaling. We see that writes to this sequential log can occur concurrently, especially in flash drives. By adding a <b>sequencing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the write ahead log, the writes can proceed simultaneously.

40|$|Current {{theories}} accurately view {{working memory}} as a multi -component structure, including a phonological store, a visuospatial sketchpad and a central executive. These components have been roughly identified with known brain areas and neuropsychological functions. However, the neural mechanisms for memory encoding and retrieval remain largely controversial, especially the mechanisms for serial order. These open questions warrant courageous attempts to tackle these problems computationally; that is, constructing large-scale biologically plausible computational models to explain detailed memory processes in these components, their interactions and the required control processes. The thesis {{is focused on}} constructing computational models to explain a few critical phenomena and mechanisms in working memory, observed in the Immediate Serial Recall task. The main constraining phenomena for the models are: the primacy effect, the recency effect, the phonological similarity effect in word lists but not in non-word lists, repetition coding by patterns, and position effects in transposition errors (e. g., an item {{is likely to be}} transposed with another item at the same position in another group). The modeling method is incremental: it first begins with a biologically plausible model for sequence encoding and retrieval based on the anatomy of the prefronto-basal ganglionic system. Phenomena that confirm this model include the primacy effect, the recency effect, similarity effects and the transposition gradient. This model is then extended with a specialized <b>sequencing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for phonological information, in order to explain the lack of phonoloigcal similarity effect in non-word lists. This Dual Representation model, to some extent, can also mitigate the difficulty of recalling repeated items, though it does not explain repetition encoding by patterns. The pattern encoding mechanism and the required binding process are discussed for a later model, which also uses binding to account for the positional effects, where position codes are considered to be temporarily bound to items. At last, it is discussed how the working memory models can be merged with a long-term memory component to transfer sequences stored in working memory into long-term memory. At last, limitations of the model are analyzed in the Implications and Discussion chapter. The analysis reveals a difficulty in the sequencing of items of different categories by lateral inhibition, because different categories of items are represented in different cortical areas. This result necessitates an additional subsystem that can encode category sequences, because the system needs to encode the category sequence to cue the retrieval of items. For example, a sequence like "Trees are plants" can be recalled better if it is accompanied by a category sequence "N V N". Due to the difficulty with repetitions of the basic cortico-basal ganglia <b>sequencing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the category subsystem would work best if it is hierarchically organized, where each constituent does not contain repeated categories, or the repetition can be coded away by simple patterns. The category sequence then becomes a hierarchy, for instance, S(N VP(V N))). At this stage, the working memory theory meets linguistic theories. It implies, however, that the phrase-structure syntax should not itself be the ultimate criterion for linguistic acceptability or comprehensibility. If comprehensibility is defined as whether the brain can bind simple concepts into complex concepts following physical laws that govern synchronization, then, the brain should be able to make use of all available information from the sentence, context, long-term knowledge and the even the encoding mechanism. Therefore, an acceptable grammar can include phrase structure rules, and rules concerning the context, repetition patterns, position codes, and even syllabic counts. These implications of the working memory model deserve further exploration. Further analysis of the model also reveals a need for a specialized subsystem to encode the timing within sequences. It suggests that the cortico-cerebellar loop can be a good candidate for encoding temporal information, in addition to the serial order information encoded by the cortico-basal ganglionic system. A cerebellum-based mechanism for absolute and relative timing is discussed. This work will hopefully help further research about various sequence processing mechanisms of the brai...|$|E
40|$|As {{the result}} of recent {{advances}} {{in the business of}} e-learning there has been a growing interest in e-learning standards, particularly SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model). SCORM is a reference model that integrates a collection of e-learning resource standards and specifications. In a SCORM compliant courseware, content and the pedagogic approach to be taken are predefined by the course author. As a consequence, users are unable to learn according to their preferences, and implicitly they will all encounter the same learning experience. Recent attempts to personalise learning in SCORM often resulted in either modifying SCORM or substituting its course <b>sequencing</b> <b>mechanism</b> with Adaptive Hypermedia techniques. Nonetheless, SCORM is a widely-used solution to interoperability problems with e-learning resources and can realise not only content sharing and reusability but also a consistent sequencing of course content across different systems and tools. For these reasons, this thesis focuses on supplementing SCORM sequencing rather than redefining it. The novelty of this work is that it builds an adaptive environment around the existing SCORM, without extending or modifying SCORM itself. The work integrates Adaptive Hypermedia principles into the SCORM Run-Time Environment as an independent service to support the environment with learning materials that are preferable to both teachers (primary materials of their choice) and students (supplementary materials that are pre-selected to suit some aspects of their user models to assist their understanding of the primary materials). This SCORM-complementing approach can also enable the SCORM Run-Time Environment to include on-demand external resources into the environment in order to address SCORM’s limitation of static pool of learning resources. The novel contribution of this work is the design of an authoring architecture which enables the automatic generation of a concept map and consequently links to alternative learning resources, and a run-time service oriented architecture which delivers these alternative resources, alongside the SCORM defined resources, according to a dynamic user model.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} much human behaviour is the generation and regulation of sequential activities. Such behaviour {{is seen in}} both naturalistic settings such as routine action and language production and laboratory tasks such as serial recall and many reaction time experiments. There {{are a variety of}} computational mechanisms that may support the generation and regulation of sequential behaviours, ranging from those underlying Turing machines to those employed by recurrent connectionist networks. This paper surveys a range of such mechanisms, together with a range of empirical phenomena related to human sequential behaviour. It is argued that the empirical phenomena pose difficulties for most <b>sequencing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> but that converging evidence from behavioural flexibility, error data arising from when the system is stressed or when it is damaged following brain injury, and between-trial effects in reaction time tasks, point to a hybrid symbolic activation-based mechanism for the generation and regulation of sequential behaviour. Some implications of this view for the nature of mental computation are highlighted...|$|R
