5|$|At 17:18:03 the Embraer {{contacted}} the Cachimbo Airport (SBCC) tower directly to coordinate its emergency landing there, and landed <b>safely</b> at Cachimbo at 17:23:00.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} leader with current Safe Swim Defense {{training}} {{is required for}} swimming activities. Boating activities require Safety Afloat and CPR training. Climb On <b>Safely</b> training and CPR certification are required for climbing and rappelling events.|$|E
5|$|If driving, <b>safely</b> {{exit the}} roadway, turn on hazard lights, and park. Remain {{in the vehicle}} and avoid {{touching}} metal.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{reported}} that a Canadian firm wanted to tackle the challenge of <b>safely</b> extracting metallic content from the wastes on site.|$|E
5|$|In May 2016, the RAIB {{published}} {{a report on}} the incident, which largely blamed the incident on the train crew tampering with a safety system that would otherwise have <b>safely</b> brought the train to a halt.|$|E
5|$|Of the horses, eight made it <b>safely</b> to land, {{while the}} ninth had its leg broken while being {{pushed into the}} sea.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 2015, an F-16CJ {{collided}} with a Cessna 150M over Moncks Corner, South Carolina, U.S. The pilot of the F-16 ejected <b>safely,</b> but both people in the Cessna were killed.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to Hut Point on 25 November the search party found that Campbell's Northern Party had rescued itself and had returned <b>safely</b> to base.|$|E
5|$|Passengers were boarded {{on these}} two {{replacement}} planes on a first-come, first-served basis. 76 passengers boarded a Lockheed L-188 Electra. This aircraft flew to Miami and arrived <b>safely.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some sharks, if {{inverted}} or stroked on the nose, enter {{a natural}} state of tonic immobility. Researchers use this condition to handle sharks <b>safely.</b>|$|E
5|$|The British took Ninfa {{into service}} as HMS Hamadryad, a 36-gun frigate with a main battery of 12-pounders, but {{were unable to}} {{retrieve}} the cargo of silver, which later arrived <b>safely</b> in Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{categories}} of decompression equipment {{used to help}} divers decompress, which is the process required to allow divers {{to return to the}} surface <b>safely</b> after spending time underwater at higher pressures.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} stop is {{a period}} a diver must spend at a relatively shallow constant depth during ascent after a dive to <b>safely</b> eliminate absorbed inert gases from the body tissues to avoid decompression sickness. The practice of making decompression stops is called staged decompression, as opposed to continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|A {{small fire}} {{broke out in the}} gas turbine engine room (located high on the ship behind the Queen Mary 2 sign) on the evening of 5 October 2011. The fire was started in one of the ship's gas turbines. No {{injuries}} were reported, and crew on board the ship managed to <b>safely</b> extinguish the fire.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} attack there {{followed}} {{several hours of}} quiet as Nos. 10 and 11 Groups and Luftflotte 2 and 3 recovered. On {{both sides of the}} Channel, unit commanders now phoned round to establish whether missing crews and aircraft had landed <b>safely</b> elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived <b>safely</b> at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. The {{plan was}} to scrap eleven of the vessels and keep only five to make the return journey. This was typical. Ships from the Americas to Spain carried a much smaller volume of cargo than ships traveling in the other direction, although the shipments to Spain included valuable gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|Among the anecdotes of {{navigation}} by bioluminescence, the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell recounted how as a navy pilot {{he had found}} {{his way back to}} his aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems failed. Turning off his cabin lights, he saw the glowing wake of the ship, and was able to fly to it and land <b>safely.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities {{have tried to}} limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and <b>safely</b> assisting turtles across the road.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{graphene}} {{appears to}} be the strongest material ever tested. The process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is economical for industrial processes. If successful, graphene could be used in the construction of a space elevator. It could also be used to <b>safely</b> store hydrogen for use in a hydrogen based engine in cars.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{encounter}} with Turbine, Radetzky managed to destroy a railroad bridge {{near the town of}} Fermo, severely hampering the movement of troops and supplies in the region. Sixty-three Italian civilians and military personnel were killed in the bombardment. By the time Italian ships from Taranto and Brindisi arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were <b>safely</b> back in Pola.|$|E
5|$|Back in Egypt, as-Sallar {{was assassinated}} in 1153 by his son Abbas, Abbas's son Nasr, and caliph az-Zafir, who, {{according}} to Usama, was Nasr's lover. Thirteenth-century historian Ibn al-Athir says that Usama was the instigator of this plot. Usama {{may also have been}} behind the assassination of az-Zafir by Abbas, in 1154. Az-Zafir's relatives called upon a supporter, Ibn Ruzzik, who chased Abbas out of Cairo, and Usama followed him. He lost his possessions in Cairo, and on the way to Damascus his retinue was attacked by the crusaders and Bedouin nomads, but in June 1154 he <b>safely</b> reached Damascus, which had recently been captured by Nur ad-Din. Ibn Ruzzik tried to persuade him to come back, as the rest of his family was still in Cairo, but Usama was able to bring them to Damascus, through crusader territory, in 1156. The crusaders promised to transport them <b>safely,</b> but they were attacked and pillaged, and Usama lost his entire library.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients with}} titanium implants can be <b>safely</b> examined with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.|$|E
5|$|Bond dives {{after the}} {{submarine}}, boards it, and frees Jones. Following a fight, the submarine hits {{the bottom of}} the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and kills him after a lengthy fight in the submarine's reactor. Bond and Jones escape from the submarine, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate <b>safely</b> underwater.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is invited}} to the White House for lunch with the President. However, Goldfinger hijacks the plane {{carrying}} Bond there. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun fires, shooting out a window, creating an explosive decompression. Goldfinger is blown out of the cabin through the ruptured window. With the plane out of control, Bond rescues Galore and they parachute <b>safely</b> from the aircraft before it crashes into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Brand's {{involvement}} in smuggling Jews into Hungary began in July 1941, when Hansi Brand's sister and brother-in-law were {{caught up in}} the Kamianets-Podilskyi deportations. The Hungarian government sent 18,000 Jews to German-occupied Ukraine because they were unable to prove they were Hungarian citizens; 14,000–16,000 of them were shot by the SS. Brand paid a Hungarian counter-espionage officer to bring his wife's relatives back <b>safely.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1893, the NYLE {{had gone}} {{bankrupt}} and was {{merged with the}} Erie Railroad, which became {{the owner of the}} bridge. By the start of the 20thcentury, locomotives were almost 85percent heavier, and the iron bridge could no longer <b>safely</b> carry trains. The last traffic crossed the old bridge on May 14, 1900, and removal of the old iron began on May 24.|$|E
5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} partial pressure of inert gases as low as <b>safely</b> practicable throughout the dive. This minimizes the absorption of inert gas in the first place, and accelerates the elimination of the inert gases during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the risks}} {{associated}} with the Lunar landing, a number of rescue spacecraft were proposed, to be used to allow the crew of an Apollo mission to return to Earth <b>safely</b> {{in the event of a}} problem. Many of these designs were based around the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|During {{sunrise and}} sunset, {{sunlight}} is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint {{enough to be}} viewed comfortably {{with the naked eye}} or <b>safely</b> with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.|$|E
5|$|Enola Gay {{returned}} <b>safely</b> to {{its base}} on Tinian to great fanfare, touching down at 2:58 pm, after 12 hours 13 minutes. The Great Artiste and Necessary Evil followed at short intervals. Several hundred people, including journalists and photographers, had gathered {{to watch the}} planes return. Tibbets {{was the first to}} disembark, and was presented with the Distinguished Service Cross on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Ford, {{serving as}} General Quarters Officer of the Deck, {{was ordered to}} go below to assess the raging fire. He did so <b>safely,</b> and {{reported}} his findings back to the ship's commanding officer, Captain Stuart Ingersoll. The ship's crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.|$|E
5|$|Glenn landed <b>safely,</b> but an {{inspection}} of his capsule revealed {{that one of}} the landing bag switches had been faulty. Kraft was right; the heat shield had not been loose after all. The lessons that he drew from this experience were clear.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, McGovern {{met with}} the Cuban grandmothers of five-year-old Elian Gonzalez. Elian's mother had drowned while trying to escape from Cuba with the boy. Although Elian had reached Florida <b>safely,</b> McGovern {{advocated}} the boy's return to his father's custody in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to <b>safely</b> get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They <b>safely</b> reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E
5|$|In September, Salih entered Aleppo's citadel victoriously. Afterward, he had Mawsuf and the qāḍī Ibn Abi Usama executed. However, Salih {{released}} Thu'ban {{in return}} for financial compensation and allowed the city's dāʿī (chief Isma'ili propagandist) to depart <b>safely.</b> Salih also confiscated the estates of numerous upper class Aleppines.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} ditched {{aircraft}}, pilots {{have been able}} to eject <b>safely</b> in several cases. However, fatal aircraft crashes have occurred; in 1994, Lt. Kara Hultgreen, the first female F-14 Tomcat pilot, was killed while attempting to land on board Abraham Lincoln during a training exercise.|$|E
