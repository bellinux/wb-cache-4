5000|$|Just as {{with the}} modern cheetah, {{almost every aspect of}} Acinonyx pardinesis was {{specialized}} for running, though not as fast. The muzzle is short and the nasal passage large for increased air intake during a strenuous sprint. To make room for the enlarged nasal passage, the maxilla was reduced and the anchorage for the canine roots was less, resulting in shorter canine roots and a shorter, more stout external canine, a characteristic seen in the modern cheetah. As evidenced by Marco Cherin, Denis Geraads et al, the giant cheetah may have also had a stronger bite than modern cheetahs, perhaps enough to crush bone. To lighten the weight of the animal, bone girth is reduced and the skeleton is lean and light, excellent for running, but probably not for fighting or coping with injuries, severe or minor. Its thoracic cavity was consumed by large lungs and a powerful heart. The intestines were probably shorter, to lighten the animal, and muscles not used for running were reduced. The diaphragm was likely connected to the movement of its gait and with the <b>stretching</b> <b>phase</b> of a stride, the expansion of space in the abdominal cavity pulled the diaphragm down and forced the animal to inhale, while the contractile phase compressed the lungs and forced air out, so it had no control over its breathing while running, a commonality of most quadruped sprinters. Analysis of its skeleton indicates that the giant cheetah was intermediate in morphology between the swift-moving cheetahs and slower big cats; for one, its head was more proportionate to that of the cheetah's cougar-like ancestors in appearance and its limbs were relatively more robust than the modern cheetah. Indeed, the giant cheetah may have less resembled its modern cousin and instead have had more in common in regards to morphology with the modern snow leopard, whose skeletal proportions are very similar. Despite its longer legs and potential as a sprinter, the giant cheetah was overall less suited to speed than its modern relatives due to its intermediate build and greater mass ...|$|E

Normal two-legged jumps on a force plate and one-legged jumps on a sledge apparatus were made by four volunteers. Kinetics, kinematics, and muscle activity from seven muscles were recorded. The loading patterns of the tendomuscular system differed among the jumping conditions, but were similar when the jumping height was varied. Peak PTF were greater than ATF in each condition. In contrast to earlier simulation studies it was observed that tendomuscular force could continue to increase during the shortening of muscle-tendon unit in CMJ. The concentric tendomuscular output was related to the force {{at the end of the}} <b>stretching</b> <b>phase</b> while the enhancement of the output in CMJ compared to SJ could not be explained by increases in muscle activity. The <b>stretching</b> <b>phase</b> in CMJ was characterised by little or no electromyogram activity. Therefore, the role of active stretch in creating beneficial conditions for the utilisation of elastic energy in muscle was only minor in these submaximal performances. The modelling, as used in the present study, showed, however, that tendon underwent a stretch-shortening cycle, thus having potential for elastic energy storage and utilisation. In general, the interaction between muscle and tendon components may be organised in a manner that takes advantage of the basic properties of muscle at given submaximal and variable activity levels of normal human locomotion...|$|E

As observed by previous investigators, force rose in two phases: an initial rapid increase {{over a small}} <b>stretch</b> (<b>phase</b> I), and a slower, more modest rise over {{the remainder of the}} <b>stretch</b> (<b>phase</b> II). The transition between the two phases occurred at a critical stretch (LC) of 7. 7 ± 0. 1 nm/half-sarcomere that is independent of velocity. The force at critical stretch (PC) increased with velocity up to 1 length/s, then was constant at 3. 26 ± 0. 06 times isometric force. The decay of the force response to a small step stretch was much faster during stretch than in isometric fibers. The addition of 3 mM vanadate reduced isometric tension to 0. 08 ± 0. 01 times control isometric tension (P 0), but only reduced PC to 0. 82 ± 0. 06 times P 0, demonstrating that prepowerstroke states contribute to force rise during stretch. The data can be explained by a model in which actin-attached cross-bridges in a prepowerstroke state are stretched into regions of high force and detach very rapidly when stretched beyond this region. The prepowerstroke state acts as a mechanical rectifier, producing large forces during stretch but small forces during shortening...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} dynamics of unsteady gravity currents produced by lock-release of a saline mixture into a fresh water tank. Seven different experimental runs were performed by varying {{the density of the}} saline mixture in the lock and the bed roughness. Experiments were conducted in a Perspex flume, of horizontal bed and rectangular cross section, and recorded with a CCD camera. An image analysis technique was applied to visualize and characterize the current allowing thus the understanding of its general dynamics and, more specifically, of the current head dynamics. The temporal evolution of both head length and mass shows repeated stretching and breaking cycles: during the <b>stretching</b> <b>phase,</b> the head length and mass grow until reaching a limit, then the head becomes unstable and breaks. In the instants of break, the head aspect ratio shows a limit of 0. 2 and the mass of the head is of the order of the initial mass in the lock. The average period of the herein called breaking events is seen to increase with bed roughness and the spatial periodicity of these events is seen to be approximately constant between runs. The rate of growth of the mass at the head is taken as a measure to assess entrainment and it is observed to occur at all stages of the current development. Entrainment rate at the head decreases in time suggesting this as a phenomenon ruled by local buoyancy and the similarity between runs shows independence from the initial reduced gravity and bed roughness. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E

The PR caps a similar to 60 -km-wide lens-shaped serpentinized peridotite body underlying both thinned continental and thin oceanic crust. When superimposed on a reflection time version of the velocity model, the S reflector is clearly intracrustal at its east end. Westward, S cuts down to lower crustal levels, eventually coinciding with {{the top of the}} serpentinized peridotite lens (original crust-mantle boundary).

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in modeling the magnetospheric magnetic reconnection is to quantify the interaction between large-scale global magnetospheric dynamics and microphysical processes in diffusion regions near reconnection sites. There is still considerable debate as to what degree microphysical processes on kinetic scales affect the global evolution and {{how important it is}} to substitute numerical dissipation and/or ad hoc anomalous resistivity by a physically motivated model of dissipation. Comparative studies of magnetic reconnection in small scale geometries demonstrated that MHD simulations that included non-ideal processes in terms of a resistive term η J did not produce the fast reconnection rates observed in kinetic simulations. For a broad range of physical parameters in collisionless magnetospheric plasma, the primary mechanism controlling the dissipation in the vicinity of the reconnection site is non-gyrotropic effects with spatial scales comparable with the particle Larmor radius. We utilize the global MHD code BATSRUS and incorporate nongyrotropic effects in diffusion regions in terms of corrections to the induction equation. We developed an algorithm to search for magnetotail reconnection sites, specifically where the magnetic field components perpendicular to the local current direction approaches zero and form an X-type configuration. Spatial scales of the diffusion region and magnitude of the reconnection electric field are calculated selfconsistently using MHD plasma and field parameters in the vicinity of the reconnection site. The location of the reconnection sites is updated during the simulations. To clarify the role of nongyrotropic effects in diffusion region on the global magnetospheric dynamic we perform simulations with steady southward IMF driving of the magnetosphere. Ideal MHD simulations with magnetic reconnection supported by numerical resistivity produce steady configuration with almost stationary near-earth neutral line (NENL). Simulations with non-gyrotropic corrections demonstrate dynamic quasi-periodic response to the steady driving condition. The loading/unloading cycle in non-gyrotropic MHD results has a non-stationary reconnection site in the magnetotail, with the retreating during the <b>stretching</b> <b>phase</b> and then a new NENL forming in the resulting thin plasma sheet.

40|$|Sawtooth {{events have}} been {{identified}} at geosynchronous orbit as large-amplitude quasiperiodic (2 – 4 hour period) modulations of the energetic electron and ion fluxes. They are called sawtooth events because {{the shape of the}} flux versus time profiles are composed of rapid increases followed by gradual decreases that resemble the teeth on a saw blade. Although much of the phenomenology associated with sawtooth events is substorm-like, there is still debate as to whether the individual teeth are substorms or not. Here we examine each of the teeth associated with the 10 – 11 August 2000 sawtooth event in detail. We find that {{all but one of the}} teeth were associated with injections at geosynchronous orbit and that most of the teeth were consistent with the hypothesis that they are predominantly caused by unusually large and longitudinally extended substorms. A few were unclear or complex, and the final flux enhancement at 1845 : 36 UT was not a substorm but a solar wind shock-associated disturbance. In addition, the presence of numerous dispersionless flux perturbations in the LANL SOPA data provides support for the hypothesis that solar wind pressure variations can modulate the flux profiles to some extent. For the substorm events we find that the geosynchronous particle injections were neither globally simultaneous nor globally dispersionless but were instead consistent with a nightside/duskside source in most cases. Similarly, we show that the field dipolarizations were also not global and simultaneous. Each of the substorms was also associated with high-latitude negative H bays, middle- and low-latitude positive H bays, a partial recovery in Sym-H, and the onset of Pi 2 ULF pulsations. In addition, we show that the auroral distribution develops in a systematic way during each cycle of a sawtooth substorm event. Specifically, a localized auroral onset develops on the lower branch of a thinned double-oval distribution. The location of onset is typically premidnight and often occurs to the west of intense omega band forms. This is followed by westward, eastward, and poleward expansion and the copious production of auroral streamers which can develop in complex patterns including a “spoke-like” morphology. The double-oval configuration thins again during the <b>stretching</b> <b>phase</b> until the next onset occurs and the cycle repeats.

40|$|Approximately 1100 km of {{multichannel}} seismic reflection profiles {{from the}} Goban Spur region, S W of Ireland, which {{belong to the}} Department of Energy U K., have been re-examined. Interpretation of this data reveals the presence of two main seismic sequences, viz., 'Syn-rift' and 'Post-rift'. The former occurs in fault bounded sedimentary basins which are wedge-shaped in cross-section, and the latter drapes over the basement topography. The divergent pattern of seismic reflections from the strata within the basins suggests that the processes of continental rifting and deposition were contemporaneous. The younger post-rift seismic sequences are characterised by parallel to subparallel seismic reflections, and they appear {{not to have been}} affected by any major tectonic activity during their geological history. The faults bounding the basins are 'regarded' as normal and listric in form, indicating extension and rotation of the basement blocks. They appear to show a predominant northwesterly trend with downthrown side towards the ocean basin. Correlation of the seismic profiles with DSDP Drill Sites 549 and 550 through ID synthetic seismograms has made it possible to date the syn-rift and post-rift seismic sequences. The available data does not allow a very accurate assesment of the age of the break-up unconformity, nonetheless, it seems to be marked by the boundary between Aptian and Albian. The timing and appearance of the deep seismic reflections seen on the Continental Margin profiles suggest that they are lower crustal reflections similar to the ones reported from the Southwestern Approaches Basin by BIRPS. However, the observed time thickness of the band of these reflections is much smaller than that seen over the Southwest Approaches. Using the synthetic seismogram program, their causes have been reviewed. It has been shown that they can occur from very thin alternating low and high velocity laminae. It has also been shown that in a set of these alternating laminae, the seismic wave sees only a single low and a single high velocity zone rather than an individual lamina, and that the maximum reflected amplitude occurs if the total laminae thickness equals lambda/ 4. Furthermore, a change in the character of the deep reflections with azimuth suggests that they are probably arising from extensional features developed in relatively competent layers within the lower crust during the <b>stretching</b> <b>phase.</b> Two dimensional gravity modelling along the seismic profiles, using the free-air gravity data, has produced models for crustal structure across the continental margin and has thus provided a measure of the whole crustal extension values. From the geometry of the rotated fault blocks, the depth to detachment and superficial extension beta values have been calculated which appear to be appreciably lower than the whole crustal thinning values, thus suggesting that the extension in {{the lower part of the}} crystalline crust may be greater than in the upper part. It is implied from the depth to detachment analysis that the reflections occurring at 9 sec (twt) mark a major change in the rheological properties within the crust. Furthermore, the deeper 10 sec (twt) reflections may mark the Moho. Also, it has been found that the rotational planar faults over Porcupine Abyssal Plain do not seem to penetrate through the gravity deduced Moho. <p...|$|E

The RMS value of the MUAPs recruited during the <b>stretch</b> <b>phase</b> of the passive contractions was lower than the RMS value of MUAPs recruited during active contractions. This may indicate that only smaller MUs are affected by increased sensitivity to muscle stretch while a larger part of the MU pool can be recruited voluntarily...|$|R
40|$|Knots seem to {{be found}} every time one {{encounters}} long, stringy objects. At the macroscopic scale, knots are seen every day in shoelaces, tangled hair, or woven clothing, yet they also present themselves at the microscopic scale in long polymer molecules. Knots can be found often in DNA packaged within the viral capsid, occasionally in proteins, and during the transcription and replication of genomic DNA. Biological knots are similarly thought to change the dynamics of viral ejection, protein digestion, and translocation of biomolecules through nanopores. Despite the prevalence of knots in important biological polymers, to date, the physics of knots is only partially understood. DNA has become a well-accepted model system for investigating the physics of single polymer molecules due to its tremendous biological significance and useful experimental properties. Recent advances in microscopy and nanofabrication have enabled the real-time manipulation and imaging of single DNA molecules, facilitating fundamental studies concerning the physics of individual polymers. Leveraging these experimental techniques, this thesis aims to explore the changes knots can impart on the static and dynamic properties of single DNA molecules. We first demonstrate a mechanism for the previously observed phenomenon of the compression and self-knotting of a single DNA molecule {{in the presence of}} an electric field. We then use this mechanism to study the process of stretching complex DNA knots in an extensional field. These knots dramatically alter the way DNA stretches in two ways: an initially arrested state and a subsequently slowed <b>stretching</b> <b>phase.</b> Our work consists of the first experimental support of these phenomena, originally predicted by simulation and theory. We then develop theoretical arguments, shown to agree with simulation results, for the physics that govern the distribution of sizes of knots that stochastically occur on DNA molecules, and more broadly, all semiflexible polymers. We then extend our theory to the case where the entire DNA molecule is confined and elongated within a channel. Here, the complex non-monotonic behavior of the sizes of knots agrees with our modified theory. We finally present the results of dynamical simulations where knots on polymers interact with flows or forces. We first examine the behavior of a knot along a polymer extended by extensional flow. The flow may cause a knot to be swept off a polymer molecule, and the motion of a knot is consistent with a model. Different families of knots display different rates of motion, and we explain this difference with a simple topological mechanism. We then turn to examine the case of knots jamming on a polymer molecule extended with high tensile forces. A simple energy barrier hopping argument qualitatively explains the observed slowdown in dynamics of knots. We use these results to reexamine the problem of DNA knots jamming during nanopore translocation, and our results establish the potential for using knots to slow and control the rate of translocation by a ratcheting mechanism. The impact of this thesis is threefold. First, we have demonstrated a novel experimental platform capable of interrogating DNA knots, likely the most efficient of its kind. Second, we have established a theoretical framework for the size and probability of knotting in single molecules capable of directing experiments where these properties need to be controlled. Finally, we have shown how knotted topologies can be manipulated by external flows or forces, which have applications involving preconditioning molecules to unknotted states or the jamming of knotted molecules in nanopores. by C.

40|$|In view {{of recent}} {{evidence}} that physiological tremor {{can be enhanced}} by positive feedback via the segmental stretch reflex, several manoeuvres and procedures were employed to enhance the finger and hand tremor of healthy subjects [...] the purpose being to determine if tremorogenic effects, at least in part, are due to increase efficacy of the stretch reflex servo. Mechanical events during tremor (and during voluntary or electrically induced muscle twitches) were recorded together with EMG activity from wrist and finger flexor muscles and discharges from primary spindle endings in these muscles. Physiological tremor can be enhanced not only by manoeuvres which increase the gain of segmental stretch reflexes (Jendrassik manoeuvre) but also by manoeuvres which increase the contrast in spindle firing during <b>stretch</b> versus shortening <b>phases</b> of tremor, thus enhancing reflex modulation. Effects of the latter type {{can be achieved by}} procedures which alter mechanical twitch properties of extrafusal fibres (isoproterenol infusions and fatigue) and by procedures which involve application of spindle stimuli acting preferentially during <b>stretch</b> <b>phases</b> of tremor movements (muscle vibrations). Physiological tremor, which can be temporarily enhanced by an externally applied muscle perturbation, also becomes accentuated by those small "pseudo-myoclonic" jerks which occur in all normal subjects attempting to perform slow, smooth movements...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIntracontinental {{elevated}} plateaus remain {{geomorphologic features}} which are poorly studied. Their genesis requires a coupling between climate and deformation. The Fish River canyon (southern Namibia), {{the second largest}} canyon of the Earth, carved the South-African plateau on 550 m along 65 km. This study reveals that the upper and the lower segments are shaped by NE-SW and north-south grabens, respectively. These deformations increased the meandering and the vertical incision mainly in the lower canyon. However the river main trend was not drastically modified attesting that the river was ancient and {{that the rate of}} the vertical displacement was slow compared to the erosion rate. The main incision occurred during a NW-SE stretching of Plio-Pleistocene. These stretching episodes belong to two deformation phases previously poorly described in the South-African plateau. These widespread <b>stretching</b> <b>phases</b> are interpreted as a result of deep mantle dynamics affecting the inner African continent...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} motor unit (MU) characteristics of the biceps brachii during sinusoidal contractions in chronic stroke patients using high-density surface electromyography. Ten sinusoidal elbow flexion and extension movements were performed both passively and actively by 18 stroke patients and 20 healthy subjects. Motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) were extracted, and their root-mean-square value (RMSMUAP) was calculated. RMSMUAP was significantly larger in stroke than in healthy subjects. In both groups RMSMUAP was smaller during the <b>stretch</b> <b>phase</b> of passive movement than during active movement. The larger MUAPs indicate enlarged MUs, possibly as a result of reinnervation. The lower RMSMUAP values during passive stretch than during active movement indicates that the stretch reflex mainly activates smaller MUs, while a larger part of the MU pool can be recruited voluntarily. RMSMUAP may have added value for monitoring changes in peripheral MU properties after strok...|$|R
5000|$|The {{increased}} performance benefit {{associated with}} muscle contractions {{that take place}} during SSCs {{has been the focus}} of much research in order to determine the true nature of this enhancement. At present, there is some debate as to where and how this performance enhancement takes place. It has been postulated that elastic structures in series with the contractile component can store energy like a spring after being forcibly stretched. Since the length of the tendon increases due to the active <b>stretch</b> <b>phase,</b> if the series elastic component acts as a spring, it would therefore be storing more potential energy. This energy would be released as the tendon shortened. Thus, the recoil of the tendon during the shortening phase of the movement would result in a more efficient movement than one in which no energy had been stored. [...] This research is further supported by Roberts et al.|$|R
40|$|A self-interacting polymer {{with one}} end {{attached}} to a sticky surface has been studied {{by means of a}} flat-histogram stochastic growth algorithm known as FlatPERM. We examined the four-dimensional parameter space of the number of monomers up to 91, self-attraction, surface attraction and force applied to an end of the polymer. Using this powerful algorithm the complete parameter space of interactions and force has been considered. Recently it has been conjectured that a hierarchy of states appears at low temperature/poor solvent conditions where a polymer exists in a finite number of layers close to a surface. We find re-entrant behaviour from a <b>stretched</b> <b>phase</b> into these layering phases when an appropriate force is applied to the polymer. We also find that, contrary to what may be expected, the polymer desorbs from the surface when a sufficiently strong critical force is applied and does not transcend through either a series of de-layering transitions or monomer-by-monomer transitions.
