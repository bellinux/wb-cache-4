Study Design: Clinical report. Animals: Ragdoll cat (n = 1), 2 months old. Methods: Sternal cleft was confirmed by thoracic radiographs. Computed tomography (CT) was used to plan an optimal surgical approach. A ventral median incision was made, starting at the 3 rd <b>sternebra</b> and extended into the abdomen. Ostectomy of the proximal part of the 5 th left <b>sternebra</b> was performed. Lateral periosteal flaps were created, unfolded, and absorbable monofilament sutures preplaced to facilitate closure and the repair was reinforced by 2 peristernal sutures. A bone graft was applied, and the free margin of the omentum was sutured to the cranial aspect of the wound. Results: No major complications occurred. At 3 weeks, CT scan confirmed approximation of the hemisternebrae and at 10 months, complete fusion of the hemisternebrae had not occurred, but a strong connection of the sternal bars was present. Conclusion: Sternal cleft is a rare congenital abnormality that can be corrected surgically with favorable outcome...|$|R

Histological analysis shows thicker epidermis, which is unable to differentiate. Limbs and tail are wrapped inside the skin and do not extend properly out of the body trunk.

40|$|Retrieving a {{large amount}} of genetic {{information}} from extinct species was demonstrated feasible, but complete mitochondrial genome sequences have only been deciphered for the moa, a bird that became extinct a few hundred years ago, and for Pleistocene species, such as the woolly mammoth and the mastodon, both of which could be studied from animals embedded in permafrost. To enlarge the diversity of mitochondrial genomes available for Pleistocene species, we turned to the cave bear (Ursus spelaeus), whose only remains consist of skeletal elements. We collected bone samples from the Paleolithic painted cave of Chauvet-Pont d’Arc (France), which displays the earliest known human drawings, and contains thousands of bear remains. We selected a cave bear <b>sternebra,</b> radiocarbon dated to 32, 000 years before present, from which we generated overlapping DNA fragments assembling into a 16, 810 -base pair mitochondrial genome. Together with the first mitochondrial genome for the brown bear western lineage, this study provides a statistically secured molecular phylogeny assessing the cave bear as a sister taxon to the brown bear and polar bear clade, with a divergence inferred to 1. 6 million years ago. With the first mitochondrial genome for a Pleistocene carnivore to be delivered, our study establishes the Chauvet-Pont d’Arc Cave as a new reservoir for Paleogenetic studies. These molecular data enable establishing the chronology of bear speciation, and provide a helpful resource to rescue for genetic analysis archeological samples initially diagnosed as devoid of amplifiable DNA. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{experimental}} {{studies have been}} performed to evaluate mild diabetes effects. However, results are divergent regarding glycemia and insulin measurement, fetal macrossomia, and placental weights. The aim was to investigate repercussions of neonatally-induced mild diabetes on the maternal organism and presence of congenital defects in their offspring in other mild diabetes model. On the day of birth, female offspring were distributed into two groups: Group streptozotocin (STZ) : received 100 mg STZ/kg body weight, and Control Group: received vehicle in a similar time period. Maternal weights and glycemias were determined at days 0, 7, 14 and 21 of pregnancy. At day 21 of pregnancy, the rats were anesthetized and a laparotomy was performed to weigh and analyze living fetuses and placentas. The fetuses were classified as small (SPA), appropriate (APA) and large (LPA) for pregnancy age. Fetuses were also analyzed {{for the presence of}} external anomalies and processed for skeletal anomaly and ossification sites analysis. Statistical significance was considered as p < 0. 05. In STZ group, there was increased glycemia at 0 and 14 days of pregnancy, lower weights throughout pregnancy, higher placental weight and index, an increased proportion of fetuses classified as SPA and LPA, and their fetuses presented with an increased frequency of abnormal <b>sternebra,</b> and absent cervical nuclei, which were not enough to cause the emergence of skeletal anomalies. Thus, this study shows that mild diabetes altered fetal development, characterized by intrauterine growth restriction. Further, the reached glycemia does not lead to any major congenital defects in the fetuses of streptozotocin-induced mild diabetic rats...|$|R

There is accumulating evidence that these compounds have adverse effects on reproduction and development in humans and animal models. Animal studies have generally characterized the outcome of exposure to a single technical mixture or congener. Here, we determined the impact of exposure of rats prior to mating and during gestation to a mixture representative of congener levels found in North American household dust. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 0, 0. 75, 250 or 750 mg/kg of a mixture of flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, hexabromocyclododecane) from two weeks prior to mating to gestation day 20. This formulation delivered nominal doses of 0, 0. 06, 20 and 60 mg/kg body weight/day. The lowest dose approximates high human exposures based on house dust levels and the dust ingestion rates of toddlers. Litter size and resorption sites were counted and fetal development evaluated. No effects on maternal health, litter size, fetal viability, weights, crown rump lengths or sex ratios were detected. The proportion of litters with fetuses with anomalies of the digits (soft tissue syndactyly or malposition of the distal phalanges) was increased significantly in the low (0. 06 mg/kg/day) dose group. Skeletal analysis revealed a decreased ossification of the sixth <b>sternebra</b> at all exposure levels. Thus, exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of brominated flame retardants results in developmental abnormalities in the absence of apparent maternal toxicity. The relevance of these findings for predicting human risk is yet to be determined...|$|R

Mice engineered to lack expression of both FoxA 2 and FoxA 3 in their chondrocytes display defects in chondrocyte hypertrophy, alkaline phosphatase expression, and mineralization in their <b>sternebrae</b> and, in addition, exhibit postnatal dwarfism that is coupled to significantly decreased expression of both collagen X and MMP 13 in their growth plates.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a novel transgene insertional mouse mutant with skeletal abnormalities {{characterized by a}} kinked tail and severe curvature of the spine. The disrupted locus is designated kkt for “kyphoscoliosis kinked tail. ” Malformed vertebrae including bilateral ossification centers and premature fusion of the vertebral body to the pedicles are observed along the vertebral column, and the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae are the most affected. Some of the homozygous kkt neonates displayed two backward-pointing transverse processes in the sixth lumbar vertebra (L 6) that resembled the first sacral vertebra, and some displayed one forward- and one backward-pointing transverse process in L 6. The fourth and fifth <b>sternebrae</b> were also fused, and the acromion process of the scapula was missing in kkt mice. The skeletal abnormalities {{are similar to those}} observed in the mouse mutant undulated (un). The transgene is integrated at the distal end of chromosome 2 close to the Pax 1 gene, as revealed by FISH analysis. However, mutation of the Pax 1 gene is responsible for the un phenotype, but the Pax 1 gene in the kkt mice is not rearranged or deleted. Pax 1 is expressed normally in kkt embryos and in the thymus of mature animals, and there is no mutation in its coding sequence. Thus, the skeletal abnormalities observed in the kkt mutant are not {{due to a lack of}} functional Pax 1. Mouse genomic sequences flanking the transgene and PAC clones spanning the wild-type kkt locus have been isolated, and reverse Northern analysis showed that the PACs contain transcribed sequence. Compound heterozygotes between un and kkt (un+/−/kkt+/−) display skeletal abnormalities similar to those of un or kkt homozygotes, but they have multiple lumbar vertebrae with a split vertebral body that is more severe than in homozygous un or kkt neonates. Furthermore, the <b>sternebrae</b> are not fused and no backward-pointing transverse processes are detected in L 6. It is therefore apparent that these two mutations do not fully complement each other, and we propose that a gene in the kkt locus possesses a unique role that functions in concert with Pax 1 during skeletal development...|$|E

In kids the measures in vivo and in carcass were made over the 3 rd and 4 th <b>sternebrae</b> and in the sternocostal cartilage between the 3 rd and 4 th <b>sternebrae.</b> Were used 20 crossbred lambs and 20 crossbred kids, non-castrated, being 10 Â Dorper x Santa InÃs (DxSI) lambs, 10 Â Dorper x Brazilian Somali (DxBS) lambs, 10 Â Savana x Without Defined Standard Breed (SxWDSB) kids and 10 Â Anglo-Nubian x Without Defined Standard Breed (AxWDSB) kids. The DxSI lambs were slaughtered at an average of 138 days of age with average weight of 43. 7 kg whereas DxBS lambs were slaughtered with 32. 0 kg at an 117 days of age, when both genetic groups reached approximately 3 mm of ultrasound subcutaneous fat thickness. The kids were slaughtered at an average of 197 days of age and body weight of 21. 7 kg and 20. 3 kg, for SxWDSB and AxWDSB genotypes, respectively. The data were analyzed under a completely randomized design with 4 genotypes and 10 repetitions each. The ULMA and CLMA were higher in lambs than in kids, being DxSI lambs (ULMA = 17. 10 cmÂ; CLMA = 17. 78 cmÂ) superior in relation to DxBS lambs (ULMA = 13. 51 cmÂ; CLMA = 13. 91 cmÂ), while in the kids the values were similar: SxWDSB (ULMA = 6. 73 cmÂ; CLMA = 7. 65 cmÂ) and AxWDSB (ULMA = 6. 72 cmÂ; CLMA = 7. 01 cmÂ). There were significant and positive correlations for ULMA and CLMA of lambs (0. 75) and kids (0. 86). Measures of USFT and CSFT in lambs also showed significant and positive correlation (0. 51). In kids the depth of tissue over the 3 rd and 4 th <b>sternebrae</b> and sternocostal cartilage between the 3 rd and 4 th <b>sternebrae</b> measured in vivo and carcass showed no significant differences between both measurements in both genetic groups. There were significant and positive correlations between variables in the sternal region measured in vivo and in carcass. It was concluded that LMA is higher in lambs than in kids, indicating a superior muscular performance in lambs. The 3 mm USFT as desired slaughter criterion was reached only by lambs, indicating a greater precocity of ovine species. The use of ultrasound was an effective method to estimate LMA and SFT of lambs and LMA and the depth of the sternal tissues of kids. Objetivou-se avaliar, as caracterÃsticas quantitativas de Ãrea de olho de lombo (AOL) e espessura de gordura subcutÃnea (EGS) in vivo e na carcaÃa de cordeiros e cabritos terminados em confinamento. Antes do abate, foram mensuradas entre a 12 Â e a 13 Â vÃrtebras torÃcicas com a utilizaÃÃo de ultrassom, a espessura de gordura subcutÃnea (EGSU) e a Ãrea de olho de lombo (AOLU). Na carcaÃa mensurou-se a Ãrea de olho de lombo (AOLC) e a espessura de gordura subcutÃnea (EGSC), atravÃs de uma rÃgua milimÃtrica e paquÃmetro, respectivamente. Nos caprinos mensurou-se, in vivo e na carcaÃa a espessura dos tecidos sobre a 3 Â esternÃbra, 4 Â esternÃbra e sobre a cartilagem esternocostal entre a 3 Â e 4 Â esternÃbras. Foram utilizados 20 cordeiros e 20 cabritos mestiÃos, machos nÃo castrados, sendo 10 cordeiros Â Dorper x Santa InÃs (DxSI), 10 cordeiros Â Dorper x Somalis Brasileiro (DxSB), 10 cabritos Â Savana x SPRD (SxSPRD) e 10 cabritos Â Anglo-Nubiana x SPRD (AxSPRD). Os cordeiros DxSI foram abatidos com idade mÃdia de 138 dias e peso corporal mÃdio de 43, 75 kg, enquanto que os cordeiros DxSB apresentaram idade mÃdia de 117 dias e peso corporal mÃdio de 32, 04 kg, quando alcanÃaram aproximadamente 3 mm de espessura de gordura subcutÃnea. Por sua vez, os cabritos foram abatidos com idade mÃdia de 197 dias e peso corporal mÃdio de 21, 7 kg para os SxSPRD e 20, 3 kg para os AxSPRD. Os dados obtidos foram analisados num delineamento inteiramente casualizado com 4 genÃtipos e 10 repetiÃÃes cada. A AOLU e AOLC foram maiores nos ovinos que nos caprinos, sendo dos cordeiros DxSI (AOLU = 17, 10 cmÂ; AOLC = 17, 78 cmÂ) superiores aos DxSB (AOLU = 13, 51 cmÂ; AOLC = 13, 91 cmÂ), enquanto nos cabritos foram similares: AxSPRD (AOLU = 6, 73 cmÂ; AOLC = 7, 65 cmÂ) e SxSPRD (AOLU = 6, 72 cmÂ; AOLC = 7, 01 cmÂ). Houve correlaÃÃes positivas e significativas para a AOLU e AOLC de cordeiros (0, 75) e cabritos (0, 86). As medidas de EGSU e EGSC de cordeiros tambÃm apresentaram correlaÃÃo positivas e significativas (0, 51). Nos caprinos a profundidade dos tecidos sobre a 3 Â esternÃbra, 4 Â esternÃbra e sobre a cartilagem esternocostal entre a 3 Â e 4 Â esternÃbras mensuradas in vivo e na carcaÃa nÃo apresentaram diferenÃas significativas entre ambas as mediÃÃes em ambos os grupos genÃticos. Houve correlaÃÃes positivas e significativas entre as medidas mensuradas na regiÃo esternal in vivo e as mesmas na carcaÃa. Conclui-se que a AOL Ã maior em cordeiros do que em cabritos mesmo com idade inferior, indicando um desempenho muscular superior. A EGS desejada de aproximadamente 3 mm como critÃrio de abate foi atingida somente pelos ovinos, indicando maior precocidade de acabamento desta espÃcie. A utilizaÃÃo do ultrassom foi um mÃtodo eficaz para estimar AOL e EGS de cordeiros e AOL e a espessura dos tecidos esternais de cabritos...|$|E
40|$|Examined {{bones were}} {{obtained}} from eight adult African giant rats, Cricetomys gambianus Waterhouse. Animals used had an average body mass of 730. 00 ± 41. 91 [*]gm and body length of 67. 20 ± 0. 05 [*]cm. The vertebral formula {{was found to be}} C 7, T 13, L 6, S 4, Ca 31 – 36. The lowest and highest points of the cervicothoracic curvature were at C 5 and T 2, respectively. The spinous process of the axis was the largest in the cervical group while others were sharp and pointed. The greatest diameter of the vertebral canal was at the atlas (0. 8 [*]cm) and the lowest at the caudal sacral bones (2 [*]mm). The diameter of the vertebral foramen was the largest at C 1 and the smallest at the S 4; the foramina were negligibly indistinct caudal to the sacral vertebrae. There were 13 [*]pairs of ribs. The first seven pairs were sternal, and six pairs were asternal of which the last 2 - 3 [*]pairs were floating ribs. The sternum was composed of deltoid-shaped manubrium sterni, four <b>sternebrae,</b> and a slender processus xiphoideus. No sex-related differences were observed. The vertebral column is adapted for strong muscular attachment and actions helping the rodent suited for speed, agility, dexterity, and strength which might enable it to overpower prey and escape predation...|$|E
40|$|Recognition and {{detailed}} description of malformations and aberrations in domestic animals may be very useful in cognition {{of the problem and}} in creating breeding programs. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe a rare case of sternal (pectoral) ectopia cordis in a calf. A female calf of the Limousin breed born in Poland in 2011 was subjected to euthanasia because the heart was situated outside the chest. The carcass of the calf was subjected to anatomical examination in which alterations in cardiovascular system and in the structure of the sternum were observed. Cytogenetic studies were performed to find out if the karyotype of the calf was normal. Elongation of the ascending aorta was observed and the pattern of aortic branching was aberrant similarly to that found in dogs, not cattle. The systemic circulation was found to be linked to pulmonary circulation due to persisting large calibre arterial duct. Each of the ventricles had its own cardiac apex and walls of the ventricles manifested a similar width. The atria were slightly altered. A single, short and dilated blood vessel (pulmonary vein) evacuated its content to the left atrium. Pericardium formed no pericardial sac. Radiogram of the sternum demonstrated a ring-resembling shape and 12 (6 pairs) cartilaginous bars of the sternum (<b>sternebrae).</b> A normal female karytotype (60, XX) indicated that this malformatio...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} equine muscle tissue- and periosteal tissue-derived cells as mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) and assess their proliferation capacity and osteogenic potential {{in comparison with}} bone marrow- and adipose tissue-derived MSCs. Sample: Tissues from 10 equine cadavers. Procedures: Cells were isolated from left semitendinosus muscle tissue, periosteal tissue from the distomedial aspect of the right tibia, bone marrow aspirates from {{the fourth and fifth}} <b>sternebrae,</b> and adipose tissue from the left subcutaneous region. Mesenchymal stem cells were characterized on the basis of morphology, adherence to plastic, trilineage differentiation, and detection of stem cell surface markers via immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Mesenchymal stem cells were tested for osteogenic potential with osteocalcin gene expression via real-time PCR assay. Mesenchymal stem cell cultures were counted at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours to determine tissue-specific MSC proliferative capacity. Results: Equine muscle tissue- and periosteal tissue-derived cells were characterized as MSCs on the basis of spindle-shaped morphology, adherence to plastic, trilineage differentiation, presence of CD 44 and CD 90 cell surface markers, and nearly complete absence of CD 45 and CD 34 cell surface markers. Muscle tissue-, periosteal tissue-, and adipose tissue-derived MSCs proliferated significantly faster than did bone marrow-derived MSCs at 72 and 96 hours. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Equine muscle and periosteum are sources of MSCs. Equine muscle- and periosteal-derived MSCs have osteogenic potential comparable to that of equine adipose- and bone marrow-derived MSCs, which could make them useful for tissue engineering applications in equine medicine...|$|E
