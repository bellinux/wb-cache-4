5|$|Studies of {{the orbit}} of the comet showed that the Great Comet of 1882 was moving on an almost {{identical}} path to previous great comets seen in C/1843 D1 and C/1880 C1. These comets had also <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared</b> in the morning sky and had passed extremely close to the Sun at perihelion. One suggestion was that all three were in fact the same comet, with an orbital period that was being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage. However, studies showed this to be untenable, as the orbital period of this comet is 772 ± 3 years {{and the others are}} 600–800 years.|$|E
5|$|By 10 October Toyoda's tour of {{the front}} was complete. He {{intended}} to depart from Formosa for Japan that same day but was forced to change his plans when Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared</b> to the north, launching strikes against the Ryukyu Islands. Toyoda could not risk a return trip home through a concentrated enemy carrier force that now embarked more than 1,000 aircraft, especially not after previous Combined Fleet commanders had been lost during aerial engagements. As a result, he was grounded far from Combined Fleet headquarters at a decisive moment. Out of position and with inadequate lines of communication, the response to such overwhelming enemy air power was left to Toyoda's Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the same}} day Haldane ordered US 1/28th Battalion to closely explore the tunnels in their area of operations, {{uncovering}} a number chambers and trapdoors defended by grenades and booby traps. A Company subsequently located another tunnel system after an American {{was killed by a}} Viet Cong soldier who <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared</b> out of a large anthill. Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese {{promptly}} withdrew as {{the morning}} came on November 26, and a counterattack by the 38th Infantry Regiment later reopened {{the road to the}} rear. When the ROK 3rd Infantry Regiment of the ROK 7th Infantry Division <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared</b> in the 38th Infantry Regiment's sector, Colonel George B. Peploe of the 38th Infantry Regiment realized the right flank of the US 2nd Infantry Division and the entire Eighth Army had collapsed. Under orders from Major General Laurence B. Keiser, commander of the US 2nd Infantry Division, Colonel Peploe immediately took command of the ROK 3rd Infantry Regiment while trying to refuse his right flank. At the same time, Colonel Paul L. Freeman of the 23rd Infantry Regiment had also tried to lead his regiment to capture Chinaman's Hat, but without much success.|$|E
5|$|Following this disaster, Sayf al-Dawla {{needed time}} to recover his strength, {{but as soon as}} Nikephoros Phokas {{returned}} victorious from Crete in summer 961, he resumed the offensive in the east. The Byzantines captured Anazarbus in Cilicia, and followed a deliberate policy of devastation and massacre to drive the Muslim population away. Sayf al-Dawla's attempts to halt the Byzantine advance in Cilicia failed, and Nikephoros Phokas, with an army reportedly 70,000 strong, took Marash, Sisium, Duluk and Manbij, securing the western passes over the Anti-Taurus Mountains. Sayf al-Dawla sent his army north under Nadja to meet the Byzantines, but Nikephoros ignored them. Instead, the Byzantine general led his troops south and in mid-December, they <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared</b> before Aleppo. There they defeated an improvised army before the city walls. The Byzantines stormed the city and plundered it, except for the citadel, which continued to hold out. The Byzantines departed in early 963, taking much of the populace with them as captives.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis {{planned to}} produce sequels, but the North American video game crash of 1983 halted most video game {{production}} {{for a few}} years. Prior to the full effects of the crash, Vid Kidz developed an official sequel, Blaster in 1983. The game {{is set in the}} same universe and takes place in 2085 in a world overrun by Robotrons. Williams considered creating a proper sequel in the mid-1980s as well as a movie adaptation. The company released a sequel with 3D graphics titled Robotron X in 1996 for the Sony PlayStation and personal computers. It was ported two years later to the Nintendo 64 as Robotron 64. In addition to the graphical update, the game includes new audio and multiple camera angles. Though the game features similar gameplay as the original, it was not as well received. Authors Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams considered the moving camera in the 3D environment a negative update. They felt the original format—an overhead perspective of a single screen—presented the player with all the necessary information and relied on the player's skill. The moving camera angle, however, obscured areas of the playing field and could result in the player being shot by an enemy that <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared.</b> Vince echoed similar statements, stating that the gameplay suffered from the loss of important aspects from the original. Rollings and Adams, however, attribute the fad of classic video game remakes in the late 1990s in part to Robotron Xs release.|$|E

25|$|In 1805, Gyulay {{fought in}} the Ulm Campaign, {{commanding}} the Danube army's grenadier reserve in Franz von Werneck's corps. At the Battle of Günzburg on 9 October he commanded a division of seven battalions and 14 squadrons. Ordered to rebuild a bridge across the Danube, he did so but was surprised when a French infantry regiment <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared</b> and seized the span. Later, he escaped from Ulm with Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and others. On 4 November, Gyulai served on a council of war convened by Emperor Francis II {{to determine how to}} save Vienna.

25|$|The {{defenders}} of Biazza Ridge managed to capture two 75-mm pack howitzers, which they turned into direct fire weapons {{to defend the}} ridge.

By early evening, the situation had turned grim when six American M4 Sherman tanks <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared,</b> eliciting cheers from the weary paratroopers, who had been joined by others, including some airborne engineers, infantry, clerks, cooks and truck drivers. With this scratch force and the Shermans, Gavin counterattacked and in so doing deterred the Germans from pressing their considerable advantage. The battle ended with the Americans still in control of Biazza Ridge. For his feats of valor that day, Colonel Gavin was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
25|$|Anxious that Napoleon might {{suddenly}} show up, Schwarzenberg ordered Wittgenstein and Wrede {{to attack}} the city at once. Gérard held out on the east bank of the Seine until 11:00 am when he withdrew into Troyes. The Allies fought {{their way into the}} suburbs but were stopped at the city walls. They brought up howitzers and began shelling Troyes. During a lull in the bombardment the French garrison slipped out and joined MacDonald's retreating army. Oudinot did not think a strong rearguard was needed in La Chapelle-Saint-Luc. Consequently, the Bavarian cavalry <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared</b> behind Kellermann's cavalry, throwing it into panic. Luckily for the French, when VI Cavalry Corps stampeded their infantry held steady, but 400 prisoners were swept up by the Allies.|$|E
25|$|On 3 March 1814, Schwarzenberg {{defeated}} MacDonald in the Battle of Laubressel. At {{this time}} Jacquinot's division numbered 1,258 sabers while Trelliard's division counted 1,747 horsemen.

After the II Cavalry Corps was drawn into action, Kellermann's corps moved east to Saint-Parres-aux-Tertres.

When the VI Cavalry Corps retreated from Troyes on 4 March, Oudinot failed to provide for a rearguard. Bavarian cavalry <b>suddenly</b> <b>appeared,</b> causing the French horsemen to panic and flee.
