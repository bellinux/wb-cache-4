40|$|Firms {{exporting}} via foreign channel intermediaries, such as import agents or distributors, {{trade off}} a lack <b>of</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreign channel for a low-risk market entry. Agency theory and transaction cost analysis {{suggest that a}} lack of control manifests itself in the foreign channel intermediary (FCI) having opportunities to behave in its own interests, rather than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exporter.</b> Even so, management strategies that result in an alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exporter's</b> and FCI's goals are more likely to result in a perception <b>of</b> satisfaction in <b>the</b> relationship than if only one party's goals were met. Such management strategies should commence with an extensive precontractual screening step to find an intermediary whose goals are complementary to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exporter.</b> After forming a trading relationship, an exporter can better coordinate the relationship by noncoercive monitoring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exporter,</b> and reduce <b>the</b> potential for opportunistic behavior and achieve a relationship that performs to the satisfaction to both parties.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{literature on}} pricing-to-market has identified two possible reasons why <b>the</b> elasticity <b>of</b> prices to exchange rate changes may be asymmetric across appreciations and depreciations. If firms {{are attempting to}} increase market shares in foreign markets subject to <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> trade restrictions, then more pricing-to-market may occur during appreciations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exporter's</b> currency. If firms face capacity constraints in their distribution networks, then pricing-to-market may be exaggerated during periods <b>of</b> depreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exporters</b> currency. This paper uses panel data on German and Japanese 7 -digit industry exports to compare these competing explanations for asymmetries in pricing-to-market behavior. While the data seldom reject <b>the</b> null hypothesis <b>of</b> a symmetric response of prices to exchange rates, some industries, notably automobiles, provide empirical support for the market share model.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> national legal institutions {{on international}} trade flows. While <b>the</b> <b>exporter’s</b> risk <b>of</b> not getting paid can generally be mitigated by arrangements such as letters <b>of</b> credit, <b>the</b> importer’s risk <b>of</b> either receiving faulty shipments or of having its specifications misinterpreted is less effectively offset by similar simple agreements with <b>the</b> <b>exporter.</b> Therefore importers often depend upon courts and arbitration tribunals for seeking compensation after receiving unsatisfactory products. Because <b>exporters</b> generally keep <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> their assets in their home jurisdiction, we argue that institutions and courts in particular in <b>the</b> <b>exporter’s</b> country are critical for resolving disputes, since only these institutions could potentially seize those assets. We capture these feature of international trade in a model, which also assumes that: 1) product complexity and quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exporter</b> country’s legal institutions impact the probability that courts in <b>the</b> <b>exporter’s</b> country make and enforce a correct decision; and, 2) higher product complexity and social differences between <b>the</b> <b>exporter’s</b> country and importer’s country increase {{the probability that the}} importer is dissatisfied even when <b>the</b> <b>exporter</b> makes a good faith effort. The model predicts that 1) <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exporter</b> country institutions matter more for complex product markets, 2) <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> importer country institutions do not matter much, and 3) social differences between <b>the</b> <b>exporter</b> and importer’s countries also matter for the most complex product markets.
