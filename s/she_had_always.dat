5|$|And {{where in}} modern {{dramatic}} literature can such pearls be matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying {{out to the}} distant carousel the glad news that he {{is to be a}} father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven.... The temptation to count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist.|$|E

She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to do.
