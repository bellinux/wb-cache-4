The box office receipts of these last few films had declined from previous Wisdom films but The <b>Square</b> <b>Peg</b> (1959), an army comedy, reversed the trend {{and was one of}} the year's biggest hits. The film was the 7th most popular movie at the British box office in 1959. Less successful was Follow a Star (1959). There Was a Crooked Man (1960) was an attempt to change Wisdom's image away from Rank Organisation. The Bulldog Breed (1960) was more conventional. Wisdom remained the 10th biggest star at the British box office.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{three and a}} half stars out of five and called it [...] "another decent episode". Furthermore, he wrote that Pam and Nellie's bonding was the subplot that [...] "worked best". Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that [...] "the writers [...] trying to shove Andy Bernard in a Michael Scott-shaped hole." [...] Furthermore, he called Nellie [...] "the {{greatest}} <b>square</b> <b>peg</b> of them all." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review, despite enjoying the tension between Pam and Jim, felt that the main story never went anywhere. He called the main action of the episode [...] "lifeless", but wrote that the entry as a whole [...] "set up the conclusion of the series". Davinger also applauded Darryl's sound byte call back.|$|E
2500|$|He also {{authored}} {{the majority}} opinion in Apple v. Superior Court, where he ruled that online retailers can continue asking for credit card holder's information, such as telephone numbers and home addresses, when completing a transaction with a credit card. The complaint arose from the Song-Beverly Credit Card Act of 1971, which sought to protect consumer privacy when purchasing products in a store. Liu instead ruled for Apple, concluding that [...] "because we cannot make a <b>square</b> <b>peg</b> fit a round hole, we must conclude that online transactions involving electronically downloadable products fall outside {{the coverage of the}} statute." ...|$|E

[...] Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger—a long range missile—but JATO {{was all he could}} manage, hoping for a greater project later.

2500|$|Unlike other bands {{associated}} with the 1990s alternative music movement, Primus emerged from a mostly heavy metal background, with Claypool and LaLonde previously {{a part of the}} 1980s Californian thrash metal underground. Kirk Hammett, guitarist of Bay Area thrash metal band Metallica, stated in an 1991 interview that Primus are [...] "unique, they're a <b>square</b> <b>peg</b> in a round hole". The music of Primus has been described as [...] "thrash-funk meets Don Knotts, Jr." [...] and [...] "the Freak Brothers set to music". Also, Primus has been categorized as alternative rock, alternative metal, experimental rock, funk rock, funk metal, progressive rock, and [...] "thrash-funk". Regarding the band's genre, Claypool has stated [...] "We've been lumped in with the funk metal thing just about everywhere. I guess people just have to categorise you". MTV suggests that Primus is [...] "a post-punk Rush spiked with the sensibility and humor of Frank Zappa". Les Claypool himself once described their music as [...] "psychedelic polka." [...] Spin have labelled Primus as [...] "pranksters" [...] and an [...] "unlikely gold-selling white trash purveyor of hard-ass pinballing funk metal".|$|E
2500|$|Greg McElhatton of CBR gave A-Force #1 {{three stars}} {{out of five}} writing, [...] "Ultimately, I wish the {{narration}} from Singularity had been dropped entirely from [...] "A-Force" [...] #1.

Hopefully, they will get smoothed out a bit in future issues, but—for now—this issue is only alright." [...] Jeff Lake of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10 and said, [...] "Overall, A-Force #1 is a solid, if unspectacular debut. It's great to see this cast together again, especially {{in the hands of}} Wilson, Molina and Martin, but as of now this new direction feels hamstrung by its need to <b>square</b> <b>peg</b> its way into a round hole." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 saying, [...] "While this book starts off with a shaky foundation - namely, {{that you have to have}} read a Secret Wars tie-in to understand where Singularity came from - Wilson does a great job at firming things up, with her new heroine proving to be a fun addition to the Marvel Universe." ...|$|E

He did not get strong again until it was too late for college, and he was a <b>square</b> <b>peg</b> in a round hole all his life, as he used to tell us. Mother died before we could remember, so Murray and Dad and I were everything to each other. We were very happy too, although we were bossed by Uncle Abimelech more or less.

60|$|This was {{too much}} for the forced calmness under which the Assistant Commissioner had for upwards of {{eighteen}} months concealed his irritation with the system and the subordinates of his office. A <b>square</b> <b>peg</b> forced into a round hole, he had felt like a daily outrage that long established smooth roundness into which a man of less sharply angular shape would have fitted himself, with voluptuous acquiescence, after a shrug or two. What he resented most was just the necessity of taking so much on trust. At the little laugh of Chief Inspector Heat’s he spun swiftly on his heels, as if whirled away from the window-pane by an electric shock. He caught on the latter’s face not only the complacency proper to the occasion lurking under the moustache, but the vestiges of experimental watchfulness in the round eyes, which had been, no doubt, fastened on his back, and now met his glance for a second before the intent character of their stare had the time to change to a merely startled appearance.|$|E
60|$|As {{we walked}} along I {{reflected}} on a circumstance which all that I had lately heard about Strickland forced on my attention. Here, on this remote island, {{he seemed to}} have aroused none of the detestation with which he was regarded at home, but compassion rather; and his vagaries were accepted with tolerance. To these people, native and European, he was a queer fish, but they were used to queer fish, and they took him for granted; the world was full of odd persons, who did odd things; and perhaps they knew that a man is not what he wants to be, but what he must be. In England and France he was the <b>square</b> <b>peg</b> in the round hole, but here the holes were any sort of shape, and no sort of peg was quite amiss. I do not think he was any gentler here, less selfish or less brutal, but the circumstances were more favourable. If he had spent his life amid these surroundings he might have passed for no worse a man than another. He received here what he neither expected nor wanted among his own people -- sympathy.|$|E
