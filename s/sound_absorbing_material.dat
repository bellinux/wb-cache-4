40|$|Nowadays a great {{attention}} is paid to the level and quality of noise radiated from the tailpipe of intake and exhaust systems, to control the gas dynamic noise emitted by the engine as well as the characteristics of the cabin interior sound. The muffler geometry can be optimized consequently, to attenuate or remark certain spectral components of the engine noise, according to the result expected. Evidently the design of complex silencing systems is a time-consuming operation, which must be carried out by means of concurrent experimental measurements and numerical simulations. In particular, 1 D and multiD linear/non-linear simulation codes can be applied to predict the silencer behavior in the time and frequency domain. This paper describes the development of a 1 D-multiD integrated approach for the simulation of complex muffler configurations such as reverse chambers with inlet and outlet pipe extensions and perforated silencers with the addition of <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material.</b> The 1 D-multiD integrated approach is exploited to validate the transmission loss prediction of reverse chamber configurations with inlet and outlet extensions. Results have pointed out the capability of capturing transversal resonances at high and mid frequencies.

40|$|The tonal {{character}} of the low frequency internal noise in cars is often due to energy transmission through the tyre at the first few eigenfrequencies of the air cavity of the tyre. The first acoustic mode in the air cavity of a typical stationary car tyre is approximately 224 Hz. At this frequency the tyre is comparatively stiff resulting in a high transmission of energy from the road wheel contact to the car body itself. In order to investigate possible means of reducing this effect, the acoustic field inside a tyre is modelled. Theoretically {{it is found that}} the pressure inside a tyre and the energy transmission through the tyre to the wheel axle and the car body can be reduced by adding a <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> inside the tyre. This was confirmed by measurements on stationary as well as rotating tyres with and without added sound absorption. For a rotating tyre there is a split of the natural frequency depending on the rotational speed of the tyre. Measurements in a standard passenger car reveal that the noise level inside the car is rather high in a fairly wide frequency range around 224 Hz at normal velocities. This tonal noise can be reduced by adding sound absorption inside a tyre. Models for the prediction and the reduction of the tonal noise are presented. Measured and predicted results are compared and the agreement is found to be good. It is found that the tonal noise can be reduced by up to 9 dB. The effects of the air cavity resonances on the external noise have also been studied. It is estimated that external tyre noise can be reduced 1 dB by adding a <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> inside tyres. For a car travelling on a road a strong acoustic field is induced between the floor of the car and the road. The impact of this acoustic field can be reduced by mounting a <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> underneath the car. It is estimated that the A-weighted sound pressure level close to a running car could be reduced by 3 dB by adding this type sound absorption. It is found that aluminium foam could be a suitable <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> which could be mounted inside tyres and underneath cars. The acoustic and dynamic properties of various types of aluminium foams are discussed. In particular measurement techniques for determining sound absorption at grazing incidence are investigated.

40|$|Abstract. Melt blowing(MB) is {{a process}} for {{producing}} fibrous webs or articles directly from polymers or resins using high-velocity air or another appropriate force to attenuate the filaments. This process is one of the newer and least developed nonwoven processes. This process is unique because it is used almost exclusively to produce microfibers rather than fibers the size of normal textile fibers. MB microfibers generally have diameters in the range of 2 to 4 ㎛, although they may be as small as 0. 1 ㎛ and as large as 10 to 15 ㎛.

40|$|Acoustically treated, lined ducts {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of applications, one of which is a transmission-line {{loudspeaker}} (TLL), which consists of a long, acoustically-lined, folded duct attached to the rear of the loudspeaker driver. Consequently, knowledge and understanding of sound propagation within acoustically treated ducts is essential in order to be able to create and analyse designs for the intended applications. The lowfrequency driver of a loudspeaker creates pressure fluctuations on both sides of the diaphragm. Therefore, a loudspeaker cabinet of some sort is required to control the sound radiation from the rear of the driver and to prevent the unwanted interference of those sounds with that radiated from the front of the loudspeaker. The transmission-line loudspeakers are however, designed and optimized to control this rear driver radiations by redirecting the pressure at the back of the driver and use them to extend the overall low-frequency response of the loudspeaker system. Transmission-line loudspeakers rely on the use of <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> and, although attempts at modelling the performance of these have been reported in the literature, most transmission-line loudspeakers are designed empirically, using a combination of experience and trial-and-error. This project is concerned with creating and evaluating an engineering method of accurately modelling the sound propagating inside the transmission-line loudspeaker waveguides. Loudspeaker systems inherently suffer from an insufficient low-frequency response, due to their inefficiency at low-frequencies. Therefore, TLL rely on the use of <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> added on their internal boundaries to extend their overall response of the loudspeaker at the lowfrequency region. The acoustic load on the driver and the sound radiated from the open end of the TLL duct both depend upon the propagation of sound through the duct; and the physical length of the duct determines the frequencies that can propagate within it. The addition of <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> along the interior boundaries of the TLL reduces the speed of propagating sound within it, causing the TLL to respond such as having a much longer internal waveguide, consequently accommodating far lower frequencies within the TLL duct, extending the overall response of the loudspeaker system. The characteristics of sound propagation through a variety of two-dimensional and three-dimensional acoustically lined ducts at low-frequencies have been analyzed. Analytical models of straight ducts have been compared with the developed numerical models. In this research dissipative mufflers, that consist of ducts lined on the inside with an acoustically absorptive material, have been considered. Starting with the propagation of sound within hard-walled boundary condition ducts, this investigation moves to the modelling of waveguides treated with locally-reacting acoustic liners and next into the analysis of ducts treated with bulk-reacting acoustic absorbent materials; two kinds of excitations have been considered, namely pistonic and non-uniform excitation. The impedance mismatch and acoustic dissipation between the <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> layer and the free propagation within the duct has been modelled numerically, and the results have been compared with the in-situ measurements conducted on a range of acoustically treated and purpose built transmission-line loudspeakers.
