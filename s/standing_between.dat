5|$|The {{destruction}} of timber continued onto the mainland, prompting one observer to remark that no usable trees were left <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> {{the mouths of}} the Waccasassa and Suwannee rivers. In Williston, nearly a dozen residences were destroyed, killing {{at least one person}} and injuring 15 more. Six prison inmates were killed by a falling tree on a farm near the town, and in total, about 13 people lost their lives in mainland Levy County. Damage throughout the county, including the Cedar Keys, was estimated at $450,000.|$|E

5|$|Izsha is a zerg advisor {{in service}} to Sarah Kerrigan. She is a unique type of zerg; one of a kind. Izsha exemplifies a {{midpoint}} for Kerrigan, <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> Kerrigan's cold rationality and the feral nature of the Swarm. She harkens back to {{the ideology of the}} Overmind, but is still a rational individual. In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. On at least one occasion she entrusted Izsha with a plan to infest a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to the Swarm. She served as an advisor, recalling memories from Kerrigan's time as the Queen of Blades, and helping her to reclaim the Swarm while remaining attached to her queen's leviathan.|$|E

5|$|Nansouty's {{division}} {{suffered a}} very high casualty rate at the Battle of Wagram, with more men and horses lost {{than the other two}} heavy cavalry divisions combined. Losses in horses were extremely high, with 1,141 animals killed or injured, while losses in men were also significant, despite the fact that only the carabiniers-à-cheval really came into contact with the enemy. Overall, Nansouty's division lost 164 men killed and 436 wounded. Foremost of all, the highly battered two carabiniers-à-cheval regiments had no more than 300 horses <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> themselves {{by the end of the}} day, for an equine casualty rate of 77 percent, with the 9th and 12th cuirassiers also suffering high casualties. Bessières's charge, hastily organised with only the division of Nansouty, through murderous artillery fire and against masses of infantry prepared to receive them, had less tactical effect than at Aspern-Essling, but it did win Napoleon valuable time, allowing him to retake the initiative in this battle.|$|E
5|$|Also on Nanking's {{eastern side}} but further south, other {{units of the}} SEA faced the {{difficult}} task of fording the large moat <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> them and three of the city gates, Zhongshan Gate, Guanghua Gate, and Tongji Gate, though the speed of Japan's earlier advance played in their favor as key Chinese units slated to be deployed here were not yet in position. That evening, Japanese engineers and artillerymen closing in on Guanghua Gate managed to blow a hole in the wall. A Japanese battalion launched a daring attack through the gap and planted a Japanese flag on a portion of the gate, but was immediately pinned down by a series of determined Chinese counterattacks. The Chinese brought up reinforcements, including tanks, and they poured down grenades and even flaming, gasoline-soaked lumber onto the Japanese battalion, which was only saved from annihilation by timely bursts of concentrated artillery fire from the rest of their division. The battalion succeeded in holding its position {{for the rest of the}} battle despite losing eighty of its eighty-eight men.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Ghosts are {{hand-picked}} to form specialist kill-teams, {{placed in a}} regime of additional jump-training and covertly deployed into Ouranberg prior to the invasion.

Doing so will break {{the morale of the}} Chaos worshippers and enable the Imperial forces to recapture Ouranberg with greater ease. The task is made more daunting with the prospect of thousands of Blood Pact troopers and loxatl mercenaries <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> them and their target. However, the rest of the Tanith First face their own trials as they await deployment; a great unease is brewing between the Tanith and the Verghastite soldiers, and a crime case involving several Ghosts highlights this divide.|$|E
25|$|As the Ming dynasty faltered and {{the threat}} from {{northern}} enemies grew, Ming emperors saw the strategic value of Shanhai Pass and frequently garrisoned troops there, armies which sometimes reached up to 40,000 men. Under Emperor Hung Taiji (r. 16261643), the Qing were becoming more aggressive against the Ming. After an intermittent siege that lasted over ten years, Qing armies led by Jirgalang captured Songshan and Jinzhou in early 1642. The garrison of Ming general Wu Sangui in Ningyuan became the only major army <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> the Qing forces and the Ming capital in Beijing. In the summer of 1642, a Qing army managed to cross the Great Wall and ravaged northern China for seven months before withdrawing in May 1643, with prisoners and booty, without having fought any large Ming army.|$|E
25|$|Among black-figure Attic vases, the Panathenaic prize amphoras play {{a special}} role. After 566 BC—when the Panathenaic {{celebrations}} were introduced or reorganized—they were {{the prize for}} the winners of sport competitions and were filled with olive oil, one of the city's main export goods. On the front they routinely bore {{the image of the}} goddess Athena <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> two pillars on which roosters perched; on the back there was a sports scene. The shape was always the same and was only modified slightly over the long period of its production. The belly amphora was, as its name suggests, originally especially bulbous, with a short neck and a long, narrow foot. Around 530 BC the necks become shorter and the body somewhat narrower. Around 400 BC the vase shoulders were considerably reduced in width and the curve of the vase body looked constricted. After 366 BC the vases were again more elegant and become even narrower.|$|E

25|$|Whipple also {{discloses}} that Japan {{has retained}} its militarism, {{with reference to}} its bushido code of conduct, while the United States vacillates against the Greater Soviet Union's ascendancy. Due to the Greater Soviet Union threat, the United States and Japan have moved towards a closer military and strategic alliance. Japanese militarist values are much admired in the United States. Japan and the United States {{are the only two}} major powers <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> the Greater Soviet Union and total control of the globe—yet most Americans seem unable to be roused to deal with the Soviet threat. Whipple wonders what the emergence of an American leader like Feric Jaggar, the hero of Lord of the Swastika, could accomplish. Finally, there is a casual mention that, while in this history Nazi Germany never came into being, it is the Soviets who have undertaken the systematic genocide of all Jews in Europe—and since this is perpetrated by the Soviets, there is no power left whose armies might stop it and save at least a remnant of the Jews from this version of the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|In 1831 {{the federal}} {{survey of the}} Northwest Territory reached the Grand River; it set the {{boundaries}} for Kent County, named after prominent New York jurist James Kent. In 1833, a land office was established in White Pigeon, Michigan, with Campau and fellow settler Luther Lincoln seeking land in the Grand River valley. Lincoln purchased land {{in what is now}} known as Grandville, while Campau became perhaps the most important settler when he bought 72 acres (291,000 m²) from the federal government for $90 and named his tract Grand Rapids. Over time, it developed as today's main downtown business district. In the spring of 1833, Campau sold Joel Guild, who traveled from New York, a plot of land for $25.00, with Guild building the first frame structure in Grand Rapids, which is now where McKay Tower stands. Guild later became the postmaster, with mail at the time being delivered monthly from the Gull Lake, Michigan to Grand Rapids. Grand Rapids in 1833 was only a few acres of land cleared {{on each side of the}} Grand River, with oak trees planted in light, sandy soil <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> what is now Lyon Street and Fulton Street.|$|E
25|$|The British {{loans to}} China greatly {{offended}} the Japanese, {{who believed that}} if the British would cease their financial support of China, they would finally win the war. Konroe thought that the British effort to stabilize China's currency and thereby prevent the complete economic collapse of China {{was the only thing}} <b>standing</b> <b>between</b> them and the total victory required for his program. Since the loans to China were guaranteed by the British government, the Chinese silver as collateral was not strictly necessary from economic point of view, but it was felt that for public relations, it was necessary for the Chinese to put up collateral, as the British people might otherwise disapprove of their government guaranteeing loans to a country with chaotic finances like China. At the same, both the United States and the Soviet Union also made loans to the Kuomintang government, again to keep Japan embroiled in China. The Americans lent China some $45 million starting in December 1938 while the Soviet Union lent a sum of rubles equivalent to $250 million. To persuade the Soviets not to support China, the Japanese began a border war with the Soviet Union in 1938–1939 ended with the Japanese being badly defeated by the Soviets in August 1939 in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol.|$|E
