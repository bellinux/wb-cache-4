5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays, the contents of the <b>screen</b> <b>memory,</b> and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E
50|$|In {{discussing}} multidirectional memory, it {{is important}} to highlight that <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> is also a kind of multidirectional memory, even though <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> operates more on the personal level while multidirectional memory is primarily collective. <b>Screen</b> <b>memory</b> is “covering up a traumatic event-another traumatic event-that cannot be approached directly”.|$|E
50|$|InterWord was a {{menu-driven}} WYSIWYG wordprocessor {{which allowed}} 80-column editing (screen modes 0 or 3, {{with the latter}} taking less <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> but displaying fewer lines on the screen), {{as well as a}} non-standard 106-column view using custom fonts. 40- and 53-column views were also available if a larger font was required or to reduce <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> footprint, and the display would scroll horizontally when narrower than the printed page. InterWord could not use the extra-low-memory teletext mode except for its main menu, and recommended that the machine have Shadow RAM (like the BBC Master) so that <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> would not be an issue.|$|E

50|$|Video cards {{suffered}} {{from their own}} incompatibilities. Once video cards advanced to SVGA the standard for accessing them was no longer clear. At the time, PC programming used a memory model that had 64 KB memory segments. The most common VGA graphics mode's <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> fit into a single memory segment. SVGA modes required more memory, so accessing the full <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> was tricky. Each manufacturer developed their own methods of accessing the <b>screen</b> <b>memory,</b> even {{going so far as}} not to number the modes consistently. An attempt at creating a standard named VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE) was made, but not all manufacturers used it.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal {{scrolling}} {{requires the}} same Display List implementation {{as the worst}} case example described for Vertical Coarse Scrolling. So, where Horizontal scrolling is implemented, vertical scrolling is also supported just by changing the value incrementing or decrementing the LMS addresses. The other benefit of this arrangement {{is that it is}} easy to manage <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> around ANTIC's 4K <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> boundary limit.|$|E
50|$|The Memory Scan Register, a {{register}} addressing the data {{stored in the}} <b>screen</b> <b>memory,</b> is 16-bit, but only the lower 12 bits change when ANTIC is sequentially scanning the video memory. This means the Display List requires a Mode line instruction including the LMS (Load Memory Scan) option where <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> crosses a 4K boundary. ANTIC's graphic modes E and F require more than 7.5K of <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> for a full screen display. The Display Lists for these displays require the LMS option added to a Mode instruction near {{the middle of the}} display where <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> crosses the 4K boundary. Note that the 4K boundary cannot be crossed within the middle of a Graphics Mode line. The 4K boundary address can only be crossed between the end of one Mode line {{and the beginning of the}} next line. In other words, the memory for the previous Mode line ends at the exact last byte of the 4K block and the next Mode line begins at the exact first byte on the other side of the 4K boundary.|$|E

The Character or Map mode specified will begin displaying bytes from that address. The LMS option must appear in the first Playfield Mode Instruction line (not Blank Line) in the Display List to initialize ANTIC to begin reading {{at the start of}} <b>screen</b> <b>memory.</b> Most of the Operating System-generated full screen modes will have only that one occurrence of the LMS modifier present in the Display List.

50|$|Combining the Map and Character Mode {{instructions}} {{with the}} LMS bit {{makes it possible}} to set the <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> address freely within the 64K address space independently for each display line. In other words, the <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> {{does not have to be}} completely contiguous memory scanned sequentially towards higher addresses - only that a single Mode line must be provided with adequate sequential bytes of memory to meet the requirements of that Mode, width of the display, and Scrolling feature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Screen</b> <b>memory</b> gains its {{significance}} from {{the presence of}} other memories and not necessarily as a stand-alone memory. With <b>screen</b> <b>memory,</b> {{there is more than one}} memory operating at the same time, except one is displaced by another, so we may not realise the presence of multiple memories. This points to its multidirectionality. The memory being used as a replacement is usually one that is easier to confront. This however does not result in the total silencing of the other memory(ies), which would suggest competition between or among memories.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal coarse {{scrolling}} {{requires a}} little more effort than vertical scrolling. While horizontal scrolling is expected to present {{the illusion of a}} view port moving left and right across a wide panoramic scene made of <b>screen</b> <b>memory,</b> ANTIC's automatic memory scan increment conflicts with this idea that the rows of screen data is wider than the display. Presenting <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> as long horizontal lines requires an LMS modifier for every Display List Text or Map Mode instruction in the scrolling region. A horizontal step is accomplished by incrementing or decrementing all the LMS addresses of the scrolling region.|$|E

The FBMS evidenced good test-retest reliability and high correlation with standard measures of memory. In receiver operating characteristic analyses, the FBMS correctly classified 100 % of patients with probable Alzheimer disease and 87. 5 % of normal elderly subjects. Sensitivity and specificity for patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment was 82. 6 % and 87. 5 %, respectively. Performance on the FBMS was generally independent of the effects of age, education, or primary language.

50|$|The Display List and {{the display}} data are written into RAM by the CPU. ANTIC reads the Display List instructions, <b>screen</b> <b>memory,</b> and {{character}} set information from RAM using a technique known as {{direct memory access}} (DMA). A BASIC or 6502 machine language program's job is to initialize the display—set up the Display List instructions, organize <b>screen</b> <b>memory</b> (and character set if applicable), and then direct ANTIC to start the display. After this, ANTIC automatically takes care of generating the screen display. This powerful design allows the Atari 8-bit computers to produce complex, mixed-mode displays without direct CPU intervention while other platforms, even those designed much later, cannot either mix graphics modes in one display, or do so without direct, complex CPU interrupts.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Alzheimer Disease (AD) {{is often}} {{diagnosed}} at a moderately advanced stage, {{even though its}} early detection has become increasingly important, because of the continuing development of treatments that may improve its outcome. OBJECTIVE: To determine if a free <b>memory</b> <b>screening</b> program is associated with an earlier diagnosis of AD, compared with traditional referral methods, such as by physicians and family members. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective study of 1489 consecutive patients with AD who presented to an outpatient memory disorders clinic between 1993 and 2002. Subjects were classified according to referral source (<b>memory</b> <b>screening,</b> physician, family/friend, other), and self-reported ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, white Hispanic). The associations between referral source and the presenting cognitive and behavioral status of subjects were evaluated using analysis of variance and logistic regression analyses, after controlling for potentially confounding factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Score on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), duration of cognitive symptoms, and presence of psychosis, defined as delusions and/or hallucinations. RESULTS: After controlling for ethnicity, gender, and the year of diagnosis, subjects with AD, who were referred by the <b>memory</b> <b>screening</b> program, scored significantly higher at presentation on the MMSE (20. 8 +/- 5. 7), than those referred by physicians (18. 8 +/- 6. 6), family/friends (16. 8 +/- 6. 6), or other referral sources (15. 3 +/- 7. 1). Subjects with AD, referred by the <b>memory</b> <b>screening</b> program, also had a lower reported duration of illness at presentation, and a decreased frequency of psychosis compared with those referred by family/friend and other methods. Other factors related to a diagnosis of AD at a later stage included female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, and a diagnosis early in the 1993 to 2002 time period. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>memory</b> <b>screening</b> program referred patients with AD to a memory clinic at an earlier phase of illness compared with traditional methods such as physician referral...|$|R
