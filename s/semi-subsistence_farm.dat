40|$|At {{the date}} of Romania’s {{accession}} to the European Union, our country’s agriculture had a much lower development level compared to most EU Member States and the EU average. In the present paper we try to investigate the economic size of the Romanian farms {{in comparison with the}} economic farm size in the European Union. The goal is not to copy the pattern followed by the other countries, but rather to know the level and trend of the existing gap and to draw certain conclusions with regard to the possibility of narrowing this gap under the conditions of the global economic crisis. economic size, European economic size unit, subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farm...</b>|$|E

40|$|In the {{enlargement}} {{process of the}} European Union (EU), micro farm households so called <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> households (SFHs) came into {{the focus of the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The political question was and still is, how these households could be stimulated to become market oriented private farms or to exit the agricultural sector? This would induce positive structural change. It is difficult to answer this question. Reliable statistical information on SFHs is scarce. Moreover, SFHs may follow diverse objectives in a simultaneous manner to sustain their livelihoods. The portfolio of objectives largely depends on their specific characteristics. Having said this, it is clear {{that it is difficult to}} address the households with the right policy measures to promote structural change and maintain sustainable rural livelihoods.

The transition from the status-quo of an agricultural structure dominated by subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> in the view of restructuring, resulting in a more efficient sector - is a must. Present study proposes to evaluate the application of specific measures of the Romanian National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) that sought to support <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> between 2007 and 2013. Three NRDP measures have been identified under which <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> were eligible: Measure 112 "Setting up of young farmers", Measure 121 "Modernization of agricultural holdings", and Measure 141 "Supporting semi-subsistence agricultural holdings". The above measures belong to the 1 st Axis of the Common Agricultural Policy's second pillar, thus having a common general goal the improvement of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, while aiming at restructuring and developing the physical potential and management of generation change - trying to keep the rural population in place.

40|$|Social capital {{matters in}} {{determining}} a person¿s or a family¿s material well-being. It {{is argued that}} social capital functions similar to the traditional production factors. However, {{there are not many}} empirical analyses looking into this hypothesis at the farm-household level in general and in post-communist countries in particular. Whether or not social capital affects farm income is tested in this paper in two ways using micro-data from 185 Bulgarian <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> households (SFHs). First, it is tested whether social capital has an impact on agricultural income. Whether social capital promotes more efficient farming is evaluated in a second step. The findings confirm the hypothesis that social capital not only increases agricultural income, but also the efficiency of agricultural production among SFHs in Bulgaria. However, different specifications of social capital may impact income and efficiency in a diverse way. While good relations to corporate farms are significant in getting higher agricultural incomes, good relations to large-scale private farmers significantly impact efficient managerial capability of SFHs. It is suggested that good links to the second group are vital for those SFHs, which aim at becoming viable farmers in the future. JRC. DDG. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) {{introduced}} a special transitional semi-subsistence measure {{to promote the}} smallest agricultural producers, so-called <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> households (SFHs) in the enlargement process. An outlook {{on the future of}} SFHs requires comprehensive and reliable information on the phenomenon and the impact of policy measures on their development. Therefore, a survey using a standardised questionnaire was conducted in Poland (175 households), Romania (185 households), and Bulgaria (184 households) from July to September 2007. In a first step, four major types of SFHs could be identified by means of cluster analysis: (i) rural diversifiers, (ii) rural pensioners, (iii) farmers, and (iv) rural newcomers. In a second step, a multiobjective linear programming household model was designed to simulate the impact of policy measures and various household strategies on the future viability of the SFHs. Results show that the most preferable combination of strategies for rural diversifiers and rural newcomers is starting a non-farm self-employed activity and developing their farms. Farmers will advance best when they focus on developing their farms only, whereas rural pensioners will mainly remain or become unviable. JRC. DDG.

40|$|<b>Semi-subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> {{households}} (SFHs) have persevered in Central and Southeastern Europe. An {{outlook on}} future perspectives of SFHs asks for reliable {{information on the}} phenomenon of SFHs {{and the impact of}} policy measures on their development options: (1) intensifying farming, (2) diversifying income creating activities, or (3) exiting farming for waged employment. This article focuses on SFHs and rural non-farm employment (RNFE). On the basis of a comparative 2007 -survey of 489 SFHs in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, three countries with particularly many SFHs, four major types of SFHs (rural pensioners, farmers, rural diversifiers, rural newcomers) were identified. For policy analysis, a multiobjective linear programming household model was developed. In the model, labour can be devoted to (1) farming, (2) self-employment and (3) waged employment. The policy scenarios reflect different development options for SFHs: (1) farm development, (2) start selfemployment, (3) farm development and start self-employment, and (4) stop agriculture. Policy can foster the structural change but the modeling results show that fine targeting to the various types of semi-subsistence farms and country specificities is a strong precondition for success.

40|$|Subsistence and semi-subsistence farming” {{has been}} a {{research}} topic in the last decades on which a generally agreed definition was not reached yet. The main approaches to this subject are based on some criteria such as: farm size, economic size and market participation. In {{the context of the}} last 2 waves of EU enlargement, the subsistence farming, a specific phenomenon in the New EU Member States that occurred {{as a result of the}} transition economies and land reforms, induced important social implications in the rural area and considerable development gaps between the Old Member States and the New ones. For efficiency and competitiveness reasons, with the Common Agricultural Policy a special rural measure was designed to support the drive to commercialization of subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> in the NMS. For the practical implementation of this measure, the generally definition for <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> in the context of the NMS {{has been a}}greed as “the farm producing mainly for self-consumption, but also selling a certain part of the production”, in which the “surplus” part that is sold has a degree of regularity and consistency. This issue was debated in the new Member States (NSM), before the elaboration of the National Rural Development Plans, being tackled through the local characteristics of each NMS, depending on the development level of the respective economies, correlated with the degree of general modernization of the society and with the accuracy of the available data. This paper intends to present some options for different types of small Romanian farmers to overpass the semi-subsistence status and become commercial, using the support options provided by CAP. <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming,</b> rural development, New Member States, measures of National Rural Development Plans, Romanian farmers...|$|R

40|$|Ukraine {{belongs to}} the group of {{countries}} which are known for the widespread phenomenon of subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming.</b> Individual farmers are not obliged to produce financial reports and their incomes belong to the category of unobservable incomes. When checking the eligibility for social assistance the level of their incomes needs to be estimated. In a country, where poverty rate is quite high, the coverage of the poor with financial aid is relatively low and public finances under constant control, the importance of a fair and justified methodology for income imputation is particularly strong. In this situation, an outdated and unfair current system of agriculture income estimation in Ukraine calls for immediate changes. This paper presents recommendations for the Ukrainian government in the area of agriculture income imputation, where several methods of estimating farm income were proposed (including the one based on Household Budget Survey). The recommendations were preceded with the analysis of five countries' practices in this area: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, and Poland.

40|$|Everybody knows: rural regions offer fewer {{possibilities}} for non-farm employment than urban areas. For this reason, {{it was the}} <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> structures that had to absorb the released workers from the big rural state enterprises and the urban-rural migrants fleeing unemployment in the towns {{in the course of}} economic transformation. This has created hidden unemployment in farm households and thus low agricultural labour productivity in the European transition economies. From a policy point of view, it is therefore desirable to promote new jobs outside the farm sector in order to decrease the livelihood dependency on agriculture. But do rural people actually have a choice? And if so, will they go for non-farm employment? In Europe’s transition economies rural people taking up non-farm jobs seem to do this predominantly due to distress-push and not so much due to demand-pull factors. The former would imply that distress pushes them to earn money even in very low-paid jobs. The latter indicates better remunerated job options because there is demand. When individuals decide what kind of employment to go for, they consider among other factors also the support they can get from relatives and friends, the opinion of the local society in general, the resources they can mobilize and the barriers they are supposed to overcome. Since the late 1990 s, {{a number of studies have}} been done with respect to non-farm rural employment (NFRE) and its contribution to rural development.

40|$|Over {{fifteen years}} have elapsed since {{the process of}} {{transition}} from the socialist system started in the early 1990 s. During this time, Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia have undergone profound structural change with wide variation {{in the amount of}} transformation in rural areas. In retrospect, {{it can be seen that}} the countries that chose to transform their socialized agriculture into a private-ownership and market-based system experienced the most positive economic performance. These countries in 2004 became members of the European Union, and left the classical stages of transition behind. Looking at the developments of the past one and a half decade, it is clear, however, that the initial expectations for the transformation in the bulk of the region were overly optimistic and the transition process in agriculture is far more complex than originally envisaged. It is widely recognized, for instance, that the importance of functioning institutions was underestimated at the outset of the transition. Increased social problems and alarming signs of increasing poverty and inequality have also added a new, unexpected, dimension to the transition process. This Seminar provided an excellent opportunity to discuss the process and the status of transition in agriculture as well as to review of the status of agricultural economics profession in the region.

In recent years, Romania has successfully reduced both development gaps and poverty rates.

The findings of the research made to identify the manner in which communication, on the European funding for the 2007 - 2013 period, was made pointed out that the methods used did not succeed to lower the lack of interest or improve the information level of the people living in the Timis County. They neither stimulated them {{to find out more about}} this matter nor increased the number of people who applied for European financing. The authors point out {{the importance}} of using interdisciplinary teams to inform the owners of <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> about various financing possibilities...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture {{plays an}} {{important}} role in Turkey, both in social and economic terms. Subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> is an important characteristic of the Turkish agriculture. These farms are typically characterized by low productivity and only a small fraction of production has been marketed. While the rate of agriculture in national income was 14. 7 % in 2000, this rate is declined to 10. 7 % in 2005. Turkey is endowed with rich natural and human resources, but it is still far from reaching full potential of agricultural growth because of the inefficient agricultural policies. The prevailing conditions in agriculture combined with the mismanagement in macro and agricultural policies prevented an overall structural transformation of the sector. The long-term objectives of agricultural policies obviously need to be the improvement of productivity in the sector. In this study, the recent changes and developments in agriculture sector in general economy, agricultural structure, land use, production and policies in Turkey are analyzed. In addition, problems and proposed solutions related to agricultural in Turkey are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{biodiversity}} is {{a crucial}} environmental resource. Much of the agricultural biodiversity remaining today is found on the <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> of poorer countries and on the small-scale farms and home gardens of more industrialised nations. The traditional Hungarian home gardens, which serve as small farms, are an example. Historically, these home gardens have served important functions related to food security, diet quality, and local culture. Some policies related to European Union accession threaten the survival of traditional home gardens in Hungary’s transitional economy. This paper applies the choice experiment method to estimate the value farmers themselves attach to the agricultural biodiversity still found in these micro-agroecosystems. One of several related studies, its aim is to enhance policy {{understanding of the role}} of Hungarian small farms and home gardens in the National Agri-Environmental Programme. The analysis is based on primary data collected in three environmentally sensitive areas of Hungary where pilot agri-environmental programmes have been initiated. Findings demonstrate the variation in values farmers assign to home gardens across regions and households, with implications for the design of efficient public conservation programmes.
