5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat {{is the loss}} of large sections of the Larsen Ice <b>Shelf</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula. The recent collapse of Wordie Ice <b>Shelf,</b> Prince Gustav Ice <b>Shelf,</b> Mueller Ice <b>Shelf,</b> Jones Ice <b>Shelf,</b> Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice <b>Shelf</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice <b>shelf</b> systems are.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{habitats}} can {{be divided}} horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline {{to the edge of}} the continental <b>shelf.</b> Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the <b>shelf</b> area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental <b>shelf.</b> Alternatively, marine habitats {{can be divided}} vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent <b>shelf</b> position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so <b>shelf</b> browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open <b>shelf</b> access for patrons.|$|E
5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their <b>shelf</b> life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a <b>shelf</b> life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.|$|E

Moreover, perlecan labeling was sparse in the basement membrane of the MES, on which laminin and type IV collagen were observed. Moreover, we assessed the distribution of matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 9, MMP- 2, and MMP- 3 in developing mouse palates and these MMPs were observed in the MES. Our findings indicated that heparanase was important for palate formation because it mediated degradation of the ECM of palatal <b>shelves.</b> Heparanase may, in concert with other proteases, participate in the regression of the MES...|$|R

5|$|Archeological {{data from}} the Late Pleistocene in South Asia is vital for our {{understanding}} of the evolution of modern human behavior and how early humans spread through the Old World. In prehistoric times, the movement of human and faunal populations from the Indian mainland to Sri Lanka and back took place over the continental <b>shelf</b> shared between the two countries, which from around 7000 BP has been submerged below the Palk Strait and Adam's Bridge. Being only around 70 m deep, significant reductions in sea level due to climate change, in at least the past 500,000 years, periodically caused the continental <b>shelf</b> to be exposed, forming a land bridge approximately 100km wide and 50km long.|$|E
5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} <b>shelf.</b> The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental <b>shelf</b> was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E

5000|$|Ice <b>shelves</b> are thick {{plates of}} ice, formed {{continuously}} by glaciers, that float atop an ocean. The {{presence of the}} <b>shelves</b> acts as [...] "brakes" [...] for the glaciers. These <b>shelves</b> serve another important purpose -- [...] "they moderate the amount of melting that occurs on the glaciers' surfaces. Once their ice <b>shelves</b> are removed, the glaciers increase in speed due to meltwater percolation and/or a reduction of braking forces, and they may begin to dump more ice into the ocean than they gather as snow in their catchments. Glacier ice speed increases are already observed in Peninsula areas where ice <b>shelves</b> disintegrated in prior years." ...|$|R

5|$|On the mandible, the {{diastema}} is {{very large}} and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 forward to a point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, {{an opening in the}} jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches {{to the level of the}} front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small and opens in the diastema, near the ventral <b>shelf</b> of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal <b>shelf.</b> Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice <b>Shelf,</b> the Ronne Ice <b>Shelf,</b> and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Lesser Sunda Islands {{is a small}} {{archipelago}} which, {{from west}} to east, consists of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba and the Timor islands; all are located {{at the edge of}} the Australian continental <b>shelf.</b> Volcanoes in the area are formed because of oceanic crusts and the movement of the <b>shelf</b> itself. Some volcanoes completely form an island, for instance, the Sangeang Api island. Mount Tambora, on Sumbawa island, erupted on 5 April 1815, with a scale 7 on the VEI and is considered the most violent eruption in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|The M2 {{is similar}} to that of eosimiids and almost {{identical}} to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows well-developed small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally well-developed crests. The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar <b>shelf,</b> the outer area of the tooth, is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the <b>shelf</b> is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an invagination in the outer wall of the tooth) more symmetrical in the former. The parastyle, a small cusp in the outer front corner of the tooth, is located more buccally (towards the outer side of the tooth) than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar <b>shelf</b> is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth, is more expansive. The lingual cingulum is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the secondary palate commences in the sixth week of human embryological development. It is characterised by the formation of two palatal <b>shelves</b> on the maxillary prominences, the elevation of these <b>shelves</b> to a horizontal position, and then a process of palatal fusion between the horizontal <b>shelves.</b> The <b>shelves</b> will also fuse anteriorly upon the primary palate, with the incisive foramen being the landmark between the primary palate and secondary palate. This forms {{what is known as}} the roof of the mouth, or the hard palate.|$|R
40|$|In {{determining}} global sea-to-air CO 2 flux from measurements or models, {{the ocean}} margin {{has not been}} resolved from the land or the open ocean. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} <b>shelves</b> can be either a large sink or a source for atmospheric CO 2. This CO 2 sink/source term may substantially alter our current view of the global carbon budget for land and oceans. However, past fieldwork and synthesis have focused on a few <b>shelves</b> in the northern temperate zone while the vast majority of other <b>shelves</b> are ignored. By dividing the highly heterogeneous <b>shelves</b> into seven provinces, we suggest that the continental <b>shelves</b> are a sink for atmospheric CO 2 at mid-high latitudes (- 0. 33 Pg C a(- 1)) and a source of CO 2 at low latitudes (0. 11 Pg C a(- 1)). Warm temperature and high terrestrial organic carbon input are most likely responsible for the CO 2 release in low latitude <b>shelves...</b>|$|R
