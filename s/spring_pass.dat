50|$|The {{reading device}} {{was the most}} {{critical}} part of the machine. Built with electrical conductors or springs, punched cards were introduced, the <b>springs</b> <b>passed</b> through the holes producing contact. The <b>springs</b> only <b>passed</b> through the holes of the punched cards, causing the information to be recorded. He obtained the ideas for this machine by stealing the notes of Henrik Hartzner, his Danish partner. One of the main problems of this method was the low durability of the material of the cards, which meant that the method did not always work the right way. Another major problem was the dust that entered the holes of the contacts. Finally, {{one of the biggest}} problems Bull and Knutsen had to face was that because of the contacts, sparks were created causing the machine to crash frequently. All these details were being constantly improved.|$|R
