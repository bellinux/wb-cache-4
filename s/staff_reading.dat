40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} achieve the results that meet the {{specifications}} of a given project, like engineering surveys and deformation measurements, {{the knowledge of the}} reliability and accuracy of the surveying equipment is inevitable. Precise digital levels and reflectorless total stations are used nowadays for several applications in geodetic engineering due to their highly accurate and fast measurements in an automated measuring process. A shortcoming is that they give less accurate measurements in some cases of observations. There are several sources of errors which {{have an effect on the}} accuracy of <b>staff</b> <b>reading</b> during digital leveling such as the effect of sun, and therefore have to be investigated. The quality and accuracy of measurements of electronic surveying instruments may be affected by the capacity of instrument battery which may be worked for long time in the field. This paper investigates the effect of sun on the accuracy of digital level measurements and investigates also the effect of battery capacity on the accuracy of total station and digital levels observations. The paper is performed also to find out the effect of inclined angle of reflecting surface, its colors and types on the accuracy of reflectorless total station measurements which have a great influence on monitoring the deformation of cylindrical and domical structures. The results of practical measurements, calculations and analysis of the interesting tests using least squares theory and computer programs are also presented...|$|E

40|$|This study, {{within the}} {{framework}} of improving the English course for postgraduate level at IPB (Bogor Institute of Agriculture), attempts {{to determine the extent of}} English reading activities for academic purposes expected by agricultural teaching staff at post graduate level, different expectations across the study programs or a particular area of specialised discipline, the extent of English problems experienced by postgraduate students and the strategies used to cope with English needs in their postgraduate studies, to test a hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between the students' command/scores of English and their achievements/scores in agricultural subjects. Questionnaires for agricultural staff and students were adapted from Hughes (1988) and Weir (1988) to address these questions. Students' academic records were obtained to compute the correlation between scores in English and agricultural subjects. Review of literature and research in current theories of reading in EFL is given to serve as a theoretical foundation to discuss English reading lessons from secondary level to tertiary level in Indonesia and to provide general implications to improve the English course at IPB. The results indicate that <b>staff</b> <b>reading</b> expectation in English is high in comparison to the students' level of English and in that all eight types of reading activities listed in the questionnaires were expected. There are some different expectations across the study programs. However, the most relevant finding to note in regard to the the English course is that reading English texts as review of literature for research proposes and reading English texts for writing assignments were expected across all the study programs. It is also found that reading English texts for academic purposes was still a problem for the majority of student respondents and there are various interesting reading strategies used by the student to cope with the English needs of their studies. However, further investigation is essential to assist the students with reading problems since the results do not specify the nature of reading problems and methods used by the respondents. A significant correlation is found between scores in English and agricultural subjects at the level of 5 % and 1 % by the Spearman rank- order and the Pearson product-moment correlation formulas. This implies that English is central to the students' success in their postgraduate studies, which is also supported by the student respondents' opinions. General implications and suggestions are provided to assist postgraduate with reading problems and to improve the English course for the students...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary It is {{estimated}} that 2, 773, 460 people under 17 {{are in need of}} child and adolescent mental health services provided by the GP or schools. It is also known that half of all anxiety disorders - the most common mental health condition - are experienced before the age of 12 years old. 	Young people face many risk factors for poor mental health but not all young people with mental health conditions seek support or receive the support or services they need. The current environment of austerity means that there is decreasing resourcing of the third sector and increasing pressure on CAMHS. 	‘Shelf Help’ is the name that has been used to market the Reading Well for young people scheme. It is a reading list for those who experience mental health problems between 13 - 18 yrs old, or are friends with, live with, or care for people who do and is. Shelf Help is delivered in partnership with the Society of Chief Librarians as part of the Chief Librarian’s Universal Health Offer. 	Reading Well for young people is endorsed by health professionals and supported by public libraries and provides advice of specific topics such as anxiety, depression, stress, OCD, self-harm, bullying, eating disorders, autism and aspergers as well as general topics to do with adolescence. This research report documents the impact of introducing ‘Shelf Help’ – the Reading Well for young people scheme - into a secondary school environment in partnership with a local charity, which supports the mental wellbeing of young people. 	Adult stakeholders were interviewed during a scoping phase (n= 12) to determine how to discretely monitor the usage and impact of the Reading Well for young people at The Priory School and Phase, in Hitchin. 	Multiple copies of the reading list were given to the School and Phase, and young people were left to interact with the books for 3 months (Dec 2016 – February 2017. The engagement with the books was monitored at each site. Young people and key adult stakeholders were consented to take part in focus groups and interviews (during March 2017). Qualitative analysis of interviews focus groups used to determine the impact of engaging with the Reading Well for young people books. 	 33 participants provided qualitative data for the project, 18 young people and 15 adults. 	 26 participants (8 adults and 18 young people) took part in focus groups and interviews to determine engagement with and impact with the scheme. 	Innovative and successful approaches to getting young people to engage with Shelf Help books were devised e. g. Creating a wellbeing corner in the library, selecting a’ book of the week’, promoting the scheme to the whole school to create inclusivity and talking points, making Shelf Help the focus of wellbeing events, a <b>staff</b> <b>reading</b> challenge, opportunity to write short reviews for other library users. Books were recommended to service users of Phase which included young people and parents. 	 128 Reading Well for young people books were borrowed from the library by 67 people during the 3 months, a further 35 titles were borrowed by 18 users at Phase. Borrowers ranged from year 7 to year 11 as well as adults. Several titles were renewed and many were continually on loan {{for the duration of the}} project. Interestingly, many people used the wellbeing corner to browse and read books during break-times, without taking out loans. Many positive impacts of reading the Shelf Help books were identified. Four key themes emerged in the qualitative research analysis: 	Improved awareness, knowledge and understanding of mental health conditions. 	Improved emotional and mental wellbeing, specifically relating to confidence, self-esteem, hope, isolation and emotional intelligence 	Changes in behaviour and improved relationships 	Normalising and destigmatizing mental health discussions. Through piloting Shelf Help in a secondary school and charity setting there were several areas of learning going forwards. The books can be accessed by people with low, moderate or severe mental health conditions, thus suggestions to develop a supportive environment include: 	 	Ensuring appropriate training in mental first aid to key staff involved in the shelf help scheme – this may include staff who would not normally have this training. 	Provide time and access for staff to read through the list of books and familiarise themselves with the content prior to rolling out to the whole organisation. 	Providing activities, or book groups that would allow young people to discuss the books they have been reading within a facilitated environment, especially where some books may make young people feel sad or upset. 	Ensure the use of the Shelf Help leaflet as much as possible, specifically as it has contact number for support organisations that can be contacted, often 24 / 7. In conclusion, all participants found the Reading Well for young people scheme highly acceptable and the inclusive approach has supported an increase in discussion about mental health in each organisation that piloted ‘Shelf Help’. Further research should now be conducted to further understand the impact of the Reading Well for young people scheme on wellbeing and resilience...|$|E
