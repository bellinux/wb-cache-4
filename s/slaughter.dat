50|$|Dhabīḥah (ذَبِيْحَة) is a {{prescribed}} method of ritual animal slaughter; {{it does not}} apply to most aquatic animals.

5|$|Following Governor Madison's death, Secretary of State Charles Stewart Todd {{offered to}} step down if <b>Slaughter</b> {{preferred}} to appoint someone else to the post. The letter was not an explicit resignation, as Todd emphatically declared his intention to work with <b>Slaughter</b> should the governor choose to retain him. <b>Slaughter</b> did replace Todd with former Senator John Pope, however, apparently as a political favor. This move proved disastrous for Slaughter's political career. Todd was very popular {{by virtue of being}} the son-in-law of twice-governor Shelby. By contrast, Pope was extremely unpopular for his vote in the U.S. Senate against declaring war in the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel <b>Slaughter</b> was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. <b>Slaughter,</b> who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, <b>Slaughter</b> began his campaign.|$|E

5|$|Prohibited by the Kentucky Constitution from {{succeeding}} {{himself as}} lieutenant governor, <b>Slaughter</b> {{ran for governor}} of Kentucky in 1812. The impending war with England, however, drew military hero and former governor Isaac Shelby into the race.

Following his defeat, <b>Slaughter</b> took a two-year hiatus from public life, and engaged in farming at his estate in Mercer County.|$|E

The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and <b>slaughter</b> process taken in Futo in October 1999 (a still of which can be seen on the right), shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN.|$|E

5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are <b>slaughtered</b> {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael.

Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world.
