5|$|On April 13, 2008, {{rumors of}} a {{construction}} worker burying a Red Sox jersey in the concrete of the new Yankee Stadium were verified after anonymous tips led {{to the location of}} the jersey. The worker, identified as Gino Castignoli, had buried a David Ortiz jersey in what would become a <b>service</b> <b>corridor</b> in the hopes of cursing the new stadium. After extracting the jersey from underneath two feet of concrete, Yankees' President Randy Levine indicated that the shirt would be donated to the Jimmy Fund to be auctioned for the charity long associated with the Red Sox. Whatever curse was intended failed to bear fruit with the Yankees winning the World Series in their first year at the new stadium.|$|E
25|$|A seventh corridor, and {{the third}} for Manhattan, the M60 125th Street–Triborough Bridge–Astoria Boulevard bus route to LaGuardia Airport, was {{converted}} to SBS on May 25, 2014; local service was replaced by other routes running alongside {{the route of the}} M60 (the M100, M101, Bx15, and Q19). An eighth Select Bus Service route was planned in the 2014–2017 Financial Plan. The eighth Select Bus <b>Service</b> <b>corridor</b> (ninth route overall), and the fourth in Manhattan, was for the M86 running on 86th Street, which was originally scheduled to start running on June 28, 2015, but pushed back to July 13, 2015; it does not include a major change in stops.|$|E
2500|$|The first Select Bus <b>Service</b> <b>corridor,</b> on the Bx12 along 207th Street, Fordham Road, and Pelham Parkway, {{was placed}} into service on June 29, 2008. The next line, the M15, saw Select Service begin on October 10, 2010 after the {{delivery}} of new low-floor buses. The M34/M34A line was started on November 13, 2011. Initially, a 34th Street busway was planned that would require eliminating 34th Street as a through street, but it was dropped {{in favor of the}} standard SBS model. The B44 Rogers/Bedford/Nostrand Avenues bus route, the fifth Select Bus <b>Service</b> <b>corridor</b> in the city, was implemented on November 17, 2013 after the arrival of new fare machines. The S79 Hylan Boulevard/Richmond Avenue route, initially slated to be converted to SBS in 2013, was moved up to September 2, 2012; the local equivalents of the S79 route are the S78 and S59 buses. A sixth corridor, the second for the Bronx, began service on the Bx41 Webster Avenue route on June 30, 2013; this route was the first [...] "Phase II" [...] SBS route to begin service (the existing corridors plus the B44 comprise Phase I). Another Select Bus Service route on Webster Avenue, which will be extended to run between LaGuardia Airport and Fordham Plaza alongside the local Bx41 route, is proposed for later implementation.|$|E

50|$|The southernmost pavilion, the Pavillon de Flore, {{served as}} the backstairs to the palace. <b>Service</b> <b>corridors</b> led to it. One could get {{from there to the}} {{sprawling}} basement, lit with innumerable gas lamps, where a railway had been set up to bring food from the kitchens under the Rue de Rivoli.|$|R
30|$|The local {{administration}} plans (scenario 1) foresee 2 new additional metro lines plus the {{extensions of the}} previous ones, modifying only the supply side. In addition, 11 new rapid feeder <b>services</b> <b>corridors</b> are provided {{in order to improve}} the feeder services to the future metro network which, however, remains substantially a radial network.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} has a {{concrete}} floor <b>service</b> <b>corridor</b> running under the upper hallway, with a brick retaining {{wall to the}} west and a single skin timber wall to the eastern rooms. A sitting room is located on the southeast with a remodelled kitchen and sunroom are on the northeast.|$|E
50|$|The {{dining room}} opens onto the <b>service</b> <b>corridor</b> to the rear, {{to the public}} bar through a door at the far {{east side of the}} room and {{receives}} service from the bar through an open hatch. The former lounge to the northeast of the dining room is enclosed with aluminium sliding doors and accommodates a billiard table.|$|E
50|$|There is a <b>service</b> <b>corridor</b> {{between the}} kitchen and the dining room that may {{originally}} have been an open veranda. The kitchen is presumably in its original location. Walls and ceiling are panelled over and the wood stove, which is in a masonry alcove, has been completely sealed off. A small pantry and cold room are located on what was presumably an open veranda alongside the kitchen.|$|E
40|$|Various {{alternative}} active {{approaches to}} achieving aand maintaining flatness for the microwave {{power transmission system}} (MPTS) were studied. A baseline active alignment scheme was developed which includes subarray attachment mechanisms, height and tilting adjustments, <b>service</b> <b>corridors,</b> a rotating laser beam reference system, monopulse pointing techniques, and {{the design of a}} beam-centering photoconductive sensor...|$|R

50|$|Earlier gas light {{pipes and}} {{fittings}} remain to {{the upper and lower}} rear verandahs. Original door and window joinery and hardware remain throughout the building. The building has timber floors throughout except for the upper verandahs which are now sheeted with a thick fibre cement board. Fibre cement sheeting encloses the bathrooms to the northwest and the enclosed <b>services</b> <b>corridor</b> of the ground floor rear verandah.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} the {{survivors}} trapped inside band around Nord, who believes he {{can find a way}} out through the mid-river passage, a <b>service</b> <b>corridor</b> running between the north and south tubes. Kit arrives and finds Nord, warning him that the passage could come down at any moment, but Nord dismisses the possibility. Kit barely escapes as the mid-river collapses, killing Nord, and causing another explosion which kills a survivor.|$|E
50|$|The {{dining room}} {{is located in the}} {{northwest}} corner of the building and is in more or less original condition. The west wall has been panelled over and the windows blocked. Three sets of double doors to the <b>service</b> <b>corridor</b> have been widened at some stage and then sealed. The remaining walls have their original boards. The ceiling is intact, with two decorative fretwork vents. The floor is covered with carpet.|$|E
50|$|The SMART District {{will provide}} {{passenger}} {{service on the}} historic Northwestern Pacific right-of-way, which roughly parallels US Highway 101 and {{is owned by the}} SMART District from Healdsburg to Larkspur. There are 24 bridges in the segment from San Rafael to Santa Rosa, as well as 63 at grade crossings (with the possibility of adding more). A positive train control system, as mandated by the FRA for passenger services with grade crossings, was implemented for the length of the <b>service</b> <b>corridor</b> for customer and pedestrian safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} holds a free open day {{to allow}} {{members of the}} public to visit areas of the hospital which would usually be inaccessible. The tours include visits to the basement <b>service</b> <b>corridors,</b> the hospital's mortuary, the pathology laboratories, the hospital roof, and one of the operating theatres. The most recent open day was held on 20 March 2016. Over 5000 visitors attended the event.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} set on the planet Fomalhaut III. A {{therapist}} named Elaine becomes involved {{with a group of}} fugitive underpeople, living in a maze of drab <b>service</b> <b>corridors</b> jokingly dubbed [...] "Clown Town", who are being helped by Lady Panc Ashash (a personality recording of a deceased Lady of the Instrumentality, hence the eponymous [...] "Dead Lady") and a telepath called The Hunter. Panc Ashash had predicted Elaine's coming, and how she would help the dog-girl D'joan create history.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} Ontario general election, 2011, Premier Dalton McGuinty {{also made}} a {{campaign}} pledge to provide two-way, all-day train <b>service</b> on all <b>corridors.</b> The vision of two-way, full-day train <b>service</b> on all <b>corridors</b> eventually included electrification of the system, and was renamed Regional Express Rail.|$|R
50|$|The {{rail line}} {{expansion}} project, which includes 11 mi of new track {{and at least}} two additional train stations, was completed (except for the Laraway Road station) in January 2006. The number of trains per day increased from 16 to 30, 15 in each direction. For years, Pace operated Route 835, whose bus service enhanced the limited train service in the SouthWest <b>Service</b> <b>corridor.</b> With the rail service expansion, ridership on route 835 became so poor that Pace eliminated it on August 17, 2007.|$|E
5000|$|A huge {{site was}} {{acquired}} near New Cross alongside the Surrey Union Canal {{and a vast}} building constructed to process and pack products and opened in 1901. The inaugural luncheon was reported favourably in the press for this was a factory built on a grand scale: at one time nearly 2,000 people worked there. For the most part single-storey, it was designed in an impressive and efficient way with a central <b>service</b> <b>corridor.</b> There was a separate tin-making and tin-printing department. Once again, the future looked encouraging.|$|E

50|$|From the <b>service</b> <b>corridor,</b> Morris and the Anglins {{climbed the}} {{ventilation}} shaft to the roof. Guards {{heard a loud}} crash as they broke out of the shaft, but since nothing further was heard, {{the source of the}} noise was not investigated. Hauling their gear with them, they descended 50 ft to the ground by sliding down a kitchen vent pipe, then climbed two 12 ft barbed-wire perimeter fences. At the northeast shoreline, near the power plant—a blind spot in the prison's network of searchlights and gun towers—they inflated their raft with the concertina. At some time after 10 o’clock, investigators estimated, they departed in the dense fog toward their objective, Angel Island, two miles to the north.|$|E

50|$|British Coachways began {{operation}} {{on the day}} that coach services were deregulated, 6 October 1980, on a network based around five <b>service</b> <b>corridors</b> linking London with major population centres. To make its services attractive to passengers, the consortium charged extremely low fares, including some that were {{less than half of the}} cheapest fare offered by the rival NEX or SBG service. This meant that profit margins were very low. In addition, the venture suffered from not being able to use recognised departure points in some major cities, most notably Victoria Coach Station in London and Digbeth Coach Station in Birmingham.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Accademia Pilot Project {{concerns}} one of {{the lesser}} known buildings of Hadrian’s Villa, the Accademia, which is still in private property and is not open to the pub-lic. One {{of the most significant}} and unique features of this building – and of the whole Villa – is a network of subter-ranean <b>service</b> <b>corridors,</b> which was seldom studied. For the first time we used Geophysics at Hadrian’s Villa, to explore the subterranean tunnels of the Accademia and re-construct their layout. The survey was done by archaeologist Anna Maria Marras for her Master thesis in Geo-technology (Marras, 2008) and gave very interesting results. ...|$|R
50|$|A timber framed two-roomed {{rectangular}} building clad with chamferboards (some beaded to the interior), the kitchen/laundry wing {{stands to}} the rear of the main building. It is reached from the rear ground floor verandah through an enclosed <b>service</b> <b>corridor</b> and storage area. The roof to the kitchen/laundry is clad with corrugated metal sheeting with a gable to the north end and a hip to the south. A two- sided fireplace with a tall brick chimney stands to the centre. The fireplace is no longer operable and accommodates a contemporary stove within the north end. The kitchen fit-out is recent including the plasterboard lining. The laundry ceiling is lined with timber boards and has a decorative metal ceiling rose; the laundry walls are unlined.|$|E
