During binocular viewing hOKR gain was equal for movement {{to the left or}} right, during monocular stimulation, all afoveate geckos (Lepidodactylus lugubris, Gekko gecko, Eublepharis macularius) and the foveate Lygodactylus spp. exclusively reacted to temporo-nasal stimulation with <b>stabilising</b> <b>head</b> movements whereas in Phelsuma madagascariensis a naso-temporal component of hOKR could be elicited albeit much weaker. Thus, neither the presence of a fovea nor lifestyle seems to be decisive for a symmetrical monocular hOKR...|$|R

40|$|The overarm throw {{has been}} {{classified}} as a fundamental motor skill that {{is the basis for}} a number of more complex sporting skills. There are a number of developmental stages over which a child progresses to the mature form of the skill. Control of the overarm throw, especially towards a target is very dependent on visual and vestibular information for successful execution. The quality of the information is, in tum, dependant on the head movement of the performer during the execution of the skill. It has been reported that head angular velocities above 350 degrees/second result in a degradation of useful visual and vestibular information and as such, a loss in control of the performed skill. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate head movement in children while they performed an overarm throw towards a forward facing target. The study also investigated the possible relationship between motor proficiency of the thrower and their head movement. Three hypotheses were investigated. These included: 1. The <b>head</b> is <b>stabilised</b> during the throw. 2. The <b>head</b> is <b>stabilised</b> throughout the performance until close to ball release where it will move with the trunk as part of the 2 ̆ 7 kinetic chain 2 ̆ 7. 3. Subjects with lower levels of motor proficiency <b>stabilise</b> their <b>head</b> Jess over the whole performance when they are compared to subjects with higher motor proficiency levels. Ten, ten-year-old children of mixed gender and varying levels of motor proficiency participated in the study. Subjects were video recorded performing an overarm throw towards a forward facing target. Their throwing proficiency was assessed using a standard motor test. The video of the throw was digitised and analysed to produce angular velocities profiles of the head and trunk about different reference axes. It was found that all of the subjects except one <b>stabilised</b> their <b>head</b> throughout the whole throwing performance. It was also found that the subjects <b>stabilised</b> their <b>head</b> intentionally and independently despite large trunk angular velocities near the end of the performance. These findings support hypotheses l and 2. No significant relationship was found between motor proficiency and head movement. Thus hypothesis 3 remained unsupported. Further research with a larger sample size and changes to the motor proficiency-testing regime are required to investigate the possible relationship between motor proficiency and head movement...|$|R

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{system has}} been built to navigate a walking robot into a ship structure. The 8 -legged robot is equipped with an active stereo head. From the CAD-model of the ship good view points are selected, such that the head can look at locations with sufficient edge features, which are extracted automatically for each view. The pose of the robot is estimated from the features detected by two vision approaches. One approach searches in stereo images for junctions and measures the 3 -D position. The other method uses monocular image and tracks 2 -D edge features. Robust tracking is achieved with a method of edge projected integration of cues (EPIC).

Speech is of key importance in CLP fromboth a {{quality of life and}} surgical outcome perspective, yet assessment relieson subjective perceptual methods, with speech and language therapists (SLTs) listening to speech and transcribing errors. This is problematic becauseperception-based phonetic transcription is well known to be highly unreliable(Howard & Lohmander, 2011) especially in CLP, where the range of errortypes is arguably far greater than for other speech sound disorders. Moreover,CLP speech is known to be vulnerable to imperceptible error types, such asdouble articulations which can only be understood with instrumental techniquessuch as ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI). Incorrect transcription of theseerrors can result in misdiagnosis and subsequent inappropriate interventionwhich can lead to speech errors becoming deeply ingrained. Aims: This study willdevelop a technical solution for improving diagnosis of speech disorders inchildren with CLP. Participants: 40 children with CLP, aged 3 to 15.

40|$|Ant foragers {{are known}} to memorise visual scenes {{that allow them to}} {{repeatedly}} travel along idiosyncratic routes and to return to specific places. Guidance is provided by a comparison between visual memories and current views, which critically depends on how well the attitude of the visual system is controlled. Here we show that nocturnal bull ants <b>stabilise</b> their <b>head</b> to varying degrees against locomotion-induced body roll movements, and this ability decreases as light levels fall. There are always un-compensated head roll oscillations that match the frequency of the stride cycle. Head roll stabilisation involves both visual and non-visual cues as ants compensate for body roll in complete darkness and also respond with head roll movements when confronted with visual pattern oscillations. We show that imperfect head roll control degrades navigation-relevant visual information and discuss ways in which navigating ants may deal with this problem. 9 page(s...|$|R

In this study, attenuation of haemodynamic and neuroendocrine stress response with dexmedetomidine, an alpha- 2 adrenoreceptor agonist versus placebo (normal saline) were compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty patients posted for elective craniotomy in {{the age group of}} 18 to 60 years of both sexes were divided into two groups of 20 each as dexmedetomidine and placebo (normal saline) and the attenuation of haemodynamic response and neuroendocrine response to intravenous dexmedetomidine or placebo to the application of skull-pin head holder were compared. Data of haemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses were analysed statistically by Student’s t-test, independent t-test and paired ttest and the p value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The results of study showed that the increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure and increase in blood glucose, serum cortisol and serum prolactin was attenuated by dexmedetomidine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Children with {{cleft lip}} and palate (CLP) often {{continue}} to have problems producing clear speech long after the clefts have been surgically repaired, leading to educational and social disadvantage. Speech is of key importance in CLP from both a {{quality of life and}} surgical outcome perspective, yet assessment relies on subjective perceptual methods, namely phonetic transcription. This is particularly problematic in CLP where the range of error types is arguably far greater than for other speech sound disorders, leading to problems with reliability (Howard & Lohmander, 2011). Moreover, CLP speech is known to be vulnerable to imperceptible error types, such as double articulations which can only be understood with instrumental techniques. Incorrect transcription of these errors can result in misdiagnosis and subsequent inappropriate intervention which can lead to speech errors becoming deeply ingrained. Until now, the technique of choice (recommended by the UK professional body for Speech & Language Therapists) for assessing articulatory errors in CLP has been electropalatography, with a number of small n studies showing it to be a powerful technique for identifying imperceptible errors and treating them by using real-time EPG for biofeedback. However, EPG is expensive and logistically difficult to manage. In contrast, ultrasound is cheaper and arguably better equipped to image the posterior articulations (such as pharyngeals) which are common in CLP. This study will present an ultrasound assessment protocol for the assessment of CLP speech which is designed to dovetail with current assessment practices used in Europe. Methods: We will use UTI to both qualitatively and quantitatively identify errors in the speech of 40 children with CLP. Data will consist of materials from the CLEFTNET protocol: spontaneous counting, 10 repetitions of all consonants in /aCa/, sentences from GOS. SP.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study the age-related {{differences}} of prospective control and object representation in young infants. The overall set of theoretical and empirical issues addressed in this thesis consists of how infants represent and react to visible and non-visible moving objects. This involves understanding the interrelationship between different actions, such as head and trunk movements, and reaching. Questions about infants’ ability to negotiate different kinds of motions {{and the notion that}} infant representation of an occluded object can be graded in strength are also addressed in the present thesis. The hypothesis of graded representation proposed that a concept of object representation is not a clear-cut distinction between whether one has a representation or not. It is rather a graded process, evolving with experience and becoming embedded in processes underlying overt behaviour. Study I showed that perturbing an object affected the quality of grasp, which seems to indicate that the approach and grasp components are, at least partially, integrated by nine months of age. The analysis of the relationship between head and hand movements showed tightness in the coupling between these movements, as indicated by a small correction time difference between them. Study III showed that 6 -month-old infants, under certain conditions, can form a dynamical representation of a moving and temporarily occluded object, taking into account the velocity and the direction of the object’s motion. It also revealed three other interesting findings: firstly, that an occluder could provide landmark information about object reappearance; secondly, that reaching was dramatically disrupted when the object was temporarily non-visible either due to occlusion or blackout of the room lights and thirdly, that reaching recovered markedly after a few trials, but only when subject to blackout. Overall, the results supported the hypothesis of graded representations. In Study IV, when infants observed a circular object motion, it was shown that while head tracking is functional in 6 -month-old infants, it continues to develop and become more refined up to, and beyond, the age of 12 months. The structural organization of head tracking in both 6 and 12 -month-old infants complied with an organizational pattern of accelerations and decelerations, or so-called movement units, which is in line with earlier studies of both goal-directed and spontaneous arm movements. The intersegmental coupling between the head and the trunk showed that the infants tried to <b>stabilise</b> <b>head</b> movements by adjustments of the trunk. In addition, study II presents a method for coding prehensile movements by means of a touch screen system, which is used in study III...|$|R
30|$|CBCT imaging is {{accomplished}} using a rotating gantry {{to which an}} X-ray source and detector are fixed. Nearly all modern CBCT devices use a digital flat panel detector (FPD) instead of an image intensifier for image capture. CBCT scanners use a tightly collimated narrow cone-shaped X-ray beam [22]. Image data are recorded in a single gantry rotation (180 – 360 °) when the x-ray source and 2 D detector move synchronously around the patient’s <b>head,</b> which is <b>stabilised</b> with a <b>head</b> holder. The acquisition time of CBCT devices ranges roughly between 6 and 20  s [24]. Posteroanterior and lateral scout views {{can be used to}} determine the correct location of the imaging area and its use is recommended especially in small FOV examinations. However, it is important to notice that the positioning of the FOV using a single projection is prone to error because of the summing of attenuation structures in the depth direction and divergence of the beam [23].|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} three hypotheses {{that have been}} proposed to explain the effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in standing human subjects. The first assumes realignment to an altered representation of vertical. GVS-evoked body tilt produced under conditions of different stability was compared with perceptions of the vertical which subjects indicated by two means, a visual line and a manipulandum. GVS produced body tilt that increased in unstable conditions {{but there were no}} differences in the perceived vertical in any condition. The second hypothesis is that the altered vestibular signal is interpreted as a tilt of the support surface. The postural response evoked by tilting the support surface was compared with the GVS response under conditions of varying stability. These responses were different, particularly for the lower body where movements were oppositely directed. Standing on foam augmented GVS responses whereas standing with feet apart augmented platform-tilt responses. The third hypothesis is that GVS produces an illusion of movement, and this causes a reaction in the opposite direction. Perception of movement during GVS was determined in standing and immobilised subjects. Although immobilised subjects experienced illusions of movement in the direction opposite the sway response, this only happened after long periods of stimulation and never for standing where subjects accurately reported the true direction of sway. Thus, the results do not support any of these proposals. Instead, they and other observations support a simpler interpretation that the GVS signal is consistent with head movement and evokes an automated response to <b>stabilise</b> the <b>head</b> in space...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae (Physiotherapy) - MSc(Physio) Sprinting can be {{described}} as the ability to cover a short distance in the fastest possible time. It requires enormous stability, strength and speed to achieve this goal. Any improvements in technique or speed can be the difference between winning and losing and ultimately gold or silver. Many coaches focus their training on improving the mechanics of the lower limb in order to achieve their goal. They often neglect to consider the effect the upper limb, head, neck and trunk has on the sprinters technique. This study aimed to determine the effect the muscles that assist in <b>stabilising</b> the <b>head</b> and neck namely the deep neck flexors, has on sprinting technique. A systematic review was conducted to determine the factors that influence the acquisition of the correct and most efficient sprint technique. Thereafter assessments were done to determine the prevalence of neck discomfort and how it impacts the athlete’s life by use of the Disability Neck Index. In addition, the endurance of the participant’s deep neck flexors using the Craniocervical Flexion Test and an analysis of their sprinting technique through video analysis were conducted. Variables for each assessment were coded and analysed with Chisquared tests to determine statistically significant relationships. Results show that there was to prevalence of neck pain among participants and although the participants have poor deep neck flexor endurance and an inadequate sprinting technique, no statistically significant relationships could be found between these two variables. Thus poor endurance in the deep neck flexors has no effect on sprinting technique. The results of the study was limited due to a small sample size and lack of equipment, thus further research is required in order to completely reject the possibility that the deep neck flexors effects a sprinters ability to acquire an efficient sprinting technique...|$|R
40|$|Flying insects, {{like many}} other animals that rely on their sense of vision to guide behaviour, have a {{tendency}} to maintain a default orientation of their eyes relative to the environment. During flight, reflexes act to keep the head level and minimise retinal image shifts resulting from rotational steering manoeuvres, or from external perturbations such as wind gusts and turbulent air flow. Gaze stabilisation serves a number of functions, which include: i) simplifying the estimation of translational self-motion, ii) aligning the head-based sensory systems with the inertial vector which facilitates the transformation of sensory signals into motor commands, iii) supporting the tracking of moving targets, and iv) reducing motion blur in the visual input. This thesis reports studies on species-specific adaptations and general principles underlying multisensory gaze stabilisation {{in a number of different}} Dipteran flies. A variety of stimulation methods were explored, along with their suitability for a linear systems analysis of the gaze stabilisation system across species. Using results obtained from the well-characterised blowfly for comparison, novel experimental work was performed on the gaze stabilisation behaviour of robberflies, hoverflies and horseflies. Species from each family were shown to <b>stabilise</b> their <b>heads</b> in compensation for body rotations around the roll axis. The performance of the reflex was found to be species-specific and dependent on the sensory modalities involved. Experimental evidence suggests that in contrast to the other families, hoverflies appear to make use of the inertia of the head to maintain a level gaze, a novel finding that has previously been reported only for dragonflies. Finally, the integration of signals in the context of gaze stabilisation obtained by the two visual systems in blowflies - the ocelli and compound eyes - were explored in both behavioural and electrophysiological experiments. This research opens new lines of investigation by identifying behaviours that demonstrate different control strategies employed by the nervous systems of flying insects. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Shoulder {{muscle fatigue}} {{has not been}} {{assessed}} in massive rotator cuff tear (MRCT). This study used EMG to measure fatigability of 13 shoulder muscles in 14 healthy controls and 11 patients with MRCT. A hand grip protocol was applied to minimise artifacts due to pain experience during measurement. The fatigue index (median frequency slope) was significantly non-zero (negative) for anterior, middle, and posterior parts of deltoid, supraspinatus and subscapularis muscles in the controls, and for anterior, middle, and posterior parts of deltoid, and pectoralis major in patients (p ≤ 0. 001). Fatigue was significantly greater in patients compared to the controls for anterior and middle parts of deltoid and pectoralis major (p ≤ 0. 001). A submaximal grip task provided a feasible way to assess shoulder muscle fatigue in MRCT patients, however with some limitations. The results suggest increased activation of deltoid is required to compensate for lost supraspinatus abduction torque. Increased pectoralis major fatigue in patients (adduction torque) likely reflected strategy to <b>stabilise</b> the humeral <b>head</b> against superior subluxing force of the deltoid.

40|$|In {{practice}} discharges of untreated wastewater occur {{from many}} wastewater sewer systems, often via Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSO). The untreated wastewater from SSO {{can be transferred}} through the overflow systems into receiving waters, reducing their quality and bringing risks to human health and aquatic organisms. Increased awareness of {{the negative effects of}} SSOs has {{led to the development of}} various control measures as part of watershed protection programs around the world. However, the information the number of SSO events is often unknown due to poor or limited monitoring. A further problem is that backflows can occur through an overflow system, with receiving waters entering the wastewater network due to elevated levels of the receiving waters. This additional relatively clean water often increases the volumes of water that need to be transported to the treatment facility and dilutes wastewater pollutants, resulting in lower treatment efficiency and higher costs for chemicals, increasing electricity consumption for any intermediate booster pumps and within the treatment plant. This paper illustrates how the flap gates, commonly used for preventing these backflows, also can be used for the estimation of SSO discharge volumes. An experimental full-scale setup was designed where sewage flowed through a flap gate between two chambers with a constant flow rate. The <b>stabilised</b> water <b>heads</b> in the two chambers and the flow rate were measured. Experiments were performed for both dry and submerged flap gate conditions (the latter is relevant for the SSO event occurring during high water level in the receiving waters). In total, five flap gates with opening dimensions of 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mm were tested and flow rating curves were established with high precision (R 2 > 0. 99). Results of the opening pressure tests showed some deviations between the values specified by the manufacturer of the flap gates and the experimentally obtained opening pressure values. An approach to generalising the flow rating curves for other than tested diameters of the flap gates is suggested. The usage of flow rating curves for estimation of the volume is discussed. This study showed that the water head measurements before and after the flap gate can provide a reliable and inexpensive method for quantification of the SSO discharge volumes.
