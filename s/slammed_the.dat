5|$|The {{problem with}} the {{animation}} from the producers' point-of-view was {{that it did not}} exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time {{there were only a few}} choices for animation style. Usually, they would either follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example with the early animation being cartoonish was that the doors behaved liked rubber when <b>slammed.</b> <b>The</b> style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Yokozuna and The Undertaker began at Survivor Series 1993.

Yokozuna <b>slammed</b> <b>The</b> Undertaker's head into the steel steps {{leading up to the}} ring, but The Undertaker was unharmed. Later, Yokozuna used his finishing move, the Banzai Drop, on The Undertaker.

In the following weeks, it was revealed that Yokozuna had a fear of caskets. The Undertaker used this knowledge to gain a psychological advantage going into the match. On one occasion, Paul Bearer brought the casket to the ring to intimidate Yokozuna. When Yokozuna approached the casket to face his fear, the Undertaker popped out to scare Yokozuna.|$|E
