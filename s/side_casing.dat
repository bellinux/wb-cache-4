50|$|The main {{armament}} of the T-14 is the 2A82-1M 125 mm smoothbore cannon, {{a replacement}} for the 2A46 125 mm gun of previous Russian and Soviet tanks. Its muzzle energy is greater {{than one of the}} world’s previously considered best cannons: the German Leopard 2 Rheinmetall 120 mm gun. The 125 mm gun has 15-20% improved accuracy and its rolling fire angular dispersion has improved 1.7 times. Features include an absence of a fume extractor (due to the unmanned turret), a firing rate of 10-12 rpm (rounds per minute), left <b>side</b> <b>casing</b> ejection port for the 125 mm gun and a maximum effective-penetration range of 8 km with ATGMs. The detection range of the tank's optical sensors is more than 5 km for tank-sized targets in daylight, and at least 3.5 km at night through the thermal imaging channel. The gunner sight's optical channel is equipped with 4× and 12× optical zoom. The laser rangefinder has a theoretical maximum range of 7.5 km. These systems are duplicated; in addition there is a weaker third system that can fire on the move. The crew uses a high-definition camera with a 360-degree field.|$|E

40|$|Small open-deck roll-on/roll-off {{passenger}} ferries in Indonesia have a poor safety record. The Indonesian Government {{is interested}} in {{means by which the}} safety of these vessels can be improved, and this was the main catalyst for commencing research in this area. Any solution should be capable of being retrofitted to both existing vessels and new designs to improve their stability and, hence, their safety. The research therefore focused on the intact stability of the bare hulls, and with addition of <b>side</b> <b>casings,</b> for the vessels for which data was made available by the Indonesian Government. The research covered both quasi-static analysis, based on the objective of meeting the IMO intact stability criteria, and a dynamic approach using time-domain simulation in regular beam waves. A parametric study of the stability parameters of the twenty vessels demonstrated that, without the presence of <b>side</b> <b>casings,</b> the vessels had difficulties in complying with the IMO intact stability criteria. The problems were solved by introducing <b>side</b> <b>casings</b> (watertight spaces above the vehicle deck) either inboard of the vessel's side-shell plating, or partially inboard and partially outboard of the side shell. The minimum extent (breadth) of <b>side</b> <b>casings</b> required was determined by iteration on each of the twenty vessels, incorporating variations in the height of the centre of gravity and loading conditions. The implementation of the minimum <b>side</b> <b>casings</b> showed that each vessel then met the IMO intact stability criteria. However, the assessment of the vessels&# 146; dynamic stability characteristics using time-domain simulation provided inconsistent results for these vessels with <b>side</b> <b>casings</b> which met the IMO intact stability criteria. For some particular conditions, the existence and the different forms of <b>side</b> <b>casings</b> could decrease vessel survivability by increasing the roll motion amplitudes for both inside and outside casings and could lead the vessel to capsize. The results of the dynamic stability analysis also confirmed the vulnerability of small vessels with small stability parameters to large waves, and the different roll seakeeping behavior of the different vessel stability parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} flow {{and the performance}} of an annular diffuser composed of a cylindrical casing and a conical hub were examined experimentally. When the flow has no whirl component at the inlet, the optimum convergent angle of the hub, giving the best pressure recovery, is about 24 degrees. But with an increment of the whirl component, the component roughly changes to the free vortex pattern at the downstream passage independent of the initial flow pattern and the axial velocity is faster near the hub side than near the <b>casing</b> <b>side.</b> Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the separation by giving an adequate whirl component at the inlet, even if it occurs at the hub wall with a large convergent angle in the case without the whirl component. When the whirl component becomes stronger, a reverse flow occurs along the hub wall at the definite area ratio irrespective of the convergent angle...|$|R

40|$|Tangential endwall {{contouring}} {{is intended}} to improve the blading efficiency in turbomachinery. The present thesis focusses {{on the influence of}} leakage flows on the performance of non-axisymmetric endwall contouring in combination with a compound lean turbine blading. All tests were conducted on a 2 stage axial turbine test rig at the Institute of Power Plant Technology, Steam and Gas Turbines (IKDG) of RWTH Aachen University. The test rig is driven with air. Two sealing set-ups are applied to create two different leakage mass flows. Four operating points are investigated that represent the design point as well as overload and partload conditions. The endwall contouring is applied on both hub and tip sides. Three configurations are compared. A baseline design without endwall contouring, contoured stator vanes and non-contoured rotor blades as well as contoured vanes and blades. At first, all configurations are investigated with a negligible leakage flow rate at the <b>casing</b> <b>side.</b> The results show that the vane contoured configuration performs best in stage 1 while the fully contoured set-up loses in efficiency for the design point and in partload compared to the baseline configuration. This trend is flipped in stage 2 as the fully contoured version performs best and the vane contoured configuration loses significantly. This finding suggests that endwall contouring has the potential to increase the efficiency of multi stage turbines. The second focus is put on the interaction of endwall contouring and leakage flow. These investigations show that neither the vane contoured nor the fully contoured set-up show an increased efficiency at any operating point. The trends within the first stage are similar to the measurements with the low amount of leakage flow. In the second stage both contouring designs perform worse than the baseline, leading to the assumption that the change in efficiency is mainly caused by the re-entering leakage mass flow upstream the contouring and not by the flow that enters the cavities in front of the rotor contouring...|$|R
40|$|During 100 h {{servicing}} of an aeroengine, chips were {{noticed in}} the oil system. Strip examination of the engine revealed severe damages to the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of the engine accessory gearbox with cage broken and lying inside the casing along with the balls. In addition, on the cover side, the bush on O 3 axis was found without nuts and tab washers. The damaged bearing along with the dislodged nuts and tab washers were sent to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that there was spalling, smearing and flow of material in all elements of the cover side bearing. There was sliding in the bearing due to breakage of the cage resulting in loss of shape of the balls and flow of material out of inner raceway. Fractographic study confirmed that the cage of the bearing had failed by fatigue. This, along with the signatures of failure in the bearing as a whole indicated that the failure was progressive in nature, and it was caused due to rotational creep from either inner ring being loose or outer ring being loose or excessive axial load. Since there is remote possibility of excessive axial load on the bearing on O 3 axis of the EAGB, looseness in the inner ring and/or outer ring or any problem(s) elsewhere which could give rise to similar situation {{appears to be the}} reason for the bearing failure. Laboratory examination did not reveal any damages to the dislodged nuts except for rubbing marks along all six edges of the nut faces. The Cu-plating on all the faces was found undisturbed. The threads were found to be in tact without any distress. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} bush nuts have come out of the bolts by progressive unwinding. This is further substantiated by the presence of rubbing marks on all the six edges of the nuts, which is possible only when the nuts rotate around the axis, that is, the bolts, and they make contact periodically with the tab washer surface. The two tab washers provided for examination showed fretting damage on the contacting surfaces with the nuts as well as the bush. This is indicative of relative movement of the tab washers in assembly in service. Examination also revealed that the bending of the tab washers for effecting the locking of the nuts was oblique and also, the contact between the tab washer and the nut faces was inadequate. This was evident from the contact marks available on the tab washer surfaces. Evidences suggest that the nut surface was in partial contact with the tab washer and hence, the locking was not effective enough to offer adequate resistance for preventing unwinding of the nuts even under normal operating conditions. Once there was unwinding of the nuts, the bush on the cover side was as good as unsupported. This is similar to a situation wherein the outer ring of the bearing is loose. Hence, the looseness in the bush would result in progressive failure in the bearing as seen in the present case. The disturbances caused because of progressive failure in the cover side bearing had resulted in initiation of spalling on all rolling surfaces of the bearing on the <b>casing</b> <b>side</b> as well. Hence, the damages to this bearing are secondary in nature. Laboratory studies did not reveal any metallurgical deficiencies in the bearing elements or in the tab washers which could give rise to the present failure. Also, negligible discolouration even after complete destruction of the bearing indicates that there were no lubrication related issues which could be the cause of failure. Based on the above, it is concluded that the failure in the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of EAGB was progressive in nature. The failure was resulted due to unwinding and dislodgement of the nuts meant for securing the bush in position. Investigation showed that the unwinding of the nuts was possible because of deficiency in locking mechanism. Therefore, the primary cause for the bearing failure is attributed to either improper assembly of tab washers or inappropriate choice of the tab washer type for the present application...|$|R
