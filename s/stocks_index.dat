The second objective is to test {{the significance of the}} three portfolio erformance measures when they're applied to measure sectoral <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> performance in Jakarta Stock Exchange. The third objective is to choose the best sectoral <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> performance based on mean value of t test. The research found that <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> performance is vary from one index to another. Property and finance index outperformed significantly over IHSG in 2004, while agriculture and mining index outperformed significantly in 2005, and infrastructure index outperformed IHSG in 2006. Paired samples t test used to test the significant of the three measure over the five sectoral <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> performances found that Treynor-Jensen and Sharpe- Jensen measures are the most significant measure. Based on this result, agriculture <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> is chosen as the best <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> performance according to Treynor-Jensen measure, and finance <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> as the best <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> performance according to Sharpe-Jensen measure...|$|R

So the prediction of <b>stocks</b> <b>index</b> {{is very important for}} stockholders to earn the highest return from their investment. The changes of stock market influence by several factors such as political, economical and social factors and maybe, using the classic methods for stock market prediction result in exact results. since, the intelligent method have this capability that consider the complex effects of above factors in the analysis, so we can use them in stock index prediction. Therefore, we can use the artificial neural network for predicting and the genetic algorithm for optimizing the input variable in the neural network. This research has studied the efficiency of compound model, artificial neural network and genetic algorithm for predicting the stock index of Tehran negotiable documents bourse. For this reason, the economical data such as open market price of foreign exchange, bubble of coin price, the price of each ounce of gold in international market and the price of OPEK oil basket as inputs of compound model and total index of bource that compared with outputs of compound model, and have collected from 23 st of September in 2010 until 18 th of March in 2013 daily.

This study focuses on the index-futures lead-laq and price-volume causality in the Malaysian <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market. This research is also intended to examine the seasonal effects in the Malaysian <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market. This study was undertaken using the daily data for closing price for both <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> and <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures and also the daily data for trading volume for <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures in Malaysia. The data, which covered the period of December 15, 1995 till June 30, 2001, was divided into three subperiods in view of variation in activity largely due to the Asian financial crisis. The aims of this study are: i) to determine whether there is any significant lead-laq relatuionship in terms of price index between the futures market and the stock market in Malaysia; ii) to determine the causal relationship between price index and trading volume in the Malaysian <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market; and iii) determine whether there is any evidence of significant seasonal effects on <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market returns and trading volume. The findings generally indicated thet the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures returns leads the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> returns by one day during the learning period and the stable period. However the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures returns led the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> returns by two days during the high volatility peruiod. This means that during high volatility period, the lead from <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures was greater than during the other subperiods. The study also found the existence of a contemporaneous relationship between the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> returns and the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures returns in the Malaysian spot and financial futures markets. Evidence also indicated that the two markets are highly cointegrated. In relation to the price-volume causality, the study found the existence of unidirectional causality running from volume to returns in the futures market during the learning period and bidirectional causality during the high volatility period. However {{there was no evidence of}} causality during the stable period. The study also found evidence pointing to the existence of day-of-week effect, week-of-month effect and month-of-year effect in the Malaysian <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market. Based on the findings of the subperiod 3 (the current period), the study recommends that an investor should monitor the movements of the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures returns because the previous day's and today's increase in <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures returns lead to an increase in todays's <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> returns.

As a result of Islamization efforts, Supreme Court of Pakistan, on 14 November 1991, declared bank interest as “Riba” and prohibited all types of interest prevailed in monetary and financial system of Pakistan. In July 2008, an Islamic Index (KMI 30) is launched with a view to provide a platform for ethical investors who seek to align their financial objectives with their religious beliefs and value systems. Beside increasing investor trust and enhancing their participation, KMI- 30 index also serves as research tool for measuring performance of Shari’ah compliant stocks and strategic assets allocation procedure. In this regard, it is really need of the hour to assess the performance of Islamic index. This performance analysis will tell us whether Islamization of <b>stocks</b> <b>index</b> rewards its investors or not. In addition, it will also help us to know whether objectives of establishing Islamic index are fulfilled or not.

Therefore, our study is the first attempt of not only analyzing the performance of Islamic stock index of Pakistan but also its response to volatility effects caused by other macroeconomic variables such as interest rate and exchange rate.|$|E
40|$|Modeling the {{dependence}} between consecutive observations {{in a time}} series {{plays a crucial role}} in risk management. For example, the risk of large losses from a financial investment is increased if extreme negative returns tend to occur in clusters, and heavy rainfall on several consecutive days could trigger a catastrophic flooding. We will recall the so-called coefficient of tail dependence (introduced by Led-ford and Tawn, 1996) as an important measure of the strength of serial depen-dence between extremes which allows for a refined characterization of depen-dence structures, {{especially in the case of}} asymptotic independence. A general class of empirical processes introduced by Drees and Rootzén (2010) enables us to analyze the asymptotic behavior of estimators of the coefficient of tail depen-dence in a unified framework. Bootstrap versions of these empirical processes yield asymptotic confidence intervals. In an application it is shown how to use these results to discriminate between time series of GARCH-type and time series from common stochastic volatility models. An analysis of a time series of returns of the German blue <b>stocks</b> <b>index</b> however reveals that probably none of these time series models describe the extremal dependence structure accurately. As a suggestion for time series models which allow for a more flexible mod-eling of the extremal dependence structure we will introduce a new specifica-tion of stochastic volatility models with a heavy-tailed volatility sequence and light-tailed innovations. For a finer description of the extremal behavior of those models we show that they feature so-called hidden regular variation (cf. Resnick, 2002) and derive some useful general results.
