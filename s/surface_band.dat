40|$|Nodal non-centrosymmetric superconductors (NCS) have {{recently}} {{been shown to be}} topologically non-trivial. An important consequence is the existence of topologically protected flat zero-energy <b>surface</b> <b>bands,</b> which are related to the topological characteristics of the line nodes of the bulk gap via a bulk-boundary correspondence [Schnyder and Ryu, arXiv: 1011. 1438]. In this paper we examine these zero-energy <b>surface</b> <b>bands</b> using a quasiclassical theory. We determine their spectrum and derive a general condition for their existence in terms of the sign change of the gap functions. A key experimental signature of the zero-energy <b>surface</b> <b>bands</b> is a zero-bias peak in the tunneling conductance, which depends strongly on the surface orientation. This {{can be used as a}} fingerprint of a topologically non-trivial NCS. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|Two {{topics of}} high current {{interest}} {{in the field of}} unconventional superconductivity are non-centrosymmetric superconductors and multiband superconductivity. Half-Heusler superconductors such as YPtBi exemplify both. In this paper, we study bulk and surface states in nodal superconducting phases of the half-Heusler compounds, belonging to the $A_ 1 $ ($s+p$-like) and $T_ 2 $ ($k_zk_x+ik_zk_y$-like) irreducible representations of the point group. These two phases preserve and break time-reversal symmetry, respectively. For the $A_ 1 $ case, we find that flat <b>surface</b> <b>bands</b> persist in the multiband system. In addition, the system has dispersive <b>surface</b> <b>bands</b> with zero-energy crossings forming Fermi arcs, which are protected by mirror symmetries. For the $T_ 2 $ case, there is an interesting coexistence of point and line nodes, known from the single-band case, with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (two-dimensional nodes). There are no flat-band surface states, as expected, but dispersive <b>surface</b> <b>bands</b> with Fermi arcs exist. If these arcs do not lie in high-symmetry planes, they are split by the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling so that their number is doubled compared to the inversion-symmetric case.

The √ 3 ×√ 3 surface, formed at a one-monolayer (ML) Ag coverage, shows a metallic behavior with two partially occupied <b>surface</b> <b>bands</b> resulting from a tiny amount of extra Ag atoms on the surface. The √ 3 ×√ 3 surface transforms into a √ 39 ×√ 39 periodicity, below ∼ 250 K, when {{a small amount of}} Ag is added to the surface. The presence of the additional Ag atoms leads to an increased filling of two partially occupied <b>surface</b> <b>bands.</b> By depositing ∼ 0. 2 ML of Ag on the √ 3 ×√ 3 surface, it transforms into a 6 × 6 periodicity. We observe an interesting transition from the metallic √ 3 ×√ 3 and √ 39 ×√ 39 phases to a semiconducting phase for the 6 × 6 surface, with a gap of around 0. 2 eV with respect to the Fermi level.

3000|$|The {{influence}} of the surface condition on silicon nanomembrane conductivity has been dramatically illustrated with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on Si(001). STM on clean bulk Si(001) produces high-quality images. Several {{attempts were made to}} image the surface of thin SOI(001) with STM, without success [17, 18]. Considering the above estimate of charge carrier density when interface states are present, STM should not, in fact, be possible because STM requires a reasonably conducting sample. When the Si surface is carefully cleaned in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), however, revealing the signature Si(001) 2 × 1 reconstruction and its associated <b>surface</b> state <b>bands,</b> STM images can be readily obtained with a quality similar to that of bulk samples. When the sample is not so carefully cleaned, and the 2 × 1 reconstruction is weak or absent, imaging is not possible.
