40|$|The {{traditional}} crop-share lease {{is meant}} to reflect how income, expenses, and risk are shared between the tenant farmer and the landlord. The sharing levels are determined by each party’s contributions to the business. As agricultural technology and production practices change over time, <b>shared</b> <b>leases</b> should be reviewed by both parties to see that income continues to be distributed according to contributions. Most <b>share</b> <b>leases</b> are based upon customary methods of sharing production and expenses in a community. More than 75 % of <b>share</b> <b>leases</b> in Ohio are 50 - 50. About 15 % of tenant farmers receive from 60 % to 75 % of income/production in a 2 / 3 - 1 / 3 type arrangement. A smaller number keep more than 75 % of income.

S. agriculture, is increasingly {{giving way to}} cash leasing and to combinations of cash and <b>share</b> <b>leasing</b> (Reiss; Barry et al.; Barry). According to the 2001 Agricultural Economics and Land Ownership Survey, cash payments instead of or in addition to crop shares characterized about 59 % of farmland leases in Illinois during 1999, up from 37 % in 1988 (National Agricultural Statistics Service). The drivers of change primarily involve risk, income, managerial control, (especially when multiple landowners are involved), and land value issues facing farmers, landowners, and professional farm managers who represent the land owners (Sotomayor, Barry, and Ellinger). These changes may strongly influence the risk and financial positions of the respective leasing parties. Compared to fixed cash leases, share leases offer farmers the opportunity to allocate yield risks and perhaps management responsibilities to land owners in the same proportion that crops and operating costs are shared.

Historically, crop <b>share</b> <b>leases</b> have predominated, but {{it is estimated that}} about half of the cropland leases in Nebraska are now cash leases and half are crop share. There are a number of reasons for this trend. With the competition for land, cash leases establish a specific rental rate which can easily be negotiated or bidup. The equivalent cash for a crop share situation cannot be determined until after harvest when the yield and market price of the crop are known. The land owners in many cases, are getting further away from the land and have less familiarity with production practices and grain markets. As a result, many landowners don’t want to be involved with selling their grain or with paying a share of the production costs...|$|R

40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of cash leasing cropland. It also provides guidelines for setting a fair cash rental rate. Each year, more than 4 million acres of Nebraska cropland are leased under a cash lease arrangement. A cash lease involves the landowner conveying use of the cropland and associated management responsibilities to the tenant operator in exchange for a negotiated amount of cash. The cash payment is usually made in two installments, half at the beginning of the crop season and half at the end. Under a typical cash lease, the tenant operator receives all the crop income (including farm commodity program payments), pays all the crop expenses, and makes all crop management decisions. The landowner is responsible for the property taxes on the land and facilities included with the land (buildings, irrigation equipment), although (s) he may not be responsible for insuring or replacing these facilities if they are no longer serviceable. The use of cash leasing cropland varies across Nebraska; however, its popularity has increased in recent years as both landowners and tenant operators have opted for cash leasing over crop <b>share</b> <b>leasing.</b> Approximately 40 percent of the cropland leases and leased acreage in Nebraska were estimated to be cash rented in 1996...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. In the past, the main reason for <b>share</b> <b>leasing</b> farm land has been to share the price and yield risk with the landowner. Because farm programs reduce price risk, the tenant farmer's preferred lease arrangement may be different today than in prior years. Previous cropland leasing studies have ignored the effects of farm policies on lease terms. This study explored the effect of yield and price variability and government programs on the optimal rental arrangement. A whole farm computer simulation model (FLIPSIM) was used to simulate the economic activity of five representative farms in the Central Plainss region of the United States under three lease arrangements. The three lease arrangements consisted of a typical share lease, alternative share lease, and cash lease. The simulation model generated an empirical probability density function for net present value to be used by a stochastic dominance program (STODOM). STODOM ranked the cumulative distributions of net present value for each of the five farms assuming participation and non-participation in two policy scenarios: (a) the current farm program, and (b) the farm program modified for GATT. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the upper bound of the risk aversion coefficient (RAC) to determine how sensitive the lease arrangement decision was to the level of risk neutrality. -The upper bound was increased and decreased by 10, 20, and 30 percent. The results show that the most preferred strategy for four of the five farms is the alternative share lease when comparing strategies within a policy. On three of the five farms the producer would be 'indifferent between the cash lease and the typical share lease when participating in the farm program. The results from the sensitivity analysis showed that a change of up to 30 percent for the upper bound of the RAC did not change the preferred strategy. The results indicated that participation and non-participation in the farm programs did not alter the preferred lease arrangement.

Inertia in cohabiting couples occurs because living together imposes constraints on a relationship (a <b>shared</b> <b>lease,</b> etc.) that make relationships harder to end.

Crop land is typically rented {{in one of three}} ways: (1) cash rent; (2) crop share; or (3) cash/share combination.

The rental arrangements between landowners and producers can significantly affect risk and profitability, and producers should understand those effects.
