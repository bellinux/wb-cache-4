5|$|On 6March 1429 Joan of Arc {{arrived at}} Château de Chinon. She claimed to hear heavenly voices that said Charles would grant her an army {{to relieve the}} siege of Orléans. While staying at the castle she resided in the Tour du Coudray. Charles met with her two days after her arrival and then sent her to Poitiers {{so that she could}} be cross-examined to ensure <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. Joan {{returned}} to Chinon in April where Charles granted her supplies and sent her to join the army at Orléans.|$|E
5|$|Susanne admits her {{deception}} but {{claims that}} she was scapegoated for trying to leave {{her job at the}} weapons facility. There, she had been working on ergotamine, an aerosolized gas that causes paranoia and anxiety. Susanne claims that the government plans to test the gas on civilians in Baltimore. After deciphering the file, the Lone Gunmen find that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth, learning the location of the gas. Susanne also finds evidence that she had a tracking device put in a tooth, which she pulls out.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{was held}} in the YMCA for nearly 200days, during which time the Kempeitai meticulously {{followed}} up every point in her story, cross-examining people she said she had helped. After a huge dossier of interviews had been compiled, the Japanese concluded that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth and set her free. Khun Heng, however, was sentenced to 12years in Outram Road Prison. People avoided Elizabeth following her release, too terrified to speak to her. Fifteen internees died in the Kempeitais cells during the Double Tenth inquisition. The suffering spread to the entire civilian population of Changi Prison; rations were cut, and games, concerts, plays, and school lessons were forbidden for months.|$|E

5|$|No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an {{autobiography}} by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It {{was published in}} hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper {{as a form of}} therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.|$|E
25|$|When the {{conventions}} of the Democratic and Republican parties met in June, 1916, suffragists applied pressure to both. Catt was invited to express her views {{in a speech to}} the Republican convention in Chicago. An anti-suffragist spoke after Catt, and as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the convention that women did not want to vote, a crowd of suffragists burst into the hall and filled the aisles. They were soaking wet, having marched in heavy rain for several blocks in a parade led by two elephants. When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a cheer for their cause. At the Democratic convention a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.|$|E
500|$|Lenore was a traditionalist who {{decried the}} women's liberation {{movement}} as {{being one of}} [...] "strident voices" [...] and [...] "burning bras and railing against male-chauvinistic pigs." [...] She decried relaxed sexual mores and talk of a [...] "New Morality", saying [...] "the morality they discuss is the barnyard morality and it {{is as old as}} the hills." [...] However, she was also an advocate for the involvement of women in business and politics. By 1966, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> audiences around the state, [...] "Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation?" [...] She added that women [...] "represent a reservoir of public service which has hardly been tapped." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Thank God I Found You" [...] was {{produced}} by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and co-produced by Carey. The song is a moderately-paced R power ballad. Arion Berger of Rolling Stone noted that the song also exhibits influences of gospel music. The song carries an upbeat tone, backed by slow [...] "manufactured pop beats". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] is written in the key of B major. The beat is set in common time, and is set at a tempo of sixty-five beats per minute. The song follows the sequence of B–F/A–Gm7–F–E–F as its chord progression. Carey's and Joe's vocals in the song span over two octaves, from the note of D4 to the high note of D6. Composed in verse–chorus–bridge form, the chorus of [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] is sung in the key of B major; Carey also makes use of melisma in the song. The arrangement is similar to Carey's [...] "One Sweet Day". Lyrically, the song is an inspirational love song, in which the protagonist thanks God for finding her the perfect partner. According to Carey, it {{was inspired by the}} relationship she was in with Latin singer Luis Miguel at that time. She stated that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> a story through the song.|$|E
2500|$|This {{period of}} almost daily visions {{came to be}} known as la Quinzaine sacrée, [...] "holy fortnight." [...] Initially, her parents, {{especially}} her mother, were embarrassed and tried to forbid her to go. The supposed apparition did not identify herself until the seventeenth vision. Although the townspeople who believed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth assumed she saw the Virgin Mary, Bernadette never claimed it to be Mary, consistently using the word aquero. She described the lady as wearing a white veil, a blue girdle and with a yellow rose on each foot— compatible with [...] "a description of any statue of the Virgin in a village church".|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, Hebard stood firm {{regarding}} her Sacajawea findings. She held to her viewpoint {{that she}} had demonstrated, [...] "beyond a question of doubt", the true identify of Sacajawea. Hebard had a final piece of evidence to present. About one year before her death in 1936 Hebard revealed a [...] "secret" [...] to her protégé Agnes Wright Spring that she asked Wright not to reveal until after Hebard's death. Hebard shared that the Indians {{had given her a}} name while doing research on the Wind River Indian Reservation. The Indians, Hebard said, had named her Zont-Tumah-Two-Wiper-Hinze, meaning: the good white woman, the woman with one tongue. [...] "They [...] felt, she said, that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth about their Indian ancestor." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2001, Vaz {{complained to}} Leicestershire police {{that his mother}} had been upset by a {{telephone}} call from [...] "a woman named Mrs Egginton", who claimed to be a police officer. The accusations led to Eggington being questioned by police. Vaz also wrote a letter of complaint to Elizabeth Filkin, but when she tried to make inquiries Vaz accused her of interfering with a police inquiry and threatened to report her to the Speaker of the House of Commons. Eggington denied that she had ever telephoned Vaz's mother and offered her home and mobile telephone records as evidence. The Commons committee decided that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. They added: [...] "Mr Vaz recklessly made a damaging allegation against Miss Eggington, which was not true and which could have intimidated Miss Eggington and undermined her credibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 14 July 2006, Sheridan sacked {{his legal}} team and {{announced}} that he would represent himself. His cross-examination of witnesses was described by one left commentator as [...] "sickening", singling out the cross-examination of Katrine Trolle: [...] "Sheridan questioned her about their sexual history, which included visits to Cupids with Sheridan and group sex encounters with him and his brother-in-law, Andrew McFarlane. When she stated that she was embarrassed about her past, but that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth, Sheridan unflinching brandished her as a perjurer, plotter and gold-digger. [...] I still find it astonishing, and not a little dispiriting, that anyone on the left – any decent human being in fact – could justify traducing a female socialist’s character in court, not once, but twice, in order to protect a leading socialist politician’s false reputation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 28, 1993, Terry Knorr {{contacted}} America's Most Wanted, {{who asked}} her to contact detectives in Placer County, California (the county in which Suesan's body was found) who took her claims seriously and followed up with an investigation. The detectives linked the two Jane Does found {{in the area in}} 1984 and 1985 to Terry Knorr's detailed stories of her sisters' deaths and concluded that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. [...] Knorr's son William was arrested on November 4, 1993 in Woodland, California where he had been living and working. Robert Knorr, Jr. was charged with his sisters' murders while he was serving a 16-year sentence in an Ely, Nevada prison for the 1991 murder of a Las Vegas bartender. [...] On November 10, 1993, Theresa Knorr was arrested at her home in Salt Lake City. [...] At the time of her arrest, Knorr was using her maiden name of [...] "Cross" [...] and was working as a caretaker for her landlord's 86-year-old mother.|$|E

2500|$|Paulus {{claimed to}} {{know nothing of}} McKittrick's past, but Bennett thought her {{comparison}} of the two women's lifestyles was unusual if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. He knew that several years earlier she had been arrested on vagrancy and prostitution charges, and he sought a way to impeach her testimony. An officer who had arrested her, Lieutenant Allbright, then testified, casting doubt on her credibility, after which Bennett eventually persuaded Paulus's daughter, Mary Jo Wood, to give evidence against her. The relationship between mother and daughter had soured some years previously, after Paulus had disapproved of a man Wood was dating, attempted to have them both killed, then had her daughter confined to a mental hospital. Wood had escaped from the institution and fled with the man to another state, where the couple married, and {{she was afraid to}} return to Texas. She agreed to testify only after Bennett assured her that the District Attorney's office would ensure her protection while she was in Houston. Bennett introduced Mary Jo Wood as a surprise witness. She went on to testify that when Wood was a young girl, Paulus had owned several properties on Galveston's Post Office Street, a notorious red-light district, that were operated as brothels. She also said that Paulus had accepted payment from a man who wished to perform a sexual act with Wood. Wood testified that she and her mother met Joan Robinson Hill through Diane Settegast around 1963. While at Robinson Hill's home, the women also met Ash Robinson. Wood said that she and her mother occasionally sat in the Robinson box at horse shows. [...] When Wood visited her mother in December 1970, she claimed she was told by Paulus of a call from Settegast, saying that Robinson wanted to hire someone to kill John Hill.|$|E
