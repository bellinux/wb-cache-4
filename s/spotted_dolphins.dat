5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is an apex {{predator}} {{and has a}} reputation for eating anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, cephalopods, and other mollusks. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus), <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Stenella), dugongs (Dugong dugon), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and the green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.|$|E
25|$|The life {{above and}} below sea is the main {{attraction}} of the island. Sea turtles, cetaceans (most common among these are spinner dolphins and humpback whales, followed by many others such as Pantropical <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins,</b> Short-finned pilot whales, Melon-headed whales), albatrosses and many other species are frequently observed.|$|E
25|$|Various {{species of}} {{dolphins}} {{are kept in}} captivity. These small cetaceans are {{more often than not}} kept in theme parks, such as SeaWorld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins,</b> false killer whales and common dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. There are also fewer than ten pilot whales, Amazon river dolphins, Risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi in captivity. An unusual and very rare hybrid dolphin, known as a wolphin, is kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a false killer whale.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} to other dolphin species, the Atlantic <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphin</b> is medium-sized. Newborn calves are about 35 - 43 in long, while adults can reach {{a length of}} 2.26 m and a weight of 140 kg in males, and 2.29 m and 130 kg in females.Compared to the much smaller pantropical <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphin,</b> the Atlantic <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphin</b> is more robust. It shares its habitat with the pantropical <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphin</b> and the bottlenose dolphin.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the larger}} marine mammals are {{species such as}} the {{endangered}} West Indian manatee and humpback whale, as well as sixteen other species of whales and dolphins, including the pantropical <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphin,</b> common bottlenose <b>dolphin,</b> Atlantic <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphin,</b> Clymene dolphin, spinner dolphin, striped dolphin, rough-toothed dolphin, Risso's dolphin, melon-headed whale, pygmy killer whale, false killer whale, and the short-finned pilot whale.|$|R

25|$|Hainan {{island has}} rich bio-diversity of {{cetaceans}} {{and is the}} site of studying these in Chinese waters. Many whales such as North Pacific right whales, western gray whales, humpback whales, and blue whales (all of these are almost extinct in Chinese waters) were historically seen in the winter and spring to mate and calve. These gentle giants of the sea had been hunted heavily and were wiped out by Japanese whalers (established whaling stations on various sites on Chinese and Korean coasts including Hainan and Daya Bay). A few Bryde's whales and minke whales may still occur in the adjacent waters along with on Leizhou Peninsula and the Gulf of Tonkin. Smaller species of whale and dolphins, such as short-finned pilot whales and pantropical <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins,</b> but most notably the endangered Chinese white dolphin. Declared sanctuary for the species extends along the coasts. These dolphins may appear among clearer waters such as vicinity to Sanya.|$|E
25|$|Various {{species of}} toothed whales, mainly dolphins, {{are kept in}} captivity, {{as well as several}} other species of {{porpoise}} such as harbour porpoises and finless porpoises. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as SeaWorld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species kept in dolphinariums, as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity, and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of Bottlenose Dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Killer whales are well known for their performances in shows, but the number kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 captives being held in aquaria as of 2012. Other species kept in captivity are <b>spotted</b> <b>Dolphins,</b> false killer whales, and common dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. Also, fewer than ten pilot whales, Amazon river dolphins, Risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi are in captivity. Two unusual and very rare hybrid dolphins, known as wolphins, are kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a false killer whale. Also, two common/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at Discovery Cove and the other at SeaWorld San Diego.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recent years}} only villages on South Malaita Island have {{continued}} to hunt dolphin. In 2010, the villages of Fanalei, Walende, and Bitamae signed a memorandum of agreement with the non-governmental organization, Earth Island Institute, to stop hunting dolphin. However, in early 2013 the agreement broke down and some men in Fanalei resumed hunting. The hunting of dolphin continued in early 2014. Researchers from the South Pacific Whale Research Consortium, the Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources, and Oregon State Universityâ€™s Marine Mammal Institute have concluded that hunters {{from the village of}} Fanalei in the Solomon Islands have killed more than 1,600 dolphins in 2013, included at least 1,500 pantropical <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins,</b> 159 spinner dolphins and 15 bottlenose dolphins. The total number killed during the period 1976-2013 was more than 15,400.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} bottlenose whale and the long-finned {{pilot whale}} are also common along the New England coast. Dolphins are common; species found along the entire coastline includes the Risso's dolphin, short-beaked common dolphin, striped <b>dolphin,</b> Atlantic <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphin</b> and the common bottlenose dolphin. Dolphin species found in New England include white-beaked dolphin and Atlantic white-sided dolphin, while species roaming the southeastern parts of the coastline include the Fraser's <b>dolphin,</b> pantropical <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphin,</b> Clymene dolphin, spinner dolphin, and the rough-toothed dolphin.|$|R
50|$|The Caribbean Sea {{offshore}} of {{the island}} of Dominica is home to many cetaceans. Most notably a group of sperm whales live in this area year-round. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include spinner dolphins, pantropical <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins</b> and bottlenose dolphins. Less commonly seen animals include killer whales, false killer whales, pygmy sperm whales, dwarf sperm whales, Risso's dolphins, common dolphins, Atlantic <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins,</b> humpback whales and Bryde's whales.
