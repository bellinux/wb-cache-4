50|$|The Chinese {{pangolin}} has {{the appearance}} of a <b>scaly</b> <b>anteater.</b> Its head and body measure about 40-58 cm and its tail measures about 25-38 cm. A mature Chinese pangolin weighs from 2 to 7 kg. It has 18 rows of overlapping scales accompanied by hair, a rare combination in mammals. It has a small, narrow mouth and a little, pointed head. Also its claws grow in as it grows older. The female gives birth to a single offspring at a time.|$|E
50|$|The Indian {{pangolin}}, thick-tailed pangolin, or <b>scaly</b> <b>anteater</b> (Manis crassicaudata) is a pangolin {{found in}} the plains and hills of Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan. It is not common anywhere in its range.Like other pangolins, it has large, overlapping scales on its body which act as armour. It can also curl itself into a ball as self-defence against predators such as the tiger. The colour of its scales varies depending on the colour of the earth in its surroundings. It is an insectivore that feeds on ants and termites, digging them out of mounds and logs using its long claws, which are as long as its fore limbs. It is nocturnal and rests in deep burrows during the day.|$|E

There have also been programs to rejuvenate and protect the island’s marine resources, forests, and mangroves. In the island’s waters live dugongs, sea turtles, and giant clams. Calauit’s coral reefs, once badly damaged by invasive fishing practices, have recovered and are now rich breeding grounds for fish and crustaceans.|$|R
40|$|Pangolins (or <b>scaly</b> <b>anteaters),</b> {{belonging}} to the order Pholidota, occupy a unique and interest-ing niche among mammals. The body is covered with overlapping scales, and their diets consist pri-marily of ants and termites (Nowak 1999). The phylogenetic position of the Pholidota has {{been a matter of}} debate. Some proposed that Pholidota is a sister group to Xenarthra, and both orders are situated at the basal position of the eutherian tree (Novacek 1992). However, a recent phylogenetic study comparing mitochondrial coding sequences among 60 mammalian species claimed that Pholidota is a sister group of the Carnivora (Arnason et al. 2002). The Sry gene is evolution-arily conserved in eutherian mammals except i...|$|R
50|$|Commonly found {{animals in}} the Margallas include rhesus monkeys, jackals (often heard cackling at night near the hills), wild boars, porcupines, {{mongoose}} and the pangolin or <b>scaly</b> <b>anteater.</b> The wild boar in particular {{can be seen at}} some of the least expected places in the city. While they generally stay close to the hills, occasionally (particularly in winter when the hills are cold and it snows on the peaks of Margalla hills) they can be seen quite far from the Margallas. Often the boars will have small hideouts in the green belts in and around the city. The increasing practice of throwing litter near the hills also attracts both monkeys and wild boar to come and forage through the rubbish. The wild boars can be quite large, very solidly built and usually travel in large groups.|$|E
5000|$|The pangolin, a <b>scaly</b> <b>anteater</b> {{that feed}} on ants and {{termites}} and curl {{into a ball}} when threatened, is prized in China for its flesh, which is considered a delicacy and scales, which used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat among other ailments, inadequate lactation in breast-feeding mothers. The Chinese pangolin is found throughout southern China, Hainan and Taiwan and the Sunda pangolin in western Yunnan. In Chinese, the pangolin is called [...] "that which wears mountain armor" [...] and the animal is believed by local shamans to hold magical powers such that hunters must utter incantation before killing them to ward off bad luck. As a Class II protected species, trading of wild pangolins is prohibited, but poaching and illegal trade remains rampant. The pangolin can be farm-raised, but pangolin farms must generally also raise termites to feed the livestock. [...] In recent years, Chinese customs have intercepted large shipments of pangolin from Southeast Asia and Africa.|$|E

60|$|The {{nature of}} the bond of {{correlation}} is very frequently quite obscure. M. Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked, that certain malconformations very frequently, and that others rarely coexist, without our being able to assign any reason. What can be more singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the tortoise-shell colour with the female sex; the feathered feet and skin between the outer toes in pigeons, {{and the presence of}} more or less down on the young birds when first hatched, with the future colour of their plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here probably homology comes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental, that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz. Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, <b>scaly</b> <b>anteaters,</b> &c.), that these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth.|$|R
40|$|A. phagocytophilum {{infection}} {{has been}} reported in I. persulcatus and engorged D. silvarum ticks in northeastern China (3). In this study, we also found Haemaphysalis spp. ticks, including H. longicornis and H. concinna ticks, to be infected by the agent. This finding indicates that various tick species may be involved in the maintenance and transmission of A. phagocytophilum. Both H. longicornis and H. concinna ticks usually have 3 hosts in their life cycle and can infest a variety of wild and domestic animals such as rodents, deer, <b>scaly</b> <b>anteaters,</b> sheep, goats, and dogs. Haemaphysalis ticks are distributed in a broad range of China and sometimes feed on humans. Their competency as a vector for A. phagocytophilum and the importance of this agent in public health as well as in veterinary medicine has yet to be investigated, particularly in the areas where they are predominant (9). The gltA sequence analyses indicated that the agents detected in this study were similar to the strains isolated from rodents and sheep in northeastern China (4) and to A. phagocytophilum strains from the Russian Far East adjacent to our survey sites. However, the strains from China are genetically distant from A. phagocytophilum strains in the United States and Europe. The genetic diversity of A. phagocytophilum in various geographic locations deserves further study...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} manuscript. It is currently embargoed pending publication. Exotic natural objects brought to Europe {{in the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries were mutable and malleable things. They were constructed and assimilated into European world-views in a reciprocal process of change as they circulated around early modern Europe. In particular, the perceived provenance and their symbolic associations were central to exotics' natural histories. The ancient distinctions between Orient and Occident were redefined in this period as two "Indies" that were neither static nor always geographically determined. Two rich examples of this natural historical construction are the Old World pangolin, or <b>scaly</b> <b>anteater,</b> and its New World counterpart, the armadillo, that are the focus of this article. Initially, pangolins were understood as East Indian "scaly lizards," armadillos as West Indian. But, from the late seventeenth century, their geographical identities and symbolic associations were entangled as these creatures came to embody colonial anxieties and resonances. The "India" of the scaly lizard became the "Indies" of the scaled mammals, both East and West. Examining the reception and treatment of examples such as these in European cabinets and natural histories shows that the close relationship between commercial and scientific activity in this period did not entail the excising of the emblematic and the ambiguous, but rather their use in the production of diverse exotic commodities...|$|E
40|$|Mr. Edward Jacobson from Semarang (Java), {{one of the}} zealed correspondents of our Museum, communicated me {{the other}} day some {{observations}} made by himself on living animals. Especially of a high scientific interest seemed to me what he wrote concerning the habits and behavior of a specimen of the <b>Scaly</b> <b>Anteater,</b> Manis javanica; among his observations is one quite unknown till now, namely that the animal when frightened, emits a strong musk-smell. As far as I am aware no hunter or traveler made the same observation before. Dr. Büttikofer, at present Director of the Rotterdam Zoological Garden, had in Liberia numbers of living specimens of Manis tricuspis and M. longicaudata under observation, he however never has perceived the named smell. As it is a very interesting fact, worthy to save from oblivion, I translate here Mr. Jacobson’s letter partly. He writes d. d. 16 December 1902 : »On a boar-hunting »foregoing week one of my men had the good luck of »procuring a specimen of the Scaly-Anteater (Manis javanica) by digging it out from a hole. — How exceedingly »helpless these creatures are! That they since long not »have been extirpated by dogs or tigers they probably »owe to the strong smell of musk they emit. — I kept »the animal during three days in a »volière” close to my »house in order to study its habits. The Anteater if »frightened rolls itself up into a ball like the hedgehog »does, I however am convinced that this would help it »not very much against the hungry »Gladakkers” (kam»pong-dogs), which would seize it very soon by the not »by scales protected parts of the body; it however seems »that the dogs dislike the smell emitted by such an animal, »for our hounds, pure »gladakkers”, would have nothing »at all to do with it; meanwhile these very hounds, as »I personally saw, on former occasions devored in a few »minutes a porcupine (landak), notwithstanding the animal »had erected its spines from all sides of the body. It »seems to me that the senses of the Anteater stand on a »very low degree. If in the afternoon I allowed the animal »to take fresh air, it seemed not at all to be aware of »my presence. The sense of sight probably is very badly »developed, for continually it ran against different objects; »if I moved a stick closely before its eyes as if I would »strike it, the animal paid no attention whatever. It did »not observe different sounds made in its neighborhood, »as much as if I stamped upon the earth at a distance of »less than a meter. It seems that the sense of smell is »the less worst of all, as the animal moves on snuffling at »the earth and at all objects on the way; the latter sense »however cannot be very strongly developed as from the »following experiment may be concluded. I held my hand »or foot so that the animal could not escape from ranning »against it, and it remarked this merely at a distance of »less than a decimeter for not earlier it shrunk back, »snuffled in the air and changed course or put its head »between the fore-legs in order to roll itself up. I repeated »this experiment more than twenty times and always with »the same result. Apparently it made him most uneasy if »I pulled on one of the thick hairs sparingly protruding »from between the scales — it immediately rolled itself »up into a ball making a hissing noice, but without any »attempt for self-defence” [...] ...|$|E
