40|$|The AASHTO 2002 Design Guide (2002 DG) {{has been}} {{calibrated}} using Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) sections {{scattered throughout the}} nation but with very few sections {{from the state of}} California. This created the need to validate the models in 2002 DG and recalibrate them if needed so that they may be used for pavement design and rehabilitation in California. In order to validate the design guide, a three-stage process has been identified: bench testing or sensitivity analysis, verification using accelerated pavement testing data, and verification using field data. The study presented in this report includes performing sensitivity analysis of the rigid part of 2002 DG. Sensitivity analysis helps to check the reasonableness of the model predictions, to identify problems in the software and to help understand the level of difficulty involved in obtaining the inputs. The reasonableness of the model predictions is checked by varying key design variables including traffic volume, axle load distribution, climate zone, thickness, shoulder type, joint spacing, load transfer efficiency, PCC strength, base type, and subgrade type. The chosen factorial resulted in approximately 8, 500 simulations. The software outputs are transverse cracking, faulting, and IRI. A couple of related sensitivity studies have also been undertaken to study the effect of variables including surface absorptivity and coefficient of thermal expansion, which {{were not included in the}} primary sensitivity analysis. Results from all the simulations showed that almost all of the cases produce reasonable values for transverse cracking, faulting, and IRI. The transverse cracking model is sensitive to coefficient of thermal expansion, joint <b>spacing,</b> <b>shoulder</b> type, PCC thickness, and traffic volume. The faulting values are sensitive to dowels, shoulder type, climate zone, PCC thickness and traffic volume. However, there are cases for which model predictions disagree with prevailing knowledge in pavement engineering. This study also revealed some problems associated with the software.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{explored}} the coordination between {{the components of}} the shoulder girdle (clavicle, scapula and humerus), and how they contribute to hand movement in the peri-personal <b>space.</b> <b>Shoulder</b> girdle motion was recorded in 10 healthy subjects during pointing movements to 9 targets in the peri-personal space, using electromagnetic sensors fixed to the trunk, scapula and upper arm. Most of the 9 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the shoulder girdle were finely scaled to target position. Principle component analysis revealed that the 6 DoF of scapula-thoracic motion were coordinated in three elementary patterns (protraction, shrug and lateral rotation). The ratio of gleno-humeral to scapulo-thoracic global motion was close to 2 : 1. A direct kinematic procedure showed that if no scapular motion occurred, the workspace would be reduced by 15. 8 cm laterally, 13. 7 cm vertically and 4. 8 cm anteriorly. Scapulo-thoracic motion should be taken into account when investigating the physiology of upper-limb movements...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} represent largest {{category of}} work related illness in India. Variety of {{internal and external}} factors leads to postural stress in vehicle drivers that affects the functioning of musculoskeletal system. Vibration, studied extensively among various risk factors causing musculoskeletal disorders. Hence, the current study focused on various risk factors. Objectives: To know the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and their association with possible risk factors in auto rickshaw drivers. Investigation Tools: Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire (NMSQ), inch tape, vibrometer. Methodology: NMSQ {{has been used to}} document prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in 300 subjects. Vibrometer and inch tape were used to measure risk factors like driver’s seat vibration and work <b>space</b> envelope (<b>shoulder</b> to handle distance, lower cabin space). Associations with risk factors were analyzed by logistic regression. Results: Work experience and working hours per week showed a significant positive association with knee problems (p= 0. 009, p= 0. 006 respectively). Shoulder to handle distance on right side showed significant negative association with knee problems (p= 0. 013). Driver’s seat vibration showed strong significant positive association with low backache (p= 0. 000). No variable showed significant association with neck troubles. Working experience and lower cabin space are significantly associated with ankle problems (p= 0. 012, p= 0. 045 respectively). Age, work experience and shoulder to handle distance on left side showed significant positive association with general musculoskeletal troubles (p= 0. 029, p= 0. 005, p= 0. 045 respectively). Conclusion: Lower back, knee, neck and ankle troubles are more prevalent in auto rickshaw drivers. Increasing age, work experience, maximum working hours per week, increased left shoulder to handle distance and greater driver’s seat vibrations are increasing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Restricted lower cabin <b>space</b> and reduced <b>shoulder</b> to handle distance on right side also increased the risk of musculoskeletal disorders.

40|$|From {{the first}} {{shoulder}} arthroscopy performed on a cadaver in 1931, shoulder arthroscopy has grown tremendously {{in its ability}} to diagnose and treat pathologic conditions about the shoulder. Despite improvements in arthroscopic techniques and instrumentation, it is only recently that arthroscopists have begun to explore precise anatomical structures within the subdeltoid space. By way of a thorough bursectomy of the subdeltoid region, meticulous hemostasis, and the reciprocal use of posterior and lateral viewing portals, one can identify a myriad of pertinent ligamentous, musculotendinous, osseous, and neurovascular structures. For the purposes of this review, the subdeltoid space has been compartmentalized into lateral, medial, anterior, and posterior regions.

50|$|Imaging {{features}} of adhesive capsulitis are seen on non-contrast MRI, though MR arthrography and invasive arthroscopy are more accurate in diagnosis. Ultrasound and MRI {{can help in}} diagnosis by assessing the coracohumeral ligament, with a width of greater than 3 mm being 60% sensitive and 95% specific for the diagnosis.

Shoulders with adhesive capsulitis also characteristically fibrose and thicken at the axillary pouch and rotator interval, best seen as dark signal on T1 sequences with edema and inflammation on T2 sequences. A finding on ultrasound associated with adhesive capsulitis is hypoechoic material surrounding the long head of the biceps tendon at the rotator interval, reflecting fibrosis.

40|$|Rotator cuff {{disease is}} multi-factored {{and has been}} {{attributed}} to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors contribute to compression of the rotator cuff tendons. Intrinsic factors that contribute to rotator cuff tendon degradation with tensile/shear overload include alterations in biology, mechanical properties, morphology, and vascularity. Subacromial impingement is related to factors that encroach upon the subacromial space, while internal impingement affects the articular side of the tendons adjacent to glenoid. While the mechanisms of impingement are varied, further research is necessary to improve treatment and patient outcomes. Chapter 2 is a thorough review of literature on the mechanisms of rotator cuff disease. 	Alterations in scapular kinematics may influence subacromial space and either contribute to the etiology of subacromial impingement with rotator cuff tendon compression or serve as a compensation to alleviate compression. Furthermore alterations in scapular position may directly influence rotator cuff muscle strength. Chapter 3 compares the influence of the scapular assistance test on scapular upward rotation, posterior tilt, subacromial <b>space,</b> and <b>shoulder</b> strength between healthy individuals and subjects with subacromial impingement syndrome. Scapular upward rotation and posterior tilt induced with scapular assistance test appears to influence subacromial <b>space,</b> but not <b>shoulder</b> muscle strength; however, the influence of these scapular rotations do not differ between asymptomatic individuals and those with subacromial impingement. Furthermore scapular posterior tilt appears to have a greater influence on increasing subacromial space and should be emphasized in the treatment of individuals with subacromial impingement. 	In chapter 4, we examine the influence that obvious scapular dyskinesis and passive scapular correction with the scapular assistance test have on 3 D scapular kinematics and subacromial space. Scapular dyskinesis did not alter scapular kinematics or acromiohumeral distance during active elevation in static positions, in the scapular plane, and without a load when compared to those without scapular dyskinesis. This suggests other contributing factors, such as pain, increased load, or fatigue is requisite to alterations in scapular kinematics or AHD. Passive correction with the scapular assistance test increased scapular upward rotation, posterior tilt, and subacromial space in individuals with and without dyskinesis. In patients with obvious dyskinesis, there was a greater increase in scapular upward rotation with passive scapular assistance. This increased scapular upward rotation had a negative relationship with change in the acromiohumeral distance. The scapular dyskinesis test increased acromiohumeral distance and therefore may be helpful identifying individuals where subacromial compression is producing symptoms, regardless of dyskinesis. 	The results of this research suggest scapular kinematics and subacromial space are altered with the passive maneuver of the scapular assistance test in all individuals, regardless of subacromial impingement syndrome or scapular dyskinesis. Scapular dyskinesis alone may not be detrimental to scapular position and subacromial space when evaluated in static positions of active arm elevation. Other potential factors may be required to alter scapular kinematics to reduce subacromial space including pain, dynamic movement, load or fatigue. Further study is necessary to determine the influence of the combination of these factors in individuals with scapular dyskinesis...|$|R

40|$|Travel time {{estimation}} and prediction on motorways {{has long}} been a topic of research. Prediction modeling generally assumes that the estimation is perfect. No matter how good is the prediction modeling- the errors in estimation can significantly deteriorate the accuracy and reliability of the prediction. Models have been proposed to estimate travel time from loop detector data. Generally, detectors are closely spaced (say 500 m) and travel time can be estimated accurately. However, detectors are not always perfect, and even during normal running conditions few detectors malfunction, resulting in increase in the spacing between the functional detectors. Under such conditions, error in the travel time estimation is significantly large and generally unacceptable. This research evaluates the in-practice travel time estimation model during different traffic conditions. It is observed that the existing models fail to accurately estimate travel time during large detector <b>spacing</b> and congestion <b>shoulder</b> periods. Addressing this issue, an innovative Hybrid model that only considers loop data for travel time estimation is proposed.

Arthroscopic debidement associated with capsular release may provide significant pain relief and improve ROM in patents with capsular contracture of > 15 ° [31]. Just as other research findings have shown how osteochondral lesions of > 2  cm 2 are correlated with persistent pain as a predictive variable {{for the ultimate}} failure of the arthroscopic procedure [31], the patients with the worst outcomes in our study were those with large cartilaginous defects. Severe arthritis {{does not seem to}} be usefully treated with arthroscopy because of deteriorating outcomes over time and poor functional results [32, 33]. Shoulder arthritis is followed by progressive restriction of ROM due to the contracture of the capsule and deformity of the humeral head [16]. For a peripheral cartilage lesion, the restriction of the glenohumeral joint volume, the compression of the damaged glenoid cartilage surface, the pivot mechanism, and the eccentric loads can all promote squaring of the humeral head [12]. 360 ° capsulotomy reduces compression between the humeral head and the glenoid and can therefore lead to an improvement in the ROM. This procedure is mandatory in all cases involving an arthroscopic approach to stiff arthritic joints. Patients affected by degenerative joint diseases with residual joint <b>space</b> can improve <b>shoulder</b> function and obtain pain relief after arthroscopic debridement. The unchanged glenohumeral distance indicates that the arthritic process is stable, and biological resurfacing of the glenoid with an engineered hyaluronic acid membrane does not appear to lead to better outcomes than debridement and capsulotomy.|$|R

For the cup supporting base, Chinese brassiere covers {{the lower part of the}} breast and as it is not comfortable and has a phenomenon of loosening up, there were severe puckering. For issues in the wearing experiment, amendments in patterns with the cup part was required. 3. Chinese brassieres were big differences in wing angles and for Aimer, it had the steepest trend in wings and thus the wings headed down and for Gujin, as the angle of the wing was smaller than 90 ˚, it was heading upward. 4. Upon comparing the patterns of the Korean and Chinese brassiere, although most of the sizes excluding the wing angle had similar sizes, there was big differences in the wing angle. The reason why the brassiere patterns sold in China had bigger wing angle was due to the fact that more Chinese women had sway back body type than the Korean women and should reflect such difference in body size into making the brassiere patterns for each women. Key Words: slope of wing, sway back body type, breast, degree of Polymerization...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} get to where we need to go, {{locomotion}} often involves walking through narrow spaces. Whether an aperture affords passage is thought to be determined by the body size/aperture size relationship. For normal, ground-level aperture crossing, spaces 1. 3 x the shoulder width or smaller are considered impassible (requiring a shoulder rotation) and as such, 1. 3 x SW {{is said to be the}} critical point of aperture crossing. However, daily activities often involve navigating through apertures under more challenging circumstances, such as when walking through a busy airport while carrying luggage. As such, additional factors other than simply the body size and the aperture size may contribute to whether an aperture is deemed passable. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to investigate how the factors associated with challenging environments contribute to the way in which the body-environment relationship determines the affordance of aperture crossing. Through a series of experiments, participants walked through apertures: 1) while carrying a wide object, 2) under conditions of increased postural threat, 3) where the narrow spaces were created by other individuals, and 4) where there were multiple, misaligned apertures. In general, aperture crossing behaviour was monitored through the frequency and magnitude of shoulder rotations at time-of-crossing (TOC), the critical point, the amount of <b>space</b> between the <b>shoulders</b> and the obstacles at TOC (spatial margin), the position of the body relative to midline (M-L COM at TOC) and the walking speed leading up to and crossing through the aperture (approach velocity and velocity at TOC). The results from study one reveal that the passability of apertures adapts to objects being carried by rescaling the body-environment relationship to consider the new person-plus-object width and maintaining a critical point of 1. 3 x the widest dimension. However, this rescaling occurred at different rates across individuals. Studies two and three demonstrate that action capabilities (postural threat) and characteristics of the aperture (people instead of poles) alter the passability of apertures, as evident by more cautious crossing behaviours. Specifically, individuals maintained a larger critical point, a higher frequency and larger magnitude of rotation, as well as a slower approach velocity and velocity at TOC. Lastly in study four, rather than walk through the center of an aperture and equalize the size of the spatial margin of each shoulder (as observed in single aperture crossing), individuals walking through multiple misaligned apertures reduce the size of the spatial margin by walking closer to the object nearest midline. Furthermore, participants choose to rotate their shoulders at apertures that would not normally require a rotation, likely in an attempt to maintain the straightest possible walking path. Together, these studies suggest that additional factors other than the body size/aperture size ratio are considered when determining the affordance of aperture crossing. Specifically, in addition to supporting the idea that individual abilities are an important contributing factor to the identification of affordances, these results demonstrate that the affordance of aperture crossing is influenced by: 1) the level of postural threat, 2) characteristics of the aperture, and 3) the number and position of apertures. Understanding the typical behaviour for walking through narrow spaces and knowing what and how specific factors influence the passability of apertures provides the necessary groundwork for understanding how these behaviours are altered with age or disease and can provide insightful suggestions for the future design of cluttered environments...|$|R
