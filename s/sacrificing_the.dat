5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Cristaldi joined her in the United States. While the two were staying in Atlanta, he surprised her by taking her to their wedding ceremony which he had arranged without her knowledge. She went ahead with the ceremony, but was concerned about <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> rights she had to her child Patrick. She also realized she was increasingly unable {{to make decisions about}} her own life. The marriage was never made official in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Lê Duẩn's {{foreign policy}} was criticised by Hoàng Văn Hoan, who {{accused him of}} <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> country's sovereignty. A {{delegation}} led by Vitaly Vorotnikov, visited Vietnam during its National Day, the holiday that celebrated the establishment of North Vietnam after the August Revolution and met with Lê Duẩn. Lê Duẩn attended the 27th Communist Party Congress and later met with Gorbachev. Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Anatoly Dobrynin attended Lê Duẩn's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, {{critics were}} {{impressed}} by the improved sound quality and the group's ability to survive the loss of Gabriel without <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> quality of the music. The group went out on tour with Collins as frontman and Bill Bruford as an additional drummer, and the resulting performances in the US raised Genesis' profile there. The album has been reissued on CD several times, including a deluxe package with bonus tracks in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|The Eucharist is {{a renewal}} of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> on <b>the</b> cross.

[...] They participate in <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> together with <b>the</b> priest. They participate by cleansing the souls of arrogance, anger, guilt, lust and other sins, and thus see more clearly the picture of Christ in themselves.|$|R
60|$|Think {{of these}} things, my friends, always, but, above all, {{think of them}} as often as you come--as would to God all would come--to the altar of the Lord, and the Holy Communion of His body and blood. For there, indeed, you render to God that which is God's--namely, yourselves; there you offer to God <b>the</b> true <b>sacrifice,</b> which is <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of yourselves-- <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of repentance, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of thanksgiving, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of righteousness, or at least of hunger and thirst after righteousness; and there you receive in return your share of God's <b>sacrifice,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> which you did not make for Him, but which He made for you, when He spared not His only-begotten Son but freely gave Him for us.|$|R
50|$|Like many of {{her other}} pieces, Offertorium {{contains}} religious elements. Even the name is a reference to that section of a Mass (performed immediately after the Credo) that is sung while the priest is offering up the prepared bread and wine. The work takes as its overarching theme <b>the</b> concepts of <b>sacrifice</b> and offering: <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of Christ during the Crucifixion, God’s offering in creating <b>the</b> Earth, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> performer to <b>the</b> tone, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> composer to the art, and <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> main musical theme to disintegration and, later, reconstruction.|$|R
5|$|An outward {{shift of}} the PPF results from growth of the {{availability}} of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E
5|$|When the Council did review cases, {{the reviews}} were {{commonly}} {{dominated by the}} countries whose ethnic groups were affected and that tried not only to resolve the problem of mistreatment of their minorities but also score other political goals on the international scene, sometimes even <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> very minority in question (German and Hungarian governments are recognized as having abused the system the most). Also, of course, the League, lacking its own army, could not coerce any state to adhere to its recommendations.|$|E
5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep, now {{formally}} established as id Software, {{used some of}} these to prototype ideas for their own games. Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with 3D computer graphics, which until then was largely the purview of flight simulation games such as Wing Commander (1990). Carmack found that this was {{largely due to the}} limitations of personal computers of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast action game in 3D due to the number of surfaces it needed to calculate. During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through ray casting, in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D game engine that used animated 2D sprites for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game Hovertank 3D, in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters. In the fall of 1991, after the team—sans Wilbur—had relocated to Madison, Wisconsin, and he had largely finished the engine work for Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy, Carmack learned about , a role-playing game in development by Blue Sky Productions. Ultima Underworld was planned to display texture-mapped 3D graphics without Hovertanks restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting. Deciding that he could add texture mapping without <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> engine's speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as Underworld was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from Hovertank 3D for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 Catacomb 3-D. Upon seeing it, Scott Miller of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.|$|E

50|$|The frieze {{represents}} <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> suovetaurilia, a <b>sacrifice</b> {{in which}} <b>the</b> victims were a pig (sus), a sheep (ovis) and a bull (taurus) {{with the animals}} intended for sacrifice of exceptional size, clearly {{much larger than the}} men leading them to <b>sacrifice.</b> <b>The</b> scene has a great number of symbolic meanings, but it indicates above all that <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> is <b>the</b> focus. The man performing <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> is perhaps to be identified with Cottius. On the western side some representatives of the Cottian communities mentioned in the inscription are depicted. On the southern side a second sacrifice, officiated by Cottius, is depicted. On the eastern side the scene has been completely destroyed by the ravages of time.|$|R

25|$|During the Baroque period, the {{transverse}} flute was redesigned. Now {{often called the}} traverso (from the Italian), it was made {{in three or four}} sections or joints with a conical bore from the head joint down. The conical bore design gave the flute a wider range and more penetrating sound without <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> softer, expressive qualities. In addition to chamber music, the traverso began to be used in orchestral music.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, Boras {{completed}} a three-year, $35 million contract for Rafael Soriano to pitch for the New York Yankees. The deal is notable for Soriano's right {{to opt out}} of the contract following each season, effectively giving Soriano the power to leave the Yankees and seek a larger contract elsewhere without <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> full guaranteed value should he suffer injury or poor performance. Soriano would use this to opt out following the 2012 season.|$|E
5000|$|The Eucharist is a {{sacrifice}} {{in that it}} re-presents (makes present again) <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> cross. <b>The</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of Christ and <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> Eucharist are one single sacrifice. Christ, of course, is not <b>sacrificed</b> again because <b>the</b> one <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> Cross was accomplished [...] "once for all" [...] and cannot be repeated. The Mass is a liturgical representation of {{a sacrifice}} that makes present what it represents through the action of God in an unbloody manner. The Eucharist {{is not merely a}} commemoration of Christ's sacrifice on Golgotha: it also makes that <b>sacrifice</b> truly present. <b>The</b> priest and victim of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> {{are one and the same}} (Christ), with the difference that the Eucharist is offered in an unbloody manner.|$|R

25|$|The {{capacity}} of the new stadium was set to be approximately 50,000 seats made by Ducharme Seating. The reduction in capacity was a strategic decision by Stanford's Athletics Program to boost season ticket sales and create a more intimate playing atmosphere without <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> ability to host large world-class events, such as the FIFA World Cup in the future. This was partially the result of San Francisco's failure to secure a bid for the 2012 Olympics, which would have featured a renovated Stanford Stadium as the main Olympic Venue.|$|E
25|$|Understanding how {{to mediate}} {{top-down}} effects on crop populations {{caused by the}} enemies of herbivores as well as bottom-up effects of chemical composition in infected plants has important consequences {{for the management of}} agricultural industries. The selection of endophytes for agricultural use must be careful and consideration must be paid to the specific impacts of infection on all species of pest and predators or parasites, which may vary on a geographic scale. The union of ecological and molecular techniques to increase yield without <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> health of the local or global environment is a growing area of research.|$|E
25|$|In late 1938, {{during the}} great crisis in Europe over Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Munich Agreement, Canadians were divided.

King, who served as his own {{secretary of state for}} external affairs (foreign minister), said privately that if he had to choose he would not be neutral, but he made no public statement. All of Canada was relieved that the British appeasement at Munich, while <b>sacrificing</b> <b>the</b> rights of Czechoslovakia, seemed to bring peace.|$|E
