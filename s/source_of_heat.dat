5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus {{is not enough}} to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.|$|E

5|$|Tidal flexing kneads Europa's {{interior}} and ice shell, which becomes a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat.</b> Depending {{on the amount}} of tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of Europa's rocky core in response to gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is a {{naturally}} occurring element {{that can be}} found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|The slight {{eccentricity}} of Europa's orbit, {{maintained by}} the gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point to oscillate around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate {{towards and away from}} it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives it a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat,</b> possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes. The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. X–ray {{observations}} {{indicate that}} non–gravitational processes {{play a key}} role in the thermodynamics of the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM). The effect of non–gravitational processes is imprinted in the ICM as an entropy minimum, whose effects are visible in the Luminosity– Temperature relation and in the Entropy–Temperature relation. However, the X–ray emission alone cannot discriminate between different mechanisms and <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating.</b> There are no answers at present to the following questions: how much non–gravitational energy per baryons is present in the ICM?

40|$|Alkyl cyanoacrylates are {{interesting}} products {{for use in}} industry because of their properties enabling them to stick together {{a wide range of}} substrates. n-Butyl cyanoacrylate {{is one of the most}} successfully used tissue adhesives in the field of medicine because it exhibits bacteriostatic and haemostatic characteristics, in addition to its adhesive properties. At present, its synthesis is performed with good yields via Knoevenagel condensation using conventional <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating,</b> but this requires a long processing time. The aim of this work was to look for a new way of synthesising n-butyl cyanoacrylate using microwave irradiation as the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating.</b> This non-conventional <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> most likely reduces the process time of the synthesis. In comparison with a conventional heating source, such as an oil bath, the results showed the advantages of this method whereby the n-butyl cyanoacrylate gave the same yield and quality with a reduction in the reaction time by a factor of 3 - 5 -fold...|$|R
