These {{can increase the}} risk of explosion when heated. Most of LIB producers do not disclose the composition; thus, every new type of battery is a specific item, from the cleanup point of view.

Finally, if the electrode cohesion allows it, lab-scale cells (half-cells and full Li-ion) will be assembled using aged electrodes samples from different sampling areas.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{surveillance}} and control of the information security and the amnesty movement community within the called political détente. This is because the demands of those entities, particularly the Female Movement for Amnesty (MFPA) and the Brazilian Amnesty Committee (CBA), which were concentrated in the most sensitive issues for the regime even in times of political openness. By publicly denouncing, in Brazil and abroad, the crimes of dictatorship; and to demand the dismantling of the repressive apparatus besides the end of discretionary laws, these movements not only reached the high ranking military committed to an opening that was slow, gradual and safe, but also sectors within the military, clearly dissatisfied with the mobilization performance of the organized civilian opposition at that time. In this context, the movements' struggle for amnesty corroborated, in the perspective of the military, the need to establish tight surveillance on opponents or potential opponents of the regime. The analysis of the relationship between state surveillance and the performance of the amnesty movement must take into account, therefore, limits of the so called slow, gradual and <b>safe</b> <b>opening</b> practices that often seem to continue after the previous period, and bring up dissension within the Armed Forces and the mobilizing performance and ability of entities in the struggle for amnesty.

40|$|Objective: We {{describe}} a novel spatula and dissector {{to facilitate the}} big-bubble technique in deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). Methods: A 29 -year-old man who was diagnosed with bilateral keratoconus underwent deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). After 350 &# 956;m partial thickness incision of the recipient cornea, the Bonfadini dissector was inserted at the deepest point in the peripheral incision and could be advanced {{to the center of}} the cornea safely because of its "semi-sharp" tip. After achieving the big-bubble (BB) separation of Descemet membrane (DM) from the overlying stroma, the anterior stromal disc was removed. Viscoelastic material was placed on the stromal bed to prevent uncontrolled collapse and perforation of DM during the paracentesis blade incision into the BB. We could detect the <b>safe</b> <b>opening</b> of the BB using the Bonfadini dissector by the leakage of air bubbles into the viscoelastic material. After injecting viscoelastic material into the BB space, we inserted the Bonfadini spatula into the bigbubble safely because of its curved profile and blunt edges. The groove along the length of the Bonfadini spatula enables safe and efficient incision or the residual stromal tissue using the pointed end of a sharp blade while protecting the underlying DM. After removal of posterior stroma, the donor button was sutured with 16 interrupted 10 - 0 nylon sutures. Results: This technique and the use of the Bonfadini spatula and dissector facilitate exposure of Descemet membrane. Conclusion: The smooth Bonfadini DALK spatula and dissector facilitate safe and efficient completion of DALK surgery...|$|E

50|$|A safe (also {{called a}} {{strongbox}} or coffer) is a secure lockable box used for securing valuable objects against theft and/or damage from fire. A safe {{is usually a}} hollow cuboid or cylinder, with one face being removable or hinged to form a door. The body and door may be cast from metal (such as steel) or formed out of plastic through blow molding. Bank teller safes typically are secured to the counter, have a slit opening for dropping valuables into the <b>safe</b> without <b>opening</b> it, and a time-delay combination lock to foil robbers/and or thieves. One significant distinction between types of safes is whether the safe is secured to a wall or structure or {{if it can be}} moved around.

40|$|The key to {{effective}} treatment of neurological diseases {{resides in the}} <b>safe</b> <b>opening</b> of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a specialized structure that impedes the delivery of therapeutic agents to the parenchyma. Despite the fact that several approaches {{have been successful in}} overcoming the BBB impermeability, none of them can induce localized BBB opening noninvasively except for focused ultrasound (FUS) in conjunction with microbubbles. The physical mechanism behind the opening, however, has not been identified. Insight into the mechanism can be critical for delineating the safety profile for in both small and large animals alike. Therefore the purpose of this dissertation is to first determine the physical mechanism of FUS-induced BBB opening in mice and then translate this approach to non-human primates. To accomplish this goal, an in vivo transcranial cavitation detection system was developed and tested, built in phantoms and in vivo, to monitor the behavior of the microbubbles in the FUS bean, and to determine the type of cavitation, i. e., the activation of bubbles in an acoustic field, during BBB opening. We showed that the inertial cavitation (IC), a collapse of a bubble, which can vary from a fragmentation of the bubble to shock wave and liquid jets depending on the pressure, thereby damaging the endothelial cells of the brain capillaries, was not required to induce BBB opening in mice. With this system, the role of microbubble properties, including the diameter and shell components, in the BBB opening were determined. When the BBB opens with stable cavitation (SC), i. e., relatively moderate amplitude changes in the bubble size, the bubble diameter is similar t...|$|E

Fascinating conversations also arose with people who work in the less clearly related fields of administrative law, law and economics, public international law, international commercial law, and law and psychology. These conversations have reshaped my understanding of the boundaries among self, family, and society, and have given me a faith in our profession that, despite the hierarchies and occasional pettiness, we {{law professor}}s are a warm and supportive bunch.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this experimental and analytical research project was to develop maturity-based guidelines for early opening-to-traffic of concrete pavements {{in the state of}} Indiana. Currently, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) specifies that pavements can be opened to traffic when the concrete reaches the strength of at least 3. 8 MPa (550 psi). During this study modulus of rupture (MOR) and maturity data were collected and strength gain characteristics were analyzed. Also, fatigue experiments were performed at different stress levels and ages. Based on the experimental results, modulus of rupture of concrete was correlated with corresponding fatigue life for a specific age. The maturity data was then linked with fatigue results through flexural strength correlation. A <b>safe</b> early <b>opening</b> age was determined based on design load used by INDOT and specifications for allowable repetitions. The results of this research should be useful to both INDOT and contractor by allowing for quantification of the impact of early opening on performance of the pavement. In addition, early pavement opening will reduce the cost to the travelling public by reducing construction time and improving safety in the construction zone. ...|$|R
