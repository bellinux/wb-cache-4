5|$|Frigatebirds {{remain in}} the air and do not settle on the ocean.

In 1882, his older brother {{in his capacity as}} Minister of Interior appointed him Road Supervisor for the District of Hanalei to replace Christian Bertlemann, who had resigned. In 1887, Bush converted to Mormonism and was ordained an elder after two years; he took an active part in missionary work in the islands. He became the bishop of the Latter-day Saints ward in Kealia and hosted LDS historian Andrew Jenson during his 1895 visit to Kauai. In around 1894, Bush married a young girl at Lahaina, traveling to Kona after their marriage.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} {{preliminary}} pilot episode, however, Knauf and the producers {{realized there was}} no room for the character to grow in a television series. They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary Christian minister in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed to be decided, Knauf contested plans to make him a Catholic priest; he rather <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial. Although Brother Justin shares traits with Father Coughlin, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{felt that}} Brother Justin shares {{patterns}} with certain religious leaders who were often persecuted for their delusional visions. Historical figures like Father Coughlin, Aimee Semple McPherson and Brigham Young served as inspiration, although the writers refrained from re-telling their particular stories. Daniel Knauf originally thought of making Brother Justin a Protestant minister, {{but when the}} producers needed to decide on a specific religious affiliation, Knauf contested their plans {{to make him a}} Catholic priest. Knauf, a Catholic himself, <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less clichéd, suspicious or controversial. When asked whether God had influenced him to write the story, Knauf replied no.|$|E

As production costs grew higher than what it could earn, Disney decided to include the short in a feature-length film with other segments set to classical pieces. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{topography}} {{of the area}} in the vicinity of Scotch Run, the area near the stream was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stream in Beaver Township 1774. Some time before 1820, a carding mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville.

5|$|Eventually Henderson leased two {{properties}} in Essex Street for £250 per year, {{at the site}} of the modern-day Esplanade Hotel. He used his convicts to convert the buildings into a temporary prison. Meanwhile, Henderson was looking for a site to build a permanent convict establishment. Whilst he favoured Mount Eliza due to its height, which gave it pleasing vistas and supposedly healthier air, Governor Charles Fitzgerald rejected that proposal. Henderson ultimately <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> current site on a hill overlooking Fremantle.|$|E

5|$|Jamestown is {{the capital}} of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, located on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is also the {{historic}} main settlement of the island and is on its north-western coast. It is the island's only port and the centre of the island's road and communications network. It was founded when colonists from the English East India Company <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island in 1659 and was briefly occupied by the Dutch East India Company in 1673 before being recaptured. Many of the buildings built by the East India Company in the 1700s survive and give the town its distinctive Georgian flavour.|$|E

In 1957, intrigued {{by the sound of}} a kind of drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E
