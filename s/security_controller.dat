Computer security can deliver the required protection mechanisms and sustain the according business models. We propose an approach to facilitate the rigorous checking of components for originality in a vehicle. In our system model, a <b>security</b> <b>controller</b> receives special messages (i. e., the authenticity heartbeat signal) from relevant ECUs and it performs subsequent authentication and plausibility checks. As a result, the <b>security</b> <b>controller</b> can tell, if the current setup of components in the vehicle is original. We evaluate our authentication architecture for the Battery Management System (BMS) of a hybrid car. Here, the <b>security</b> <b>controller</b> detects reliably, if the BMS is an original component, and whether an attacker has modified the operational limits of the battery. In this paper, we reason that an effective copy protection scheme needs to fuse relevant information from different sources. Therefore, various security techniques have to be combined in a sound architectural approach. The distinctive feature of our architecture is that it takes into account application–specific knowledge of the real–time entities under control. I...|$|E
40|$|Scan {{test has}} been a common and useful method for testing VLSI designs due to the high {{controllability}} and observability it provides. These same properties have recently been shown to also be a security threat to the intellectual property on a chip [1]. In order to defend from scan based attacks, we present the Lock & Key technique. Our proposed technique provides security while not negatively impacting the design’s fault coverage. This technique requires only that a small area overhead penalty is incurred for a significant return in security. Lock & Key divides the already present scan chain into smaller subchains of equal length that are controlled by an internal test <b>security</b> <b>controller.</b> When a malicious user attempts to manipulate the scan chain, the test <b>security</b> <b>controller</b> goes into insecure mode and enables each subchain in an unpredictable sequence making controllability and observability of the circuit under test very difficult.

This framework provides a first step towards quantitative security achieved by probabilistic controllers. It extends the framework for specification, analysis, and automatic generation of <b>security</b> <b>controllers</b> provided in [21, 23] by considering probabilistic aspects of the behaviour of both the target process and the controller. Controllers may actively try to influence the choice of action of the target system or only passively react to actions the target system tried to perform. In a non-probabilistic setting both active and passive controllers can be expressed by the same model. In a probabilistic setting, however, these two types of controllers can differ. We respectively use the notions of generative and reactive processes to capture this distinction and discuss the different behaviours obtaining in the different settings.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the influences of}} the threshold voltage VT on the leakage behavior of the dice after a fabrication process. By measuring the current consumption (leakage) on a CMOS cryptographic device like smartcard <b>security</b> <b>controller</b> and using the DPA analysis {{it is possible to}} make the key visible which is used during a cryptographic operation. Therefore, in this paper not only the security risks by using the smartcard <b>security</b> <b>controller</b> will be shown where no DPA attacks have been performed. Furthermore, it will be shown that the results of DPA analysis only on a coincidentally selected die cannot be representative for the whole production. Rather the DPA analysis must be performed on a particularly selected die with the smallest VT parameter (worst case in the leakage behavior), so that the result for all other dice on the wafer (or for the whole production) can be considered as relevant. Thus, it will be shown that the test labs must use different methods regarding the DPA analysis {{in order to be able}} to cover the leakage behavior on all wafers of a production. For further re-evaluation of smartcards it is important that the manufacturer and the test labs can save time and costs by DPA measuring on the special selected worst case die...|$|E

Beyond the theoretical aspects, the assumption that a controller can observe the entire execution of its target might be restrictive in several practical cases. In this paper we dene lazy controllers, a category of security controllers which can schedule observation points over the target execution. Finding an optimal scheduling strategy is non-trivial in general. Indeed, a lazy controller could miss security-sensitive observations. Also, we propose synthesis strategies applicable to (i) non-deterministic targets with non-instantaneous actions, (ii) probabilistic targets modelled as Discrete Time Markov Chains and (iii) stochastic targets modelled as Continuous Time Markov Chains. In each case we give an analytical characterization of the probability that the lazy controller misses the detection of a violation...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bandwidth {{and the introduction of}} advanced IP services including voice, high-speed internet access, and video/IPTV, consumers are more vulnerable to malicious users than ever. In recent years, providing safe and sound networks and services have been the zenith priority for service providers and network carriers alike. Users are hesitant to subscribe to new services unless service providers guarantee secure connections. More importantly, government agencies of many countries have introduced legislations requiring service providers to keep track and records of owners of IP and MAC addresses at all time. In this paper, we first present an overview of Metro Ethernet (or Ethernet-To-The-Home/Business (ETTx)) and compare with various IP broadband access technologies including DSL, wireless and cable. We then outline major security concerns for Metro Ethernet networks including network and subscriber/end user security. Next we introduce state-of-the-art algorithms to prevent attackers from stealing any IP or MAC addresses. Our proposal is to use network management in conjunction with hardware features for security management to provide a secure and spoofing-free ETTx network. The key idea behind our proposal is to utilize network management to enforce strict (port, MAC, IP) binding in the access network to provide subscriber security. The paper then proposes an adaptive policy-based <b>security</b> <b>controller</b> to quickly identify suspected malicious users, temporarily isolate them without disconnecting them from the network or validating their contracts, and then carry the required analysis.

Attackers continue to expose new vulnerabilities and exploit them as quickly as new technologies, applications, and security strategies are developed. Today 2 ̆ 7 s security systems work in relative isolation with limited programmatic control and remediation is working at human reaction speed. Active Security gives a fundamental architectural advantage to the network defender. Active Security seeks to leverage all resources present throughout the infrastructure through a unified programming interface to protect existing infrastructure, interface {{with a variety of}} sensors, adjust the configuration at run-time, collect forensic data on-demand, and counter an attack. This makes a programmable network infrastructure and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) control key enablers of an Active Security architecture. Today, digital forensics is commonly performed in response to an incident or anomaly after an attacker has succeeded and possibly cleaned up the crime scene. We argue that this deep well of useful information should be leveraged in our architecture immediately when an attack or anomaly is detected. In particular, we investigate host physical memory which is often lost or tampered prior to an investigation. SDN bears the banner of programmatic control and thrives in an infrastructure capable of granular programming. This requirement acts as a barrier to entry by enterprise organizations who neither have the funding nor the technical ability to upgrade their network to SDN control overnight. A new transition alternative is needed that allows SDN control today using the existing legacy equipment. We show significant progress at closing this gap with ClosedFlow, extending SDN control to legacy networks, to enable immediate adoption of an Active Security architecture in the enterprise. We strengthen the case for an active security architecture illustrating the benefits of an automated sense, decide, respond feedback loop within a software-defined <b>security</b> <b>controller</b> and present the two research branches that were specifically investigated...|$|E
