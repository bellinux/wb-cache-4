500|$|Live'r Than You'll Ever Be was {{recorded}} by [...] "Dub" [...] Taylor from Trademark of Quality using a Sennheiser <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphone</b> and a Uher [...] "Report 4000" [...] reel-to-reel tape recorder. It {{was the first}} audience-recorded rock bootleg to be mastered and distributed; some sources consider it the first live bootleg. Though the sound {{is not nearly as}} clear as the official release of Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, the recording is considered to be very strong for an audience recording, especially one of that era. The Rolling Stones performed two sets that night and it is the second concert that was more heavily bootlegged and has sharper sound. Bootleggers had collaborated to record Stones shows across the United States, recording them on two-track Sony recorders for months prior to the release of the album. At least one source claims that the recordings initially came from rock promoter Bill Graham's staff, who used the tapes for broadcast on KSAN and released their edit on Lurch Records in early 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1923, {{the ribbon}} {{microphone}} was introduced, another electromagnetic type, {{believed to have}} been developed by Harry F. Olson, who essentially reverse-engineered a ribbon speaker. Over the years these microphones were developed by several companies, most notably RCA that made large advancements in pattern control, to give the microphone directionality. [...] With television and film technology booming there was demand for high fidelity microphones and greater directionality. Electro-Voice responded with their Academy Award-winning <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphone</b> in 1963.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Shotgun</b> <b>microphones</b> are {{the most}} highly {{directional}} of simple first-order unidirectional types. [...] At low frequencies they have the classic polar response of a hypercardioid but at medium and higher frequencies an interference tube gives them an increased forward response. This is achieved by a process of cancellation of off-axis waves entering the longitudinal array of slots. A consequence of this technique {{is the presence of}} some rear lobes that vary in level and angle with frequency, and can cause some coloration effects. [...] Due to the narrowness of their forward sensitivity, <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphones</b> are commonly used on television and film sets, in stadiums, and for field recording of wildlife.|$|R

50|$|The channel 39 {{broadcast}} was innovative {{because it}} was more like professional sports with host Bill Mercer, a former broadcaster for the Dallas Cowboys and Texas Rangers, mobile cameras at ringside with multiple <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphones</b> as used by Don King to capture and enhance the sound of impacts and crowd noise for boxing pay per views, and vignettes and interviews inspired by the Rocky movies to accentuate the heel or babyface of a wrestler outside of the ring.|$|R
50|$|A common {{polar pattern}} for {{microphones}} is the cardioid. This {{has a single}} direction in which the microphone does not respond to impinging sound waves. Highly directional (<b>shotgun)</b> <b>microphones</b> have more complex polar patterns. These microphones have a large, narrow lobe in the main direction of sound reception but also a smaller lobe {{in the opposite direction}} and usually also several other smaller lobes. This pattern is achieved by wave cancellation inside the body of the microphone. Between each of these lobes is a null direction where no sound at all is detected.|$|R

50|$|Much {{like the}} home {{recording}} {{revolution of the}} 1990s that gave Røde its initial success, the early 2000s saw rapid development {{in the area of}} home video recording with technologies such as MiniDV and early non-linear editing software allowing for high quality video production. The company quickly identified a growing demand for high-quality microphones for these cameras at relatively low cost, and so in 2004 Røde released the VideoMic on-camera microphone.Since this time Røde has developed a successful range of <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphones</b> (NTG1, NTG2, NTG3, NTG8) as well as developing the VideoMic range {{to meet the demands of}} the DSLR camera market.|$|R
40|$|For the {{television}} broadcast of football in Europe, the sound engineer will typically have {{an arrangement of}} 12 <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphones</b> around the pitch to pick up on-pitch sounds such as whistle blows, players talking and ball kicks etc. Typically, during a match, the sound engineer will increase and decrease the levels of these microphones manually in accordance with {{where the action is}} on the pitch at a given time to prevent the final mix being awash with crowd noise. As part of the EU funded project, FascinatE, we have developed an automatic mixing algorithm that intelligently seeks key events on the pitch and turns on the corresponding microphones, the algorithm picks out the key events and automatically tracks the action eliminating the need for manual tracking. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{company began}} {{producing}} modern wireless microphones in 1982, {{the same year}} when founder Fritz Sennheiser handed {{the management of the}} company over to his son, Jörg Sennheiser.

50|$|Murderball {{was shot}} {{on a low}} budget. The main camera used was a Panasonic AG-DVX100; a Sony PD150 was used to shoot {{some of the early}} interviews. The crew rigged a Sennheiser <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphone</b> to use as a boom, and relied heavily on Lavaliere {{wireless}} microphones as well. Available lighting was used almost exclusively. Additional light was provided using an inexpensive china ball. In one example of on-the-spot lighting, a flashlight was diffused using only a napkin.|$|E
50|$|Each shot {{is about}} nine minutes, and {{encompasses}} {{the length of}} the entire 2.8 kilometer ride up to the temple or down. Wanting consistent framing, Nepali carpenters were hired to build a stable wooden base onto which the filmmakers anchored their hi-hat tripod. Some viewers mistakenly believe that Spray and Velez were not present in the cable car during the shooting. In all rides, Velez operated an Aaton 7 LTR camera and Spray recorded sound with a <b>shotgun</b> stereo <b>microphone</b> on a two-channel sound recorder. In the beginning of the film, it seems that the camera stays in place when it arrives at one of the two covered stations, but in fact, a new roll of film is used for each sequence. The film required 26 months from the shoot to the premiere. It was largely shot in June 2011, but the filmmakers had great difficulty getting the film out of Nepal for development.|$|R
5000|$|RØDEShow 2017 also {{announced}} {{a suite of}} new products to be released through the year. These include: studio valve condenser microphones TFM50 (produced in collaboration with Grammy Award-winning classical music producer Tony Faulkner, {{to be used in}} concert hall applications), NT49 and NT-RV, and {{a new version of the}} NT5 pencil condenser microphone (featuring a patented gasket-less capsule). The new on-camera range included a premium VideoMic on-camera <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphone,</b> the VideoMic Pro+ and the first on-camera 360-degree surround sound microphone, the VideoMic SoundField.|$|E
50|$|Filming of Glena {{began in}} November 2010 in Oregon. The movie was shot {{on a low}} budget. The main camera used was a Canon XH-A1, and a Panasonic DVX-100 was used to shoot some early footage. The one-man-crew relied on a {{wireless}} lavaliere microphone and camera-mounted <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphone</b> to capture audio. Available lighting was used almost exclusively, though a camera-mounted LitePanels Micro was utilized at times. Luebke, who also edited the film, utilized extensive post-production techniques including ADR and sound design to create the film's elaborate fight sequences.|$|E
50|$|Sennheiser {{went into}} {{business}} for himself, and achieved early success with a tube voltmeter and microphone, {{both of which}} were purchased by Siemens. Later products in the 1950s included his invention of the <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphone,</b> early wireless microphones as well as its distinctive headphones that fit over the ear with flat, disc-shaped headpieces. Sennheiser stepped down as chairman in 1982, turning the reins over to his son Jörg. By the time of his death, the family-owned business employed 2,100 people with manufacturing facilities in Germany, Ireland and the United States and had sales of $500 million in 2008.|$|E

50|$|The Dragoon ASV (Armored Security Vehicle), {{also known}} as the Patroller, is the version of the Dragoon APC that is in service with several US law {{enforcement}} agencies. The vehicle is a little higher to allow standing, and the weapon mount is replaced with a rotating box that carries the surveillance equipment. The windows are larger, as are the firing ports and vision blocks. The vehicle is equipped with several surveillance devices, including a low-light TV, VCR, computer, <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphone,</b> and night vision gear. Many of these vehicles are equipped with pole-mounted ramming blocks mounted on the nose of the vehicle. Sirens and flashing lights complete the modifications.|$|E
5000|$|The show is {{shot with}} a Sony EX3, a 1980s-era 416 Sennheiser <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphone</b> and {{subsequently}} edited on Final Cut Pro. Video footage is recorded throughout the week by the White House videographer. The material is then usually edited on a Thursday and released the next day (usually on Friday at 12:00 AM EDT). According to the Presidential Record Act all footage must be archived. It is stored in the presidential records. The episodes titles are decided by Arun Chaudhary.

5000|$|Les Cranes confrontational {{interview}} technique, {{along with}} a [...] "shotgun" [...] microphone he aimed at audiences, earned him the name [...] "the bad boy of late-night television", though critical opinion was divided. The New York Times media critic Paul Gardner considered him an incisive interviewer who asked tough questions without being insulting. One critic who did not like his show found Cranes trademark <b>shotgun</b> <b>microphone</b> distracting. [...] "Each time he points this mike into the audience, {{it looks as though}} hes about to shoot a spectator." [...] (Laurent, 1964) Nearly every critic described Crane as photogenic. One described him as [...] "a tall, handsome and personable lad..." [...] (Smith, 1964) Crane was unable to dent Carsons ratings, and the show lasted 14 weeks before ABC executives transformed it into the more show-business-oriented ABCs Nightlife.|$|E
