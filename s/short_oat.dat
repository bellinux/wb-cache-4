Then one noted the slashing, where chopped trees {{had fallen in}} tangled rows, and an inner belt of ashes and {{blackened}} stumps. Other stumps, surrounded by fern, checkered the oblong of cultivated soil, and the dew sparkled on the <b>short</b> <b>oat</b> stubble. The oats were not grown for milling; the heads were small and Jardine cut the crop for hay. The garden-lot and house occupied a gentle slope. The walls were built of logs, notched and crossed at the corners; cedar shingles, split by hand on the spot, covered the roof. Behind the house, one saw fruit trees and log barns. Nothing was factory-made, and Jimmy thought all indicated strenuous labor.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with acute}} stroke {{often do not}} seek {{immediate}} medical help, which {{is assumed to be}} driven by lack of knowledge of stroke symptoms. We explored the process of help seeking behavior in patients with acute stroke, evaluating knowledge about stroke symptoms, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and onset-to-alarm time (OAT). In a sub-study of the Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS), 161 acute stroke patients were prospectively included in 3 Dutch hospitals. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to assess knowledge, recognition and interpretation of stroke symptoms. With in-depth interviews, response actions and reasons were explored. OAT was recorded and associations with socio-demographic, clinical parameters were assessed. Knowledge about stroke symptoms does not always result in correct recognition of own stroke symptoms, neither into correct interpretation of the situation and subsequent action. In our study population of 161 patients with acute stroke, median OAT was 30 min (interquartile range [IQR] 10 - 150 min). Recognition of one-sided weakness and/or sensory loss (p[*]=[*] 0. 046) and adequate interpretation of the stroke situation (p =[*] 0. 003), stroke at daytime (p =[*] 0. 002), severe stroke (p =[*] 0. 003), calling the emergency telephone number (p =[*] 0. 004), and transport by ambulance (p =[*] 0. 040) were associated with <b>shorter</b> <b>OAT.</b> Help seeking behavior after acute stroke is a complex process. A <b>shorter</b> <b>OAT</b> after stroke is associated with correct recognition of one-sided weakness and/or sensory loss, adequate interpretation of the stroke situation by the patient and stroke characteristics and logistics of stroke care, but not by knowledge of stroke symptom...|$|R

The iconic sausage trees and fan palms line the water courses. Euphorbia candelabrum and the shorter monkey bread (or camel's foot) and Buffalo thorn trees are also found. Perennial water makes River Kidepo an oasis in the semi-desert which hosts over 86 mammal species including spotted hyenas, Congo lions, Tanzanian cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs, elephants, giraffes, zebras, Cape buffaloes, bat-eared foxes, Rothschild's giraffes [...] - [...] as well as almost 500 bird species.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{dispersion}} {{characters of}} organic modified attapulgite (<b>OAT)</b> <b>short</b> fibers in nature rubber (NR) matrix, this paper analyzed the effects, {{in terms of}} addition amount of OAT, processing technology of rubber compound and heat treatment, on mechanical properties and anisotropy of OAT/NR composites. Results indicated that mechanical properties were better when the OAT content is 50 phr and thin-passing is 20 times, meanwhile, the longitudinal and transversal tensile strength of OAT/NR composites were 17. 01 ± 0. 5 Mpa and 14. 18 ± 0. 5 Mpa respectively. The anisotropy is obvious. Also the tensile and tear broken section were studied by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the forming mechanism of OAT/NR anisotropy composites was discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the joint effects of <b>short</b> selling, fl <b>oating</b> constraints, and heterogeneous beliefs on stock prices {{by using a}} unique data set of cross-listed Chinese stocks. Because domestic A-shares are subject to both short selling and fl oating restrictions whereas foreign H-shares are not, an H-share price discount represents a price bubble induced by trading restrictions. The H-share price discounts are signifi cantly and positively correlated with short-sale transactions of H-shares and negatively correlated with the non-tradable A-share reform variable, after controlling for market-specifi c sentiment and other factors. Furthermore, we fi nd that short selling signifi cantly widens the price discounts in bullish but not in bearish market periods, and in market return up days but not in down days. Finally, we fi nd that lagged short-selling activities have predictive power for future H-share price discounts. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R
