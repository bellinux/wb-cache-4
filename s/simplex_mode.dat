40|$|Introduction BioPSE is a {{scientific}} programming environment {{that allows the}} interactive construction, debugging, and steering of large-scale scientific computations. BioPSE can be envisioned as a "computational workbench," in which a scientist can design and modify simulations interactively via a dataflow programming model. As opposed to the typical "o#-line" simulation mode (in which the scientist manually sets input parameters, computes results, visualizes the results via a separate visualization package, and then starts again at the beginning), BIoPSE "closes the loop" and allows interactive steering of the design, computation, and visualization phases of a simulation. A snapshot of our source localization algorithm running within the BioPSE environment is shown in Fig..

The Smith system of compounding was developed from the two-cylinder Worsdell-von Borries compound system. Walter Mackersie Smith, a Scottish engineer, improved on this system by developing a three-cylinder compound system with one high-pressure cylinder inside and two low-pressure cylinders outside. It permitted the locomotive to be worked in either compound, semi-compound or <b>simplex</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

By means of a steam cock in the cab, the driver could also admit boiler steam to the low-pressure cylinders for additional power while ascending steep inclines.|$|E
40|$|RFID is infiltrating {{the core}} of the {{manufacture}} industry step by step. It collects realtime data of tags attached on the products in batches, which ensures matter-flow be consistent with info-flow. Integrated with MES and DCS, RFID make the production process be visible and punctual. Despite possibly being a subversive technology for manufacture industry, RFID has not shows its great superiorities. All the same, RFID is posing many challenges for extensive applications at industrial production: i) RFID don’t integrates with control system so tightly and efficiently that RFID shows unreliable and inefficient to the existent systems at workshop; ii) The existent RFID interrogators almost do not support network-connecting at the equipment layer; iii) There exist various tags with various protocols and criterions which desires intelligent interrogators with the capacity of supporting multi-protocols. Thus, a general approach of RFID applications in industry is needed to efficiently automate the integration between RFID system with the control systems and business applications. In this paper, we put forward a fieldbus-based approach for the integration between RFID with the control system. RFID control unit connects with other instruments (meters, PLC, etc.) to composing a bottom fieldbus network, and it transmits the collected data to control system by fieldbus instantly. RFID integration and application panel runs at the workshop monitoring layer, it executes the configuration of the unit and user’s protocol, communicates with business applications at the top layer, and monitors the state of the whole RFID system. According to new approach, RFID application adopts the mode of closed-loop band together open-loop but the <b>simplex</b> closed-loop <b>mode,</b> and RFID equipments transmit data to the control system by the fieldbus network directly, which evidently reduces the frequency of communication among the RFID equipments, control system and business applications. The approach makes RFID play the real role of info-carrier, and reliable and real-time data transmission could be realized, then RFID really becomes the vivid ‘eye’ of control system. Thereby, the declarative approach should be a feasible resolution to the problem above...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{presentation}} concludes {{the research}} {{done on a}} wavefront-sensorless (WFSless) adaptive optics (AO) setup, where light intensity of a focussed beam behind a pinhole is measured. As wavefront compensator, a Piezo Deformable Mirror (PDM) was used. The goal of the research is to investigate which algorithms lead to the highest light intensity possible and {{the time needed to}} reach this optimum. The research consists out of two parts: compensation for the hysteresis of the PDM, which now causes inaccuracy of the actuator strokes; and implementation of theories on WFSless AO found in literature. To reduce the effects of hysteresis, compensation was developed, which uses a modified structure of the Coleman-Hodgdon equations (C-H eq.). The inverse model can directly be used and the number of variables was reduced. The optimization algorithms used to find light intensity are a Nelder-Mead (NM) simplex which directly optimizes PDM actuator voltages (VO), a NM, which controls 14 Zernike modes and a line search (LS) and quadratic optimization (QO) algorithm that optimize 14 individual Zernike modes coefficients. The OA and the hysteresis compensator were experimentally evaluated. From the experimental tests it can be concluded that the NM algorithms result in the highest light intensity. The use of Zernike modes increases the optimization speed. For the NM simplex a reduction of 59 - 66 % in time was achieved before the algorithm reached 95 % of its final light intensity value. If the NM <b>simplex</b> in Zernike <b>mode</b> optimization is compared with the QO, the QO only needs 60 steps to reach a photodiode value of 3 V (about 80 % of highest possible light intensity), whereas the NM simplex needs 129 steps. The use of hysteresis compensation led to an increase of the light intensity for the NM in VO and the LS and QO.

5000|$|These {{technologies}} are marketed {{in such a}} way it is possible to see them as cheating and tricking consumers through technology branding. This type of network {{will never be able to}} reach 125 Mbit/s as real data throughput; 125 Mbit/s is the maximum data rate before accounting for overhead. This causes consumer frustration due to failed expectations. For instance, the average consumer would expect a 125 Mbit/s wireless link to outperform a standard 100 Mbit/s wired link while, in fact, 100 Mbit/s wired link will be much faster; a standard wired 100Mbit/s 100BaseT link is approximately three times faster than 125HSM in <b>simplex</b> <b>mode</b> (i.e. transmitting or receiving only) and six times faster than 125HSM in full-duplex mode (i.e. both transmitting and receiving data—which is typical during file transfers between 2 computer connected to the same hub). In other words, even under ideal conditions, 125 HSM mode may only deliver anywhere from a third to one sixth the data transfer speed of a standard 100 Mbit/s wired LAN link.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{satellite}} systems being planned for introduction {{in the early}} 1990 s {{are expected to be}} invariably of the multi-service type. Mobile Telephone Service (MTS), Mobile Radio Service (MRS), and Mobile Data Service (MDS) are the major classifications used to categorize the many user applications to be supported. The MTS and MRS services encompass circuit-switched voice communication applications, and may be efficiently implemented using a centralized Demand-Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) scheme. Applications under the MDS category are, on the other hand, message-oriented and expected to vary widely in characteristics; from <b>simplex</b> <b>mode</b> short messaging applications to long duration, full-duplex interactive data communication and large file transfer applications. For some applications under this service category, the conventional circuit-based DAMA scheme may prove highly inefficient due to the long time required to set up and establish communication links relative to the actual message transmission time. It is proposed that by defining a set of basic bearer services to be supported in MDS and optimizing their transmission and access schemes independent of the MTS and MRS services, the MDS applications can be more efficiently integrated into the multi-service design of mobile {{satellite systems}}...|$|E

40|$|The {{explosion}} of new wireless communication technologies and services {{has led to}} the increase in spectrum demand. The fixed spectrum allocation approach has resulted in current day spectrum scarcity and poorly utilized licensed spectrum. In order to overcome these problems, a new concept of accessing the spectrum, defined as dynamic spectrum access (DSA), is proposed. DSA mechanism enables unlicensed or cognitive users (CUs) to temporarily utilize a spectrum hole for a period of time. In this work, DSA based on cognitive radio (CR) technology is chosen due to its features of able to sense, learn, adapt and react according to the environment. The proposed design of the system consists of four main functional blocks: spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum decision and data transmission. Spectrum management is further divided into three parts: spectrum identification, synchronization and link management. This paper focuses on the establishment of link management module in <b>simplex</b> <b>mode.</b> The implementation is done using GNU Radio and USRP SDR platform. The GMSK based and IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard radios, equipped with DSA capability using CR technique, have been developed and tested.
