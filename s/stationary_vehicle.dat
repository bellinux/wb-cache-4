25|$|Although not {{specifically}} {{linked to the}} use of warning beacons, the police, fire brigade and ambulance services (and in certain cases, the blood services and bomb disposal units, but not the other emergency services listed above) may also choose to allow their drivers to claim legal exemptions from certain motoring regulations, such as being able to treat a red traffic light as a give way sign, exceeding the speed limit, passing the wrong side of a keep left/right sign, driving in a bus lane, or parking in restricted areas. They may not, however, ignore ‘no entry’ signs, drive the wrong way down a one-way street or cross a solid white line {{in the middle of the}} road (other than the same exceptions granted everyone else, for example to pass a <b>stationary</b> <b>vehicle).</b> In reality some drivers will disobey other laws at their professional judgement but they do so without any automatic protection from the law. Some services, such as HM coastguard do not allow all their staff to claim all the exemptions available to them.|$|E

2500|$|Altogether {{it is of}} {{note that}} {{especially}} in many Western countries, after a motor vehicle collision, those involved seek {{health care for the}} assessment of injuries and for insurance documentation purposes. In contrast, in many less wealthy countries, there may be limited access to care and insurance may only be available to the wealthy. Against this background, the “(late) whiplash syndrome” (ICD-10: S13.4) has been one special focus of continuous and controversial scientific research since the 1950s [...] as the worldwide incidence of such injuries varies enormously 16-2000 per 100,000 population and the late whiplash syndrome in these cases varies between 18% to 40% [...] Thus, Schrader et al’s important work in The Lancet showed that late whiplash syndrome after a motor vehicle collision is rare or uncommon in Lithuania , and Cassidy et al’s conclusion in the New England Journal of Medicine is that “the elimination of compensation for pain and suffering is associated with a decreased incidence and improved prognosis of whiplash injury” [...] Moreover, one should also mention an experimental study in 2001 in which participants were placed in a <b>stationary</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a curtain blocking their rear view, and exposed to a simulated rear-end collision. Twenty percent of patients had symptoms at 3 days, despite the fact that no collision actually occurred [...] [...] From the evolving viewpoint of naturalistic Internet search engine analytics in has been shown in 2017 that the expectations for receiving compensation may influence Internet search behavior in relation to whiplash injury [...]|$|E

It is to generate background by image segmentation and statistic of the gray average in each gray segment interval. It realizes background update with the measurement features of adopting the gray average in each segment and the standard deviation, detects and eliminates the <b>stationary</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the background through complexity comparison of the edge. The experiment shows that the generated background has good quality, and can accurately detect and update the area of <b>stationary</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the background...|$|R

40|$|A smart camera {{combines}} video sensing, high-level {{video processing}} and communication {{within a single}} embedded device. Such cameras are key components in novel surveillance systems. This paper reports on a prototyping development of a smart camera for traffic surveillance. We present its scalable architecture comprised of a CMOS sensor, digital signal processors (DSP), and a network processor. We further discuss the mapping of high-level video processing algorithms to embedded DSP-based platforms and identify typical pitfalls for the porting of software from desktops to embedded platforms. Our mapping strategies are demonstrated on an algorithm for automatic detection of <b>stationary</b> <b>vehicles.</b> This algorithm is migrated from a Matlabbased prototyping implementation to an embedded DSP implementation in our smart camera. Our implemented smart camera prototype streams the video data over an IP-network to a central monitoring station {{and is able to}} detect <b>stationary</b> <b>vehicles</b> and blocking cargo on highways within the required real-time constraints of six seconds...|$|R
