40|$|On {{the role}} of soil seed bank and {{dispersal}} in restoration of salt-marsh vegetation Plans {{have been made to}} restore salt-marsh communities in 1000 ha of present summerpolders in the area of Noard-Fryslân Bûtendyks. The effects of breaching the summer dike at three places of a polder of 135 ha will be monitored as a pilot study before working at a larger scale in the future. The present vegetation in the summer polders features plants of fresh, fertilized communities as a result of intensive agricultural exploitation. The restoration cannot rely on the soil seed bank of halophytic plant species as a record of that previously existing salt-marsh community. Hence, restoration will depend on the dispersal of diaspores of halophytic plant species from a nearby source area info the target area. Such diaspores have indeed been deposited {{at the foot of the}} summer dike during storm events. The occurrence of seeds in the driftline suggests that salt-marsh species may float into the <b>summer</b> <b>polder.</b> The breaching of the dike in summer 2001 will enable to monitor the development of the restoration of salt-marsh plant communities from the very beginning...|$|E
40|$|Questions How {{successful}} was {{the restoration}} of a salt marsh at a former <b>summer</b> <b>polder</b> on the mainland coast of the Dutch Wadden Sea 10 yr after de-embankment? What {{were the most important}} factors determining the level of restoration success? Location Noard-Fryslân Bûtendyks, northwest Netherlands. Methods The frequencies of target plant species were recorded before de-embankment and monitored thereafter (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10 yr later) using permanent transects. Vegetation change was monitored using repeated mapping 14 yr before and 1, 7 and 10 yr after de-embankment. A large-scale factorial experiment with 72 sampling plots was set up {{to determine the effects of}} distance to a breach point, distance to a creek and grazing treatment on species composition. Abiotic data were also collected from the permanent transects and sampling plots on elevation, soil salinity and redox potential. Results Ten years after de-embankment, permanent transect data showed that 78 % to 96 % of the target species were found at the restoration site. Vegetation mapping, however, showed that the diversity of salt marsh communities was low, with 50 % of the site covered by the secondary pioneer marsh community. A multivariate analogue of ANOVA indicated that the most important experimental factor determining species composition was the interaction between distance to the nearest creek and livestock grazing. The combination of proximity to a creek and exclusion from livestock grazing always resulted in development of the high marsh community. In contrast, the combination of being located far from a creek, grazed and situated at low elevation with accompanying high salinity resulted in development of the secondary pioneer marsh community. Conclusions Using target species as criteria, restoration success could be claimed 10 yr after de-embankment. However, the diversity of communities in the salt marsh was lower than desired. Variable grazing regimes should be applied to high-elevation areas to prevent dominance by single species of tall grasses and to promote formation of vegetation mosaics. Low-elevation areas need lower grazing pressure. Also, an adequate soil drainage network should be preserved or constructed in low-elevation areas before de-embankment...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} of breeding birds on the salt marshes along the Frisian coast (NFB) {{has been studied}} for over more than 20 years. Within this period many factors have changed, affecting both vegetation and bird densities. One {{of these is the}} restoration of salt marsh habitat by managed or 'accidental' realignment of dykes. In this paper we evaluate the development of the breeding bird community on NFB and focus on four different parts that were restored to salt marsh in 2001, 1992 and 1990 and 1975 respectively. Since 1991, 60 species of breeding birds have been recorded on NFB, mostly colonial species and meadow birds. Both on the salt marsh area and in the <b>summer</b> <b>polders</b> (separated from the salt marsh by a low dyke and flooded only during exceptionally high tides), the number of breeding bird species has increased. A crash of colonial species (mainly Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Pied Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta) after 2000 is assumed to be mainly driven by increased predation (presumably by Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes). Today, highest densities of breeding birds occur in the <b>summer</b> <b>polders.</b> The de-embanked salt marshes generally show declining densities of primary meadow birds, towards densities that are typical of salt marshes. With the restoration into salt marsh, the risk of inundation of nests and drowning of fledglings has increased, reinforced by an increased frequency of storm surges during the breeding season. Also vegetation has changed, to a large extent in interaction with grazing. Although the confounding effects of ditching, predation, local grazing management and regional food availability are relevant when considering the observed trends, a negative effect of restoration on primary meadow birds was nonetheless detected. The strong decrease of colonial species however is not associated with the restoration of salt marsh habitat and has occurred nearly simultaneously in salt marshes along the neighbouring Groningen coast...|$|R
50|$|The exact year of {{construction}} is uncertain, 1832 or 1841 are mentioned. Though restored earlier, the mill was in a bad state of repair when Stichting De Fryske Mole became owner in 1981. It was scratched {{from the list of}} protected monuments and a permit for demolishment had already been given before the national government could be persuaded to at least pay for the yearly maintenance. Money was raised from other public and private parties and by selling postcards to pay for the four year restoration. In 1988 the work was completed and the windmill is currently in regular use to drain the Geeuwpolder. This polder {{is one of the last}} remaining <b>summer</b> <b>polders,</b> it is only drained during the summer and allowed to flood in winter. The polder is now a nature reserve owned by Staatsbosbeheer (English: State Forest Management).|$|R
50|$|His chosen genres {{ranged from}} genre {{landscape}} painting with scenes of <b>summer</b> landscape, <b>polders</b> {{and the village}} face to the city face. In still life, he had primarily adopted the flower as an object. He also chooses the classic theme of the windmill of Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch (1824-1903) and Paul Gabriel (1828-1903)—both are {{in the tradition of}} Jacob van Ruisdael (1630-1681). Very well known are the landscape paintings from the surrounding of Kortenhoef. He is primarily concerned with inland fishing themes, too.|$|R
40|$|Managed {{realignment}} has aroused {{increasing interest}} {{over the past}} decade, reflecting a growing awareness of {{the high cost of}} holding the line, the widespread trend of coastal squeeze, and the potentially adverse effects of accelerated sea level rise. This comparative study of England's and Germany's approaches to managed realignment sought to explore similarities and differences and hence provide insights on its future use. Although consideration of managed realignment is widely perceived as a positive development, important and sometimes surprising differences were found concerning its application. This reflects various factors ranging from the physical landscape and the state of coastal defences to cultural factors. Existing schemes are mostly concentrated on the coasts of eastern England and the German federal states of Lower Saxony and Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania. Managed realignment in England, and to some extent on Germany's Baltic Sea coast, seems driven by longer term factors, such as the desire to create more sustainable flood defences and to provide new intertidal habitats, although these are often combined with the more immediate need to upgrade defences. On Germany's well-defended North Sea coast, managed realignment has only been undertaken for specific compensation reasons, although broader conservation concerns might become an important future driver for managed realignment in <b>summer</b> <b>polders.</b> Thus managed realignment is now firmly on the agenda in both countries, reflecting a radical departure from the recent past, in which protection was the only possible response. However, application is likely to differ significantly both between and within these countries...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} design a land {{management}} plan that provides a good balance between agricultural production and natural values in the polders, a land management alternatives analysis was conducted for the region. The analysis {{was based on an}} integrated database assembled for the polder area and the AGNPS, which was adapted to Lithuanian conditions using modeling techniques. Six polders on Rusne Island were used to represent both <b>summer</b> and winter <b>polder</b> conditions in the model. ...|$|R
