40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work, we make use of two {{non-parametric}} statistical pattern recognition algorithms and a multiple regression analysis to analyse seismic clusters occur ring around Mount Etna, Italy. The aim is to determine if the onset of <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> at Mount Etna is linked to variations in the regional seismicity at a timescale of few weeks. From the analysis, we find that the discrimination between clusters preceding <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> and clusters not related in time to flank activity is mainly linked to the volume output of the previous <b>flank</b> <b>eruption,</b> in some cases together with the time elapsed from its end. Instead, we do not find any difference in the seismicity features characterizing different types of clusters, except for a very small contribution of the number of seismic events in the clusters. This result does not confirm the existence, suggested in the past, of a direct link between the regional state of stress at a timescale of few weeks and the occurrence of <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> on Mount Etna volcano. On the contrary, the result suggests that a prominent role in the <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> occur rence is played by the re-charging of the feeding system. In the second part of this study we analyse the relationship between the magma volume erupted in an eruption and the interevent time following it, finding that a ‘time-predictable model’ satisfactorily describes the occurrence of eruptions at Mount Etna in the last decades.

2500|$|Eruptions of Etna {{follow a}} variety of patterns. Most occur at the summit, where there are [...] five {{distinct}} craters — the Northeast Crater, the Voragine, the Bocca Nuova, and the Southeast Crater Complex (2). Other eruptions occur on the flanks, which have more than 300 vents {{ranging in size from}} small holes in the ground to large craters hundreds of metres across. Summit eruptions can be highly explosive and spectacular, but rarely threaten the inhabited areas around the volcano.

40|$|Mount Etna {{is among}} the few volcanoes on Earth that erupt nearly continuously, but its {{activity}} (in terms of output rate and <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> frequency) undergoes significant fluctuations in time.

The eruptive fissure of San Vincenzo gave rise to a large scoria cone located below the village of Stromboli, and generated a lava flow, most of which lies below sea level.

40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis of volcanic activity at Mt Etna was conducted with the twofold aim of (1) constructing a probability map for vent opening of future <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> and (2) forecasting the expected number of eruptive events at the summit craters. The spatiotemporal map of new vent opening at Etna volcano {{is based on the}} analysis of spatial locations and frequency of <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> starting from 1610. Thanks to the completeness and accuracy of historical data over the last four centuries, we examined in detail the spatial and temporal distribution of <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> showing that effusive events follow a nonhomogenous Poisson process with space-time varying intensities. After demonstrating the spatial nonhomogeneity and the temporal nonstationarity of <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> at Etna, we calculated the recurrence rates (events expected per unit area per unit time) and produced different spatiotemporal probability maps of new vent opening in the next 1, 10 and 50 years. These probabilistic maps have an immediate use in evaluating the future timing and areas of Etna prone to volcanic hazards. Finally, the results of the analysis of the persistent summit activity during the last 110 years indicate that the hazard rate for eruptive events is not constant with time, differs for each summit crater of Mt Etna, highlighting a general increase in the eruptive frequency starting from the middle of last century and particularly from 1971, when the SE crater was formed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> of Mt. Etna mostly {{result from}} {{drainage}} of plagioclase-rich magma {{from the central}} volcano conduits, but rarer ones emitting plagioclase-free aphyric magma, are driven by dyke propagation from beneath the volcano, bypassing the central conduits. An archetype of such events is the January-March 1974 eruption that developed in two explosive phases. New data for the mineralogy and geochemistry of the 1974 products and the coeval earthquake distribution, indicate that the eruption was likely triggered by deep tectonic fracturing that allowed a dyke to propagate from ~ 11 km depth below the summit at a minimal rate of 10 - 2 m s- 1. We point to initially fast, closed system ascent of the volatile-rich magma, leading to lava fountains during the very first stage of the two eruption phases, followed by slower magma rise and increasing gas-melt separation (strombolian explosions) within the upper portion of the feeder dyke. The anomalous K-rich composition but also distinct Rb/Th, Cl/K and S/Cl ratios of the 1974 trachybasalts, tracked a recent mixing of 25 % pre-existing low K-trachybasalts with a 75 % new alkali-rich magma whose almost pure extrusion occurred in 2001 - 2003. This new input was first revealed by the 1974 event. We propose an updated terminology - sub-volcano dyke (SVD) eruptions - for 1974 -type <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> on Etna and other basaltic strato-volcanoes, which focuses on their driving mechanism and thereby allows us to distinguish them from the more common central conduit dyke (CCD) <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions.</b> We ultimately discuss possible criteria to forecast SVD-type <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> on Etna...|$|R

The combination of the two dating techniques demonstrates that three major <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> occurred on the lower north and west flanks during Greek–Roman epochs, producing large scoria cones and extensive lava flows. In particular, the Mt Ruvolo and Mt Minardo events highly impacted the territory of the west flank, notably by damming the Simeto River.

40|$|On July 17, 2001, lava began {{pouring down}} {{the slopes of}} Mt. Etna in Sicily {{signaling}} {{the start of the}} volcano's first <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> in nearly 10 years. Etna typically experiences long periods of explosive and effusive activity at the summit, which lies 3350 m a. s. l., interspersed with shorter <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions.</b> During the latter, large volumes of lava can threaten local populations. The Catania Section of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) routinely monitors the volcano with an array of integrated multidisciplinary techniques. During the 2001 <b>flank</b> <b>eruption,</b> researchers obtained the deepest insight yet into the mechanisms that control this fascinating volcano. In particular, by studying ground deformation, seismicity, gravity changes, and geomagnetism, researchers were able to forecast 3 to 4 days in advance the intrusion of a new feeder dike in {{the upper part of the}} volcano and follow the propagation of dike emplacement and fissure opening, as well as estimate the volume of the intrusion. During the eruption, volcanology gas geochemistry and petrology were used to distinguish two different magmas erupting at the same time from both this new feeder dike and the summit feeding system, which has been active since January 2001. Effusion rate measurements and thermal mapping of the flow field provided insight into the maximum length the lava flow could reach from the lower vent, and researchers were able to follow the process of tube formation along this flow. The previous <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> on Etna occurred between 1991 and 1993, when 235 million of lava poured from within the Valle del Bove (VDB) and formed a lava flow field over 8. 5 km long that threatened the town of Zafferana. Since then, eruptive activity at Etna has been restricted to the summit area. A progressive increase in the activity occurred between June 1998 and February 1999, with a succession of 21 paroxysmal episodes from the Southeast Cone (SEC). Then, on February 1999, a fire fountain episode from the SEC indicated the start of the 1999 summit eruption, which produced two lava flow fields. During 2000, there were 66 fire fountain events from the SEC accompanied by small lava flows. Lava flow emission started again from the north base of the SEC in January 2001, and on May 9, 2001, small fire fountaining episodes were observed on the summit and northern flank of the SEC.

40|$|Analysis of the {{historical}} records of Etnas eruptive activity {{for the past three}} centuries shows that, after the large 1669 eruption, a period of about 60 years of low-level activity followed. Starting from 1727, explosive activity (strombolian, lava fountaining and subplinian) at the summit crater increased exponentially to the present day. Since 1763, the frequency of <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> also increased and this value remained high until 1960; afterward it further increased sharply. In fact, the number of summit and <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> between 1961 and 2003 was four times greater than that of the pre- 1960 period. This long-term trend of escalating activity rules out a pattern of cyclic behaviour of the volcano. We propose instead that the 16702003 period most likely characterises a single eruptive cycle which began after the large 1669 eruption and which is still continuing. On the basis of the eruptive style, two distinct types of <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> are recognised: Class A and Class B. Class A eruptions are mostly effusive with associated weak strombolian activity; Class B eruptions are characterised by effusive activity accompanied by intense, long-lasting, strombolian and lava fountaining activity that produces copious tephra fallouts, as during the 2001 and 20022003 eruptions. Over the past three centuries, seven Class B eruptions have taken place with vents located mainly on the south-eastern flank, indicating that this sector of the volcano is a preferential zone for the intrusion of volatile-rich magma rising from the deeper region of the Etna plumbing system...|$|R
40|$|Geological surveys, tephrostratigraphic study, and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age {{determinations}} {{have allowed}} us to chronologically constrain the geological evolution of the lower NW flank of Etna volcano and to reconstruct the eruptive style of the Mt Barca <b>flank</b> <b>eruption.</b> This peripheral sector of the Mt Etna edifice, corresponding to the upper Simeto valley, was invaded by the Ellittico volcano lava flows between 41 and 29 ka ago when the Mt Barca eruption occurred. The vent of this <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> is located at about 15 km away from the summit craters, close {{to the town of}} Bronte. The Mt Barca eruption was characterized by a vigorous explosive activity that produced pyroclastic deposits dispersed eastward and minor effusive activity with the emission of a 1. 1 -km-long lava flow. Explosive activity was characterized by a phreatomagmatic phase followed by a magmatic one. The geological setting of this peripheral sector of the volcano favors the interaction between the rising magma and the shallow groundwater hosted in the volcanic pile resting on the impermeable sedimentary basement. This process produced phreatomagmatic activity in {{the first phase of the}} eruption, forming a pyroclastic fall deposit made of high-density, poorly vesicular scoria lapilli and lithic clasts. Conversely, during the second phase, a typical strombolian fall deposit formed.

40|$|The 1974 western <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> of Mount Etna {{produced}} a rare, nearly aphyric and plagioclase-free trachybasalt {{that could not}} be derived from the central volcano conduits and was more alkaline and more radiogenic than all previous historical lavas. New results for the petrochemistry and volatile content of its products, combined with contemporaneous seismic and volcanological observations, allow us to reinterpret the origin and significance of this event. We show that the eruption was most likely triggered by deep tectonic fracturing that allowed a dike-like intrusion to propagate in 9 days from 11 km depth up to the surface, bypassing the central conduits. Relatively fast, closed system decompression of the volatile-rich magma initially led to lava fountaining and the rapid growth of two pyroclastic cones (Mounts De Fiore), followed by Strombolian activity and the extrusion of viscous lava flows when gas-melt separation developed in the upper portion of the feeding fracture. The 1974 trachybasalt geochemistry indicates its derivation by mixing 25 % of preexisting K-poor magma (best represented by 1763 La Montagnola eruption’s products) and 75 % of a new K-rich feeding magma that was gradually invading Mount Etna’s plumbing system and became directly extruded during two violent <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> in 2001 – 2003. We propose to classify 1974 -type so-called ‘‘eccentric’’ eruptions on Etna as deep dike-fed (DDF) eruptions, as opposed to more common central conduit-fed <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions,</b> in order to highlight their actual origin rather than their topographic location.

The long data sets comprise a satellite- and ground-based time series of effusion rates, {{and the latter}} include field-based effusion rate and degassing data collected May 29 – 31. The satellite-derived effusion rates for January through August reveal four volumetric pulses that are characterized by increasing mean effusion rate values and lead up to the 2001 <b>flank</b> <b>eruption.</b> Peak effusion rates during these 23 – 57 day pulses were 1. 2 m 3 s- 1 in Pulse 1 (1 Jan– 4 Mar), 1. 1 m 3 s- 1 in Pulse 2 (5 Mar– 21 Apr), 4. 2 m 3 s- 1 in Pulse 3 (24 Apr– 18 Jun), 8. 8 m 3 s- 1 in Pulse 4 (23 Jun– 16 Jul), and 22. 2 m 3 s- 1 during the <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> (17 Jul– 9 Aug). Rank-order analysis of the satellite data shows that effusion rate values during the 2001 <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> define a statistically different trend than Etna's persistent activity from Jan 1 to Jul 17. Data prior to the <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> obey a power-law relationship that may define an effusion rate threshold of ~ 3 – 5 m 3 s- 1 for Etna's typical persistent activity. Our short-term data coincide with the satellite-derived peak effusion period of Pulse 3. Degassing (at-vent puff frequency) shows a general increase from May 29 to 31, with hour-long variations in both puff frequency and lava flow velocity (effusion rate). We identify five 3 – 14 h degassing periods that contain 26 shorter (19 – 126 min-long) oscillations. This variation shows some positive correlation with effusion rate measurements {{during the same time}} period. If a relationship between puff frequency and effusion rate is valid, we propose that their short-term variation is the result of changes in the supply rate of magma to the near-vent conduit system. Therefore, these short-term data provide some evidence that the clear weeks- to months-long variation in Etna's effusive activity (January–August 2001) was overprinted by a minutes- to hour-scale oscillation in shallow supply...|$|R
40|$|Most <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{within a}} central {{stratovolcano}} are triggered by lateral draining of magma from its central conduit, and only few eruptions {{appear to be}} independent of the central conduit. In order to better highlight the dynamics of <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> in a central stratovolcano, we review the eruptive history of Etna over the last 100 years. In particular, we {{take into consideration the}} Mount Etna eruption in 2001, which showed both summit activity and a <b>flank</b> <b>eruption</b> interpreted to be independent from the summit system. The eruption started with the emplacement of a ~N-S trending peripheral dike, responsible for the extrusion of 75 % of the total volume of the erupted products. The rest of the magma was extruded through the summit conduit system (SE crater), feeding two radial dikes. The distribution of the seismicity and structures related to the propagation of the peripheral dike and volumetric considerations on the erupted magmas exclude a shallow connection between the summit and the peripheral magmatic systems during the eruption. Even though the summit and the peripheral magmatic systems were independent at shallow depths (< 3 km b. s. l.), petro-chemical data suggest that a common magma rising from depth fed the two systems. This deep connection resulted in the extrusion of residual magma from the summit system and of new magma from the peripheral system. Gravitational stresses predominate at the surface, controlling the emplacement of the dikes radiating from the summit; conversely, regional tectonics, possibly related to N-S trending structures, remains the most likely factor to have controlled at depth the rise of magma feeding the peripheral eruption...|$|R

A constant unrest probability of 100 %, with a magma involvement usually greater than 95 %, was computed throughout the time period analyzed. Eruption probabilities higher than 90 % were estimated {{a few days before the}} onsets of the 2001 and 2002 - 2003 <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions.</b> Values slightly higher than 75 % were observed during the lava fountaining period in June-July 2001. However, the probabilities flattened to around 30 % for the 2004 - 2005 <b>flank</b> <b>eruption.</b> With suitable data, a good depiction of the actual location of the eruptive scenario for the 2001 and 2002 - 2003 events was provided. Conversely, the size of the eruptions was not indicated. 1...|$|R
40|$|Mount Etna {{is an open}} conduit volcano, characterised by {{persistent}} activity, {{consisting of}} degassing and explosive phenomena at summit craters, frequent <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions,</b> and more rarely, eccentric eruptions. All eruption typologies can give rise to lava flows, which represent the greatest hazard by the volcano to the inhabited areas. Historical documents and scientific papers related to the 20 th century effusive activity have been examined in detail, and volcanological parameters have been compiled in a database. The cumulative curve of emitted lava volume highlights the presence of two main eruptive periods: (a) the 1900 – 1971 interval, characterised by a moderate slope of the curve, amounting to 436 · 106 m 3 of lava with average effusion rate of 0. 2 m 3 /s and (b) the 1971 – 1999 period, in which {{a significant increase in}} eruption frequency is associated with a large issued lava volume (767 · 106 m 3) and a higher effusion rate (0. 8 m 3 /s). The collected data have been plotted to highlight different eruptive behaviour as a function of eruptive periods and summit vs. <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions.</b> The latter have been further subdivided into two categories: eruptions characterised by high effusion rates and short duration, and eruptions dominated by low effusion rate, long duration and larger volume of erupted lava. Circular zones around the summit area have been drawn for summit eruptions based on the maximum lava flow length; <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> have been considered by taking into account the eruptive fracture elevation and combining them with lava flow lengths of 4 and 6 km. This work highlights that the greatest lava flow hazard at Etna is on the south and east sectors of the volcano. This should be properly considered in future land-use planning by local authorities...|$|R
40|$|Changes in Coulomb failure stress (ΔCFS) {{induced by}} dike {{propagation}} during two <b>flank</b> <b>eruptions</b> on Mt. Etna (1981 and 2001) are {{calculated for the}} most seismically active faults on the east slope of the volcano (the right-lateral Timpe fault system, oriented NNW-SSE, and the left-lateral Pernicana fault, oriented E-W). Calculations performed using Coulomb 2. 5 software indicate that intrusion of a NNW dike on the NW side of the volcano (1981 eruption) rises ΔCFS on both the Timpe and Pernicana faults. In contrast, intrusion of a N-S dike at high elevation on the south <b>flank</b> (2001 <b>eruption)</b> rises ΔCFS only on Timpe fault System. These results are compatible with the observed pattern of seismicity, but emphasize an extremely heterogeneous state of stress on the east flank of the volcano...|$|R
