They make it to a farmhouse where they and others are besieged by rampant slices of killer bread. One person is smothered to death, leaving behind a corpse strewn with white bread. News reports speculate that an explosion at a bakery is animating all manner of bread. During Catholic Mass in an emergency shelter, the worshippers are attacked by Communion wafers. The group in the farmhouse fortify their defences, using toasters (instead of torches) to frighten off the bread, and barricading {{the doors and windows}} with <b>sandwich</b> <b>bags</b> (instead of wooden planks).

5000|$|At Our Worst is a b-sides/live album {{released}} by the melodic hardcore band Evergreen Terrace. The band wrote this in their CD:"Well here it is. Another album of no new songs. Seems like as things progress for us touring wise, things get worse and worse on {{the time we have}} to do other things, like write a new album! The idea for this album came along to us by another label named Indianola. They wanted to release our demos and whatnot, and we laughed. We {{wanted nothing to do with}} an album like this. In a way we still don't, but hey... money talks and we could really use some new equipment. These live tracks were taken from a show in Jacksonville, FL @ Jack Rabbits November 2003. The unreleased track was originally written for Burned Alive By Time, but for whatever reason didn't make it to the cd. As for the demo songs on here, please be nice to us, they suck. We were in a band for two months when we wrote this. When we first put it out we were selling our demos in <b>sandwich</b> <b>bags,</b> a long way we have come. Anyways... while you guys sit back and listen to this album, we'll be sitting in our log cabin on the lake tahoe writing for our next album. We promise not to disappoint! Regardless, thanks to everyone who supports us by buying these albums to hold them over 'till the next real full length. Cheers, Evergreen Terrace." ...|$|E

Hayes denied the government's motion to dismiss March 26, 2015, stating “it is plausible that a Mint official, with proper authority and in an authorized manner, allowed Harry Lawrence to keep the 1974-D aluminum cent. Drawing reasonable inferences, it is plausible that Harry Lawrence lawfully obtained possession of the aluminum cent, giving Plaintiffs superior claim of title to the aluminum cent.” On March 17, 2016, Lawrence and McConnell surrendered the penny to the U.S. Mint to settle the terms of their lawsuit which was dropped.

5000|$|Marijuana {{is readily}} {{available}} and widely abused in the CNMI; however, {{it is difficult to}} quantify the extent of marijuana abuse {{due to the lack of}} drug abuse statistics and marijuana-related survey data for the CNMI.From 2000 to 2001 law enforcement eradication efforts caused a decrease in local cannabis cultivation, and distributors had to obtain most of their marijuana from sources outside the commonwealth. As a result, prices increased dramatically. A joint (0.5 gram), also known as a stick, of marijuana sold for an average price of $2.50 from 1997 to 1999 when supplies of locally produced marijuana were plentiful. The price of a joint subsequently increased to $20 to $50. In addition, <b>sandwich</b> <b>bags</b> (nickel and dime bags) of marijuana have been replaced by 1-inch-square, resealable bags containing small quantities of marijuana that sell for $20 to $35 each. Tourists typically are charged higher prices for retail quantities of marijuana than are local residents. At the wholesale level in Saipan, marijuana sells for approximately $1,500 per pound.As a result of strong eradication efforts by law enforcement, cannabis cultivation in the CNMI is primarily limited to small quantities intended for personal use. CNMI authorities now focus on undercover operations, controlled purchases, and border interdiction.According to the Department of Public Safety Criminal Investigation Bureau, marijuana is transported to the CNMI by criminal groups that cultivate cannabis in the Philippines and the neighboring island of the Republic of Palau. Filipino criminal groups typically transport marijuana in cargo containers aboard commercial maritime vessels. Criminal groups from Palau generally pay couriers to transport marijuana concealed on their bodies or packed in coolers. Local cultivators in the CNMI also transport small quantities of marijuana from island to island. free of copyright under section 105 ...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of a fingermark contains donor profiling information. Immunolabeling {{is a technique}} {{that can be used}} to retrieve this chemical information from fingermarks. Additionally, immunolabeling can be used to (re) develop fingermarks. To be of interest in the forensic field, the applicability of immunolabeling should be highly diverse. Therefore, in this study we investigated the applicability of one such method: immunolabeling of fingermarks left on non-porous (aluminum foil, stainless steel keys, plastic sheets, different colored garbage bags, <b>sandwich</b> <b>bags,</b> Ziploc bags), semi-porous (tiles, laminated chipboard), and porous surfaces (thermal and copy paper). Successful immunolabeling of specific components in fingermarks was possible on all surfaces tested, except for laminated chipboards and copy paper. Additionally, high quality images could be obtained from the immunolabeled fingermarks. Surprisingly, fingermarks left on thermal paper showed improved visibility when developed with the immunolabeling method. In conclusion, one intrinsically similar immunolabeling method can visualize fingermarks left on non-porous, semi-porous and porous surface...|$|E
30|$|Trapecar and Balazic (2007) {{observed}} {{no significant}} difference in quality of developed prints on dead and live human skin by cyanoacrylate fuming method. However, they suggested the use of Swedish black powder and Ruthenium Tetroxide (RTX) over cyanoacrylate fuming method for developing latent fingermarks on live and dead skin. Midkiff and Codell (1995) observed that thickness, type and consistency of adhesive affect the quality of cyanoacrylate-fumed developed fingermarks. A novel luminescent cyanoacrylate such as lumicyano was used to develop latent fingerprints on glass and a number of semiporous and nonporous surfaces in a single processing step without any further treatment (Prete et al. 2013). One-step fluorescent cyanoacrylate fuming method was used to develop high-quality fluorescent prints {{on a wide range of}} nonporous surfaces including trash bags, <b>sandwich</b> <b>bags,</b> sheet protectors, bubble wrap and textured plastic. Authors observed that one-step fluorescent cyanoacrylate fuming method was more sensitive towards sebaceous prints than eccrine prints due to presence of high concentration of initiators in the former one (Hahn and Ramotowski 2012).|$|E

50|$|Young {{children}} {{appreciate that}} people generally {{think and act}} sensibly when reasons are present, and they can evaluate a claim by assessing {{the quality of the}} reasoning provided. Thus, children create an epistemic profile of a person based {{on the quality of the}} reasons they offer when making a claim. As young as 3 years-old, children understand the difference between weak versus strong reasoning to support a statement. Children are more likely to trust someone when strong support is provided through: reliable testimony (“My teacher told me there’s a book in the bag. I think that there’s a book”), looking (“Before I came here, I looked and saw a ball in the bag. I think there’s a ball in there”), and inference (“It’s a backpack. Backpack holds books. I think there’s a book in there”). On the other hand, desire (“I like crayons. I want there to be crayons in the bag. I think that there are crayons in there”), pretense (“I like to pretend. I’m going to pretend that there’s a <b>sandwich</b> in the <b>bag.</b> I think there’s a sandwich in there”), and guessing (“I don’t know. I’m going to guess that there’s a toy in the bag”) are not viewed as strong support for a claim. Children recognize that the mental states that they and others may hold are not always reliable means for drawing specific conclusions. 3 and 4 year-olds can also choose the more reasonable of two people and continue to seek, as well as, accept new information from the more credible person (the one who had better reasons in the past).|$|R
40|$|How {{many times}} have we all jotted down a list to take with us to the supermarket? Even a simple {{vertical}} column of ordinary household items requires more than we realize. We scan areas {{of the house and}} pull from memory different food stuffs or supplies that need to be replenished or replaced: refrigerator (need milk, butter, juice); cabinets (we’re out of <b>sandwich</b> <b>bags</b> and sponges); canisters (need coffee and tea); laundry room (need detergent and bleach); dinner (… [...] good question). All this information requires a flow of memory, organization, and planning. Most of us do this part of the task spontaneously and routinely. Now we need to create that list on paper. As automatic as it seems, writing simple words like “coffee,” “sandwich, ” and “juice, ” requires a call-up of a sequence of letters and shapes for each word—spelling [...] and an ability to manipulate the pen or pencil in order to encode the letters. During the physical act of jotting down a list, we control several muscle groups to keep the writing tool flowing in a direction— moving vertically, horizontally, and in a circular fashion (rotary movement). Fine motor coordination is key as we stimulate certain muscle groups, inhibit others, and balance, flex, and contract movements. We don’t punctuate the list, write it in a creative way, grab the attention of a reader, or develop a theme and add flourish and detail to our assertions. A list is just a list...|$|E
