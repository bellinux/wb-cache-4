5|$|Following Germany's {{success in}} Europe with the Fall of France in 1940 the United Kingdom {{was unable to}} <b>spare</b> <b>tank</b> {{production}} for Australia, {{and as a result}} a program to produce tanks in Australia to equip forces in the Middle East was initiated. Concern about the likely entry of Japan into the war and the threat it would pose to vital sea lanes, as well as the possibility of an invasion of the Australian mainland, also provided impetus for local manufacture. The Australian tank program developed and produced two tank designs, a cruiser tank called the Sentinel, and the Thunderbolt. The Sentinel was the only tank to be produced in quantity in Australia. The few Sentinels that were built never saw action as Australia's armoured divisions had been equipped by that time with British and American tanks. Due to a lack of experience in tank design a mission was sent to the US to examine the M3 design and a British officer with many years tank design experience was provided by the United Kingdom. The design used existing parts where available from the M3, simplified where necessary to match the machining capacity present in Australia. The hull was cast as a single piece, as was the turret; a technique not used on the hull of any other tanks of the era.|$|E
2500|$|The supply {{situation}} in Kharkov was now catastrophic; artillerymen after firing their last rounds, were abandoning their guns to fight as infantrymen. The army's supply depot had five trainloads of <b>spare</b> <b>tank</b> tracks {{left over from}} [...] "Zitadelle" [...] but very little else. The high consumption of ammunition {{in the last month}} and a half had cut into supplies put aside for the last two weeks of August and {{the first two weeks of}} September; until the turn of the month the army would have to get along with fifty percent of its daily average requirements in artillery & tank ammunition. XI Army Corps now had a combat strength of only 4,000 infantrymen, one man for every ten yards of front. General Erhard Raus explains the intensity of the constant Russian attacks: [...] Wöhler, recognizing the hopelessness of the situation, did not prove anymore resolute, in view of the harsh realities facing the defenders of Kharkov, he knew that the depleted Infantry regiments could not hold their positions without copious artillery support. Two days after taking command of 8th Army, Wöhler also asked Manstein for permission to abandon the city. Regardless of Hitler's demand that the city be held, Wöhler and Manstein agreed that the city could not be defended for long, given the diminishing German strength and the overwhelming size of Soviet reserves.|$|E

The Eastern section (540 miles) was over the Jordanian and Iraqi deserts, uninhabited except for nomadic tribes and with few landmarks. A visible track over this part of the route was laid across the ground by the wheels of an armoured car driven for this purpose, or by a plough pulled by a Fordson tractor, depending upon the nature of the terrain. 26 emergency landing grounds were made in the desert, several of which included <b>spare</b> <b>tanks</b> of fuel.|$|R

50|$|The Invasion of Poland {{had shown}} that the towed sIG 33 guns {{assigned}} to the infantry gun companies of the motorized infantry regiments had difficulties {{keeping up with the}} tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to modify a <b>spare</b> <b>tank</b> chassis to carry it into battle. A sIG 33 was mounted on the chassis of the Panzer I Ausf. B, complete with carriage and wheels, in place of the turret and superstructure. Plates 13 mm thick were used to form a tall, open-topped fighting compartment on the forward part of the hull. This protected little more than the gun and the gunner himself from small arms fire and shell fragments, the loaders being completely exposed. The rearmost section of armor was hinged to ease reloading.|$|E
50|$|The Invasion of Poland {{had shown}} that the sIG 33s {{assigned}} to the infantry gun companies of the motorized infantry regiments had difficulties {{keeping up with the}} tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to use a <b>spare</b> <b>tank</b> chassis to carry it into battle. It was first mounted on a Panzer I chassis and given a lightly armored superstructure. This produced an adequate vehicle, but with a very high center of gravity and an overloaded chassis. As a result, only a few dozen were built. Since the over-loaded Panzer I chassis was too small for the gun, production switched to models using the chassis of larger, more suitable tanks. In 1942, the Panzer II chassis was modified to accept the sIG 33. This version also received better armour protection. Eventually, production switched to {{a modified version of the}} Panzer III and later still to the Panzer 38(t).|$|E
40|$|The {{austenitic}} stainless steel 316 L {{has been compared to}} duplex stainless steels to be able to highlight a choice of material for manufacturing of <b>spare</b> <b>tanks</b> used for cooling water at nuclear power stations on the Swedish west coast. In this report 316 L and the duplex stainless steels 2205, 2304 and LDX 2404 have been compared according to corrosion resistance, strength, manufacturing aspects and prices. The steels arranged by increasing corrosion resistance: 316 L < 2304 < LDX 2404 < 2205. The steels arranged by increasing strength (considering the thickness of the plates needed for construction) : 316 L < 2304 < LDX 2404 and 2205. The steels arranged by increasing price/tank: 2304 < LDX 2404 < 2205 < 316 L. One of the duplex stainless steels is recommended rather than the {{austenitic stainless}} steel 316 L. In terms of price 2304 is preferable to 2205 and LDX 2404. When it comes to corrosion resistance 2205 is superior to 2304 and can sometimes be considered as unnecessary good and therefore not relevant for this application. ...|$|R

50|$|Sanctum was {{inspired}} by the film's co-writer Andrew Wight's experience with a 1988 cave diving expedition in Australia that resulted in 13 cavers becoming trapped in one of the world's largest underwater cave systems in Nullarbor Plain after a freak storm collapsed the entrance. That incident was documented in the film Nullarbor Dreaming. James Cameron served as executive producer for Sanctum. Even though the film's plot takes place in Esa'ala Cave, most of the film was shot in Australia (Gold Coast, Queensland). Sanctum employs 3D photography techniques Cameron developed to film Avatar. All of the underwater sequences took place in a large water tank at the Village Roadshow Studios in Queensland. Real caves were also filmed in South Australia's cave-diving region around Mount Gambier. Stunt diver Agnes Milowka, who appears as a double in the already-released film, drowned in one of these caves on 27 February 2011 when she reportedly ran out of air. In striking similarities to the movie script, she also left her <b>spare</b> <b>tank</b> behind, to force the way through the tight restriction, and it is actually her playing Judes' drowning scene. Universal Studios and Relativity Media paid $12 million for rights to distribute the film in the United States and Canada, and in several foreign countries.|$|E

General Erhard Raus explains the intensity of the constant Russian attacks: [...] "On 20 August the Russians avoided mass groupings of tanks, crossed the brook valley simultaneously in a number of places, and disappeared into the broad cornfields that were located ahead of our lines, ending at the east-west rollbahn several hundred metres in front of our main battle line. Throughout the morning Soviet tanks worked their way forward in the hollows up to the southern edges of the cornfields, then made a mass dash across the road in full sight. [...] "Das Reich"'s Panthers caught the leading waves of T-34's with fierce defensive fire before they could reach our main battle line. Yet wave after wave followed, until Russian tanks flowed across in the protecting hollows and pushed forward into our battle positions. Here a net of anti-tank and flak guns, Hornet 88mm tank destroyers, and Wasp self-propelled 105mm field howitzers trapped the T-34's, split them into small groups, and put large numbers out of action. The final waves were still attempting to force a breakthrough in concentrated masses when the Tigers and StuG III self-propelled assault guns, which represented our mobile reserve s behind the front, attacked the Russian armour and repulsed it with heavy losses. The price paid by the 5th Guards Tank Army for this mass assault amounted to 184 knocked out T-34's. [...] Wöhler, recognizing the hopelessness of the situation, did not prove anymore resolute, in view of the harsh realities facing the defenders of Kharkov, he knew that the depleted Infantry regiments could not hold their positions without copious artillery support.
