5|$|It {{was also}} doubted that fast fighter {{aircraft}} could engage in dogfights. The g-force {{effect on the}} human body also <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the prospect of air-to-air combat between fighters was impractical anyway. The threat they saw related only to the return-fire of the bomber's gunners. Before the war the effectiveness of return, or cross-fire, from bombers had been exaggerated by the Air Staff and Air Ministry.|$|E
5|$|Constant news of Ottoman {{campaigns against}} Bosnia and Morea but not against Albania <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> to Skanderbeg that Mehmed II had been {{considering}} an armistice with Skanderbeg. The latter {{took advantage of}} this lull in the fighting by preparing for his voyage to Italy and by securing his northern frontiers from a possible attack by Skanderbeg's elusive ally in northern Albania, Lekë Dukagjini, who {{had been trying to}} expand his realm by reaching an agreement with the Turks. In order to curb his ambitions, Skanderbeg seized Shat Fortress and presented it as a gift to Venice. Skanderbeg then established an alliance with Venice against Dukagjini, while Dukagjni was strengthening his Turkish alliance. The new pope issued a bull against Dukagjini, giving him fifteen days to break his alliance with the Ottomans and to reconcile with Skanderbeg, or be subject to interdiction; Dukagjini conceded and chose the former option. He then reestablished his alliance with Skanderbeg and Venice and accepted all of its losses.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, {{according}} to Bernard Lewis, {{the volume of}} antisemitic literature published in the Arab world, and the authority of its sponsors, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that classical antisemitism had become {{an essential part of}} Arab intellectual life, considerably more than in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century France, and to a degree that has been compared to Nazi Germany. The rise of political Islam during the 1980s and afterwards provided a new mutation of Islamic antisemitism, giving the hatred of Jews a religious component.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{information}} in Sims v. State <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the possibility of causing great bodily harm, Hill filed, on December 15, 2005, a petition for postconviction relief {{in the state of}} Florida and requested an evidentiary hearing to investigate whether or not the state’s lethal injection death penalty did, in fact, cause bodily harm. The Circuit Court for Escambia County denied Hill’s motions for postconviction relief and for an evidentiary hearing. Hill then appealed to the Florida Supreme Court on January 3, 2006. On January 17, 2006, Florida’s High Court affirmed.|$|E
25|$|The global license proved {{difficult}} to handle for the government.

25|$|Although not {{initially}} agreeing {{to send troops}} to Borneo, in April 1964 the Australian Government agreed to allow its forces {{to be used to}} protect peninsular Malaysia from attack, whilst also announcing that it would dispatch an engineer construction squadron to Borneo, while also providing two naval mine-sweepers, four helicopters and other support in addition to units already stationed in Malaysia. Meanwhile, in June the 111th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery deployed to Butterworth in northern Malaysia to defend the airfield in case the Indonesians conducted an unexpected air raid. The 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca, was subsequently used to mop up two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964. These incursions <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a serious escalation in the conflict was imminent.|$|E

25|$|Four {{accounts}} of Berti's experiment exist, but a simple model of his experiment consisted of filling with water a long tube that had both ends plugged, then standing the tube in a basin already full of water. The bottom {{end of the}} tube was opened, and water that had been inside of it poured out into the basin. However, {{only part of the}} water in the tube flowed out, and the level of the water inside the tube stayed at an exact level, which happened to be 10.3m, the same height Baliani and Galileo had observed that was limited by the siphon. What was most important about this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to fill it up. This <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the possibility of a vacuum existing in the space above the water.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether Douds remains good case law. The Supreme Court {{distinguished}} the case but declined to overrule Douds in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951). In 1965, in United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Supreme Court essentially overturned Douds by holding that the Taft-Hartley Act's oath constituted a bill of attainder, but did not formally do so. Two years later, in United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967), the Court specifically declined to apply a balancing test to a law prohibiting members of the Communist Party from holding jobs in the defense industry. Although the law was based on the same rationale as Taft-Hartley (that membership in the Communist Party was a sure indication of future action), the Supreme Court said this was too heavy an infringement on the individual's First Amendment rights. Instead, the Court <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a new, two-part test: Whether the governmental interests advanced are valid, and whether the statute is narrowly drawn to infringe on First Amendment rights in the most narrow way. The Court returned to the balancing test in Brandenberg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), but this time concluded that prohibiting mere advocacy of violence was too heavy a burden on the First Amendment. Such advocacy must produce imminent action for the speech to be punishable, the Court held.|$|E

Denning apologised for his remarks on 21May and handed a letter to the Lord Chancellor detailing his resignation, effective as of 29September.|$|E
500|$|The volcano erupted rather {{abruptly}} in 1902, spewing out ash from January 18 to June 21 in the year. A {{local newspaper}} stated, [...] "Word {{has just been}} received that Redoubt, one of the volcanoes at Cook's Inlet had an eruption on January 18, and the country for [...] around was covered with ashes and lava. The news comes from Sunrise, but nothing definite has been ascertained as to whether any damage was done, for no boats have as yet been {{in the neighborhood of}} the volcano." [...] There were many other news reports on the eruption, one describing the eruption as [...] "a terrific earthquake which burst the mountain asunder leaving a large gap," [...] which could possibly suggest the crack formation in the volcano's crater, however, it is unlikely. Supposedly, the volcano was ejecting [...] "flames" [...] from its caldera, and the eruption terrified natives in the area.

500|$|In another {{effort to}} inform the public of the Army's {{personnel}} needs and improve the way the AGF was perceived, on Armistice Day in November 1942, McNair delivered a radio address over the Blue Network. [...] In his remarks, titled [...] "The Struggle is for Survival", McNair described the fighting capability and ruthless attitude of soldiers in the Japanese and German armies, and stated that only similar qualities in American ground troops – by implication, meaning not [...] "the more genteel forms of warfare" [...] practiced by the AAF and ASF – would see the Allies through to victory. [...] The public response to McNair's remarks was largely favorable, though he did receive some criticism for extreme language that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> an unfeeling attitude towards death and destruction. [...] More importantly, McNair's radio address did little to improve recruiting into the Army Ground Forces; the public may have developed a better appreciation for infantry, armor, and artillery, but volunteers and draftees continued to be attracted to the AAF and ASF, and the AAF and ASF continued to lobby for the bulk of new service members in the high quality category to be assigned to them.|$|E

500|$|Kydd {{graduated}} from university {{at the end}} of 2004, but had significant difficulty finding employment as her netball commitments scared off prospective employers. She also became engaged to Garth Kydd, a member of the Australian men's netball team, whom she married in April 2006. Kydd was widely expected to again feature among the league's best, however, she was disappointing against South Africa in February. She also struggled in the opening games of the national league season, a result largely attributed to nerves associated with the captaincy. She began to recover her form, but in May broke her finger. She continued to play but the injury severely inhibited her performance for four weeks. In June she was dropped from the national team {{for the first time in}} two years as a result of poor form and injury, with national coach Norma Plummer stating that she was [...] "very disappointed that [...] let it drop" [...] and that she [...] "never thought she would have to [...] ". The ageing Southby-Halbish was brought in to replace her and Kydd admitted that her accuracy had been well below ideal levels. She improved markedly over the following two rounds, but on 23 July suffered major concussion after being hit hard in the head during a match against the Adelaide Thunderbirds, which required her to be taken to hospital. A brilliant performance against the Perth Orioles the following week <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a quick recovery, however she was dogged with complications for the remainder of the season.|$|E
500|$|At several times, {{the film}} hints that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei {{are more than}} best friends, and are in fact engaged in a lesbian relationship, so when the film ends with Lily {{choosing}} Harvey as her lover, this serves as a testament to his manly Western sex appeal, which [...] "redeems" [...] her from {{her life as a}} prostitute. At the same time that Shanghai Express embraces Yellow Peril stereotypes through the character of Chang, it also to some extent undermines them through the character of Hui, who is shown crying inconsolably after being raped by Chang, which gives her a certain humanity and allows the audience to sympathize with her. Hui is a courtesan who is looked down upon by all Western characters except for her best friend Lily on the account of her race and profession, but she is shown as possessing dignity and a willingness to stand up for herself. Several scenes <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Shanghai Lily and Hui are more attracted to one another then either are to Captain Harvey as the two women exchange longing glances more than once, through this may be suggesting Hui's sexuality is not quite normal (most people in 1932 would considered bi-sexuality to be unnatural). At one point, Hui wears a tight cheongsam dress, which clearly reveal her erect nipples, which definitely captures Lily's interest [...] The same criticism might be applied to Lily, but the film ends with Lily embracing heterosexual love by kissing Harvey while Hui walks off into the distance alone, sadder as a result of losing her best friend to Harvey and because she was raped, but otherwise unchanged. Finally, it is Hui who saves Harvey in the climax from being blinded/raped/castrated at the hands of Chang by killing Chang; Hui explains the killing as her way of regaining the self-respect that Chang had taken away from her.|$|E
