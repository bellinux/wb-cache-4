In terms of fauna, animal prey which was previously considered an inefficient use of resources (particularly small, fast mammals or fish) could now also be worthwhile.

30|$|This study proposes two {{competitive}} equilibrium models: (1) {{to satisfy}} each user's physical power demand and (2) to balance all individual utilities {{in a competitive}} communication <b>spectrum</b> <b>economy.</b> Theoretically, we prove that a competitive equilibrium with physical power demand requirements always exists for the communication spectrum market with Shannon utility if the total power demand is {{less than or equal}} to the available total power supply. A competitive equilibrium with identical individual utilities also exists for the communication spectrum market with Shannon utility. Computationally, we use two approaches to find out the budget allocation where the competitive equilibrium satisfies power demand or balances individual utilities: one solves the characteristic equilibrium conditions and the other employs an iterative tatonament-type method by adjusting budget to each user. The iterative method performs significantly faster and can efficiently solve large-scale problems, which makes the competitive economy equilibrium model applicable in real-time spectrum management.|$|E
40|$|Batadomba-lena, a rockshelter in the {{rainforest}} of southwestern Sri Lanka, has yielded {{some of the}} earliest evidence of Homo sapiens in South Asia. H. sapiens foragers were present at Batadomba-lena from ca. 36, 000 cal BP to the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene. Human occupation was sporadic before the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Batadomba-lena's Late Pleistocene inhabitants foraged for a broad spectrum of plant and mainly arboreal animal resources (monkeys, squirrels and abundant rainforest snails), derived from a landscape that retained equatorial rainforest cover through periods of pronounced regional aridity during the LGM. Juxtaposed hearths, palaeofloors with habitation debris, postholes, excavated pits, and animal and plant remains, including abundant Canarium nutshells, reflect intensive habitation of the rockshelter in times of monsoon intensification and biome reorganisation after ca. 16, 000 cal BP. This period corresponds with further broadening of the economic spectrum, evidenced though increased contribution of squirrels, freshwater snails and Canarium nuts in the diet of the rockshelter occupants. Microliths are more abundant and morphologically diverse in the earliest, pre-LGM layer and decline markedly during intensified rockshelter use on the wane of the LGM. We propose that changing toolkits and subsistence base reflect changing foraging practices, from shorter-lived visits of highly mobile foraging bands in the period before the LGM, to intensified use of Batadomba-lena and intense foraging for diverse resources around the site during and, especially, following the LGM. Traces of ochre, marine shell beads and other objects from an 80 km-distant shore, and, possibly burials reflect symbolic practices from the outset of human presence at the rockshelter. Evidence for differentiated use of space (individual hearths, possible habitation structures) is present in LGM and terminal Pleistocene layers. The record of Batadomba-lena demonstrates that Late Pleistocene pathways to (aspects of) behavioural ‘modernity' (composite tools, practice of symbolism and ritual, broad <b>spectrum</b> <b>economy)</b> were diverse and ecologically contingent...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} work and {{considerations}} necessary {{for the design of}} VHF mobile radio systems, and is directed particularly at the requirements of the emergency services of the United Kingdom. It was occasioned by an international regulatory decision to re-allocate part of their existing operating frequencies. This work provides both a structure for such a design, and a record of events. It considers the various elements of design, initiallv from a theoretical base which is developed to the extent where practical trials and external constraints overtake the theoretical analysis. The constraints can take the form of compatibility with the eXisting system, cost. timescale. and political considerations. The concept of a design flow chart is shown to lead to many circular arguments of the chicken-and-eg~ variety {{to the extent that the}} resultant diagram is termed in interaction diagram since its main function is to show how the design elements interface with each other. It consists of many feed-back loops; and design completion is achieved when a traverse of all paths of the interaction diaram can be made without meeting discontinuities at the interfaces. The topic of area coverage is examined in depth and the multiple transmitter common channel (Quasi synchronous) mode is shown to be efficient from both the time and the <b>spectrum</b> <b>economy</b> viewpoints. There are benefits also from operational considerations. The section shows that a reuse factor of 3 should be practical, which is of interest to mobile radio users in general. and cellular radio telephony systems in particular. The choice of type of modulation is quickly shown to lie between FM, AM and SSB. All three are analysed from single station and quasi synchronous aspects: the theoretical predictions of the superiority of AM, for the system under study, is confirmed by subjective trials from which design parameter limits are obtained. Examination of equipment hardware. mobile and base station, shows that system design aspects are severely constrained by intermodulation products due to passive site non linearities. Measurements indicate that these will be troublesome up to at least the 11 th order. A frequency assignment plan covering mobile and fixed services for the country is derived and the dominating influence of the intermods is shown to result in a workable, but unconventional version...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a fundamental}} {{issue in the}} theory of economic organization: the optimal level of market competition. Answers in neoclassical and new institutional economics are identified and critiqued. The analysis shows that selective assumptions in both fields produce distinctly market-favoring and "more competition is better than less" conclusions. The paper generalizes these assumptions and demonstrates organization-favoring and "less competition is better" positions are equally plausible. The paper also argues that part of the market-favoring bias in these fields stems from failure to distinguish between conditions of market failure and organizational success. Given these problems in extant theory, this paper develops an alternative institutional theory of economic organization, drawing principally on ideas of Walton Hamilton and John Commons. This proposed alternative shows that the optimal level of competition occurs at an intermediate level in the competition/cooperation <b>spectrum</b> (a mixed <b>economy)</b> and varies with five key determinants of the economic order.

40|$|The (post) {{modern economy}} finds itself {{undoubtedly}} {{in the center}} of a large scale, deeply contradictory and uncertain current transformation of the world. Together with the (post) modern technologies, it composes the dominant core of the globalizing processes, often referred to as globalization. The key features and especially the accumulated consequences of these processes pose a challenge for scientific and theoretical thought in the form of essential questions and dilemmas which are in the last instance tied to the impact of globalization on the quality and meaning of human life. This problem relates as much to individuals as it does to different social groups and human communities, that is to the entire humanity as such. This paper attempts to problematic these contradictory relationships between global corporative economy as an instrumental value and the human liberty as a substantive that is the highest value in itself (summum bonum), which gives meaning and dignity to human life. Therefore, if economy in one form or another covers most of human practical activity, then it is certain that it can have a decisive impact on the most fundamental value of human life, that is the value of freedom (individual, general; internal and external). Of course, the <b>spectrum</b> of <b>economy</b> can act either way - as an encouragement or as often happens, as a deterrent to expansion of human freedom. This paper aims to briefly indicate some causes, characteristics and consequences of global economic processes which, as it seems paradoxically, contribute more to narrowing than to widening room for human liberty, or they simply generate proliferation of "hedonism of non-freedom". Is this another case of "surplus of knowledge" and "deficit of wisdom" that so strongly characterizes our time or something else?...|$|R
40|$|The Australian {{manufacturing}} industry is in crisis. In {{the last decade}} manufacturing employment levels have dec l ined substantially, production has stagnated, and thousands of companies have been taken over or ceased operations. The relative de c l in e o f the im po r tan ce o f the {{manufacturing industry}}, however, has been symptomatic of the profound process of structural change that is occurring in the Australian economy and society, a process which will if it remains unchecked {{by the forces of}} labor inevitably lead to the further integration of Australia into a world system over which national control is very difficult. This process of structural change affecting the manufacturing industry is the inevitable result of a variety of factors, including the gradual liberalisation of trade, technological change, and changes in patterns of demand due to factors such as demographic influences.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{studying}} {{the effect of}} financial development and shocks on aggregate growth volatility will not be informative because they affect growth volatility through its different components. Volatility declines either a consequence {{of a change in}} the nature of shocks or a change in how the economy reacts to shocks. If two economies differ only in terms of volatility of shocks experienced, the GDP growth <b>spectrum</b> of one <b>economy</b> will lie proportionately below that of another at all frequency ranges so that both business cycle and long-run variances will be lower. Conversely, if change in volatility is due to propagation mechanism such as financial development, a country having developed financial markets will have disproportionately lower variance at the business cycle than at other frequencies relative to that of a country having less developed financial markets. Therefore, the variance at only the business cycle frequency range will be influenced by financial development. The novelty of this paper is that different components of growth volatility are extracted using spectral method. Empirical evidence provides qualified support for both hypotheses. Higher private credit, which is used as proxy of financial development, dampens business cycle volatility but not the long-run volatility. Shocks, as measured by changes in the terms of trade, affect both business cycle and long-run volatility negatively. These results are robust to alternative market-based measure of financial development, and corrections for reverse causality. These results have important implications for growth theory as they shed lights on the factors causing permanent and transitory deviations from the steady state. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a lack}} of data on {{comparative}} {{anatomy of}} the assimilatory organs of the enigmatic carnivorous Nepenthes species; the linkages between their leaf tissue anatomy and physico-chemical properties are also rarely considered. We examined the anatomy of the leaf (lamina) and its conjoint pitcher in five Nepenthes species (Nepenthes ampullaria, N. bicalcarata, N. gracilis, N. hemsleyana and N. rafflesiana). A Nepenthes leaf displays the usual cuticle–epidermis–hypodermis–palisade–spongy structure with ample stomata distribution for gas exchange. The conjoint pitcher has similar anatomy but lacks a palisade mesophyll layer, and its inner epidermal wall is endowed with digestive glands of three cell layers. A higher level of variation exists in the anatomy of the pitcher relative to the leaf. Both stomata and digestive glands, being similar in origin, display the usual negative log–log relationship between size and density. Across species, the mean size but not density of the glands varied across three readily identified zones of the digestive section of the pitcher. Leaf and pitcher thicknesses correlated (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) with stomatal and digestive-gland sizes. Organ longevity, lignin content and construction cost negatively correlated with lower cuticle, epidermal and mesophyll dimensions, and positively so with stomatal and digestive-gland densities. In contrast, major nutrients of N, P, K, and total ash had minimal influence on anatomical size dimensions. It is likely that in Nepenthes leaf and its conjoint pitcher, both the protective and physiological tissues drive anatomical differences and organ functions. The observed bivariate relationships between the anatomical traits also fit into the worldwide leaf <b>economy</b> <b>spectrum...</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{over three}} centuries {{and across the}} globe, lottery-linked savings (LLS) {{programs}} have offered individuals the opportunity to save, and in lieu of paying traditional interest, have given savers periodic chances to win money or prizes. Despite their long history, LLS programs are relatively unstudied by scholars. In this paper, I detail an LLS program that the UK government has offered continuously since 1956, the UK Premium Bond (PB) program. PBs guarantee holders risk-free return of nominal principal. In aggregate, they pay a market-related return, distributed to holders each month by a lottery like mechanism. Premium bonds are popular savings vehicles in the UK. Over £ 31. 1 billion of PBs were outstanding as of March 2006, and public reports suggest that they were held by between 22 percent and 40 percent of UK citizens. The 60. 2 million residents of the UK had £ 517 invested in PBs per capita. If held in the banking sector, PB holdings would have accounted for 3. 9 percent of household sterling deposits in UK financial institutions. LLS programs, such as PBs, are fascinating {{not just because of}} their size, but because of their appeal to nonsavers, especially low-income families. Mauro Guillén and Adrian Tschoegl (2002, reviewing LLS programs in Latin America, concluded: “The bankers we spoke with believe that [LLS] are especially successful with low income depositors, and in cases where {{there are lots of people}} outside the banking system. ” In South Africa, a new LLS program raised over 1. 2 billion rand and enrolled 750, 000 participants across a wide <b>spectrum</b> of the <b>economy</b> in two years. In the United Kingdom, while PBs are held by about the same fraction of the population holding stocks, PBs have a stronger appeal to lower-income British households. PBs are held by a larger fraction of British households than are stocks and shares for all households, except those earning over £ 52, 000 annually (Department for Work and Pensions 2007). Are PB holders saving, gambling, or engaging in both activities? This question is not just academic, because national laws and regulations in many countries bar private LLS programs on the basis that they are prohibited gambling activities. For example, in South Africa, the government has tried to shut down the popular LLS program mentioned above; in the United States, these programs would violate state lottery laws and federal banking regulations. In this paper, I analyze the time series of net sales of the PB program and conclude that the program appears to be a hybrid of gambling and savings, but with a clear savings element...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{cultural}} economy of film distribution {{set against the}} backdrop of Philippine independent cinema. Considered as the business centre of filmmaking, film distribution is typically studied from an economic perspective and traditionally falls outside the remit of film studies. However, the role that economics play in filmmaking cannot be regarded as an exclusive object or subject in the field of business and economics and not of the arts, since film is both a cultural good and economic commodity. As such, this thesis offers a more balanced viewpoint by taking on a humanities perspective in analysing and understanding the complex interplay of culture and economics as applied to Philippine cinema. The project also provides an Asian context to a generally western-dominated approach to the study of film distribution and thereby contributes to the (now) growing literature on distribution studies situated in the larger area of film studies. This thesis employs in-depth interview and case study analysis in addressing the central issue of how the independent sector struggles to access the various film distribution platforms in an attempt to sustain itself. The first chapter positions my research in the field, surveys existing scholarship on independent cinema and film distribution, and sets up the theoretical grounding of this thesis on the cultural economy framework. The second chapter fleshes out the notion of independence in filmmaking and contextualises the study by outlining the historical development of Philippine independent cinema. The third chapter analyses the interaction between mainstream and independent cinema and the current shifting movements happening between the two sectors. The next four chapters examine the film distribution and exhibition practices in the Philippines and how these affect the relationship of the mainstream and independent sectors and address the sustainability issue of the independents. Chapter Four lays out the conceptual framework of film distribution and exhibition as intermediary spaces and maps out a historical landscape of film distribution and exhibition in the Philippines. This is followed by an overview of the film distribution <b>economy</b> <b>spectrum,</b> namely, formal, semi-formal, and informal. Chapter Five explores the formality of the traditional platforms of theatrical and non-theatrical distribution method, while Chapter Six discusses the formality of the emerging distribution and exhibition platforms that utilise new media technologies. Both chapters present the challenges that independent filmmakers face in passing through the layers of gatekeepers in order to bring the film to its audience. Chapter Seven sets out a clearer definition of the semi-formal distribution economy and cites different self-distribution methods to illustrate and support my claim. This chapter also looks into the informal distribution method of piracy and its constructive effects on independent filmmaking. It also explains how technology is changing the role of the audience from being a passive consumer to an active producer to a dynamic distributor. Lastly, Chapter Eight probes into the identity of the Philippine film industry {{and the role of the}} state, their implications on cultural or film policy development, and how these elements impact the overall state of Philippine cinema...|$|R
