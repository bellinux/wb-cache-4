40|$|The main {{signature}} for anti-neutrino detection in reactor and geo-neutrino experiments {{based on}} scintillators {{is provided by}} the space-time coincidence of positron and neutron produced in the Inverse Beta Decay reaction. Such a signature strongly suppresses backgrounds and allows for measurements performed underground with a relatively high signal-to-background ratio. In an aboveground environment, however, the twofold coincidence technique is not sufficient to efficiently reject the high background rate induced by cosmogenic events. Enhancing the positron-neutron twofold coincidence efficiency has the potential to pave the way future aboveground detectors for reactor monitoring.

40|$|A {{series of}} triple crystal {{phosphor}} <b>sandwich</b> <b>detectors</b> {{have been developed}} and constructed for testing at the University of Missouri-Columbia [1 - 7]. These detectors can simultaneously measure alpha, beta, and gamma radiation and utilize digital pulse shape discrimination to identify and separate radiation events coming {{from each of the}} separate phosphors. The research reported here uses Monte Carlo [8] software analysis to determine operating parameters for this detector system and optimizes its design for measuring trace amounts of alpha, beta and gamma-ray activity in effluent streams from nuclear waste cleanup processes. The previously designed, fabricated and tested phoswich detector [5] consisted of three scintillators placed {{on top of each other}} with a common diameter of 5. 08 cm and viewed with a single photomultiplier tube. The scintillators (ZnS- 0. 00376 cm, CaF{sub 2 }- 0. 254 cm and NaI- 2. 54 cm) interact preferentially with alpha, beta and gamma-ray radiation, respectively. This design allows preferential, but not exclusive, interaction of various radiations with specific layers. Taking into account and correcting for events that can occur in the ''wrong'' phosphor, this system was experimentally shown to have a 99 % accuracy for properly identifying radiation coming from a mixed alpha/beta/gamma-ray source. In an attempt to better understand this system and provide design guidance for a detector system to be used in monitoring effluents from nuclear waste treatment facilities, this detector was modeled using MCNP [8]. This analysis [9] indicated that the thin ZnS layer adequately stops alpha particle energy, but greatly reduces beta detection efficiency to essentially zero at beta E{sub max} energies below 300 keV. The CaF{sub 2 } layer, designed to keep any beta particle energy from entering the NaI detector results in an incorrect gamma-ray response that is approximately 23 % of the NaI's response and is variable with energy. High energy beta events in the CaF{sub 2 } can lead to Bremsstrahlung radiation being detected in the NaI. These errors must be corrected by system software...|$|R

The standard KOPIO beamline was assumed. The KOPIO detector consists of photon and charged particle systems covering 4 π sr solid angles. The photon systems not only detect photons from the decay of interest (the “signal”) but also act as a veto system to suppress background with additional photons in particular from the decay K → 2 π 0.

Since the telescope could not be aimed, the spacecraft was set in a slow spin to scan the celestial sphere. Due to a higher than planned orbit that carried the spacecraft into the detector-jamming radiation of the Van Allen belt, and an early failure of the on-board tape recorder, only 141 hours of useful observing time could be culled from about 7 months during which the instrument operated. During this time thirty-one [...] "gamma-ray signature" [...] events were recorded when the telescope was pointing in directions well away from the Earth's atmosphere, which is a relatively bright source of gamma rays produced in interactions of ordinary cosmic ray protons with air atoms. The celestial distribution of the thirty-one arrival directions showed no statistically significant correlation with the direction of any potential cosmic source. Lacking such a correlation, the identification of the cause of the thirty-one events as gamma rays of cosmic origin could not be established. The results of the experiment were therefore reported as upper limits that were significantly lower than the limits obtained from previous balloon-borne experiments.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of ultra low-background gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} has been installed in the underground laboratory HADES in Belgium located {{at a depth of}} 500 m water equivalent. The spectrometer is composed of two coaxial HPGe-detectors of about 1. 9 kg each. The lower detector has the typical U-shaped arm while the top detector's arm is inverted to make the two detectors' windows face each other. The solid angle is effectively doubled for small samples and close to 3. 2 p. The muon fluence rate in HADES is 0. 09 s- 1 m- 2, which is about 5000 times lower than at the surface (40 m above sea level). The detailed muon spectrum is measured with an active muon shield comprising two plastic scintillators stacked on top of the lead shield. The plastic scintillators are 2. 5 cm thick and with an area of 0. 8 × 0. 8 m 2. The scintillators are connected in coincidence to exclude environmental gamma- and X-rays. All data is stored in list mode, which is suitable for offline analysis of time-interval distributions, coincidences and subsequent background reduction. A completely {{new type of}} lead shield is used around the HPGe-detectors. The outer part of the shield is made of 145 mm low-background lead (20 Bq/kg) while the inner 40 mm is made of ultra low-background lead (2. 5 Bq/kg), which in turn is lined on the inside with 35 mm of electrolytic copper.

One direction of the telescopes is covered in a thin lexan foil, ~1500 Å of aluminum evaporated on each side to completely eliminate sunlight, (SST-Foil) where the thickness was chosen to stop protons up to the energy of electrons (~400 keV). Electrons are essentially unaffected by the foil. On the opposite side (SST-Open), a common broom magnet is used to refuse electrons below ~400 keV from entering but leaves the ions essentially unaffected. Thus, if no higher energy particles penetrate the detector walls, the SST-Foil should only measure electrons and the SST-Open only ions. Each double-ended telescope has two 36° x 20° FWHM FOV, thus each end of the five telescopes can cover a 180° x 20° piece of space. Telescope 6 views the same angle to spin axis as telescope 2, but both ends of telescope 2 have a drilled tantalum cover to reduce the geometric factor by a factor of 10 to measure the most intense fluxes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 A two-channel data {{acquisition}} system for simultaneous detection and discrimination of beta particles and gamma rays has been developed. Each channel measures and analyzes the input pulses resulting from the absorption of radiation in the layers of the detector. The detector is a triple-layer phoswich (phosphor <b>sandwich)</b> scintillation <b>detector</b> followed by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The PMT amplifies the photons and converts them into an electric signal. The signal is digitized {{and sent to the}} host computer for further processing. Two new digital algorithms based on Fuzzy Logic and on the Continuous Wavelet Transform have been developed and are discussed in this thesis. In the first method, a de-noising algorithm based on the Wavelet Transform is implemented to reduce the effect of noise introduced by the analog channel and by the photomultiplier tube. Three new timing features are extracted and given as input to a fuzzy interface system. The main goal of fuzziness in a data set is to reduce the system complexity and to provide a model that allows for approximate results. Compared to the method which was originally implemented for this detector, the fuzzy algorithm shows a better performance in separating beta and gamma spectra, especially at high energies. Also, absorption in multiple layers is detected more efficiently. The second algorithm is based on the Continuous Wavelet Transform. The novelty of this method consists in using scale-domain features. Since the output pulse shape of the photomultiplier tube is a non-stationary signal, conventional Fourier methods are not efficient for analyzing these signals and most of the existing pulse shape discrimination methods use time-domain features. Therefore, a time-frequency space is better suited to analyze these non-stationary signals. This method shows better performance over existing time-domain methods in terms of robustness to noise and reliability. The simultaneous detection of beta particles and gamma rays has several applications (for instance detection of underground nuclear explosions). The methods presented in this thesis could also be used in alpha/beta/neutron/gamma discrimination systems for cancer diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
