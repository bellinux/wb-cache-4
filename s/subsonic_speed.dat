5|$|The {{switch from}} high-altitude to low-altitude flight {{profiles}} severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned {{to provide the}} desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B-70 to <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed</b> while dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed</b> than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed.</b> The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E
25|$|The AMX {{is capable}} of {{operating}} at high <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed</b> and low altitude, by day or night, and if necessary, from bases with poorly equipped or damaged runways. It possesses a low infrared signature and a reduced radar cross-section to help prevent detection, while low vulnerability of structure and systems aid survivability and a complement of integrated electronic countermeasures (ECM), air-to-air missiles and nose-mounted guns provide self-defence capabilities.|$|E

25|$|These shocks appear {{when the}} flow over a {{transonic}} body is decelerated to <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
25|$|In December 2004, Voyager 1 {{crossed the}} {{termination}} shock, where {{the solar wind}} is slowed to <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed,</b> and entered the heliosheath, where the solar wind is compressed and made turbulent due to interactions with the interstellar medium. On December 10, 2007, Voyager 2 also reached the termination shock, about 1 billion miles closer to the Sun than from where Voyager 1 first crossed it, indicating that the Solar System is asymmetrical.|$|E
25|$|Although {{radar beam}} riding {{guidance}} was planned to solve this, the <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed</b> of the weapon was also considered to be insufficient to avoid obsolescence; accordingly, the AAM-A-1's production program was terminated late in 1949, the Hughes Falcon being selected for development as the Air Force's standard intercept missile instead. The test program {{was considered to be}} successful despite this, as a considerable amount of knowledge was gained that benefited later programs.|$|E
25|$|To {{produce a}} shock wave, {{an object in}} a given medium (such as air or water) must travel faster than the local speed of sound. In {{the case of an}} {{aircraft}} travelling at high <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed,</b> regions of air around the aircraft may be travelling at exactly the speed of sound, so that the sound waves leaving the aircraft pile up on one another, similar to a traffic jam on a motorway. When a shock wave forms, the local air pressure increases and then spreads out sideways. Because of this amplification effect, a shock wave can be very intense, more like an explosion when heard at a distance (not coincidentally, since explosions create shock waves).|$|E
50|$|The {{propeller}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} efficient sources of thrust available and is common on subsonic aeroplanes and airships. Sometimes it is enclosed in the form of a ducted fan. At higher <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds</b> and at high altitudes, such as attained by most airliners, the high-bypass turbofan becomes necessary. Pure jets such as the turbojet and ramjet are inefficient at <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds</b> and not often used.|$|R
50|$|Incompressible flow occurs {{where the}} air simply moves to avoid objects, {{typically}} at <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds</b> below that of sound (Mach 1).|$|R
50|$|Ramjets are {{the most}} basic type of ram powered jet engines. They consist of three sections; an inlet to {{compress}} incoming air, a combustor to inject and combust fuel, and a nozzle to expel the hot gases and produce thrust. Ramjets require a relatively high speed to efficiently compress the incoming air, so ramjets cannot operate at a standstill and they are most efficient at supersonic speeds. A key trait of ramjet engines is that combustion is done at <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds.</b> The supersonic incoming air is dramatically slowed through the inlet, where it is then combusted at the much slower, <b>subsonic,</b> <b>speeds.</b> The faster the incoming air is, however, the less efficient it becomes to slow it to <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds.</b> Therefore, ramjet engines are limited to approximately Mach 5.|$|R
25|$|By {{the start}} of VIM, Voyager 1 was at a {{distance}} of 40 AU from the Earth while Voyager 2 was at 31 AU. VIM is broken down into three distinct phases: termination shock, heliosheath exploration, interstellar exploration phase. The spacecraft began VIM in an environment controlled by the Sun's magnetic field with the plasma particles being dominated by those contained in the expanding supersonic solar wind. This is the characteristic environment of the termination shock phase. At some distance from the Sun, the supersonic solar wind will be held back from further expansion by the interstellar wind. The first feature encountered by a spacecraft {{as a result of this}} interstellar wind/solar wind interaction was the termination shock where the solar wind slows from supersonic to <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed</b> and large changes in plasma flow direction and magnetic field orientation occur.|$|E
500|$|Since the A-10 flies low to {{the ground}} and at <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed,</b> {{aircraft}} camouflage is important to make the aircraft more difficult to see. Many different types of paint schemes have been tried. These have included a [...] "peanut scheme" [...] of sand, yellow and field drab; black and white colors for winter operations and a tan, green and brown mixed pattern. Many A-10s also featured a false canopy painted in dark gray {{on the underside of the}} aircraft, just behind the gun. This form of automimicry is an attempt to confuse the enemy as to aircraft attitude and maneuver direction. Many A-10s feature nose art, such as shark mouth or warthog head features.|$|E
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with established NORAD procedures, the F-16s were initially directed to head northeast to avoid {{some of the}} most heavily traveled commercial airline routes rather than to fly directly to the Washington, DC, area. Major Dean Eckmann and Major Brad Derrig, plus Captain Craig Borgstrom of the 119th Fighter Wing were directed to fly at maximum <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed,</b> 660 miles per hour. At about 40 miles away, they saw the billowing smoke of American Airlines Flight 77, which had crashed into the Pentagon at 9:43am. [...] As the North Dakota Air Guardsmen neared Washington, DC, Major Eckmann, the flight lead, set up a patrol over the nation's capital with the help of air traffic controllers at the Northeast Air Defense Sector.|$|E

2500|$|The Air Force and the Navy {{could agree}} only on swing-wing, two-seat, {{twin-engine}} design features. The Air Force wanted a tandem-seat aircraft for low-level penetration ground-attack, while the Navy wanted a shorter, high altitude interceptor with side-by-side seating {{to allow the}} pilot and radar operator to share the radar display. Also, the Air Force wanted the aircraft designed for 7.33g with Mach2.5 speed at altitude and Mach1.2 speed at low level with an approximate length of [...] The Navy had less strenuous requirements of 6g with Mach2 speed at altitude and high <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed</b> (approx.

2500|$|The B-58 set 19 world speed records, {{including}} coast-to-coast records, {{and one for}} {{the longest}} supersonic flight in history. In 1963, it flew from Tokyo to London (via Alaska), a distance of [...] in 8 hours, 35 minutes, 20.4 seconds, averaging [...] , this record still stands. The aircraft was serving in an operational unit, and had not been modified in any way besides being washed and waxed. One of the goals of the flight was to push the limit of its new honeycomb construction technique. The speed of the flight was limited only by the speed at which they believed the honeycomb panels would delaminate, although one of the afterburners malfunctioned and the last hour of the flight was continued at <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed.</b> This reduced the average speed to roughly Mach 1.5, despite most of the flight being at Mach 2. This B-58 was called [...] "Greased Lightning" [...] – the codename for the record attempt.|$|E
2500|$|The USAF and the Navy {{could only}} agree on swing-wing, two seat, twin engine design features.

The Navy had less strenuous requirements of 6g with Mach2 speed at altitude and high <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed</b> (approx.

So McNamara developed a basic set of requirements for TFX based largely on the Air Force's requirements. He changed to a 36-inch (91.4cm) dish for compatibility and increased the maximum weight to approximately [...] for the Air Force version and [...] for the Navy version. Then on 1September1961 he ordered the USAF to develop it.|$|E
50|$|The orbiter's maximum glide ratio/lift-to-drag ratio varied {{considerably}} with speed, {{ranging from}} 1:1 at hypersonic speeds, 2:1 at supersonic speeds, and reaching 4.5:1 at <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds</b> during approach and landing.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reactivated}} a {{few months}} later in October with new B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers, which were capable of flying at high <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds</b> and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|The A-6's wing {{was very}} {{efficient}} at <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds</b> compared to supersonic fighters {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, which are also limited to <b>subsonic</b> <b>speeds</b> when carrying a payload of bombs. The wing was also designed to provide good maneuverability with a sizable bomb load. A very similar wing would be put on pivots on Grumman's later supersonic swing-wing Grumman F-14 Tomcat, as well as similar landing gear. The Intruder was also equipped with the [...] "Deceleron", a type of airbrake on the wings with two panels that opened in opposite directions; in this case, one panel went up, while another went down.|$|R
2500|$|Supersonic flow behaves very {{differently}} from subsonic flow. Fluids react {{to differences in}} pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is [...] "told" [...] to respond to its environment. Therefore, since sound is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, {{the speed of sound}} in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that [...] "information" [...] can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself {{in the case of a}} fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a stagnation pressure as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at <b>subsonic</b> <b>speed,</b> this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid [...] "knows" [...] the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – temperature, density, pressure, and Mach number—in an extremely violent and irreversible fashion called a shock wave. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see Reynolds number) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.|$|E
