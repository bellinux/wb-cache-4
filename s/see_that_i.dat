25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E

[...] After a second crowd was convinced to disperse by Patriot leaders, Dunmore reacted angrily, warning on April 22 that if attacked, he would [...] "declare Freedom to the Slaves, and reduce the City of Williamsburg to Ashes."

500|$|Keith Thornton, {{best known}} by the stage name Kool Keith, {{released}} the album Dr. Octagonecologyst in 1996, under the name Dr. Octagon, produced by Dan [...] "The Automator" [...] Nakamura. Thornton later expressed some frustration with the [...] "Dr. Octagon" [...] nickname, saying, [...] "Octagon wasn't my life...I've {{done a lot of}} things that were totally around different things other than Octagon. Are some people just afraid to venture off into my life and <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do other things which are great? I think people stuck me with something." [...] In 1999, Thornton released the album First Come, First Served, which featured a track in which the newly introduced character Dr. Dooom murdered Dr. Octagon. Thornton had intended to move away from the Dr. Octagon character, but later decided to record another album under the Octagon name.|$|E
500|$|Scott and Rawlings {{had also}} become {{attached}} to several of the musical cues they had used for the temporary score while editing the film, and re-edited some of Goldsmith's cues and re-scored several sequences to match these cues and even left the temporary score in place {{in some parts of}} the finished film. Goldsmith later remarked that [...] "you can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was sort of like going at opposite ends of the pole with the filmmakers." [...] Nevertheless, Scott praised Goldsmith's score as [...] "full of dark beauty" [...] and [...] "seriously threatening, but beautiful." [...] It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album, and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music. The score has been released as a soundtrack album in several versions with different tracks and sequences.|$|E
500|$|Seward's wife Frances {{was deeply}} {{committed}} to the abolitionist movement. In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. Seward's frequent travel and political work suggest that it was Frances who played the {{more active role in}} Auburn abolitionist activities. In the excitement following the rescue and safe transport of fugitive slave William [...] "Jerry" [...] Henry in Syracuse on October 1, 1851, Frances wrote to her husband, [...] "two fugitives have gone to Canada—one of them our acquaintance John." [...] Another time she wrote, [...] "A {{man by the name of}} William Johnson will apply to you for assistance to purchase the freedom of his daughter.

500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Steve Huey {{wrote that}} Dr. Octagonecologyst [...] "...attracted {{more attention than}} any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes." [...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, and I think people [...] that I was an artist on a project. Octagon wasn't my life...I've {{done a lot of}} things that were totally around different things other than Octagon.

500|$|Astronomer Carl Sagan {{wrote in}} his book The Cosmic Connection that Clarke and Kubrick asked his opinion on how to best depict {{extraterrestrial}} intelligence. Sagan, while acknowledging Kubrick's desire to use actors to portray humanoid aliens for convenience's sake, argued that alien life forms were unlikely to bear any resemblance to terrestrial life, and that {{to do so would}} introduce [...] "at least an element of falseness" [...] to the film. Sagan proposed that the film suggest, rather than depict, extraterrestrial superintelligence. He attended the premiere and was [...] "pleased to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been of some help." [...] Kubrick hinted at the nature of the mysterious unseen alien race in 2001 by suggesting, in a 1968 interview, that given millions of years of evolution, they progressed from biological beings to [...] "immortal machine entities", and then into [...] "beings of pure energy and spirit"; beings with [...] "limitless capabilities and ungraspable intelligence".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, Villa {{had become}} an {{integral}} part of Luis Aragonés' plans and ousted Raúl from the team. Proving vital in Spain's qualification for Euro 2008, he scored six goals, including a bicycle kick against Liechtenstein. He was subsequently called up for the tournament where he formed a striking relationship with Torres, with whom he would often celebrate his goals. He scored a hat-trick in Spain's 4–1 win over Russia, making him the first player to do so at a UEFA European Championship since Patrick Kluivert in 2000, and only the seventh overall. After the third goal, he went out of his way to meet Torres, who was on the bench at the time, to celebrate with him: [...] "I had just scored a hat-trick and I knew people would be talking about me, but I wanted them to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had benefited from Torres's work, just as he sometimes benefits from mine." [...] In the next match, he secured a 2–1 win against Sweden with a goal in the 92nd minute. Rested for the next match against Greece, he started once again in the quarter-finals, where Spain beat Italy 4–2 on penalties; Villa took the first penalty and scored.|$|E

2500|$|Chesterton {{was a large}} man, {{standing}} [...] {{and weighing}} around [...] His girth {{gave rise to a}} famous anecdote.

[...] On another occasion he remarked to his friend George Bernard Shaw, [...] "To look at you, anyone would think a famine had struck England." [...] Shaw retorted, [...] "To look at you, anyone would think you have caused it." [...] P. G. Wodehouse once described a very loud crash as [...] "a sound like G. K.

2500|$|Disney {{characters}} Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Daisy Duck, {{and most}} of their supporting cast live in the fictional city of Duckburg, first mentioned in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #49 in 1944, created by Carl Barks, where Duckburg {{is described as a}} medium size city located in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota. Don Rosa, a subsequent cartoonist of Donald Duck, described his placement of the imaginary town: [...] "I won't bother to say precisely where I situated Duckburg and Calisota on America's west coast... but if you get out a good map and compare the coastline, you'll <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stuck the old gold-prospector's adopted hometown directly across the bay from a very appropriately named actual city." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 21, 1775, {{he seized}} colonial {{ammunition}} stores, {{an action that}} resulted in the formation of an angry mob. The colonists argued that the ammunition belonged to them, not to the British Crown. That night, Dunmore angrily swore, [...] "I have once fought for the Virginians and by God, I will let them <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can fight against them." [...] This {{was one of the first}} instances that Dunmore overtly threatened to institute martial law. While he had not formally passed any rulings, news of his plan spread through the colony rapidly. A group of slaves offered their services to the royal governor not long after April 21. Though he ordered them away, the colonial slaveholders remained suspicious of his intentions.|$|E
2500|$|I have {{convinced}} myself {{that there is}} nothing in the world — no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Doesn't it follow that I don't exist? No, surely I must exist if it's me who is convinced of something. [...] But there is a deceiver, supremely powerful and cunning whose aim is to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am always deceived. But surely I exist, if I am deceived. Let him deceive me all he can, he will never make it the case that I am nothing while I think that I am something. Thus having fully weighed every consideration, I must finally conclude that the statement [...] "I am, I exist" [...] must be true whenever I state it or mentally consider it.

2500|$|A {{story is}} {{preserved}} that {{once when he}} was a child, his father took him to the Kaaba, and asked him to pray before the idols. His father went away to attend to some other business, and Abu Bakr was left alone with the idols. Addressing an idol, Abu Bakr said [...] "O my God, I am in need of beautiful clothes; bestow them on me". The idol remained indifferent. Then he addressed another idol saying [...] "O God, give me some delicious food. <b>See</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am so hungry". The idol remained cold. That exhausted the patience of young Abu Bakr. He lifted a stone, and addressing an idol said [...] "Here I am aiming a stone; if you are a god protect yourself". Abu Bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the Kaaba. Thereafter, he never went to the Kaaba to pray to the idols.|$|E

He answered my question civilly in his own language. <b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was at a loss to understand what he said, he invited me by signs to follow him. After walking for a few minutes in a direction which was quite new to me, we stopped in a gloomy little square, with a plot of neglected garden-ground in the middle of it. Pointing to a lower window in one of the houses, in which a light dimly appeared, my guide said in Dutch: [...] "Office of Van Brandt, sir," [...] bowed, and left me.|$|R
