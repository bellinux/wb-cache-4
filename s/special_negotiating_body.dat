40|$|Worker {{participation}} {{has been}} subject to controversial debate in Europe. Although the member states' traditions in industrial relations and especially in worker participation vary greatly, the Council of Ministers agreed on some directives in this regard, recently: the EWC directive (94 / 45 /EC) and the information/consultation directive (2002 / 14 /EC), and the directive (2001 / 86 /EC) supplementing the Statute for a European Company {{with regard to the}} involvement of employees, which emphasises voluntary negotiations between employees' representatives, a so-called <b>special</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>body,</b> and the management. The latter directive does not only provide information and consultation procedures but also provisions regarding board-level representation. For that reason, the focus of this paper is on the European Company (Societas Europaea = SE). In this context, the fundamental provisions regarding the SE are presented. After discussing some exemplary cases in order to demonstrate the practical implications of this legal initiative regarding employee involvement, some issues arising are examined...|$|E
40|$|At the Nice Summit in December 2000, {{after more}} than 30 years of {{controversial}} debate, the Council of Ministers agreed on the European Company Statute (Societas Europaea = SE). In this context two legal instruments were enacted, the council regulation (No. 2157 / 2001) on the Statute for a European Company, which rules the internal corporate governance structure of the SE, and the council directive (2001 / 86 /EC) supplementing the Statute for a European Company {{with regard to the}} involvement of employees on the company level, which emphasises voluntary negotiations between employees' representatives, a so-called <b>special</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>body,</b> and the management. In October 2004, the SE can be established by companies based in the EU and the EEA for the first time. The legal form of the SE provides companies all-over Europe extensive opportunities for structural adjustments in accordance with their organisational needs. However, it does not only have substantial impacts on the companies capacity to act but also on the member states. Actually, the introduction of this new form of enterprise is expected to put considerable pressure on the national corporate governance systems {{as well as on the}} national fiscal systems. Additionally, the paradigm shift of the Community is remarkable regarding co-determination. This means, the Community does not try to establish a specific institutional pattern anymore, but pushes procedures that promote the idea of worker participation in management's decisions. The paper gives a brief overview of the emergence of the SE. Then, the contents of the regulation and the directive are presented. Subsequently, the focus of the paper is on the impacts on co-determination taking into consideration exemplarily the great variety of forms of worker participation currently prevalent in the EU and the EEA...|$|E

40|$|Worker {{participation}} at the {{supervisory board}} {{has always been}} subject to controversial debate. It is not {{the aim of this}} paper to examine worker participation as to its advantages and disadvantages, but to give the reader an overview of how companies can determine the depth, form and level of worker participation by choosing between different legal structures within the EU. Generally speaking, three alternatives can be identified. First of all, companies that do business across boarders in the EU/EEA and are organised as joint-stock companies may establish a European Company (Societas Europaea = SE) from October 8 th, 2004 on. The Council of Ministers has agreed on the European Company Statute during the Nice Summit in December 2000 after more than 30 years of controversial debate. In this context two legal instruments have been enacted, the council regulation (No. 2157 / 2001) on the Statute for a European Company, which rules the internal corporate governance structure of the SE, and the council directive (2001 / 86 /EC) supplementing the Statute for a European Company with regard to the involvement of employees on the company level, which emphasises voluntary negotiations between employees' representatives, a so-called <b>special</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>body,</b> and the management. The negotiation's outcome primarily depends on the negotiating skills of the parties involved. If no agreement is achieved, the management, however, still wants to establish a SE, standard rules are applied that are specified in the Annex of the Directive. Secondly, companies continuously organise their activities by choosing a legal form that is provided by national law. According to rulings as to freedom of establishment by the ECJ, member states have to recognise companies that have been established according to legal provisions in another member state as long as this member state follows incorporation theory. This means, for instance, for the management that it may establish a British private limited company. Then the ltd. can even transfer its administrative centre to Germany. In order to do business there, the ltd. must be registered in the German commercial register. Consequently, German legislation regarding worker participation at the company level cannot be applied. Finally, the proposal for a EU directive on cross-border mergers of companies with share capital is mentioned in this context. The proposal provides two alternatives concerning worker participation {{in the case of a}} merger. On the one hand, one ore more companies participating are subject to any form of worker participation so far and there are no national provisions on worker participation in the member state, where the new company is incorporated. In this case a procedure in accordance with the SE Directive will have to be established. On the other hand, the member state, in which the new company is incorporated, offers national provisions regarding worker participation. They will have to be applied in consequence. In sum, the above-mentioned organisational alternatives might put considerable pressure on the different industrial relations systems persistent in the EU. In the long run, this pressure might result in a convergence not only of the industrial relations systems but also of the corporate governance systems...|$|E

Mental health professionals largely classify transgender experiences as disorders, and transgender people seeking {{to alter their}} bodies typically must obtain authenticating letters from therapists verifying such diagnoses.

In these ways, psychomedical professionals impose gatekeeping measures that withhold and confer services to transsexuals who desire medical transition. Using qualitative interview data and grounded theory methods with 20 female-to-male transsexuals, this study demonstrates that transmen typically represent informed consumers whom carefully research psychomedical protocol and anticipate providers’ adherence to professional standards.

As non-member economies, both Taiwan and China are competing for participation in committees and in other OECD sub-groups such as working parties and working groups.
