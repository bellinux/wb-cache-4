40|$|The {{vibration}} in 100 different vehicles {{has been}} measured, evaluated and assessed according to British Standard BS 6841 (1987) and International Standard ISO 2631 (1997). Vibration {{was measured in}} 14 categories of vehicle including cars, lift trucks, tractors, lorries, vans and buses. In each vehicle, the vibration was measured in five axes: vertical vibration beneath the <b>seat,</b> <b>fore-and-aft,</b> lateral and vertical vibration on the <b>seat</b> pan and <b>fore-and-aft</b> vibration at the backrest. The alternative methods of evaluating the vibration (use of different frequency weightings, different averaging methods, the inclusion of different axes, vibration dose values and equivalent r. m. s. acceleration) as defined in the standards have been compared. BS 6841 (1987) suggests that an equivalent acceleration magnitude is calculated using vibration measured at four locations around the seat (x -, y -, z -seat and x -backrest); ISO 2631 (1997) suggests that vibration is measured in the three translational axes only on the seat pan but only the axis with the most severe vibration is used to assess vibration severity. Assessments made using the procedure defined in ISO 2631 tend to underestimate any risks from exposure to whole-body vibration compared to an evaluation made using the guidelines specified in BS 6841; the measurements indicated that the 17 m/s 1. 75 "health guidance caution zone" in ISO 2631 was {{less likely to be}} exceeded than the 15 m/s 1. 75 "action level" in BS 6841.

40|$|Subjective {{response}} to <b>seated,</b> <b>fore-and-aft</b> direction, whole-body vibration {{of the type}} experienced in automobiles was investigated. Fore-and-aft acceleration was measured at the seat guide of a small automobile when driving over two representative road surfaces, and was replicated in a laboratory setting using a whole-body vibration test rig and rigid seat. A single 15 -second section {{of each of the}} two acceleration time histories was band-pass filtered to the frequency interval from 0. 5 to 50. 5 Hz, and was used as a base stimulus. Thirteen test stimuli were then constructed for each base stimulus by rescaling to BS 6841 Wd frequency-weighted r. m. s. amplitudes from 0. 01 to 0. 86 m/s 2. Two groups of 16 participants (8 male and 8 female in each case) rated the discomfort of the test stimuli. The first group was asked to use the psychophysical method of magnitude estimation while the second used a Borg CR- 10 scale. The order of presentation of the test stimuli was fully randomised and each was repeated 3 times. For each group of participants, regression analysis was used to determine both the individual and the group mean Stevens’ Power Law exponent describing the relationship between stimulus amplitude and subjective response. All mean power exponents were found to be less than unity, with the CR- 10 scale having produced smaller exponents than magnitude estimation. The power exponents ranged from 0. 66 to 0. 91, corroborating th...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{vibration}} affects discomfort is {{an important}} factor for improving work and travelling experience. Methods of evaluating health effects from whole-body vibration are closely linked to those for evaluating discomfort in ISO 2631 - 1. The standard includes a method to evaluate discomfort using twelve axes of vibration with a similar approach to that for evaluating health effects; thus using all twelve axes gives a possibility to evaluate both health and discomfort. The full 12 -axis method has not been widely used in practice or validated in a multi-axis environment. The standard guidance is not explicit, thus different interpretations are possible especially when determining the method of comparing or combining vibration in different axes. Furthermore there are not enough studies conducted in multi-axis environments to suggest the optimal combination of axes. In this study ISO 2631 - 1 method was tested and optimised using a multi-axis test bench at Loughborough University, UK. Subjects were exposed to stimuli which represented vibration characteristics from field measurements. Each stimulus, lasting 15 s, was judged using a continuous judgement, cross-modal matching method. The seat translational and rotational and the backrest translational axes were used in the analyses. There was no vibration at the floor, in order to constrain the number of independent variables. Results showed that correlation for discomfort improved with more complex analysis procedures. However a good correlation was also achieved using just seat translational axes with optimised multiplying factors. The results showed that frequency weightings and r. m. s. averaging improved correlation between vibration and subjective ratings of discomfort. Multiplying factors specified in ISO 2631 - 1 degraded the correlation between objective and subjective measures of discomfort, therefore an improved set of factors were determined. The new factors showed improvement by placing more emphasis on <b>seat</b> <b>fore-and-aft</b> and lateral axes...|$|R

Lateral forces were relatively low on both the seat and the backrest. In all directions, forces on the seat and the backrest showed a nonlinear behaviour.

40|$|The {{apparent}} {{mass of the}} human body reflects gross movements caused by whole-body vibration and can be used to predict the influence of body dynamics on seat transmissibility. With vertical excitation, various models fit the measured vertical {{apparent mass}} {{of the human body}}, but experiments also show high fore-and-aft forces on the <b>seat</b> (the <b>fore-and-aft</b> cross-axis apparent mass) that have not influenced current models. This paper defines a model that predicts the vertical apparent mass and the fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass of the seated human body during vertical excitation. A three degree-of-freedom model with vertical, fore-and-aft and rotational (i. e. pitch) degrees of freedom has been developed with twelve model parameters (representing inertia, stiffness, damping, and geometry) optimised to the measured vertical apparent mass and the measured fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass of the body. The model provides close fits to the moduli and phases for both median data and the responses of 12 individual subjects. The optimum model parameters found by fitting to the median apparent mass of 12 subjects were similar to the medians of the same parameters found by fitting to the individual apparent masses of the same 12 subjects. The model suggests the seated human body undergoes fore-and-aft motion on a seat when exposed to vertical excitation, with the primary resonance frequency of the apparent mass arising from vertical motion of the body. According to the model, changes in the vertical, fore-and-aft, or rotational degree of freedom {{have an effect on the}} resonance in the fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass...|$|R
40|$|The {{second part}} of this study of the six axes of head motion caused by {{translational}} seat vibration {{is concerned with the}} effect of fore-and-aft (x-axis) and lateral (y-axis) seat vibration. Seat-to-head transmissibilities have been determined at frequencies up to 16 Hz {{for each of the three}} translational and three rotational axes of the head during exposure to random vibration of the seat. Repeatability measures within a single subject and studies of the variability across a group of twelve subjects have been conducted with two seating conditions: a rigid seat with a backrest, and the same seat with no backrest. <b>Fore-and-aft</b> <b>seat</b> motion mainly resulted in head motion within the mid-sagittal plane (x-z plane). Without the backrest, transmissibilities for the fore-and-aft, vertical and pitch axes of the head were greatest at about 2 Hz. The backrest greatly increased head vibration at frequencies above 4 Hz and caused a second peak in the transmissibility curves at about 6 to 8 Hz. Lateral seat motion mainly caused lateral head motion with a maximum transmissibility at about 2 Hz. The backrest had little effect on the transmission of lateral vibration to the head. For both axes of excitation inter-subject variability was much greater than intra-subject variability. © 1988. </p...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{transmission}} of vibration from the floor beneath a seat to interfaces between the seat and the human body are used to characterise the dynamic performance of the seat. Most studies of seat transmissibility concern {{the transmission}} of vertical vibration through seat pan cushions, but fore-and-aft vibration at a seat pan and backrest can also cause discomfort. This study investigated {{the transmission of}} fore-and-aft vibration through a car seat to surfaces on the seat pan cushion, the backrest cushion and the headrest, and also to the seat frame at these three locations. The study sought to understand the influences of the seat frame and the cushion foam and to provide data for dynamic modelling of the <b>seat.</b> The <b>fore-and-aft</b> transmissibility of the seat was measured with 12 human subjects and an SAE J 826 manikin, using 120 -s periods of fore-and-aft random vibration (0. 25 - 40 Hz) at three magnitudes (0. 4 m/s 2 r. m. s., 0. 8 m/s 2 r. m. s. and 1. 2 m/s 2 r. m. s.). With the manikin, there were three resonances (at 3. 5 Hz, 12 Hz and 20 Hz) in the transmissibilities from the seat base to the seat pan frame and the seat pan cushion, and to the backrest frame and the backrest cushion. With the human subjects, the transmissibilities from the seat base to all six locations on the seat showed a principal resonance around 4 Hz. With increasing magnitude of the vibration, the principal resonance frequency in all the seat transmissibilities decreased. It is concluded that fore-and-aft resonances in the seat transmissibilities, especially to the backrest, are likely to affect vibration discomfort. There are large differences between the fore-and-aft transmissibility of a seat with a manikin and those with human subjects, consistent with the human body having dynamics very {{different from those of}} a rigid mass. Non-linearities in the seat transmissibilities with the manikin and with the human subjects may be explained by non-linearity in the biodynamics of the body and the responses of the seat and the manikin. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} of roll, {{pitch and yaw}} vibration {{from the floor of}} a small car to the seat backrest has been investigated with three road conditions. At the seat base, there were distinctive differences between roll vibration at the front and rear of the seat base and between pitch vibration at the left- and right-hand side of the seat base. The yaw motion was generally small relative to the roll and pitch motion. At high frequencies, the yaw motion calculated from the difference between fore-aft vibration at the left- and right-hand side of the seat base was less than the yaw motion calculated from the differences between lateral vibration at the front and back of the seat base. Furthermore, yaw motion calculated from the difference in lateral vibration at the right-hand side of the seat was greater than that at the left-hand side, due to differences between the two lateral accelerations at the two right corners of the seat base. The measurements indicated that the seat base was not a rigid structure in either roll, pitch or yaw. The {{transmission of}} rotational vibration from the non-rigid <b>seat</b> base to <b>fore-and-aft,</b> lateral and vertical vibration at the seat backrest was investigated using single- and multi-input models. It was found that pitch and roll vibration, together with translational vibration at the seat base, made significant contributions to seat backrest vibration. For predicting seat transmissibility in the fore-aft and vertical directions, a translational model comprising all the least-correlated fore-aft and vertical inputs, and a combined rotational and translational model consisting of the pitch vibration input and part of the least-correlated fore-aft and vertical inputs appeared equally good. Low coherency in the transmission of vibration to the lateral direction of the seat backrest observed when considering only translational vibration at the seat base was resolved after taking into account the effect of the roll vibration at the seat base...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmissibility}} of a seat {{depends on}} the dynamics of both the seat and the human body. Previous {{studies show that the}} apparent mass of the body, to which much attention has been paid, has a large influence on the vibration transmissibility of a seat. The influence of the seat dynamics on the seat transmissibility has received less systematic attention. The principal objective {{of this study was to}} develop a systematic methodology using finite element methods to model the dynamic interaction between a seat and the human body so as to predict the seat transmissibility. The purpose was to understand how the foam material, the seat structure, and the seat occupant influence the vibration transmitted through seats. The effect of the foam thickness at the seat cushion and the backrest on the transmissibility was investigated experimentally in the laboratory with a SAE J 826 manikin and with 12 subjects during exposure to 60 -s periods of fore-and-aft and vertical vibration, respectively, in the frequency range 0. 5 to 20 Hz at 0. 8 ms- 2 r. m. s [...] Increasing the thickness of the foam at the seat cushion decreased the resonance frequency of both the vertical vibration transmitted to the seat cushion and the fore-and-aft vibration transmitted to the backrest, while there was little effect of the foam thickness at the backrest. It appears that the foam at the seat cushion had a predominant effect on the transmission of the vibration. Load-deflection curves were measured at various points across the lateral and fore-and-aft centrelines of a car seat with three different loading rates: 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mm/s. The dynamic stiffness of the seat cushion and backrest was measured with 120 -s broadband random vibration (1. 5 to 15 Hz) with three static preloads and with three vibration magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5, and 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.). With the same deformation, the reaction force was greater during loading than during unloading, showing evidence of hysteresis. The stiffness increased with increasing preload force and tended to decrease with increasing magnitude of vibration, indicating the seat components were nonlinear. The dynamic stiffness was also found to be greater when the seat cushion was constrained with a leather cover than without a leather cover. The transmission of vibration from the seat base to six different positions on a car seat was investigated experimentally in the laboratory with a SAE J 826 manikin and with 12 subjects exposed to 120 -s periods of random vibration (0. 5 to 40 Hz) at three magnitudes (0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 2 ms- 2 r. m. s.) in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions, respectively. The transmissibility from the seat base to the seat cushion surface and frame, to the backrest surface and frame, and to the headrest surface and frame exhibited a peak around 4 - 5 Hz in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions, respectively. The principal resonance frequency in the transmissibilities to all locations decreased with increasing magnitude of vibration, indicating nonlinearity in the seat-occupant system. There was little effect of the seat track position on the measured seat transmissibilities. The transmissibilities with subjects and with the manikin were different. Based on the experimental studies, models of the seat cushion and the backrest assemblies were built up and calibrated separately using the measured load-deflection curves and dynamic stiffnesses. They were joined to form a complete seat model and integrated with the model of a manikin for further calibration with measured seat transmissibility. The calibrated seat model was combined with a re-calibrated existing human body model to predict the transmissibility of the seat. It was found that by combining a calibrated seat model with a calibrated human body model, and defining appropriate contacts between the two models, the vertical vibration transmissibility of a seat with an occupant can be predicted. The developed seat-occupant model could be further improved to predict <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>seat</b> transmissibility to the backrest and the dynamic pressure distributions at the interfaces between the human body and the seat...|$|R
