40|$|Thermal {{control of}} Shuttle {{instruments}} {{will require the}} use of a pumped fluid space radiator system to reject large quantities of waste heat. Many payloads, however, will have insufficient vehicle surface area available for radiators to reject this waste heat and will, therefore, {{require the use of}} deployed panels. It is desirable to utilize modularized, deployable radiator systems which have a high degree of configuration and component commonality to minimize the design, development, and fabrication costs. Prototypes of two radiator systems which meet these criteria are currently under development for Shuttle payload utilization: a 'rigid' radiator system which utilizes aluminum honeycomb panels of the Shuttle Orbiter configuration that are deployed by an Apollo Telescope Mount <b>type</b> <b>scissors</b> mechanism; and two 'flexible' radiator systems which use panels constructed from flexible metal/dielectric composite materials that are deployed by 'unrolling' or 'extending' in orbit.

40|$|Endoscopic submucosal {{dissection}} (ESD) {{with a knife}} is a technically demanding procedure {{associated with}} a high complication rate. The shortcomings of this method are the deficiencies of fixing the knife to the target lesion, and of compressing it. These shortcomings can lead to major complications such as perforation and bleeding. To {{reduce the risk of}} complications related to ESD, we developed a new grasping <b>type</b> <b>scissors</b> forceps (Clutch Cutter®, Fujifilm, Japan) which can grasp and incise the targeted tissue using an electrosurgical current. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on a 59 -year-old Japanese man revealed a 16 mm esophageal submucosal nodule with central depression. Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated a hypoechoic solid tumor limited to the submucosa without lymph node involvement. The histologic diagnosis of the specimen obtained by biopsy was granular cell tumor. It was safely and accurately resected without unexpected incision by ESD using the CC. No delayed hemorrhage or perforation occurred. Histological examination confirmed that the granular cell tumor was completely excised with negative resection margin. We report herein a case of esophageal granular cell tumor successfully treated by an ESD technique using the CC...|$|R

50|$|Battle Beasts {{came out}} in the late 1980s and like most toys of the era, had a gimmick to help sales. Each Battle Beast had a heat {{sensitive}} sticker on his chest which, when rubbed would reveal the warrior's strength. The symbols would represent either fire, wood or water and could be used in a rock, paper, <b>scissors</b> <b>type</b> game - fire beat wood, wood beat water, water beat fire. Later a fourth emblem was added, the Sunburst, and it would beat all other types. The Sunburst was extremely rare, in a ten pack in Japan, or Pirate Leo was available in America as a variant, despite claims that there were others of that affiliation. Each Beast also carried his own distinctive weapon which could be identified to its Beast with the corresponding number.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Wear plate welding {{machines}} requires some special raw {{material handling system}} as they are heavy to handle. Wear plate welding requires 4 - 5 workers for handling and clamping of raw material. This paper reviews different material handling equipment used by various industries. As the raw material is heavy, {{it is very difficult}} to handle manually. Hence there is requirement of integrated material handling and clamping system to do this heavy task. An integrated approach for material handling and clamping is suggested. In this paper, various handling mechanisms like scissor lifting mechanism, hydraulic lift platform in <b>scissors</b> <b>type</b> mechanism, hydraulic lifting system based on multistage telescopic cylinder are discussed. Their analysis is done by using various software. Some failure diagnosis points are also discussed by mathematical calculations. Clamping mechanisms like electric power clamping device driven by step motor and screw-toggle-lever force amplifier in series, unilateral fixtures for sheet-metal parts with holes are discussed...|$|R

30|$|The dispute begins already with {{different}} definitions of a GMO (usually a plant). Depending on the position held, conflicting requirements concerning regulation are inferred [12]. Those who advocate an unregulated application of both {{old and new}} genetic engineering techniques effectively treat GM plants as {{the sum of its}} parts, i.e., genes, and only want to subject individual new components to an isolated assessment (reductionistic approach). Those in favour of regulations advocate a comprehensive risk evaluation of the whole GM organism, in which interactions between the GM organism and the environment (including human and animal consumers) are also taken into consideration. Consequently, the argument of those favouring the reductionistic approach is that if no novel transgene constructs are transferred like with the older, conventional genetic engineering techniques, risks would be absent. In contrast, those who favour a comprehensive risk evaluation of the whole GM organism argue that the process of genetic engineering, regardless of what <b>types</b> of molecular <b>scissors</b> are used, carries risks [12], for example, by disrupting or otherwise interfering with the network of genes and their fine-tuned interactions.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} several {{methods of}} decomposition for two player normal form games. Viewing {{the set of}} all games as a vector space, we exhibit explicit orthonormal bases for the subspaces of potential games, zero-sum games, and their orthogonal com- plements which we call anti-potential games and anti-zero-sum games, respectively. Perhaps surprisingly, every anti-potential game comes either from the Rock-Paper- <b>Scissors</b> <b>type</b> games (in the case of symmetric games) or from the Matching Pennies type games (in the case of asymmetric games). Using these decompositions, we prove old (and some new) cycle criteria for potential and zero-sum games (as orthogonality relations between subspaces). We illustrate the usefulness of our decomposition by (a) analyzing the generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors game, (b) completely characteriz- ing the set of all null-stable games, (c) providing a large class of strict stable games, (d) relating the game decomposition to the decomposition of vector elds for the replicator equations, (e) constructing Lyapunov functions for some replicator dynam- ics, and (f) constructing Zeeman games -games with an interior asymptotically stable Nash equilibrium and a pure strategy ESS. normal form games, evolutionary games, potential games, zero-sum games, orthogonal decomposition, null stable games, stable games, replicator dynamics, Zeeman games, Hodge decomposition. ...|$|R
40|$|Rajnish P Patel, 1, 2 Sunita M Ubale 21 Suyog Women&# 39;s Hospital, 2 Rajiv Gandhi Medical College, Thane, IndiaBackground: Obstetric anal {{sphincter}} injuries (OASIs) are {{the leading}} cause of anal incontinence in women. Episiotomies with a postdelivery suture angle of less than 30 ° to the midline are more likely to injure the anal sphincter directly, while those with a suture angle of more than 60 ° are associated with increased incidence of OASIs, as they do not relieve the pressure on the perineum. A safe zone of 40 °– 60 ° has been proposed. Recently, two new <b>types</b> of episiotomy <b>scissors</b> (Episcissors- 60 ® Straight version and angled version) were introduced to ensure a standardized cutting angle of 60 ° to the midline. We audited our results with the angled Episcissors- 60 in spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Materials and methods: Consecutive patients delivering in two private maternity hospitals in Thane, India undergoing clinically indicated episiotomies were included. Only patients delivering spontaneously were included. The scissors were introduced vaginally at crowning, and aligned to orient the guide limb vertically from the posterior fourchette to the anus. While a single cut was preferred, a stagger cut was needed for some women. Postdelivery angles were measured by placing a protractor transparency on the perineum after delivery and marking the angle with an indelible ink pen. Per rectal examination was performed prior to suturing to detect OASIs. Results: A total of 25 women underwent clinically indicated episiotomies. Of these, 16 women were nulliparous, eight women were para 1, and one woman was a para 2. One woman had a vaginal breech delivery (para 2), and the rest were cephalic vertex deliveries. The average age was 27 (range 20 – 35) years. The median birth weight was 2, 800 g (standard deviation 312 g, interquartile range 2, 500 – 3, 000 g). The median postdelivery suture angle of the episiotomy was 50 ° (standard deviation 3. 5 °, interquartile range 48 °– 54 °, range 45 °– 55 °). No cases of OASI were detected in this series. Conclusion: The Episcissors- 60 angled version demonstrated a postdelivery suture angle of 50 ° in a cohort of Indian women undergoing spontaneous vaginal deliveries.
