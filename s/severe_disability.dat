5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} is {{less common}} than carotid artery dissection (dissection {{of the large}} arteries {{in the front of}} the neck). The two conditions together account for 10â€“25% of non-hemorrhagic strokes in young and middle-aged people. Over 75% recover completely or with minimal impact on functioning, with the remainder having more <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> and a very small proportion (about 2%) dying from complications. It was first described in the 1970s by the Canadian neurologist C. Miller Fisher.|$|E
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with <b>severe</b> <b>disability.</b> The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{literature}} {{relating to}} the educational reeds of children with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> and describes methods to facilitate inclusion of these children into integrated educational settings. The paper defines {{use of the term}} "learners with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> " and outlines trends in placement of these learners. Components of a quality education are identified, including its age appropriateness, specific objectives, functional activities, consistent cue hierarchy, systematic data-based instruction, periodic program review, community-based instruction, integrated delivery of related services, interactions with nondisabled peers, transition planning, and home-sctool partnership. A synthesis of the literature on assessment of learners with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> emphasizes the use of ecological inventories and transdisciplinary models. Modifications designed to facilitate inclusion of learners with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> in integrated educational settings are then discussed, including improved accessibility, increased teacher familiarity with specialized needs of students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities,</b> and others...|$|R

5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this mixed methods case {{study was to examine}} how high school {{students}} with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> interact with peers and adults, the relationship between specific contextual factors and peer interactions, and the informal roles students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> assume during inclusive service-learning. Data were collected through video and live observations of four high school students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> throughout an inclusive arts-based service-learning project, and interviews with peers, art teachers, and focus groups of preservice teachers who facilitated the service-learning project. The data were analyzed using a combination of inductive and deductive processes to investigate peer and adult interactions, contextual factors, and the roles assumed by students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> during the project. The findings indicate that students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> had interactions with peers during inclusive service-learning that ranged in frequency and ease from natural to challenging; the majority of interactions were task related; adults and peers had positive perceptions of group functioning; and adult interactions occurred primarily within the function of providing supports. All of the contextual factors examined were each found to be associated with peer interactions. Students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> assumed a variety of roles that fell within the three categories described in the literature: group building roles, task completion roles, and individualistic roles...|$|R

40|$|This {{study used}} the Integrated Play Group model (Wolfberg and Schuler, 1992) {{to assess whether}} {{creating}} peer play groups for students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> would {{increase the number of}} interactions between students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> and their general education peers and the levels of play used by all the participants involved. Two measurement instruments were used. A pre/post measure of the levels of play for all participants was implemented using the Howes Peer Play Scale (Howes, 1980). A measure of the number of interactions between the targeted students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> and their general education peers was implemented with the Educational Assessment of Social Interactions or EASI Scale (Goetz, Haring, & Anderson, 1986). The frequency measure was implemented in a multiple baseline, single subject design, using interventions based on student need and preference. Peer play groups were recruited before the measure began and pre data were taken. The study took place in an urban elementary school with a diverse ethnic population. The context of this study was the elementary school playground at the morning recess period, where baseline data on the frequency of interactions data collection were collected for all of the targeted students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities.</b> As the first student's intervention was implemented and the targeted student with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> began to increase the frequency of his interactions, the second student with <b>severe</b> <b>disability's</b> intervention was initiated. As the second targeted student's interactions began to increase, the third student's intervention began. Each student had a customized intervention based on his disability and preferences. The student's peer play group was formed with consideration for age, and activity level. As the student with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> and peers began to interact successfully, the teacher began to fade her involvement to that of observer. When two of the three students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> were interacting independently with their peer play groups, interaction data were discontinued and post data was taken for all the participants. Results showed that all of the students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> had increased interactions with peers, as well as decreased non-play activities and teacher interactions. All of the participants showed increased levels of play in the post data, suggesting that the use of the Integrated Play Group model (Wolfberg and Schuler, 1992) with students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> and their peers on an elementary school playground increased the level of play for the students with and without disabilities, and increased the number of interactions between the students with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> and their peers without disabilities...|$|R
