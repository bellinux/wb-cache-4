40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} {{parametric}} instability <b>of</b> <b>square</b> <b>laminated</b> plates subjected to periodic dynamic loadings in hygrothermal environment. The effects of various parameters like {{the increase in}} static load factor {{and the degree of}} orthotropy of simply supported composite plates at elevated temperatures and moisture concentrations on the principal instability regions are investigated using finite element method. The effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia are used to study the antisymmetric angle-ply square plates. A simple laminated plate model is developed for the parametric instability <b>of</b> <b>square</b> <b>laminated</b> plates subjected to hygrothermal loading. A computer program based on FEM in MATLAB environment is developed to perform all necessary computations. The results show that instability <b>of</b> <b>square</b> <b>laminated</b> plates occurs for different parameters with an increase in temperature and moisture environment. The onset of instability occurs earlier, and the width of dynamic instability regions increases with a rise in temperature and moisture for different parameters.

40|$|The {{potential}} for enhanced postbuckling performance of flat plates using variable angle tow (VAT), {{in comparison with}} conventional laminated composites, has been shown previously. This paper presents an optimization strategy {{for the design of}} postbuckling behaviour <b>of</b> VAT composite <b>laminates</b> under axial compression. The postbuckling performance <b>of</b> composite <b>laminated</b> plates for a given compression loading is assessed by studying both the maximum transverse displacement and the end-shortening strain. For the postbuckling analysis of VAT composite plates, an efficient tool based on the variational principle and the Rayleigh-Ritz method is developed. In the optimization study, a mathematical definition based on Lagrangian polynomials, which requires few design parameters, is used to define a general fibre angle distribution of the VAT plate.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} interlaminar stresses in unsymmetrically laminated plates is presented. The study examines the linear elastic, large deflection response <b>of</b> <b>square</b> <b>laminated</b> composite plates subjected to uniform thermal loading. Both cross-ply and angle-ply, symmetric and unsymmetric, laminates are examined {{to evaluate the}} effects of mismatch between adjacent layers in elastic constants and coefficients of thermal expansion. A geometrically nonlinear kinematic description is used to predict the large out-of-plane (transverse) deflections. The nonlinear, three-dimensional boundary value problems are formulated from elasticity theory and approximate solutions are determined using the finite element method. A global/local analysis procedure is used to obtain improved free edge stress predictions. For the laminates and loading conditions considered, {{the results indicate that}} the out-of-plane deflections <b>of</b> the unsymmetric <b>laminates</b> reduce interlaminar shear stresses. These deflections also reduce interlaminar normal stresses in some laminates and increase these stresses for others.

It can be interpreted as an added mass to the vibrating structure in the analysis of the dynamic response. Because the density of water is much greater than air, the added mass effect becomes even more critical in understanding the dynamic response of composites in water surroundings. In this study, experimental testing was carried out to investigate FSI <b>of</b> composite <b>laminates</b> immersed in fluid and subjected to low-velocity impact. <b>Square</b> composite <b>laminates</b> <b>of</b> carbon fiber weave and vinyl ester resin of size 305 mm and 2. 38 mm nominal thickness were subjected to low velocity impact loading, using a specially developed vertical drop-weight testing machine.

Impact tests were performed on four side clamped laminates in air-backed, water-backed, and dry surroundings, and at various impact energies for investigation.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Laminated glass is comprised of multiple plates of glass bonded together with polymorphous interlayers. The interest in the use <b>of</b> architectural <b>laminated</b> glass in the construction industry has increased due to its possible advantages over monolithic glass. Some of the advantageous properties <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass include a greater impact resistance, improved sound resistance, and better thermal insulation inside the structure. The most important advantage <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass as compared to monolithic glass is its improved safety. Should failure <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass occur, the interlayer would adhere to the surrounding glass plates. This would prevent the glass from shattering and potentially harming any inhabitants of the structure. Although these advantages are generally accepted, the performance <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass is highly disputed. Of particular interest are the performance <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass at various temperatures and its response to loading over a duration of time. There are two primary objectives of this thesis. First, the effect of temperature on the elastic bending stiffness <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass with a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) based interlayer is to be resolved. The creep response with respect to temperature will also be observed. Second, the design method for laminated glass will be evaluated. This includes determining the effectiveness of the existing models <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass. This investigation will include typical three point loading on two types <b>of</b> architectural <b>laminated</b> glass. These tests will be conducted at various temperatures to determine the effect of temperature on the bending <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass. The results of these experiments show that temperature is the most influential property in the determination of the behavior <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass beams. It is shown in this thesis that at cold temperatures, laminated glass approaches the performance of the true monolithic model. Furthermore, it is shown that at hot temperatures, laminated glass is bound by the performance of the layered model. The results of this thesis indicate that a return to the traditional design procedure is warranted until further research is conducted...|$|R
