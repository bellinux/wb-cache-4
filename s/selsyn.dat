5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a <b>selsyn.</b>|$|E
25|$|To make a range measurement, the {{operator}} {{would turn the}} potentiometer dial {{in an effort to}} get the leading edge of the target blip to line up with a vertical line on the CRT. The range was not read off the CRT, but the dial. The dial also turned a magslip, or <b>selsyn</b> as it is more commonly known today. The output of the magslip was used to directly turn the controls on the predictor, allowing the radar to continually update the range measurement.|$|E

50|$|Single phase {{units have}} five wires: two for an exciter winding (typically line voltage) and three for the output/input. These three are bussed {{to the other}} synchros in the system, and provide the power and {{information}} to align the shafts of all the receivers. Synchro transmitters and receivers must be powered by the same branch circuit, so to speak; the mains excitation voltage sources must match in voltage and phase. The safest approach is to bus the five or six lines from transmitters and receivers at a common point. Different makes of <b>selsyns,</b> used in interlock systems, have different output voltages. In all cases, three-phase systems will handle more power and operate a bit more smoothly. The excitation is often 208/240 V 3-phase mains power. Many synchros operate on 30 to 60 V AC also.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first serious}} {{suggestion}} that <b>selsyns</b> {{could be used}} for machining control was made by Ernst F. W. Alexanderson, a Swedish immigrant to the U.S. working at General Electric (GE). Alexanderson had worked on the problem of torque amplification that allowed the small output of a mechanical computer to drive very large motors, which GE used {{as part of a larger}} gun laying system for US Navy ships. Like machining, gun laying requires very high accuracy - fractions of a degree - and the forces during the motion of the gun turrets was non-linear. In November 1931 Alexanderson suggested to the Industrial Engineering Department that the same systems could be used to drive the inputs of machine tools, allowing it to follow the outline of a template without the strong physical contact needed by existing tools like the Keller Machine. He stated that it was a [...] "matter of straight engineering development". However, the concept was ahead of its time from a business development perspective, and GE did not take the matter seriously until years later, when others had pioneered the field.|$|R
5000|$|When sound {{recording}} {{reached the point}} where the sound was recorded on a synchronized but separate piece of media (such as 35mm film, audio tape, or other media) a method of keeping the recording media and camera film [...] "in sync" [...] was needed. The solution was to use a special form of motor which has multiple [...] "windings" [...] in it, and which can be connected to another identical motor {{in such a way that}} turning one motor a certain distance will turn the other motor exactly the same distance. The motors did not have to be close together, and, with appropriate circuitry, did not have to be of the same size or power. These motors were called <b>selsyn</b> (self synchronous) motors. A system was created where a single {{sound recording}} room could be connected to any of the stages on a studio lot (you can still see the connection points on some of the oldest stages.) The sound mixer (sound man) on stage connected the control panel to the recording room and the camera. There was a <b>selsyn</b> motor on the camera and it was linked to a matching <b>selsyn</b> motor on the sound recording equipment at another point on the studio lot.|$|E
50|$|Using Polaroid filters meant {{an entirely}} new form of projection, however. Two prints, each {{carrying}} either the right or left eye view, had to be synced up in projection using an external <b>selsyn</b> motor. Furthermore, polarized light would be largely depolarized by a matte white screen, and only a silver screen or screen made of other reflective material would correctly reflect the separate images.|$|E
50|$|The key {{development}} {{in this area}} was {{the introduction of the}} servomechanism, which produced powerful, controlled movement, with highly accurate measurement information. Attaching two servos together produced a <b>selsyn,</b> where a remote servo's motions were accurately matched by another. Using a variety of mechanical or electrical systems, the output of the selsyns could be read to ensure proper movement had occurred (in other words, forming a closed-loop control system).|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} and dissemination throughout industry of NC, CNC, PLC, and other control technologies provided {{a new way}} to control the movement of the milling cutter: via feeding information from a program to actuators (servos, <b>selsyns,</b> leadscrews, machine slides, spindles, and so on) that would move the cutter as the information directed. Today most commercial machining is done via such programmable, computerized methods. Home machinists are likely to work via manual control, but computerized control has reached the home-shop level as well (it's just not yet as pervasive as its commercial counterparts). Thus pantograph milling machines are largely a thing of the past. They are still in commercial use, but at a greatly reduced and ever-dwindling level. They are no longer built new by machine tool builders, but a small market for used machines still exists. As for the magnification-and-reduction feature of a pantograph (with the scale determined by the adjustable arm lengths), it is achieved in CNC via mathematic calculations that the computer applies to the program information practically instantaneously. Scaling functions (as well as mirroring functions) are built into languages such as G-code.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} years laser {{measuring}} system become widespread. The great {{advantage of these}} systems is that the physical quantities such as a linear displacement, vibration parameters, angular displacement can be measured by a noncontact method. In this work performed {{an analysis of the}} possibility of applying in gyroscopic systems serially produced angle encoders and encoders that are being developed. In {{the beginning of this article}} describes the main characteristics of encoders, manufactured by leading instrument companies, and analyzed their work in gyroscopic systems. The most widely used in gyroscopic verticals are potentiometers and <b>selsyns,</b> from which are taken electrical signals proportional to the angles of pitch and roll, with the axis of the frame are loaded by moments from these encoders, which reduces the accuracy of the measurement. Research presented in the article demonstrate that serially produced angle encoders have high accuracy and wide range of measurement angles, but they also have a large size, weight, high cost. A disadvantage of the most important when used in gyroscopic systems is that they cause a large error of the interaction. One promising avenue is the use of non-contact systems, in particular laser. Presented in this article the development of laser frequency-phase system of the Institute of Electrodynamics of NAS of Ukraine allowing almost completely eliminating the power consumption from the measured object and greatly improve the accuracy of measurement. Analysis of the system shows that its metrological characteristics, it fully matches the requirements placed on measuring instruments of angular displacements in gyroscopic systems. However, the need for further experimental studies to improve the design of the laser angular displacement meter, which will consider the practical question of its application in the gyroscopic systems. ???????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????? ??????? ???????????, ??????????? ???????? ???????????????????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ??????????????? ??????????. ????????, ??? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ????? ??????????? ? ??? ???????????. ??????????? ??????????? ????????????? ? ??????????????? ???????? ???????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????, ??????? ?? ????? ????????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ???? ?????????????, ??? ???????? ???????? ??????????????? ?????????????? ????? ?????????...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the visual impact of the image, Cinerama {{was one of the}} first processes to use multitrack magnetic sound. The system, developed by Hazard E. Reeves, one of the Cinerama investors, played back from a full coated 35 mm magnetic film with seven tracks of sound targeting a speaker layout similar to the more modern SDDS. There were five speakers behind the screen, two on the side and back of the auditorium with a sound engineer directing the sound between the surround speakers according to a script. The projectors and sound system were synchronized by a system using <b>selsyn</b> motors.|$|E
5000|$|This {{was not an}} {{impossible}} problem to solve, but would require some sort of feedback system, like a <b>selsyn,</b> to directly measure how far the controls had actually turned. Faced with {{the daunting task of}} building such a system, in the spring of 1949 Parsons turned to Gordon S. Brown's Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT, which was a world leader in mechanical computing and feedback systems. During the war the Lab had built a number of complex motor-driven devices like the motorized gun turret systems for the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and the automatic tracking system for the SCR-584 radar. They were naturally suited to technological transfer into a prototype of Parsons's automated [...] "by-the-numbers" [...] machine.|$|E
50|$|Telemetering {{information}} over wire had {{its origins}} in the 19th century. One of the first data-transmission circuits was developed in 1845 between the Russian Tsar's Winter Palace and army headquarters. In 1874, French engineers built a system of weather and snow-depth sensors on Mont Blanc that transmitted real-time information to Paris. In 1901 the American inventor C. Michalke patented the <b>selsyn,</b> a circuit for sending synchronized rotation information over a distance. In 1906 a set of seismic stations were built with telemetering to the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia. In 1912, Commonwealth Edison developed a system of telemetry to monitor electrical loads on its power grid. The Panama Canal (completed 1913-1914) used extensive telemetry systems to monitor locks and water levels.|$|E
5000|$|The bearing and {{altitude}} {{of the target}} was measured directly on the UD4 Height Finder/Range Finder, a coincidence rangefinder located in the High Angle Director Tower (HADT). The direction of travel was measured by aligning a binocular graticule with the target aircraft fuselage. The early versions of HACS, Mk. I through IV, did not measure target speed directly, but estimated this value based on the target type. All of these values were sent via <b>selsyn</b> to the HACS in the High Angle Calculating Position (HACP) located below decks. The HACS used these values to calculate the range rate (often called rate across in RN parlance), which is the apparent target motion across the line of sight. This was also printed on a paper plot so that a range rate officer could access its accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Late in April 1942, {{during a}} test flight of V9977, the {{prototype}} unit {{was shown to}} Flight Lieutenant E. Dickie, a navigator. Dickie pointed out that navigational charts were always produced with north at the top, while the PPI display of H2S had {{the top of the}} display representing whatever direction the aircraft was flying. He suggested that this would cause significant problems during navigation, which had not been considered serious because H2S was seen purely as a bombing aid. This led to a crash program at EMI to modify the prototype sets with a system to correct for this problem. This was solved with the introduction of a <b>selsyn</b> connected to the aircraft's gyrocompass, whose output modified the scan rotation. A further addition produced a bright line on the display indicating the direction of travel.|$|E
5000|$|A synchro is, in effect, a {{transformer}} whose primary-to-secondary coupling may be varied by physically changing the relative {{orientation of the}} two windings. Synchros are often used for measuring the angle of a rotating machine such as an antenna platform. In its general physical construction, it is much like an electric motor. The primary winding of the transformer, fixed to the rotor, is excited by an alternating current, which by electromagnetic induction, causes currents to flow in three Y-connected secondary windings fixed at 120 degrees {{to each other on}} the stator. The relative magnitudes of secondary currents are measured and used to determine the angle of the rotor relative to the stator, or the currents can be used to directly drive a receiver synchro that will rotate in unison with the synchro transmitter. In the latter case, the whole device may be called a <b>selsyn</b> (a portmanteau of self and synchronizing).|$|E

5000|$|The Air Force Numeric Control and Milling Machine {{projects}} formally {{concluded in}} 1953, but development continued at the Giddings and Lewis Machine Tool Co. and other locations. In 1955 {{many of the}} MIT team left to form Concord Controls, a commercial NC company with Giddings' backing, producing the Numericord controller. Numericord {{was similar to the}} MIT design, but replaced the punch tape with a magnetic tape reader that General Electric was working on. The tape contained a number of signals of different phases, which directly encoded the angle of the various controls. The tape was played at a constant speed in the controller, which set its half of the <b>selsyn</b> to the encoded angles while the remote side was attached to the machine controls. Designs were still encoded on paper tape, but the tapes were transferred to a reader/writer that converted them into magnetic form. The magtapes could then be used on any of the machines on the floor, where the controllers were greatly reduced in complexity. Developed to produce highly accurate dies for an aircraft skinning press, the Numericord [...] "NC5" [...] went into operation at G&L's plant at Fond du Lac, WI in 1955.|$|E
50|$|The {{range control}} was {{connected}} to a potentiometer and measured range electronically. The elevation and azimuth was measured via the physical position of the antenna. Turning the handwheels at these positions drove the rotor assembly through <b>selsyn</b> motors, and the current position was fed back to the operator display using magslips, better known today as synchros. The output of the magslips was also amplified and sent to external connectors, {{where they could be}} used to create additional displays at remote locations. These were placed in front of the operators of the gunnery analog computers, known as predictors, who would feed these numbers into the computer. The output of the computer was similarly fed to another set of magslip indicators placed in front of the gunners. The gunners then rotated the gun until their indicators lined up with those from the predictor, a technique known as laying needle on needle. The range was used for fuse timing, which was set automatically in a fuse setting machine driven directly off another magslip. In some cases the output of the radar drove the inputs of the predictors directly, and in others the outputs drove the gun laying directly, making the process highly automated.|$|E
