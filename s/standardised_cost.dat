40|$|The {{construction}} industry in Botswana faces {{a problem of}} cost variances on the construction projects. Hence, the identified problem needs to be attended to. The study was an evaluation of how constructions cost on projects were managed. This entails establishing how project costs were planned, how projects costs were controlled and reported and finally how project costs at completion were analysed. This was done through questionnaires. The major findings were that of inadequate planning for project costs. This {{could be attributed to}} the fact that, although the major cost planning factors such as specifications and statement of work (Scope) were incorporated in the cost plan, they were not complete at the time the cost plan was determined. Consequently, they were the major causes of cost variances at post contract stage. Furthermore, cost control was not adequately conducted on projects. Therefore, it is recommended that the government should provide a detailed brief and specifications to confirm the project requirements and also have <b>standardised</b> <b>cost</b> control measures on projects.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to analyse}} how cost {{accounting}} knowledge is mediated {{in a large}} multinational organisation employing a company-wide enterprise resource planning system and off-the-shelf activity based costing software to create a uniform profitability management system within the organisation. Design/methodology/approach – The case analysis is informed by the theoretical notions of dis-and re-embedding of expert knowledge, expert systems and standards. Findings – The results indicate that <b>standardised</b> <b>cost</b> accounting software packages may be useful {{not only because of}} their superior data processing properties and technical efficiency, but also because of their usability in overcoming resistance to change. It is suggested that software packages and some degrees of freedom in the implementation process may actually enhance actors' “blind” commitment to the system and reduce resistance to the new system. Originality/value – It is of interest to researchers and practitioners alike how ready-made software packages may be successfully used in implementing the changes needed in the management accounting systems of large organisations. It is also particularly interesting to find reasons why software packages seem to be so useful in driving these changes.

40|$|Experience {{over the}} last decade has {{demonstrated}} that, in general, the process of decommissioning has reached industrial maturity, although specific techniques continue to evolve. The use of these techniques in the decommissioning of nuclear facilities continues to increase this experience. Various international studies of decommissioning project costs have shown that there are substantial variations in cost estimates for individual installations. Studies attempting to understand the reasons for these differences have been somewhat hampered by the fact that different types of costing methods are used, having different data requirements. Although some uncertainty is inevitable in any costing method, an understanding of the costing methods used in particular projects is useful to avoid key uncertainties. Difficulties of understanding can be encountered and invalid conclusions drawn in making cost comparisons without regard to {{the context in which the}} various cost estimates were made.

40|$|Abstract—Quality {{costs are}} the costs {{associated}} with preventing, finding, and correcting defective work. Since the main language of corporate management is money, quality-related costs act as means of communication between the staff of quality engineering departments and the company managers. The objective of quality engineering is to minimize the total quality cost across the life of product. Quality costs provide a benchmark against which improvement can be measured over time. It provides a rupee-based report on quality improvement efforts. It is an effective tool to identify, prioritize and select quality improvement projects. After reviewing through the literature it was noticed that a simplified methodology for data collection of quality cost in a manufacturing industry was required. The quantified standard methodology is proposed for collecting data of various elements of quality cost categories for manufacturing industry. Also in the light of research carried out so far, it is felt necessary to <b>standardise</b> <b>cost</b> elements in each of the prevention, appraisal, internal failure and external failure costs [...] Here an attempt is made to <b>standardise</b> the various <b>cost</b> elements applicable to manufacturing industry and data is collected by using the proposed quantified methodology.

40|$|The {{increasing}} land-use {{activities in}} European mountain regions {{have led to}} a considerable threat of natural hazards such as flash floods and debris flows in areas used for settlement purposes and economic activities. To mitigate associated losses, traditional protective measures, including check dams and retention basins, were commonly implemented by public authorities. However, due to the scarceness of public funds, efficient protection alternatives have to be developed to reduce future expenditures. Supplementing the concept of integral risk management, this efficiency can be obtained by local structural protection, reducing the vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure facilities considerably. However, data related to the effects of local structural protection measures to reduce losses has not been quantified satisfyingly so far, and the associated decrease in vulnerability has hardly been measured until now. In this paper, results of a comparative <b>standardised</b> <b>cost</b> benefit analysis are presented. Different mitigation strategies were assessed and the benefit of local structural measures was quantified. The results suggest that local structural measures reduce the vulnerability of buildings towards natural hazards considerably, and that they therefore should be considered as either additional or even alternative mitigation measures...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Historically, Kenya {{has used}} various {{distribution}} models for long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) with variable results in population coverage. The models presently vary widely in scale, target population and strategy. There is limited information {{to determine the}} best combination of distribution models, which will lead to sustained high coverage and are operationally efficient and cost-effective. <b>Standardised</b> <b>cost</b> information is needed in combination with programme effectiveness estimates to judge the efficiency of LLIN distribution models and options for improvement in implementing malaria control programmes. The study aims to address the information gap, estimating distribution cost and the effectiveness of different LLIN distribution models, and comparing them in an economic evaluation. Methods and analysis Evaluation of cost and coverage will be determined for 5 different distribution models in Busia County, an area of perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya. Cost data will be collected retrospectively from health facilities, the Ministry of Health, donors and distributors. Programme-effectiveness data, defined as the number of people with access to an LLIN per 1000 population, will be collected through triangulation of data from a nationally representative, cross-sectional malaria survey, a cross-sectional survey administered to a subsample of beneficiaries in Busia County and LLIN distributors’ records. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis will be used for the evaluation. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from a health-systems perspective, and cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated using bootstrapping techniques.

40|$|Objective. Proposed Australian {{healthcare}} reforms {{describe a}} move towards partial Commonwealth funding of public hospitals, whereby hospitals will be paid an ‘efficient price’ for each separation, incorporating both {{the costs and benefits}} of services. This paper describes a potential approach to setting the efficient price using risk adjusted cost-effectiveness (RAC-E) analysis. Methods. RAC-E analysis uses a decision analytic framework to estimate lifetime costs and survival for individual patients, which are standardised by comparing observed and expected values. Analysis of <b>standardised</b> <b>costs</b> and effects at different hospitals identifies efficient hospitals, from which efficient prices can be defined. Results. A RAC-E analysis of services for stroke patients at the four main public hospitals in South Australia demonstrates the need to account for costs and benefits in identifying efficient hospitals. The hospital with the best patient outcomes incurred additional costs relative to less effective hospitals. If an investment of AU$ 14 760 to gain an additional life year in stroke patients is deemed to be a cost-effective use of resources, then the most effective hospital is also the most efficient hospital. Conclusions. The applied RAC-E analysis demonstrates a framework for comparing the economic efficiency of care provided at different hospitals, which provides a basis for defining the efficient price and appropriate funding incentives to achieve better patient outcomes.

40|$|Most {{products}} {{go through}} a life-cycle with certain common features across {{a wide range of}} different industries. In the early stages a new product has relatively few outlets and is often viewed as a luxury item by consumers. Sales are therefore low and prices are high when it first appears on the market. However, as the product becomes established, production methods are <b>standardised,</b> <b>costs</b> and prices fall and it gradually takes on the characteristics of a mass-market good. This leads to a period of rapid growth which levels off as sales reach the potential capacity of the market. At this time the market may stabilise or even go into a period of decline as rival products enter the market or as low cost foreign competition replaces domestic production. In this article we will discuss the product life-cycle for domestic air travel in the United States. This is an interesting industry because air travel has only existed for about the last eighty years and so we have accurate statistics which allow us to trace out its development from an infant to a mature industry.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{guidelines}} {{for the conduct of}} cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) are mainly applicable to facility-based interventions in high-income settings. Differences in the unit of analysis and the high cost of data collection can make these guidelines challenging to follow within public health trials in low- and middle- income settings. OBJECTIVE: This paper reflects on the challenges experienced within our own work and proposes solutions that may be useful to others attempting to collect, analyse, and compare cost data between public health research sites in low- and middle- income countries. DESIGN: We describe the generally accepted methods (norms) for collecting and analysing cost data in a single-site trial from the provider perspective. We then describe our own experience applying these methods within eight comparable cluster randomised, controlled, trials. We describe the strategies used to maximise adherence to the norm, highlight ways in which we deviated from the norm, and reflect on the learning and limitations that resulted. RESULTS: When the expenses incurred by a number of small research sites are used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of delivering an intervention on a national scale, then deciding which expenses constitute 'start-up' costs will be a nontrivial decision that may differ among sites. Similarly, the decision to include or exclude research or monitoring and evaluation costs can {{have a significant impact on}} the findings. We separated out research costs and argued that monitoring and evaluation costs should be reported as part of the total trial cost. The human resource constraints that we experienced are also likely to be common to other trials. As we did not have an economist in each site, we collaborated with key personnel at each site who were trained to use a <b>standardised</b> <b>cost</b> collection tool. This approach both accommodated our resource constraints and served as a knowledge sharing and capacity building process within the research teams. CONCLUSIONS: Given the practical reality of conducting randomised, controlled trials of public health interventions in low- and middle- income countries, it is not always possible to adhere to prescribed {{guidelines for}} the analysis of cost effectiveness. Compromises are frequently required as researchers seek a pragmatic balance between rigor and feasibility. There is no single solution to this tension but researchers are encouraged to be mindful of the limitations that accompany compromise, whilst being reassured that meaningful analyses can still be conducted with the resulting data...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Our {{objective}} was to identify, among the information routinely collected on patients in intensive care units (ICUs), data that determine the total cost for a given patient. Design: We developed a model that could help physicians in medical ICUs to estimate the cost of care for their patients when no cost data were available at the individual patient level. Setting: A Medical ICU. Patients and participants: The model was developed using {{a random sample of}} 73 patients admitted to the medical ICU in 1996 and 1997, validated by another random sample of 29 patients admitted during the same period. Interventions: The actual medical variable cost per patient was computed from data on the total resources used (excluding personnel and fixed costs), collected from the patients' records plus pharmacy, laboratory and blood bank logs. The explanatory variables tested were: length of stay, nursing workload, severity of condition, and procedures recorded by a score [omega (Omega) ] including 3 components related to the frequency of procedure use. The model was constructed in a stepwise fashion, assuming a linear relation. Equations were tested {{on the basis of the}} residual mean square; criteria for inclusion and elimination of variables were the level of its partial regression coefficient and medical criteria. The model was validated by analysis of variance of the regression on a second population of 29 patients using the F-test. Main outcome measures and results: The median length of stay was 7 days (range: 3 to 22 days). Mortality rate was 25 %. Median medical variable cost was Lstg 805 (mean medical variable cost was Lstg 1738, total cost was Lstg 6279). The variables selected in the multiple regression model as relevant predictors of medical costs were: procedures recorded only once during the ICU stay irrespective of their reiteration (Omega 1), procedures recorded every time they are performed (Omega 2), procedures recorded daily in the ICU (Omega 3) and the presence or absence of an invasive procedure (Kc). The final equation, calibrated with r 2 of 0. 826 and p > 0. 0001, was: medical cost (Lstg) = 23 Omega 1 + 53 Omega 2 + 8 Omega 3 + 2352 Kc + 96. The validation with the other sample of 29 patients compared actual to predicted costs. Analysis of variance of the regression from the model was r 2 = 0. 596 (p > 0. 05). Conclusions: Our <b>standardised</b> <b>cost</b> model is a possible approach to allow comparison of medical costs within and between ICUs.

40|$|Background: Allocating {{national}} resources to regions based on {{need is a}} key policy issue in most health systems. Many systems utilise proxy measures of need {{as the basis for}} allocation formulae. Increasingly these are underpinned by complex statistical methods to separate need from supplier induced utilisation. Assessment of need is then used to allocate existing global budgets to geographic areas. Many low and middle income countries are beginning to use formula methods for funding however these attempts are often hampered by a lack of information on utilisation, relative needs and whether the budgets allocated bear any relationship to cost. An alternative is to develop bottom-up estimates of the cost of providing for local need. This method is viable where public funding is focused on {{a relatively small number of}} targeted services. We describe a bottom-up approach to developing a formula for the allocation of resources. The method is illustrated in the context of the state minimum service package mandated to be provided by the Indonesian public health system. Methods: A <b>standardised</b> <b>costing</b> methodology was developed that is sensitive to the main expected drivers of local cost variation including demographic structure, epidemiology and location.

40|$|Background and purpose: Cost-of-illness studies often {{describe}} a single aggregate {{cost of a}} disease state. This approach is less helpful for a condition with a spectrum of outcomes like stroke. The modified Rankin Scale is {{the most commonly used}} outcome measure for stroke. We sought to describe the existing evidence on the costs of stroke according to individual modified Rankin Scale categories. This may be useful in future cost effectiveness modelling studies of interventions where cost data have not been collected, but disability outcome is known. Methods: Systematic review of the published literature, searching electronic databases between 2004 and 2015 using validated search filters. Results were screened to identify studies presenting costs by individual modified Rankin Scale categories. Results: Of 17, 782 unique identified articles, 13 matched all inclusion criteria. In only four of these studies were costs reported by modified Rankin Scale categories. Most studies included direct medical costs only. Societal costs were assessed in two studies. Overall, studies had a high methodological and reporting quality. The heterogeneity in costing methods used in the identified studies prevented meaningful comparison of the reported cost data. Despite this limitation, the costs consistently increased with greater severity (increasing modified Rankin Scale score). Conclusions: Few cost studies of stroke include information based on stroke recovery measured by individual modified Rankin Scale categories and the existing data are limited. To reliably capture this information, future studies are needed that preferably apply <b>standardised</b> <b>costing</b> methods to promote greater potential for use in cost-effectiveness analyses whereby direct collection of patient-level resource use has not been possible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction In {{the context}} of the current human {{resources}} for health (HRH) crisis, the need for comprehensive Human Resources Development Plans (HRDP) is acute, especially in resource-scarce sub-Saharan African countries. However, the financial implications of such plans rarely receive due consideration, despite the availability of much advice and examples in the literature on how to conduct HRDP costing. Global initiatives have also been launched recently to <b>standardise</b> <b>costing</b> methodologies and respective tools. Methods This paper reports on two separate experiences of HRDP costing in Mozambique and Guinea Bissau, with the objective to provide an insight into the practice of costing exercises in information-poor settings, as well as to contribute to the existing debate on HRH costing methodologies. The study adopts a case-study approach to analyse the methodologies developed in the two countries, their contexts, policy processes and actors involved. Results From the analysis of the two cases, it emerged that the costing exercises represented an important driver of the HRDP elaboration, which lent credibility to the process, and provided a financial framework within which HRH policies could be discussed. In both cases, bottom-up and country-specific methods were designed to overcome the countries' lack of cost and financing data, as well as to interpret their financial systems. Such an approach also allowed the costing exercises to feed directly into the national planning and budgeting process. Conclusions The authors conclude that bottom-up and country-specific costing methodologies have the potential to serve adequately the multi-faceted purpose of the exercise. It is recognised that standardised tools and methodologies may help reduce local governments' dependency on foreign expertise to conduct the HRDP costing and facilitate regional and international comparisons. However, adopting pre-defined and insufficiently flexible tools may undermine the credibility of the costing exercise, and reduce the space for policy negotiation opportunities within the HRDP elaboration process. </p...|$|R

Essential package costing is often undertaken at a country level. It is less usual to utilise the methods across different parts of a country in a way that takes account of variation in population needs and location. Costing was based on best clinical practice in Indonesia and province specific data on distribution and costs of facilities. The resulting model was used to estimate essential package costs in a representative district in each province of the country. Findings Substantial differences in the costs of providing basic services ranging from USD 15 in urban Yogyakarta to USD 48 in sparsely populated North Maluku. These costs are driven largely by the structure of the population, particularly numbers of births, infants and children and also key diseases with high cost/prevalence and variation, most notably the level of malnutrition. The approach to resource allocation was implemented using existing data sources and permitted the rapid construction of a needs based formula that is highly specific to the package mandated across the country. Refinement could focus more on resources required to finance demand side costs and expansion of the service package to include priority non-communicable services. </p...|$|R

Methods: This study was undertaken at the largest district health board in New Zealand. All {{patients with}} a diagnosed presentation of medically unexplained physical symptoms in 2013 were identified using the district health board’s clinical coding system. The clinical records (medical and psychiatric) of 49 patients were examined in detail to extricate all medically unexplained physical symptoms–related secondary care activity within 6 [*]months before or after their medically unexplained physical symptoms presentation. <b>Standardised</b> national <b>costing</b> methodology was {{used to calculate the}} associated healthcare costs. Results: In all, 49 % of patients attended hospital settings at least twice during 2013. The majority of presentations were for neurological or respiratory concerns.

Conclusion: Medically unexplained physical symptoms result in frequent presentations to hospital settings. The costs incurred are substantial and comparable to the costs of chronic medical conditions with identifiable pathology. Improving recognition and management of medically unexplained physical symptoms has potential to offer more appropriate and cost-effective healthcare outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{effort has}} been made to {{estimate}} the global resource requirements of scaling-up HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) interventions. There are currently several medium- and long-term global estimates available. Comprehensive country specific estimates are now urgently needed to ensure the successful scaling-up of these services. This paper reviews evidence on the global resource requirements of scaling-up HIV/AIDS and TB interventions. The purpose of this review is to summarise and critically appraise the methods used in the global estimates and to identify remaining knowledge gaps, particularly those relevant to country level estimation. This review found that the estimates of global resource requirements provide sound methodological guidance for countries on the basic steps to follow. However, there are still many areas that require further development or evidence. These include the following. Firstly, the methods used to assess the capacity to scale up HIV/AIDS and TB services need to be further refined. In particular countries need simple methods to assess human resource capacity. Secondly, investments need to be made to improve country level data on the costs and effectiveness of HIV/AIDS and TB services. In particular efforts should be focused on producing <b>standardised</b> unit <b>costs</b> for each intervention by country, which reflect the reality of domestic resource use. Thirdly, simple costing models, which appropriately integrate systems costs need to be developed for use at the country level. Finally, resources needs estimation needs to be embedded by countries in multi-sectoral expenditure planning processes. Countries and global agencies will continue to need estimates for different purposes at different times. Therefore attention should move away from specific estimates, to the longer term aim of building capacity at the country level, supported by global agencies. This will be of mutual benefit. Those making national resource estimates can learn from the experience of global estimation. Concurrently, global resource estimates can build on the evidence emerging from improved national resource estimate...|$|R
40|$|Childhood {{respiratory}} disease creates considerable morbidity and mortality, especially amongst {{children living in}} low-income countries. Of the more than 10 million children who die annually from preventable diseases, pneumonia is responsible for 18. 1 %, while in low-income countries this percentage rises to 26 %. It is calculated that 90 % of these deaths from preventable diseases occur in 42 countries. Even {{in the face of}} the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, pneumonia is still responsible for 21 % of deaths. HIV-infected children are at greatest risk for developing and dying from pneumonia. By the introduction of low <b>cost</b> <b>standardised</b> case management strategies for the management of pneumonia, increasing immunisation, reducing risk factors such as poor nutrition and environmental smoking and promoting breast-feeding, it is estimated that the death rate from pneumonia can be reduced by 50 %. In this series the epidemiology of childhood acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the recognition and management of childhood pneumonia in resource-poor settings will be highlighted as well as the scientific justification for the standard case management of childhood pneumonia. As cases of pneumonia are better managed, other childhood {{respiratory disease}}s such as asthma and tuberculosis (TB) will be discovered, which also require a standard approach to management. The management of asthma and TB in resource-poor settings will also be discussed. © 2005 The Union. Revie...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{a relatively}} new computing paradigm that builds upon virtualisation technologies to provide hardware, platforms and software as services over the Internet. The cloud can be deployed in four basic deployment models namely private cloud, community cloud, public cloud and hybrid cloud. Private cloud is owned and utilised by a single organisation and may be hosted internally and by a third party. The community clouds is meant for organisations with similar business interests, while the public cloud is accessible to the general public over the Internet. The hybrid cloud is a combination of any of the other cloud deployment models. All the cloud deployment models are characterised by multi-tenancy, namely data belonging to multiple users reside on the same physical host. Powering off a multi-tenant host would disrupt co-hosted services in a physical host which would then affect their availability. This affects other tenants that are not related to an incident. The cloud is distributed and often spans multiple jurisdictions. Its distributed nature also prevents conventional procedures for collecting evidence data and preservation. New approaches in conducting digital forensic investigations are required. In this thesis, different dimensions of digital forensic challenges brought by the advent of cloud computing are presented. The extent to which traditional digital forensic approaches address the issue of digital forensics in cloud environments are also presented. Digital forensic standards are considered important in this thesis as they are an aspect that can contribute positively to investigating cloud environments when multi-jurisdictional collaboration is required. Standards can also enhance acceptability of digital forensic evidence gathered from cloud environments. As a solution towards addressing issues of digital forensic investigation in cloud environments, in this thesis the author presents standard procedures {{that can be used to}} conduct a digital forensic investigation in cloud environments. To enable execution of these procedures, a cloud forensic service model is presented that guides digital forensic investigators through a standardised collaborative process of investigating cloud environments. Both proposed digital forensic procedures and the service mentioned above were evaluated in a private cloud environment. Evaluation results have shown that a collaborative environment can be used to investigated cloud-based incident scenes in a <b>standardised</b> and <b>cost</b> efficient manner.

40|$|The {{availability}} of miniaturised ultrasound instruments, {{such as the}} “ultrasonic stethoscope”, herald {{a new era in}} the detection of important cardiovascular pathology at the point-of-care During the last centuries, cardiologists weretaught to perform physical examination byusing their senses; indeed, most clinical diagnoses are still based on auscultation which requires the best skill to recognise abnormal sounds and different types of heart murmurs. However, awareness that abnormal physical find-ings are not always specific nor always sensitive has {{led to the development of}} an armamentarium of diagnostic procedures during the last few dec-ades. In particular, ultrasound imaging allows the cardiac structures to be viewed dynamically, undoubtedly providing a new window on the heart. Currently, echocardiography is the most widely used and cost effective diagnostic imaging tool in cardiology and has largely replaced other imaging modalities in a wide variety of health care environments. Generally, a standard echocar-diogram is requested whenever the physical examination is inconclusive or doubtful, or for evaluation of the severity of a known disease. However, echocardiography is becoming more and more complex and the significant equipment <b>costs,</b> <b>standardised</b> examinations, and required specialised personnel make standard echocardio-graphy time consuming and expensive. The same factors limit access to echocardiography and cre-ate delays in getting important results to the bed-side. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that to perform any echocardiographic examination an examiner must be completely trained, certified, and examined. However, for answering simple questions, it may not be necessary to go to these extremes...|$|R
30|$|Drawing this conclusion, we {{must keep}} in mind that we only observe that young workers with {{vocational}} credentials who experienced some unemployment are worse off in the mid-term compared to a similar group of young workers who experienced smooth transitions. Mechanisms behind unemployment scarring still remain a black box and may only be theorised about. It may be that employers take transitory unemployment as a relevant sorting criterion even if degrees are sufficiently <b>standardised</b> and dismissal <b>costs</b> are low. As early unemployment experiences may also exert a psychological impact, scarring effects may also stem from reduced self-efficacy and self-esteem due to the experience of early unemployment, which in turn influence future job search effort and success (see Furnham [1985]). Over and above this, those who experience early unemployment may be more prone to apply for and accept jobs that offer worse career advancement and employment prospects (see e.g., Mortensen [1986]). In this case it may be self-selection rather than sorting by employers that is at play. Whatever the driving forces of unemployment scarring are, our results clearly contradict assumptions about improvement in job-matching quality as proposed by search and matching theories (see Kahn and Low [1982]). Therefore, we conclude that even a potentially advantageous institutional setting, which on the one hand allows for smooth transitions, does on the other hand not protect the young from adverse consequences in case they happen to experience bumpy transitions. As vocationally skilled entrants are not sheltered from unemployment scarring even within a favourable institutional setting, they should not be left unattended within research and policy considerations addressing labour market vulnerability.|$|R
40|$|Key {{messages}} • Older {{people are}} particularly vulnerable to social isolation or loneliness owing to loss of friends and family, mobility or income. • Social isolation and loneliness impact upon individuals’ {{quality of life and}} wellbeing, adversely affecting health and increasing their use of health and social care services. • The interventions to tackle social isolation or loneliness include: befriending, mentoring, Community Navigators, social group schemes. • People who use befriending or Community Navigator services reported that they were less lonely and socially isolated following the intervention. • The outcomes from mentoring services are less clear; one study reported improvements in mental and physical health, another that no difference was found. • Where longitudinal studies recorded survival rates, older people who were part of a social group intervention had a greater chance of survival than those who had not received such a service. • Users report high satisfaction with services, benefiting from such interventions by increasing their social interaction and community involvement, taking up or going back to hobbies and participating in wider community activities. • Users argued for flexibility and adaptation of services. One-to-one services could be more flexible, while enjoyment of group activities would be greater if these could be tailored to users’ preferences. • When planning services to reduce social isolation or loneliness, strong partnership arrangements need to be in place between organisations to ensure developed services can be sustained. • We need to invest in proven projects. Community Navigator interventions {{have been shown to be}} effective in identifying those individuals who are socially isolated. Befriending services can be effective in reducing depression and cost-effective. • Research needs to be carried out on interventions that include different genders, populations and localities. • There is an urgent need for more longitudinal, randomised controlled trials that incorporate <b>standardised</b> quality-of-life and <b>cost</b> measures...|$|R
40|$|Hospital {{services}} in Ireland have {{developed into a}} complex mixture {{of public and private}} provision with private patients being treated in public as well as private hospitals. This interweaving of public and private medicine is driven to a large extent by the large proportion of the population covered by health insurance which has grown from 4 % in 1960 to over 50 % by 2004. This situation has led to concerns that hospital care is not available to all on the basis of need alone but is substantially influenced by personal circumstances. Previous research on Irish hospitals found that utilisation was neutral across the income distribution controlling for health status – i. e., there was essentially equal treatment for equal need irrespective of income. It could be argued however that these analyses did not properly control for health status as those in lower income groups can be shown to have a lower health status within the same response categories within social surveys. Similarly, previous research has also assumed that treatment costs were identical across groups. In this paper we derive a new measure of health – the ‘Ill Health Index’ using three different health indicators and obtain information on differential costs of treatment across groups. We find that both those with medical insurance and those with medical cards are more likely to use hospital services. The costs of these services are also significantly higher for these groups. Comparison of measures of equity for inpatient utilisation and inpatient costs shows that costs are more pro-poor, but a decomposition of the distribution of hospital <b>costs</b> <b>standardising</b> for health needs shows that higher income groups actually use hospital services more and cost more for the same level of health than lower income groups. hrb...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					The rising {{prevalence}} of overweight and obesity places a financial burden on {{health services and}} on the wider economy. Health service and societal costs of overweight and obesity are typically estimated by top-down approaches which derive population attributable fractions {{for a range of}} conditions associated with increased body fat or bottom-up methods based on analyses of cross-sectional or longitudinal datasets. The evidence base of cost of obesity studies is continually expanding, however, the scope of these studies varies widely and a lack of standardised methods limits comparisons nationally and internationally. The objective of this review is to contribute to this knowledge pool by examining direct costs and indirect (lost productivity) costs of both overweight and obesity to provide comparable estimates. This review was undertaken as part of the introductory work for the Irish cost of overweight and obesity study and examines inconsistencies in the methodologies of cost of overweight and obesity studies. Studies which evaluated the direct costs and indirect costs of both overweight and obesity were included. 				 				 					 						Methods 					A computerised search of English language studies addressing direct and indirect costs of overweight and obesity in adults between 2001 and 2011 was conducted. Reference lists of reports, articles and earlier reviews were scanned to identify additional studies. 				 				 					 						Results 					Five published articles were deemed eligible for inclusion. Despite the limited scope of this review there was considerable heterogeneity in methodological approaches and findings. In the four studies which presented separate estimates for direct and indirect costs of overweight and obesity, the indirect costs were higher, accounting for between 54 % and 59 % of the estimated total costs. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					A gradient exists between increasing BMI and direct healthcare costs and indirect costs due to reduced productivity and early premature mortality. Determining precise estimates for the increases is mired by the large presence of heterogeneity among the available cost estimation literature. To improve the availability of quality evidence an international consensus on <b>standardised</b> methods for <b>cost</b> of obesity studies is warranted. Analyses of nationally representative cross-sectional datasets augmented by data from primary care are likely to provide the best data for international comparisons...|$|R
40|$|Background: Most {{evidence}} {{on the effect of}} collaborative care for depression is derived in the selective environment of randomised controlled trials. In collaborative care, practice nurses may act as case managers. The Primary Care Services Improvement Project (PCSIP) aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative models of practice nurse involvement in a real world Australian setting. Previous analyses have demonstrated the value of high level practice nurse involvement in the management of diabetes and obesity. This paper reports on their value in the management of depression. Methods: General practices were assigned to a low or high model of care based on observed levels of practice nurse involvement in clinical-based activities for the management of depression (i. e. percentage of depression patients seen, percentage of consultation time spent on clinical-based activities). Linked, routinely collected data was used to determine patient level depression outcomes (proportion of depression-free days) and health service usage <b>costs.</b> <b>Standardised</b> depression assessment tools were not routinely used, therefore a classification framework to determine the patient’s depressive state was developed using proxy measures (e. g. symptoms, medications, referrals, hospitalisations and suicide attempts). Regression analyses of costs and depression outcomes were conducted, using propensity weighting to control for potential confounders. Results: Capacity to determine depressive state using the classification framework was dependent upon the level of detail provided in medical records. While antidepressant medication prescriptions were a strong indicator of depressive state, they could not be relied upon as the sole measure. Propensity score weighted analyses of total depression-related costs and depression outcomes, found that the high level model of care cost more (95 % CI: -$ 314. 76 to $ 584) and resulted in 5 % less depression-free days (95 % CI: - 0. 15 to 0. 05), compared to the low level model. However, this result was highly uncertain, as shown by the confidence intervals. Conclusions: Classification of patients’ depressive state was feasible, but time consuming, using the classification framework proposed. Further validation of the framework is required. Unlike the analyses of diabetes and obesity management, no significant differences in the proportion of depression-free days or health service costs were found between the alternative levels of practice nurse involvement.
