Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds; however, he struggled with tendinitis in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing. Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against Denver.

Unhappy in his marriage, Barrymore– aged 40 at the time– sought solace elsewhere and had an affair with his 17-year-old co-star Mary Astor during filming. Although the film was not an unqualified success, the cast, including Barrymore, was generally praised. Around this time, Barrymore acquired the nickname [...] "the Great Profile", as posters and photographs of him tended to favor the left-hand side.

Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he'd done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "We're doing some squeaky clean, sweet, optimistic, non-cynical piece, I wanted to do something that sorta tapped into the different <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> personality." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. He said, [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards." [...] The dark tone of the series was influenced by the 1970s ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up. In addition, the series draws inspiration from classic horror films such as Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.|$|E
500|$|Sale el Sol is {{considered}} to be Shakira's return to her [...] "roots" [...] and is a [...] "fusion between rock and pop heavily influenced from Latino and Colombian music". Shakira said there are three [...] "directions" [...] of Sale el Sol: a romantic one, a [...] "very rock and roll" [...] one, and a [...] "Latino, tropical" [...] one. Explaining the romantic [...] "direction" [...] of the album, she said that it was something [...] "which I hadn't tapped into for the past three years, but it suddenly came to me and I couldn't hold it back. So it’s [...] got songs that are very intense, very romantic [...] ". Examples include ballads like [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] ("Before Six O'Clock") and [...] "Lo Que Mas" [...] ("The Most"); in the former Shakira delivers [...] "sad, emotional, and heartfelt vocals," [...] while in the latter she sings over a piano and string-supplemented melody. About the rock and roll [...] "direction" [...] of the album, Shakira said [...] "I started my career as a rock artist and then I kind of crossed over into pop, so it’s been fun to re-encounter that <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> artistic personality".|$|E

During the end of the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "You rock hard / I rock steady" [...] eventually [...] "erupting into an orgasmic finish" [...] as stated by Puja Patel of Spin. During the last part, she sings [...] "Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin / And you're comfortable in my skin". It was noted that during the end of the song, the protagonist becomes ready to be sexually subordinate and [...] "discipline" [...] as opposed to the first part where she adopted a more dominant persona; this is further exemplified in the lines [...] "Punish me, punish me please" [...] where Beyoncé uses soft vocals.|$|E

500|$|Etan Cohen {{created the}} role of Kirk Lazarus {{as a way of}} lampooning the great lengths that some method actors go to depict a role. Downey was {{approached}} by Stiller about the part while on vacation in Hawaii. Downey said on CBS' The Early Show that his first reaction was, [...] "This is the stupidest idea I've ever heard!" [...] and that Stiller responded, [...] "Yeah, I know— isn't it great?" [...] In another interview, Downey said that he accepted the part but, having no idea where or even how to start building the character of Lazarus, eventually settled on a jive-esque speech pattern and a ragged bass voice; he then auditioned Lazarus' voice over the phone to Stiller, who approved the characterization immediately. Downey revealed that he modeled the character on actors Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, and Daniel Day-Lewis. The initial script was written for Downey's character to be Irish, but was altered after Downey stated he could improvise better as an Australian (he had previously played a similar outlandish Australian character in the film Natural Born Killers). Downey's practice of remaining in character between takes and even off the film set was also written into the script for his character to perform. Downey required between one and a half to twohours of make-up application. According to Downey, [...] "One makeup artist would start on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> face and a second makeup artist would start on the other side, and then they'd meet in the middle." ...|$|E

When interpreting, Ronstadt said she [...] "sticks to what the music demands", in terms of lyrics. Explaining that rock and roll music is part of her culture, she says that the songs she sang after her rock and roll hits were part of her soul.

2500|$|Humbert Humbert's first love, Annabel Leigh, {{is named}} after the [...] "maiden" [...] in the poem [...] "Annabel Lee" [...] by Poe; this poem is alluded to {{many times in the}} novel, and its lines are {{borrowed}} to describe Humbert's love.

In the opening of the novel, the phrase Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied, is a pastiche of two passages of the poem, the winged seraphs of heaven (line 11), and The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me (lines 21–2). Nabokov originally intended Lolita to be called The Kingdom by the Sea, drawing on the rhyme with Annabel Lee that was used in the first verse of Poe's work. A variant of this line is reprised in the opening of chapter one, which reads ...had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea.|$|E

[...] Donati agreed, saying, [...] "There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line." [...] Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in 11 days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, [...] " [...] has no spirit, he's a professional in the most banal sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn't the case with the other two. On the methodical and careful <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> character, I'd be nearer il Biondo (Blondie): but my most profound sympathy always goes towards the Tuco side...
