5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} <b>strong</b> <b>presumption</b> that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people {{in order to give}} effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
25|$|In the {{exercise}} of its original jurisdiction – that is, its power to hear cases {{for the first time}} – the High Court carries out two types of judicial review: judicial review of legislation, and judicial review of administrative acts. Although in a 1980 case the Privy Council held that the fundamental liberties in Part IV of the Constitution should be interpreted generously, Singapore courts usually adopt a philosophy of deference to Parliament and a <b>strong</b> <b>presumption</b> of constitutional validity, which has led to fundamental liberties being construed narrowly in certain cases. The courts also generally adopt a purposive approach, favouring interpretations that promote the purpose or object underlying constitutional provisions.|$|E
500|$|In Chee Siok Chin, the High Court {{interpreted}} the phrase necessary or expedient as conferring upon Parliament [...] "an extremely wide discretionary power and remit that permits a multifarious and multifaceted approach towards achieving {{any of the}} purposes specified in Art 14(2) of the Constitution". The Court emphasized the fact that, unlike Article 19(3) of the Constitution of India which provides {{that the right to}} fetter the freedom of speech and assembly is subject to the touchstone of reasonableness, Singapore's Article 14(2) does not contain the word reasonable. However, despite the broad power that Article 19(3) accords to the Indian courts, they have been [...] "most reluctant" [...] to invalidate legislation purportedly infringing the rights to free speech or assembly. There exists a <b>strong</b> <b>presumption</b> of legislative constitutionality, as the Supreme Court of India has expressed a need for [...] "judicial self-restraint and extreme caution" [...] when determining whether legislation unreasonably restricts a constitutional right. It has been noted that the Indian courts have thus been used to exemplify how much more deference Singapore courts should give to the Government, and that the Article 14(2) derogation clause was said to confer upon Parliament a great amount of discretionary power.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{generally}} supposed that John Balfour of Burley died at sea on a return voyage to Scotland. But in the New Statistical Account of Scotland, under [...] "Roseneath", <b>strong</b> <b>presumptions</b> are stated for believing {{that he never}} left Scotland, but found an asylum in the parish of Roseneath, Dumbartonshire, under the wing of the Argyll family. According to this account, having assumed the name of Salter, his descendants continued there for many generations, {{the last of the}} family dying in 1815.

2500|$|Rabbinic {{scholars}} have traditionally held that, because the Karaites do not observe the rabbinic law on divorce, {{there is a}} <b>strong</b> <b>presumption</b> that they are mamzerim (adulterine bastards), so that marriage with them is forbidden even if they return to Rabbinic Judaism. Some recent Ashkenazi Ḥaredi {{scholars have}} held that Karaites {{should be regarded as}} Gentiles in all respects, though this is not universally accepted. They hasten to add that this opinion is not intended to insult the Karaites, but only to give individual Karaites the option of integrating into mainstream Judaism by way of conversion. In contrast, in 1971, Ovadia Yosef, who was then the Chief Rabbi of the Sefaradim and ‘Edot HaMizraḥ of Israel, proclaimed that Karaites are Jews [...] "LeKhol Davar" [...] (literally, for all purposes) and that it is permissible for Rabbinic Jews to marry with them.|$|E

[...] In canon law, both physical persons and juridic persons have [...] "obligations and rights which correspond to their nature"; a juridic person [...] "is perpetual by its nature"; and, a parish is a juridic person [...] "by the law itself". So, Kuenstler believes that, [...] "There is a <b>strong</b> <b>presumption</b> in favor of its endurance in being."

60|$|But {{there is}} a still <b>stronger</b> <b>presumption.</b> The Company ordered that this person, who {{was to have the}} {{management}} of the Nabob's revenue, and who was to be his guardian, should keep a strict account, which account should be annually transmitted to the Presidency, and by the Presidency to Europe; and the purpose of it was, to keep a control upon the reduced expenses of the sixteen lac which were ordered in the manner I mentioned. Your Lordships will naturally imagine that that control was kept safe. No, here is the order of the Directors, and you will see how Mr. Hastings obeyed it.|$|R
60|$|My Lords, I {{have now}} {{done with this}} first part,--namely, the {{presumption}} arising from his refusal to make any defence, on pretence that the charge brought against him might be referred to a court of justice, and from the non-performance of his promise to give satisfaction to his employers,--and when that pretence was removed, still refusing to give that satisfaction, though suffering as he did under a load of infamy and obloquy, and though urged to give it by persons of the greatest character. I have stated this to your Lordships as the <b>strongest</b> <b>presumption</b> of guilt, and that this presumption is strengthened by the very excuse which he fabricated for {{a part of his}} bribes, when he knew that the proof of them was irresistible, and that this excuse is a high aggravation of his guilt,--that this excuse is not supported by law, that it is not supported by reason, that it does not stand with his covenant, but carries with it a manifest proof of corruption, and that it cannot be justified by any principle, custom, or usage whatever. My Lords, I say I have done with the presumption arising from his conduct as it regarded the fact specifically charged against him, and with respect to the relation he stood in to the Court of Directors, and from the attempt he made to justify that conduct. I believe your Lordships will think both one and the other <b>strong</b> <b>presumptions</b> of his criminality, and of his knowledge that the act he was doing was criminal.|$|R
60|$|I am {{not at all}} bigoted in {{the opinion}} that the Greeks may have once been totemists. The <b>strongest</b> <b>presumption</b> in favour of the {{hypothesis}} is the many claims of descent from a god disguised as a beast. But the institution, if ever it did exist among the ancestors of the Greeks, had died out very long before Homer. We cannot expect to find traces of the prohibition to marry {{a woman of the}} same totem. In Rome we do find traces of exogamy, as among totemists. 'Formerly they did not marry women connected with them by blood.' {88a} But we do not find, and would not expect to find, that the 'blood' was indicated by the common totem.|$|R
2500|$|In New York, for example, {{there is}} a <b>strong</b> <b>presumption</b> {{in favor of the}} plaintiff’s choice of forum. See Gulf Oil v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947); R. Maganlal & Co., 942 F.2d 164, 167 (2nd Cir. 1991); Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 226 F.3d 88, 101 (2d Cir. 2000); and Maran Coal Corp. V. Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A., No. 92 CIV 8728, 1993 US.Dist. LEXIS 12160 at *6 (S.D.N.Y. September 2, 1993). A {{defendant}} must show compelling evidence in order to disturb the choice of forum. The burden of proof is on the defendant: Strategic Value Master Fund, Ltd. v. Cargill Fin. Serv. Corp., 421 F.2d 741, 754 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). The court must also consider the defendant’s vast resources compared with the plaintiff’s limited resources as an aggrieved individual: See Wiwa at 107: “defendants have not demonstrated that these costs [...] are excessively burdensome, especially in view of defendant’s vast resources”. Also, Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 244 F.Supp.2d 289 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) at 341: “A countervailing factor is the relative means of the parties”.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, {{health and}} safety {{legislation}} is drawn up and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive and local authorities (the local council) under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HASAWA). [...] HASAWA introduced (section 2) a general duty on an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees; {{with the intention of}} giving a legal framework supporting 'codes of practice' not in themselves having legal force but establishing a <b>strong</b> <b>presumption</b> as to what was reasonably practicable (deviations from them could be justified by appropriate risk assessment). [...] The previous reliance on detailed prescriptive rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to technological change, leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or inappropriately regulated. [...] HSE has continued to make some regulations giving absolute duties (where something must be done with no 'reasonable practicability' test) but in the UK the regulatory trend is away from prescriptive rules, and towards 'goal setting' and risk assessment. Recent major changes to the laws governing asbestos and fire safety management embrace the concept of risk assessment. The other key aspect of the UK legislation is a statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected {{health and safety}} representatives and health and safety committees. This followed a similar approach in Scandinavia, and that approach has since been adopted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia, for example.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, {{plans were}} {{announced}} to dismantle {{all of the}} United Kingdom's gasholders due to being made largely redundant due to improvements in gas storage. This was intended to include the Oval Gas Holders. Regeneration of these contaminated brownfield sites can help deliver London with much needed homes. Berkeley Homes and Lambeth Council are working together cooperatively to prepare a Masterplan for an area surrounding the Oval Gas Holders. This {{is known as the}} Oval and Kennington Development Area (OAKDA). A preliminary consultation with the local community occurred in January and February 2015 to discover local aspirations. Draft Masterplan proposals will be released to a second consultation {{towards the end of the}} year where comments will be welcomed. In March 2012 Lambeth Council locally listed the three gas holders of 1874, 1876 and 1892 (No.4, No.5 and No.1). In 2015, Lawrence D'Silva, a 26 year old local resident, presented a case to Historic England to make the gasholders listed buildings. [...] Subsequently, Historic England assessed them all for national listing and in March 2016 decided to grant Grade II listed status to just one of the Oval Gasholders – No.1 dating from 1892. The national listing designation supersedes the local listing status of this gasometer so Gasholder No. 1 was subsequently removed from the Local list by Lambeth – Nos. 4 & 5 remain locally listed. There is a <b>strong</b> <b>presumption</b> in the planning decision-making process against the demolition of a nationally listed heritage asset.|$|E
50|$|After being {{involved}} in early repression in Constantine, Algeria as prefect, Maurice Papon was named head of the Parisian police on 14 March 1958. Tensions increased after 25 August 1958, when an FLN guerilla offensive in Paris killed three policemen on boulevard de l'Hôpital in the 13th arrondissement and another {{in front of the}} cartoucherie de Vincennes, leading to arrests and jailing of Algerians suspected of supporting the FLN. In 1960 Papon created the Auxiliary Police Force (FPA - Force de police auxiliaire), which was made up of 600 Algerians by Autumn 1960 and operated in areas densely populated by Algerians in Paris and its suburbs. While incompletely evidenced, the <b>strongest</b> <b>presumption</b> of torture by the FPA pertains to two locations in the 13th arrondissement.|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} an ex post, {{critical}} {{contribution to the}} research conducted by the World Health Organisation on healthcare financing. The issue of national healthcare systems’ efficiency is addressed, through building a model of change in healthcare quality, in response to changes in healthcare financing, with the core hypothesis stating that the greater is the change in healthcare expenditures, the lesser is their efficiency in terms of healthcare quality improvement. Then, empirical evidence is provided, with econometric research proving the robustness of the model; further, qualitative research provides <b>strong</b> <b>presumptions</b> to a more general thesis, namely that healthcare systems bear significant transaction costs, proportional to their demographically defined size. Thus, important, and negative effects of scale are to assume in healthcare financing. ...|$|R
40|$|Warnings {{about climate}} change {{invariably}} stress water-related effects. Such effects are typically framed as both unpredictable and disruptive, and are thus said to create large new risks to the water sector demanding adaptive responses. This article examines how such responses are mediated by, and also compromised by, two dominant trends {{in the evolution of}} water governance institutions: (1) the rise of an “integrated” paradigm of water resources management, which has encouraged the development of more complex and interconnected water institutions, and (2) the rapidly changing political economy of water financing and investment. Each of these trends carries its own <b>strong</b> <b>presumptions</b> about what constitutes water-related risk and how such risk is properly managed. The article uses the specific example of large dam projects to illustrate how these ongoing trends in water governance shape and complicate the prospect of managing climate-water risks...|$|R
