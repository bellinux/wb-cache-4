The <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> approach for the inventory model consists of finding the most unfavorable distribution for each decision variable and then minimizing over the decision variable.

It is supposedd that under the basic hypothesis the trend coefficient depends on the finite dimensional parameter and we study the Cramer-von Mises type statistics. The underlying statistics depends on the deviation of the local time estimator from the invariant density with parameter replaced by the maximum likelihood estimator. We propose a linear transformation which yields the convergence of the test statistics to the integral of Wiener process.

40|$|The {{problems}} {{of the construction of}} the asymptotically <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> goodness-of-fit tests for three models of stochastic processes are considered. The null hypothesis for all models is composite parametric. All tests are based on the score-function processes, where the unknown parameter is replaced by the MLE. We show that a special change of time transforms the limit score-function processes into the Brownian bridge. This property allows us to construct the asymptotically <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> tests for the following three models of stochastic processes : dynamical systems with small noise, ergodic diffusion processes, inhomogeneous Poisson processes and nonlinear AR time series.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the number of principal components problem. In order to accomplish this objective the problems associated with principal components analysis were presented, an exposition of principal components analysis was given, the literature on the number of factors problem was reviewed, and three new <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> sphericity tests proposed by Harshman and Reddon (1983) were presented. The empirical research focused on the evaluation of these new tests and the comparison of these new tests with four other commonly used test procedures.;The evaluation of the three <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> sphericity tests focused on the evaluation of the equivalence of the marginal distributions with the marginal distributions under the null hypothesis. Of the three tests only the residual observation permutation test was found to be sufficiently <b>distribution</b> <b>free.</b> In the next stage of the research a series of matrices, with correlational scaling, were constructed and the power and type one error rates in determining the dimensionality of a principal components solution was assessed.
