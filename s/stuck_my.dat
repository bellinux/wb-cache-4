In fact, I <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> neck out a million miles. I must say, though, that frankly {{it never occurred to me}} that Keith's engine would be anything other than a tremendous success. He'd had such a good record all along, and we knew where he'd been." [...] Hayes to journalist John Blunsden at the 1997 30th birthday party of the DFV at Donington Park ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{turned away}} from them, put my foot on the fender, <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> elbow on the plush-fringed mantelboard, and studied the photographs, pipes, and ash-trays that adorned it. What was it I had to think out before I went to the station? ...|$|E
60|$|No doubt but I spoke {{bitter and}} sharp. My heart was bitter. I blamed {{myself and the}} girl and hated both of us: her for the vile crew that she was come of, myself for my wanton folly to have <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> head in such a byke of wasps.|$|E

60|$|Then {{she glanced}} at me with a smile, half-sweet, half-wistful, that has <b>stuck</b> in <b>my</b> memory for ever.|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} make a jest of it and to speak lightly, but the words still <b>stuck</b> in <b>my</b> throat.|$|R
60|$|I {{stuck at}} this point partly for want of words and partly because my snow-shoes, {{catching}} on a twig, sent my {{feet into the air}} and <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> head and shoulders deep into a drift of snow. Though my words were stopped, however, the gush of my enthusiasm flowed steadily on.|$|E
60|$|DEARTH. Yes, that is {{the tree}} I <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> easel under last night, and behold the blessed moon {{behaving}} more gorgeously than ever.

I wish I'd stuck it farther out. Say, I saw Rob MacAllister from over-harbour there. Wonder if he'll tell Mrs. Wiley on me." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I stopped short. Her {{eyes were}} fixed upon mine and the lie <b>stuck</b> in <b>my</b> throat. I went on desperately.|$|R
60|$|I {{suppose it}} was the smile <b>stuck</b> in <b>my</b> memory, for I spoke back sharp. “She doesn’t look that sort,” I cried.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{called that}} man {{to one side}} and herded him into a corner. I unbuttoned enough to show him a thirty-eight I carried <b>stuck</b> under <b>my</b> vest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Short an' sweet!" [...] ejaculated Springer, and {{he removed}} his black sombrero to poke a dirty {{forefinger}} through a buffet hole in the crown. [...] "Thet's how close I come to cashin'. I was lyin' behind a log, listenin' an' watchin', an' when I <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> head up a little--zam! Somebody made my bonnet leak." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They say I'm {{the last}} new baronet. Well, I ain't ashamed of that; not a bit. When will Mr Moffat get himself made a baronet? No man can truly say I'm too proud of it. I have never stuck myself up; no, nor <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> wife up either: but I don't see {{much to be}} ashamed of because the bigwigs chose to make a baronet of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{knew it was}} wrong," [...] {{admitted}} Davy uncomfortably, [...] "but plum jam {{is awful}} nice, Anne.

60|$|As soon as I {{had made}} an end in proper style, I laid down my gun, <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> knife between my teeth, walked right up to that tree, and began to climb. I tell you my heart was like ice. But presently, as I went up, I caught another glimpse of the thing, and that {{relieved}} me, for I thought {{it seemed like a}} box; and when I had got right up to it I near fell out of the tree with laughing.|$|E
60|$|But I was desperate. I clasped {{the post}} {{that they put}} in the bow of canal-boats; I <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> toes and my finger-nails in the cracks between the boards--how glad I was that the boat was an old one and had cracks!--and so, painfully and slowly, {{slipping}} part way down once or twice, and besliming myself from chin to foot, I climbed up that post and scrambled upon deck. In an instant, I {{reached the top of}} the stairs, and in another instant I rushed below.|$|E
6000|$|... "To save my life, I don't know. I {{have one}} friend, a most {{intelligent}} chap that writes sober, scientific books, and he's always aching to throw an egg into an electric fan {{to see what}} will happen. Perhaps that's {{the way it was}} with me, except that there was no aching. When I saw those legs flying past, I merely <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> stick in between. I didn't know I was going to do it. I just did it. Timothy McManus was no more surprised than I was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I'd {{have done}} better if I'd <b>stuck</b> to <b>my</b> rags, or else bought a pair of what that fellow called river-Jacks' boots," [...] he commented ruefully.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was waiting}} in the upper chamber,' said she, 'and a nail of the man-eater's <b>stuck</b> under <b>my</b> nail, and I fell dead upon the ground. That is all I know.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} these things, I suppose, because I had {{nothing else to}} think about. And the names <b>stuck</b> in <b>my</b> memory, intensified by later events, until I began to write a diary.|$|R
60|$|The {{end of the}} {{cylinder}} was being screwed out from within. Nearly two feet of shining screw projected. Somebody blundered against me, and I narrowly missed being pitched onto {{the top of the}} screw. I turned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of {{the cylinder}} fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion. I <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again. For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you can't understand," [...] she said,--"I couldn't {{make you}} understand--what {{it means to}} {{me to think that}} very soon I shall have a glimpse, at any rate, into the world. If I had met you three weeks ago, {{probably}} I shouldn't have dreamed of waking you up. I should have let you get wet and then laughed at you. If you had ventured to speak to me, I should probably have <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> nose in the air and walked away. You see how mellowing an influence even the possibility of escape is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I wriggled {{up behind}} the Predikant as he sat glowering over Red-Beard, and <b>stuck</b> <b>my</b> knife into his back where I thought it would kill him at once. But it didn't, Baas, for he fell on {{to his face and}} began to make a noise like a wounded hyena before I could finish him. Then I heard a sound of shouts, and to save my life was obliged to run away into the mist, without loosing Red-Beard or seeing Lady Sad-Eyes. I ran very hard, Baas, making a wide circle to the left, and so at last got back here. That's all, Baas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal!" [...] he ejaculated, as if shocked into memory, {{and slowly}} {{he rose to}} hold out a shaking hand. [...] "Bill's kid--the little boy who <b>stuck</b> by <b>my</b> wife--when Lucy was born." ...|$|R

5000|$|Hancock met his wife, Iranian-born Shari Eftekhari, {{during a}} George Best and Rodney Marsh {{football}} roadshow in Staines, Surrey. Hancock proposed to Shari in a pub: [...] "We were playing {{pool in the}} Nellie Dean. I said to Shari: 'Have I got something <b>stuck</b> between <b>my</b> teeth?' As she looked I <b>stuck</b> out <b>my</b> tongue - there was an engagement ring on it. She said: 'That's lovely, yes, I will - but can we change the ring?"
