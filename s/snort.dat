5|$|Mephedrone {{can come}} in the form of capsules, tablets or white powder that users may swallow, <b>snort,</b> inject, smoke or use rectally. When taken orally, users {{reported}} they could feel the effects within 15–45 minutes; when snorted, the effects were felt within minutes and peaked within half an hour. The effects last for between two and three hours when taken orally or nasally, but only half an hour if taken intravenously. It is sometimes sold mixed with methylone in a product called bubbles in the UK and also mixed with other cathinones, including ethcathinone, butylone, fluoromethcathinone and methedrone.|$|E
50|$|Insufflation (<b>snorting</b> or sniffing) {{is usually}} safer than {{injection}} {{in terms of}} the relative danger of transmission of blood-borne viruses. However, the membranes in the nose are very delicate and can rupture when <b>snorting,</b> so users should have their own <b>snorting</b> equipment not shared with anyone else, in order to prevent viral transmission. As with injection, a clean preparation surface is required to prepare a drug for <b>snorting.</b> Nasal membranes can be seriously damaged from regular <b>snorting.</b>|$|R

40|$|Cocaine is a powerfully {{addictive}} stimulant drug. The powdered hydrochloride salt form {{of cocaine}} can be <b>snorted</b> or dissolved {{in water and}} injected.

The term “crack ” refers to the crackling sound produced by the rock as it is heated. How is Cocaine Abused?

5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive <b>snort,</b> made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, <b>snort</b> and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E

25|$|A {{simple method}} {{requiring}} no specialized equipment is to <b>snort</b> water from cupped hands, but this clears {{little more than}} the nostrils.

25|$|The plains zebra is {{a highly}} social species, forming harems with a single stallion, several mares and their recent offspring; there are also {{bachelor}} groups. Groups may come together to form herds. The animals keep watch for predators rather than attempting to hide; they bark or <b>snort</b> {{when they see a}} predator, and the harem stallion attacks predators to defend his harem. The species population is stable and not endangered, though some populations such as in Tanzania have declined sharply.|$|E

25|$|Elephant seals {{communicate}} though various means. Males will threaten {{each other}} with the <b>snort,</b> a sound caused by expelling air though their probosces, and the clap-trap, a loud, clapping sound comparable {{to the sound of}} a diesel engine. Pups will vocalize when stressed or when prodding their mothers to allow them to suckle. Females make an unpulsed attraction call when responding to their young, and a harsh, pulsed call when threatened by other females, males or alien pups. Elephant seals produce low-frequency sounds, both substrate-borne and air-borne. These sounds help maintain social hierarchy in crowded or noisy environments and reduce energy consumption when fasting.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to <b>snort</b> the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E
25|$|For {{protection}} from land predators, the plains zebra retreats into open areas with good visibility at night. When the groups forage or sleep, one zebra will keep watch, {{and if a}} predator is spotted, it will bark or <b>snort</b> loudly. When being hunted by hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra harem stays close together and cooperates to protect threatened members, particularly the young. The harem stallion will go on the offensive and attack the dogs or hyenas. Though hyenas may harass the stallion, they usually only concentrate on the herd, and attempt to dodge the stallion's assaults. Unlike stallions, mares typically only react aggressively to hyenas or dogs when their foals are threatened. Unlike wildebeest, zebras rarely take to water when escaping hyenas. With lions, a zebra's best defense is to outpace them, as lions do not have as much endurance as hyenas or wild dogs. Cheetahs and leopards are mostly threats to foals, as an adult zebra is fully capable of driving them away.|$|E

They {{communicate with each other}} using pheromones detected by flehmen and several forms of vocal communication. One of these is a metallic <b>snort</b> or an echoing [...] "hick", that can be heard up to 1500 metres (1 mile) away. They are preyed on by animals like lion, spotted hyena, Cape hunting dog, leopard, cheetah and crocodile. Of these the calves are targeted mainly by the hyenas, while lions attack the adults.|$|E
500|$|Mephedrone, {{also known}} as 4-methyl methcathinone (4-MMC) or 4-methyl ephedrone, is a {{synthetic}} stimulant drug of the amphetamine and cathinone classes.

500|$|Pugs, {{like other}} short-snouted breeds, have {{elongated}} palates. When excited, they {{are prone to}} [...] "reverse sneezing" [...] which causes them to quickly (and seemingly laboriously) gasp and <b>snort.</b> The veterinary name for this is pharyngeal gag reflex and it is caused by fluid or debris getting caught under the palate and irritating the throat or limiting breathing. Reverse sneezing episodes are usually not harmful, and massaging the dog's throat or covering its nose {{in order to make}} it breathe through its mouth can often shorten a sneezing fit.|$|E
500|$|C.crispus is philopatric and territorial, {{and marks}} trees with sweet-sour-smelling preorbital gland {{secretions}} to indicate its territory.

[...] Aggression is rare, but the serow may react with hostility to territorial breaches. [...] The animal has few predators, as Japanese wolves have become extinct; bears may prey on the serow. [...] It flees with a whistling <b>snort</b> when it detects danger. [...] It is an agile, sure-footed mountain dweller that is able to sprint up mountains and to jump from cliff to cliff to safety, an agility hunters have likened to the ninja.|$|E
