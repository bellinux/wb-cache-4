5|$|Back on the ward, {{a father}} and his two daughters have been brought in, one with a stab wound and one badly burnt. The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police seem to believe he had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the incident. Maddy tries {{to find out what}} is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. She seems to have some connection with him but can't seem to put her finger on what it is.|$|E
5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought it had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> naval guns.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, The Amazing Maleeni, a small-time magician, performs an amazing feat to impress a heckler—he turns his head 360 degrees. So when he is later found without a head at all, Mulder and Scully arrive on the case and discover an angry ex-con, an unimpressed rival, and Maleeni’s twin brother. All seem to have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a plan to rob a major bank.|$|E

60|$|ERNEST (relieved). Ah, if you {{had that}} fellow's head, Treherne, you would find <b>something</b> better <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it than play cricket. I hear you bowl with your head.|$|R
5000|$|John Bach as Harry Sheridan, A Waimoana {{executive}} who Alec has vague memories of from before his current life. Alec {{believes that he}} has <b>something</b> crucial <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the mystery.|$|R
5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing the plane to explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed from the plane, including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche. The peer divided {{his time between}} the Riviera and a home in Hove, East Sussex. He had been due to return home on 10 November. After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may have had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the theft and financial loss.|$|E
5000|$|... "Edgar Allan Poe" [...] - Peppermint Patty, Lucy, Sally, Linus, Charlie Brown agonize {{over the}} teacher calling on them, {{figuring}} {{that no matter}} what, the teacher will ask them <b>something</b> having <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Edgar Allan Poe.|$|R
25|$|The {{myth that}} I had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> both <b>with</b> spurring the {{investigation}} and with airing {{all of this has}} stuck around because it is convenient for some to blame me rather than those aides who ran afoul of the law.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{whole truth}} is," [...] ses Charlie, looking round, [...] "I’ve got <b>something</b> better <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the money. I’ve {{got a chance}} offered me that’ll make me able to double it afore {{you know where you}} are." ...|$|R
5|$|Veronica and Tim {{investigate}} Hank’s alibi further, and it checks out, {{leading to}} his release. Veronica and Tim find secret phone recordings kept by Hank. Veronica brings Keith the CD, but he informs her that Hank has disappeared as well. We see Hank {{showing up on}} Mindy’s boat. While listening to the phone calls, Veronica notices Mindy and Hank talking about a place named “Papa’s cabin”. They investigate the most recent phone calls made by Hank, and find that his alibi was faked—he was helping the witness’s son escape foster care. Keith comes {{up with the idea}} that Papa’s cabin has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Ernest Hemingway. Keith visits the cabin, a retreat in Central America, before boarding the motorboat. He finds Hank, who says that he was working with her to kill the Dean. He says that he and Mindy had a fight, and Mindy fell overboard. We see Mindy’s body washed up on a beach.|$|E
25|$|The {{words are}} {{somewhat}} generic: henqêe {{may be used}} for any spotted cat, hushuee (hushuwee) for any running ground bird. 'Lion' and 'eland' use the same root. Blench (2008) thinks this may have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the eland being considered magical in the region.|$|E
25|$|Annie Proulx {{wrote an}} essay expressing her extreme {{disappointment}} {{in the film}} not winning the Best Picture Award. She intimated that Scientologists had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it, and that Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting required less skill than that required of the actors in Brokeback Mountain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} ought'er feel bad 'bout it if I don't," [...] Seth said, {{trying hard to}} appear unconcerned. [...] "People will know you have <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> your money than buy swell clothes for me." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{technique}} {{may also}} be used to stop foreclosure long enough to allow another purchase, or <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the property.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few seconds}} the skipper of the Cormorant could not utter a word. He gazed at Fred Martin with his mouth partially, and his eyes wide, open. The {{thought that he was}} thus cordially {{received}} by the very man whose character he had so lately and so ungenerously traduced had <b>something,</b> perhaps, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his silence.|$|R
25|$|Maclean also criticised Dalyell for reiterating the programme's unfounded {{claims that}} the British or American {{security}} services may have had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Fletcher's death. He concluded by saying it was the Libyan nationals in the bureau who should be co-operating with the investigation into her murder.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 the BBC {{terminated}} Bernard Braden's {{late night}} show, On the Braden Beat, {{replacing it with}} a similar programme, That's Life!, introduced by Esther Rantzen, who had worked with Braden. The reasons seem a little complicated and may have had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Braden's contract to advertise margarine on ITV. However, although Braden himself was publicly circumspect about the decision, Kelly was forthright in condemning it and was plainly hostile towards Rantzen.|$|E
25|$|Dutch {{physicists}} Hendrik Casimir and Dirk Polder at Philips Research Labs {{proposed the}} existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947, this special form is called the Casimir–Polder force. After a conversation with Niels Bohr, who suggested it had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948 which is called the Casimir effect in the narrow sense.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Ann Veronica Smith," [...] the {{magistrate}} remarked {{when the case}} was all before him, [...] "you're a good-looking, strong, respectable gell, and it's a pity you silly young wimmin can't find <b>something</b> better <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> your exuberance. Two-and-twenty! I can't imagine what your parents can be thinking about to let you get into these scrapes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt ye are right," [...] said Barney. [...] "I've always bin {{of opinion}} {{that when a}} man feels very strong in his heart on any partic'lar subject it's {{a sure sign that}} the Almighty intends him <b>to</b> have <b>something</b> more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> that subject than other men who don't feel about it at all." ...|$|R
60|$|Ruth at once {{proceeded}} {{to relate the}} story of the watch, but we will not inflict it on the reader, as it has no particular bearing on our tale. It had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> however, <b>with</b> detaining Ruth far later than she had intended to remain, so that she jumped up hastily at last, saying she must really go home.|$|R
25|$|By birth Jeanne was {{connected}} to Clan Forbes. The marriage {{seems to have taken}} place a few years before Clan Leslie joined with Clan Gordon in their feud against Clan Forbes. The Leslie's were supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, Catholic pretender to the throne of England, who was imprisoned (and eventually executed) by Queen Elizabeth I and her son, the future James I of England, taken away to be raised protestant. These events {{may or may not have}} <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the later accusations that Thomas was an intelligencer for James I.|$|E
25|$|Some of La Fontaine's liveliest verses are {{addressed}} to the duchess Marie Anne Mancini, the youngest of Mazarin's nieces, and it is even probable that {{the taste of the}} duke and duchess for Ariosto had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the writing of his first work of real importance, the first book of the Contes, which appeared in 1664. He was then forty-three years old, and his previous printed productions had been comparatively trivial, though much of his work was handed about in manuscript long before it was regularly published.|$|E
25|$|Harald II died in 1018, and Cnut went to Denmark {{to affirm}} his {{succession}} to the Danish crown as Cnut II, stating {{his intention to}} avert attacks against England in a letter in 1019 (see above). It seems there were Danes in opposition to him, and an attack he carried out on the Wends of Pomerania may have had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> this. In this expedition, {{at least one of}} Cnut's Englishmen, Godwin, apparently won the king's trust after a night-time raid he personally led against a Wendish encampment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, `Waugh!' that's all you'll {{get out of}} {{him when}} he's puzzled," [...] said Archie; [...] "though what he means by {{it is more than}} I know. You must speak respectable English to a Red-skin if you want to {{convince}} him. Why, if he had understood you literally, you know--and obeyed you--he'd have had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> immediately <b>with</b> the lock of his gun." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{life was}} eminently {{wholesome}} and natural. Early to bed, he slept like an infant and was {{up with the}} dawn. Always <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>with</b> a thousand little things that enticed but did not clamor, he was himself never overdone. Nevertheless, {{there were times when}} both he and Dede were not above confessing tiredness at bedtime after seventy or eighty miles in the saddle.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, no! I couldn't do that!" [...] said Adeline, nervously. [...] "They will {{telephone}} {{the answer}} up to Elbridge. But {{come home with}} me, if you haven't <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and stay <b>with</b> us till we--" ...|$|R
25|$|In December 2006, two Nithari {{residents}} {{claimed they}} knew {{the location of the}} remains of children who had gone missing in the previous two years: the municipal water tank behind house D5. Both had daughters who were missing, and they suspected Surinder Koli, the domestic help at D5, had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the disappearances. The residents claimed they had been repeatedly ignored by local authorities; therefore, they sought the help of former Resident Welfare Association (RWA) President S C Mishra. That morning, Mishra and the two residents searched the tank drain. One of the residents claimed to have found a decomposed hand, after which they called the police.|$|E
25|$|A 13th century {{northern}} English source {{claims that}} William was Mormaer of Moray. As this source {{had no reason}} to deceive, it is highly likely that William was made the ruler of Moray after the defeat of King Óengus of Moray in 1130. It is feasible that this grant had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the coming of age of David's son, Prince Henry and may also be a factor in his marriage to a daughter of Óengus. As well as being the ruler of Moray, William controlled the English lands of Allerdale, Skipton and Craven, making him one of the greatest barons of northern England.|$|E
25|$|After Attlee and Greenwood left, Chamberlain asked whom {{he should}} {{recommend}} to the King as his successor. The {{version of events}} given by Churchill is that Chamberlain's preference for Halifax was obvious (Churchill implies that the spat between Churchill and the Labour benches the previous night had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> that); {{there was a long}} silence which Halifax eventually broke by saying he did not believe he could lead the government effectively as a member of the House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Churchill's version gets the date wrong, and he fails to mention the presence of David Margesson, the government Chief Whip.|$|E
60|$|It was now noontime, and a hasty mess {{was served}} all around, {{and the men}} {{continued}} <b>to</b> air themselves, <b>something</b> easy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the ponderous ship speeding the waters at an eighteen-knot rate. Suddenly from the Oregon came the boom of a thirteen-inch gun, and the shell fell just astern of the Colon, sending the water up like a fountain. The battle was again on.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Duke de Chartres, and Count D'Estang," [...] {{said the}} Doctor; [...] "they {{appointed}} for last night, {{but did not}} come. Captain, this has <b>something</b> indirectly <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> your affair. Through the Duke, Count D'Estang has spoken to the King about the secret expedition, the design of which you first threw out. Call early to-morrow, and I will inform you of the result." ...|$|R
60|$|Jarl, however, {{was skeptical}} to the last; and never {{could be brought}} {{completely}} to credit the tale. He stoutly maintained that the hobgoblins must have had <b>something</b> or other <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the Parki.|$|R
