5|$|In {{his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Bach {{performed}} 18 cantatas composed by his relative Johann Ludwig Bach, a court musician in Meiningen. He then <b>set</b> <b>some</b> {{of the texts}} himself, including this cantata, written probably by Ernst Ludwig, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. They follow a pattern: seven movements are divided in two parts, both beginning with biblical quotations, Part I from the Old Testament, Part II from the New Testament.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} sequel, Devil May Cry 2, Dante {{is shown to}} have a habit of {{flipping}} a coin to make his decisions, although it is revealed {{at the end of}} the game that both sides of the coin are heads. <b>Set</b> <b>some</b> time after the first game, Devil May Cry 2 focuses on aiding the character Lucia in defeating Arius, an international businessman who uses demonic power and seeks to conquer the world. At the end of the game, Dante must go into the demon world to stop a demon lord from escaping, but the gate closes behind him and he is trapped. With no way back to the human world, Dante heads even deeper into the demon world on his motorcycle.|$|E
5|$|As soon as late 1961, United Artists {{started a}} {{marketing}} campaign to make James Bond a well-known name in North America. Newspapers received a box set of Bond's books, {{as well as}} a booklet detailing the Bond character and a picture of Ursula Andress. Eon and United Artists made licensing deals revolving around the character's tastes, having merchandising tie-ins with drink, tobacco, men's clothing and car companies. The campaign also focused on Ian Fleming's name due to the minor success of the books. After Dr. No had a successful run in Europe, Sean Connery and Terence Young did a cross-country tour in March 1963, which featured screening previews for the film and press conferences. It culminated in a well-publicised premiere in Kingston, where most of the film is <b>set.</b> <b>Some</b> of the campaign emphasised the sex appeal of the film, with the poster artwork, by Mitchell Hooks, depicting Sean Connery and four scantily clad women. The campaign also included the 007 logo designed by Joseph Caroff with a pistol as part of the seven.|$|E

5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon <b>set.</b> <b>Some</b> weapons may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
5|$|With Charles V {{distracted by}} the {{internal}} politics of his many kingdoms and external threats, and Henry and Francis on relatively good terms, domestic and not foreign policy issues had been Henry's priority {{in the first half}} of the 1530s. In 1536, for example, Henry granted his assent to the Laws in Wales Act 1535, which legally annexed Wales, uniting England and Wales into a single nation. This was followed by the Second Succession Act (the Act of Succession 1536), which declared Henry's children by Jane to be next in the line of succession and declared both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate, thus excluding them from the throne. The king was also granted the power to further determine the line of succession in his will, should he have no further issue. However, when Charles and Francis made peace in January 1539, Henry became increasingly paranoid, perhaps as a result of receiving a constant list of threats to the kingdom (real or imaginary, minor or serious) supplied by Cromwell in his role as spymaster. Enriched by the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry used some of his financial reserves to build a series of coastal defences and <b>set</b> <b>some</b> aside for use in the event of a Franco-German invasion.|$|E

25|$|Marino's verse {{was very}} popular with {{contemporary}} Italian composers, including Claudio Monteverdi who set several of Marino's poems in his collections of madrigals, beginning with the Sixth Book published in 1614. In 1626, Domenico Mazzocchi drew on Marino's epic for his opera La catena d'Adone ("The Chain of Adonis"). Filippo Bonaffino also <b>set</b> <b>some</b> of his work to music in book of madrigals.|$|E
25|$|For efficiency, Prolog code is {{typically}} compiled to abstract machine code, often {{influenced by the}} register-based Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) instruction <b>set.</b> <b>Some</b> implementations employ abstract interpretation to derive type and mode information of predicates at compile time, or compile to real machine code for high performance. Devising efficient implementation methods for Prolog code is a field of active research in the logic programming community, and various other execution methods are employed in some implementations. These include clause binarization and stack-based virtual machines.|$|E

25|$|The Sims 2 is <b>set</b> <b>some</b> 25 {{years after}} the {{original}} game. For instance, the Goth family has aged significantly with Bella Goth mysteriously vanishing ("dying") {{at some point in}} the 25-year period. Because the entire game has progressed from 2D sprites to 3D models, all content in The Sims 2 had to be created from the ground up. Due to this, The Sims 2 was not made backwards-compatible with any content from the first generation of the main series. However, some objects and features from the original series were remade for this sequel.|$|E

In 1983-4 Shadows set FAI world class records for speed over 3km and for range and in 1990 set a UK class altitude record of 23,648ft (7,208 m). This altitude was bettered {{in the same year}} when David Cook took a Streak to 27,066ft (8,250 m), another UK record.|$|E
25|$|For {{various reasons}} {{it has become}} quite {{difficult}} to accurately assess reserves on more than simple loan instruments, and this plus the regional differences has tended to discourage standardizing any reserve rules at the global BIS scale. Historically, the BIS did <b>set</b> <b>some</b> standards which favoured lending money to private landowners (at about 5 to 1) and for-profit corporations (at about 2 to 1) over loans to individuals. These distinctions reflecting classical economics were superseded by policies relying on undifferentiated market values â€“ {{more in line with}} neoclassical economics.|$|E
