This paper reports {{the outcomes of}} an effect of sound created by rain fall on un-insulated metal <b>deck</b> <b>roofs</b> towards people's activities. The measurement and questionnaire distribution was done at selected UiTM buildings that have been built using un-insulated metal <b>deck</b> <b>roofs.</b> It {{was found that the}} occupants facing inconveniences condition that can disturb their activities. The comfort noise level that accepted by the human being is between 55 to 60 dB. Therefore, this study substantiates the notion that rain noise can contribute to negative effects in people's lives during rain...|$|R

5000|$|Because of {{the sliding}} doors which {{enclosed}} the motorman's vestibules {{from the rest}} of the car compartment, the cars were nicknamed Merry Widows. Early on, they were also known as Battleships, a reference to their second paint scheme where the siding was painted Battleship Grey. However, the nickname did not stick, and was later given to the <b>Deck</b> <b>Roof</b> Hi-V cars, which were painted the same color. Today, references to the [...] "Battleships" [...] are generally assumed to be in reference to the <b>Deck</b> <b>Roof</b> cars, as opposed to the Gibbs cars.|$|R

This building is two storeys and constructed of brick with concrete floors and a flat metal <b>deck</b> <b>roof.</b> Essentially the building is visually detached from Yungaba due to its lower level siting and line of mature trees which create a barrier between to the two parts of the site.|$|R
50|$|ICF decking is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular addition to general ICF wall construction. ICF decking weighs up to 40% less than standard concrete flooring and provides superior insulation. ICF decking can also be designed in conjunction with ICF walls to form a continuous monolithic structure joined together by rebar. ICF <b>deck</b> <b>roofs</b> are less common, as {{it is difficult to}} pour concrete on an angled surface.|$|R

Thus, the manual door controls of the <b>Deck</b> <b>Roof</b> were reliable, as the side vestibule doors {{at either end}} of the train can be opened manually even if the entire car isn't on the platform. However, two conductors were required for ooperation of manual door controlled cars.|$|R

The broken profile of roofs scattered and staggered over the steep slope and the consequent changing perspective together with the remnant regrowth eucalypt vegetation reinforced by landscaping based on Australian native species providing shade and shadow to white washed walls all serve to visually enliven the courtyard spaces and pathways on the site.|$|R
