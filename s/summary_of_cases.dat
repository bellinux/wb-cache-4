As a result, 6 male cases and 26 female cases, totalling 32 cases, of radiation-induced tumor were detected. These 32 cases were compiled after being classified into four categories of 1) malignant tumor developing after radiation therapy for malignant tumor, 2) malignant tumor after radiation therapy for benign condition, 3) benign tumor after radiation therapy for malignant tumor, and 4) benign tumor after radiation therapy for benign condition...|$|E

We encountered two cases of chyle leak in kidney donors in our series of open donor nephrectomies. <b>Summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cases.</b> After complete workup, standard open retroperitoneal donor nephrectomy with drain placement was performed in 684 living renal donors. We encountered chyle leak in two cases. The first case was a 33 -year-old female who underwent an otherwise uneventful left donor nephrectomy but continued to have high drain output (upto 300 – 400 [*]mL/ 24 [*]hrs) in the postoperative period. The drain fluid was milky, raising the suspicion of chyle which was confirmed on biochemical analysis. The second case was a 42 -year-old female with a similar case history. Both were managed conservatively with low-fat diet. The leak subsided spontaneously in three weeks and one week in the first and second patients, respectively. The drain was removed, and the patients remained symptom-free on followup. Conclusions. Both of our cases of chyle leak following open donor nephrectomy were managed successfully with conservative management. The management options and the experience of other centers are reviewed and discussed...|$|E

This paper discusses a range of extracervical lymphangioma cases seen at San Fernando General Hospital, Trinidad W. I. We report three intra-abdominal cases and the most common clinical presentations were abdominal pain and distension.

30|$|Morcellation is used {{to prevent}} {{laparotomy}} and its associated disadvantages. Morcellation allows large leiomyomas to be removed after an endoscopic procedure. Morcellators are available already from 1973 onwards. They are used to reduce surgical specimens and allow their extraction, therefore preventing the need for laparotomy and its associated disadvantages. Yet the technique itself has also disadvantages, including surgical risks, spread of benign disease and spread of malignant disease. Surgical risks refer to damage to surrounding tissue, including bowel, blood vessels, bladder, kidney and ureter. Spread of benign disease mainly refers to diffuse peritoneal leiomyomatosis and parasitic myomas. The focus of the current debate is on the risk of spreading malignant disease. A follow-up study in patients with ESS in whom the tumor was morcellated showed a shorter disease free interval as compared to patients in whom {{this was not the}} case (total n[*]=[*] 50) [4]. Survival was not different but this may be due to a relative short follow-up and the indolent nature of ESS. However, patients are more likely to undergo repeat surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and lifelong hormonal treatment reducing their quality of life. A recent <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of uterine power morcellation with follow-up exploratory laparotomy [5], revealed unexpected diagnoses in 1.2  % of 1091 patients who had their uterus morcellated following hysterectomy. 0.09  % were unexpected LMS cases. Disseminated disease occurred in 64.3  % of all (in house and consultation) tumors, including 0 / 1 ESS, 1 / 1 cellular leiomyoma, 0 / 1 atypical leiomyoma, 4 / 4 STUMPs and 4 / 7 LMSs. Only disseminated leiomyosarcoma, however, was associated with mortality. For more indolent malignancies, length of follow-up (averaging less than 3  years) may not be sufficient to identify increased morbidity or mortality for dissemination of such lesions. Similar studies refer to the same risk of uterine LMS spread [6, 7].|$|E

40|$|Measured {{in terms}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality, plague {{has never been a}} major public health problem in the United States, but, {{in terms of}} latent danger and the total cost of suppressive measures during the past 50 years, it cannot be placed in a minor classification. This disease, which {{has been one of the}} world's greatest killers, has forced the spending of large amounts of money on efforts to keep it out of this country, to suppress the epidemics which did gain a foothold, and to control or eradicate epizootics in domestic and wild rodents. Modern methods of rodent and ectoparasite control, together with almost specific therapeutic drugs, have decreased the potential danger from plague. Arrival at this turning point makes it particularly fitting to review the accomplishments of the past five decades, to summarize the cooperative efforts of the Public Health Service and the State health departments, and to emphasize specific contributions by individuals of the Public Health Service.
