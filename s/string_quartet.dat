5|$|Bennett {{had been}} {{impressed}} in Leipzig {{with the concept}} of chamber music concerts, which had been, apart from <b>string</b> <b>quartet</b> recitals, a rarity in London. He began in 1843 a series of such concerts including piano trios of Louis Spohr and Ludwig van Beethoven, works for piano solo, and string sonatas by Mendelssohn and others. Amongst those taking part in these recitals were the piano virtuoso Alexander Dreyschock and Frédéric Chopin's pupil, the 13-year old Carl Filtsch.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Wilcher {{released}} Heaven-Haven. The {{music was}} performed by The Linden <b>String</b> <b>Quartet.</b> During production of the CD, Wilcher saw press reports about the fatal attack of 18-year-old Sydney resident Thomas Kelly; Wilcher was unable to separate the sorrow he felt for Kelly and his family from the sentiment {{he was trying to}} convey through his music. He eventually dedicated the project to Kelly and announced that proceeds from the album would benefit the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{recorded}} {{their performance}} on May 13, 2011 at Sony Music Studios in New York City. The show featured {{a number of}} musicians from the Vitamin <b>String</b> <b>Quartet</b> and back-up vocalists from The Late Show's Gospel Choir. It marked the first live performance by the former. The show was produced by Lee Rolontz, Jay Peterson and Leah Culton-Gonzales through the production company Original Media.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} drums, {{bass and}} most of the guitars, the band, Giordano and Parker moved to Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey. The rest of the guitars and the vocals, strings and cowbells were recorded there, and recording was complete by April. Giordano, Parker and Ted Young mixed the recordings, and Ted Jensen did the mastering; Mike Sapone contributed programming to the songs. Girl Next Door <b>String</b> <b>Quartet</b> provided the strings, arranged by conductor Ray Zu-Artez (who played piano). Neil Rubenstein of These Enzymes and Nick Torres of Northstar contributed vocals to some songs. In retrospect, Fred Mascherino considered the sessions rushed.|$|E
50|$|The Hungarian {{composer}} György Ligeti published three <b>string</b> <b>quartets</b> {{throughout his}} life - 2 <b>string</b> <b>quartets</b> proper (1953-54, 1968), and a student piece from 1950 published {{towards the end of}} Ligeti's life. The first two <b>string</b> <b>quartets</b> proper represent both his early period, inspired by Béla Bartók, and middle period, which was largely micropolyphonic. In 2012, sketches and notes for his projected <b>String</b> <b>Quartets</b> Nos. 3 & 4 were discovered by Bianca Ţiplea Temeș at the Paul Sacher Stiftung, and they would represent Ligeti's late period.|$|R

5|$|The Sitwells {{looked after}} their protégé both {{materially}} and culturally, giving him {{not only a}} home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental <b>string</b> <b>quartet</b> heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher {{and the founder of}} the Second Viennese School.|$|E

5|$|The first {{movement}} is in cut common (2/2) time. It {{starts with the}} cello, alone, playing eight quarter notes on the same B-flat. It is not until the third measure of the movement that the violins and viola enter. The cello's eight throbbing notes act as more than an introduction. They reappear at critical junctures throughout the movement, including {{at the beginning of}} the development and recapitulation sections, illustrating that they are part of the movement's primary thematic material. The melody that follows the eight cello notes is echoed in Beethoven's <b>String</b> <b>Quartet</b> No. 1 (Op. 18, No. 1).|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the film}} {{featured}} {{a number of}} pieces of classical music, as the main Bond girl, Kara Milovy, is a cellist. Mozart's 40th Symphony in G minor (1st movement) is performed by the orchestra at the Conservatoire in Bratislava when Koskov flees. As Moneypenny tells Bond, Kara is next to perform Alexander Borodin's <b>String</b> <b>Quartet</b> in D major, and the finale to Act II of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (in Vienna) also features. Before Bond is drugged by Kara, she is practising the Cello solo from the first movement of Dvořák's cello concerto in B minor. At {{the end of the}} film, Kara and an orchestra (conducted onscreen by John Barry) perform Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations to rapturous applause.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s {{there were}} a few more Fauré works in the catalogues. A survey by John Culshaw in December 1945 singled out {{recordings}} of piano works played by Kathleen Long (including the Nocturne No. 6, Barcarolle No. 2, the Thème et Variations, Op. 73, and the Ballade Op. 19 in its orchestral version conducted by Boyd Neel), the Requiem conducted by Ernest Bourmauck, and seven songs sung by Maggie Teyte. Fauré's music began to appear more frequently in the record companies' releases in the 1950s. The Record Guide, 1955, listed the Piano Quartet No. 1, Piano Quintet No. 2, the <b>String</b> <b>Quartet,</b> both Violin Sonatas, the Cello Sonata No. 2, two new recordings of the Requiem, and the complete song cycles La bonne chanson and La chanson d'Ève.|$|E

5|$|For his <b>String</b> <b>Quartet,</b> Lutosławski had {{produced}} only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind {{them in a}} full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.|$|E
5|$|Prokofiev {{had been}} {{considering}} making an opera out of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War and Peace, when {{news of the}} German invasion of Russia on 22June 1941 made the subject seem all the more timely. Prokofiev took two years to compose his original version of War and Peace. Because of the war he was evacuated together {{with a large number}} of other artists, initially to the Caucasus where he composed his Second <b>String</b> <b>Quartet.</b> By now, his relationship with the 25-year-old writer and librettist Mira Mendelson (1915–1968) had finally led to his separation from his wife Lina, although they never divorced: indeed Prokofiev had tried to persuade Lina and their sons to accompany him as evacuees out of Moscow, but Lina opted to stay.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused {{to talk about it}} until towards the end of his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second <b>String</b> <b>Quartet,</b> contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E

5|$|Born on 16 November 1945 in Brussels, van Hamel was the {{youngest}} of three siblings of Dutch parents. Her father, Diederik (Dick) Alfred van Hamel, was a diplomat stationed in Copenhagen. Her mother, Manette van Hamel (née Cramer), born in 1913 in Deventer, was a music teacher and violinist who played in a <b>string</b> <b>quartet.</b> Martine van Hamel began ballet lessons at the age of four in Copenhagen where it was common for children to study ballet. As a diplomat, her father was routinely stationed in different countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Indonesia. It was difficult for her to find teachers but she took lessons when possible. While her father was stationed in Caracas, Venezuela, van Hamel, then age ten, took classes with Henry Danton from The Royal Ballet. Danton frequently guest taught at the National Ballet of Venezuela. In 1958, she moved to Canada to study at Canada's National Ballet School with Betty Oliphant.|$|E
5|$|Cage {{dedicated}} Sonatas and Interludes to Maro Ajemian, {{a pianist}} and friend. Ajemian performed the work many times since 1949, {{including one of}} the first performances of the complete cycle on January 12, 1949, in Carnegie Hall. On many other occasions in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Cage performed it himself. Critical reaction was uneven, but mostly positive, and the success of Sonatas and Interludes led to a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, which Cage received in 1949, allowing him to make a six-month trip to Europe. There he met Olivier Messiaen, who helped organize a performance of the work for his students in Paris on June 7, 1949; and he befriended Pierre Boulez, who became an early admirer of the work and wrote a lecture about it for the June 17, 1949 performance at the salon of Suzanne Tézenas in Paris. While still living in Paris, Cage began writing <b>String</b> <b>Quartet</b> in Four Parts, yet another work influenced by Indian philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Lutosławski {{fulfilled}} {{a commission}} for the Music Biennale Zagreb, his Trois poèmes d'Henri Michaux for chorus and orchestra. It {{was the first}} work he had written for a commission from abroad, and brought him further international acclaim. It earned him a second State Prize for music (Lutosławski was not cynical about the award this time), and Lutosławski gained an agreement for the international publication of his music with Chester Music, then part of the Hansen publishing house. His <b>String</b> <b>Quartet</b> was first performed in Stockholm in 1965, followed the same year by the first performance of his orchestral song-cycle Paroles tissées. This shortened title was suggested by the poet , who had published the poems as Quatre tapisseries pour la Châtelaine de Vergi. The song cycle {{is dedicated to the}} tenor Peter Pears, who first performed it at the 1965 Aldeburgh Festival with the composer conducting. The Aldeburgh Festival was founded and organised by Benjamin Britten, with whom the composer formed a lasting friendship.|$|E
