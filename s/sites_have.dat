Significant European uses of the park's land have been Newman's Nursery, a main road, mines, quarries and a water filtration plant.|$|E
5|$|By 300CE {{some of the}} archaic groups {{developed}} into an early branch of seminomadic Anasazi, the Basketmakers. Basketmaker <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> grass- or stone-lined storage cists and shallow, partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture. Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade.|$|E
5|$|Licancabur is {{considered}} a holy mountain by the Atacameno people, related to the Cerro Quimal hill in northern Chile. Archeological <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> been found on its slopes and in the summit crater, which was possibly a prehistoric watchtower.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} European forts and settlements {{were established}} by traders {{beginning in the}} 1680s. Almost none of these ephemeral early historical <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> been located archaeologically. Julien Dubuque’s Mines of Spain settlement and adjacent Meskwaki village occupied in the late 18th century and early 19th century, {{has been the subject}} of numerous archaeological surveys. Fort Madison (1808–1813), the first American settlement and the first American fort in Iowa, was partially excavated in 1965. American settlement began in earnest in the 1830s, and the official removal of American Indians from Iowa was completed by 1852. Several of these historical <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> been excavated, including Gilbert’s Trading Post. and Fort Atkinson. Archaeologists have also studied historical American settlements, including excavations at the Plum Grove Historic House, the Buxton African-American community, and the Bowen’s Prairie community.|$|E

5|$|Excavations of Iron Age <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> {{recovered}} horse {{bones from}} ritual pits at a temple site near Cambridge, and around twenty Iron Age chariot burials have been found, {{including one of}} a woman discovered at Wetwang Slack. The majority of Iron Age chariot burials in Britain {{are associated with the}} Arras culture, and in most cases the chariots were dismantled before burial. Exceptions are the Ferrybridge and Newbridge chariots, which are the only ones found to have been buried intact. The Newbridge burial has been radiocarbon dated to 520–370BC, and the Ferrybridge burial is likely to be of similar date.|$|E

5|$|Golondrina {{points are}} {{widespread}} {{across much of}} central, southern, and western Texas, with distribution extending northward along the Balcones Escarpment. They are particularly prevalent across the South Texas Plains, so much {{so as to be}} said to represent the first unique cultural pattern in the area. Most Golondrina specimens from the South Texas Plains are not excavated but rather found on the site's surface. They often appear as part of mixed collections with artifacts of later periods. Several <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> also been found in Arkansas {{as well as in the}} Lower Pecos Canyonlands and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that biogas (mainly methane) – produced from the anaerobic digestion {{of organic matter}} – is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British anaerobic digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> {{the potential for a}} further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} a threatened species in the Åland Islands of Finland. A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in beech woods with broad-leaved grasses and herbs in topsoils with soil pH levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to soil acidification during the last several decades. Fruit bodies collected near arsenic-contaminated <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> been shown to bioaccumulate arsenic, largely {{in the form of}} arsenobetaine.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{culture has}} evolved greatly from its origins. Contemporary culture {{combines}} influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games.

Nineteen <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, fifteen of which are of cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|Many other <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> been suggested; {{historian}} Paul Hill identified {{over thirty}} possibilities. Michael Wood published a 2014 article suggesting a Yorkshire location; philologist Andrew Breeze favours Durham, and Kevin Halloran argues for southern Scotland. Tim Clarkson discounts locations other than southern Scotland or northern England as a battle site, given the logistical {{capacity of the}} kingdoms of Alba and Strathclyde.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{the species}} nor the <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> any current legal protection, {{and it could}} be under {{significant}} threat of survival in the long term from inappropriate gardening or care. Seed samples of the Radyr hawkweed have been provided to the Millennium Seed Bank, the international conservation project coordinated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and plants are being carefully cultivated. The plant normally flowers between May and early July and Radyr residents are urged by botanists to be on the look out for further examples of the endangered species while walking in the area.|$|E

5|$|South African cave <b>sites</b> <b>have</b> {{also contributed}} to the data {{regarding}} this shift with accurate dating due to deposits of volcanic ash, which have allowed these sites to be dated to between 999 and 49 thousand years ago.
