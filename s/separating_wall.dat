2500|$|On 29 June, after Ugandan {{soldiers}} had opened an {{entrance to a}} room next to the crowded waiting hall by destroying a <b>separating</b> <b>wall,</b> the hijackers separated the Israelis (including those holding dual citizenship) from the other hostages {{and told them to}} move to the adjoining room. As they did so, a Holocaust survivor showed Böse a camp registration number tattooed on his arm. Böse protested [...] "I'm no Nazi!... I am an idealist". In addition, five non-Israeli hostages – two ultra-orthodox Jewish couples from the US and Belgium and a French resident of Israel – were forced to join the Israeli group. According to Monique Epstein Khalepski, the French hostage among the five, the captors had singled them out for questioning and suspected them of hiding their Israeli identities. On the other hand, according to French hostage Michel Cojot-Goldberg, the captors failed to identify at least one Israeli among the passengers who was a military officer with dual citizenship then using his non-Israeli passport and he was later freed as part of the second release of non-Israeli hostages. US citizen Janet Almog, Frenchwoman Jocelyne Monier (whose husband or boyfriend was Israeli) and French-Israeli dual citizen Jean-Jacques Mimouni, whose name had not been called up during the reading of the original passport-based list, reportedly joined the Israeli hostage group by their own choice.|$|E
2500|$|A {{complementary}} observable {{aspect of}} the first law is about heat transfer. Adynamic transfer of energy as heat can be measured empirically by changes in the surroundings {{of the system of}} interest by calorimetry. This again requires the existence of adiabatic enclosure of the entire process, system and surroundings, though the <b>separating</b> <b>wall</b> between the surroundings and the system is thermally conductive or radiatively permeable, not adiabatic. A calorimeter can rely on measurement of sensible heat, which requires the existence of thermometers and measurement of temperature change in bodies of known sensible heat capacity under specified conditions; or it can rely on the measurement of latent heat, through measurement of masses of material that change phase, at temperatures fixed by the occurrence of phase changes under specified conditions in bodies of known latent heat of phase change. The calorimeter can be calibrated by adiabatically doing externally determined work on it. The most accurate method is by passing an electric current from outside through a resistance inside the calorimeter. The calibration allows comparison of calorimetric measurement of quantity of heat transferred with quantity of energy transferred as work. According to one textbook, [...] "The most common device for measuring [...] is an adiabatic bomb calorimeter." [...] According to another textbook, [...] "Calorimetry is widely used in present day laboratories." [...] According to one opinion, [...] "Most thermodynamic data come from calorimetry..." [...] According to another opinion, [...] "The most common method of measuring [...] "heat" [...] is with a calorimeter." ...|$|E

5000|$|A typical {{thermodynamic}} {{operation is}} a removal of an initially <b>separating</b> <b>wall,</b> a manipulation that unites two systems into one undivided system.

More generally, a process {{can be considered as}} a transfer of some quantity that is defined by an extensive state variable of the system, so that a transfer balance equation can be written. According to Uffink, [...] "... thermodynamic processes only take place after an external intervention on the system (such as: removing a partition, establishing thermal contact with a heat bath, pushing a piston, etc.). They do not correspond to the autonomous behaviour of a free system." ...|$|E
