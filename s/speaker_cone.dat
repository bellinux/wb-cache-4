500|$|The {{influential}} distortion {{sound of}} the guitar track was created after guitarist Dave Davies sliced the <b>speaker</b> <b>cone</b> of his guitar amplifier with a razor blade and poked it with a pin. The amplifier was affectionately called [...] "little green", after {{the name of the}} amplifier made by the Elpico company, and purchased in Davies' neighbourhood music shop, linked to a Vox AC-30. In 2014, Dave Davies accused brother Ray of lying about participating in Dave's guitar distortion sound. Dave wrote on his Facebook page, [...] "My brother is lying. I don't know why he [...] does this but it was my Elpico amp that I bought and out of frustration I cut the <b>speaker</b> <b>cone</b> up with a razor blade and I was so shocked and [...] surprised and excited that it worked that I demonstrated the sound to Ray and [...] Pete [...] … Ray liked the sound and he had written a riff on the piano which formed the basis of the song 'You Really Got Me' and I played the riff on my guitar with my new sound. I alone created this sound." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You Really Got Me", a Ray Davies song, {{influenced}} by American blues and the Kingsmen's version of [...] "Louie Louie", was recorded on 15 June 1964 at Pye studios with a slower and more produced feel than the final single. Ray Davies wanted to rerecord the song with a lean, raw sound, but Pye refused to fund another session; Davies took an adamant stand, so the producer, Shel Talmy, broke the stalemate by underwriting the session himself. The band used an independent studio, IBC, {{and went in}} on 15 July, getting it done in two takes. The single was released on August 1964, and, supported by a performance on the television show Ready Steady Go! and extensive pirate radio coverage, it entered the UK charts on 15 August, reaching number one on 19 September. Hastily imported by the American label Reprise Records, it also made the Top 10 in the United States. The loud, distorted guitar riff and solo on [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] was played by Dave Davies and achieved by a slice Dave Davies made in the <b>speaker</b> <b>cone</b> of his Elpico amplifier (referred to by the band as the [...] "little green amp")— helped with the song's signature, gritty guitar sound. [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] {{has been described as}} [...] "a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal", and as an influence on the approach of some American garage rock bands. After its release, the group recorded most of the tracks for their debut LP, simply titled Kinks. Consisting largely of covers and revamped traditional songs, it was released on 2 October 1964, reaching number four on the UK chart. The group's fourth single, [...] "All Day and All of the Night", another Ray Davies hard rock tune, was released three weeks later, reaching number two in the United Kingdom, and number seven in the United States. The next singles, [...] "Set Me Free" [...] and [...] "Tired of Waiting for You", were also commercially successful, the latter topping the UK singles chart.|$|E

2500|$|Instead of a {{voice coil}} driving a <b>speaker</b> <b>cone,</b> a magnetostatic speaker uses an array of metal strips bonded to a large film membrane. The {{magnetic}} field produced by signal current flowing through the strips interacts with the field of permanent bar magnets mounted behind them.

2500|$|Davies was solely {{responsible}} for the signature distorted power chord sound on the Kinks' first hit, [...] "You Really Got Me". He achieved the sound by using a razor blade to slit the <b>speaker</b> <b>cone</b> on his Elpico amplifier, which he then ran through a larger Vox as a [...] "pre-amp". This sound {{was one of the}} first mainstream appearances of guitar distortion, which was to have a major influence on many later musicians, especially in heavy metal and punk rock.|$|E
2500|$|Monitor loudspeakers, {{also called}} [...] "foldback" [...] loudspeakers, are speaker {{cabinets}} {{which are used}} onstage to help performers to hear their singing or playing. As such, monitor speakers are pointed towards a performer or {{a section of the}} stage. [...] They are generally sent a different mix of vocals or instruments than the mix that is sent to the main loudspeaker system. [...] Monitor loudspeaker cabinets are often a wedge shape, directing their output upwards towards the performer when set {{on the floor of the}} stage. [...] Two-way, dual driver designs with a <b>speaker</b> <b>cone</b> and a horn are common, as monitor loudspeakers need to be smaller to save space on the stage. [...] These loudspeakers typically require less power and volume than the main loudspeaker system, as they only need to provide sound for a few people who are in relatively close proximity to the loudspeaker. [...] Some manufacturers have designed loudspeakers for use either as a component of a small PA system or as a monitor loudspeaker. In the 2000s, a number of manufacturers produced powered monitor speakers, which contain an integrated amplifier.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, a fuzzy and {{somewhat}} distorted sound gained widespread popularity after guitarist Dave Davies of The Kinks used {{a razor blade}} to slash his <b>speaker</b> <b>cones</b> for the band's single [...] "You Really Got Me".|$|R
5000|$|During {{the final}} three {{years of his life}} he used Hartke {{cabinets}} because of the character of aluminum <b>speaker</b> <b>cones</b> (as opposed to paper <b>speaker</b> <b>cones).</b> These provided a bright, clear sound. He typically used the delay in a chorus-like mode, providing a shimmering stereo doubling effect. He often used the fuzz control built into the Acoustic 360. For the bass solo [...] "Slang" [...] on Weather Report's live album 8:30 (1979), Pastorius used the MXR digital delay to layer and loop a chordal figure and then soloed over it; the same technique, with a looped bass riff, can be seen during his solo on the Joni Mitchell concert video Shadows and Light.|$|R

50|$|A similar {{mechanism}} {{was used}} in the Vannevar Bush differential analyzer. The electrostatic drum amplifier used a band wrapped partway around a rotating drum, and fixed at its anchored end to a spring. The other end connected to a <b>speaker</b> <b>cone.</b> The input signal was transformed up to high voltage, and added to a high voltage DC supply line. This voltage was connected between drum and belt. Thus the input signal varied the electric field between belt and drum, and thus the friction between them, and thus the amount of lateral movement of the belt and thus <b>speaker</b> <b>cone.</b>|$|E
40|$|ModalMax {{is a very}} {{innovative}} {{means of}} harnessing the vibration of a piezoelectric actuator to produce an energy efficient low-profile device with high-bandwidth high-fidelity audio response. The piezoelectric audio device outperforms many commercially available speakers made using <b>speaker</b> <b>cones.</b> The piezoelectric device weighs substantially less (4 g) than the <b>speaker</b> <b>cones</b> which use magnets (10 g). ModalMax devices have extreme fabrication simplicity. The entire audio device is fabricated by lamination. The simplicity of the design lends itself to lower cost. The piezoelectric audio device can be used without its acoustic chambers and thereby resulting in a very low thickness of 0. 023 in. (0. 58 mm). The piezoelectric audio device can be completely encapsulated, which makes it very attractive for use in wet environments. Encapsulation does not significantly alter the audio response. Its small size (see Figure 1) is applicable to many consumer electronic products, such as pagers, portable radios, headphones, laptop computers, computer monitors, toys, and electronic games. The audio device {{can also be used}} in automobile or aircraft sound systems...|$|R

This requires the speaker {{to which it is}} directed to continue to respond to signals deep into the stopband where its physical characteristics may not be ideal. In the case of (b), above, both speakers are required to operate at higher volume levels as the signal nears the crossover points. This uses more amplifier power and may drive the <b>speaker</b> <b>cones</b> into non-linearity.|$|R
5000|$|Altec Lansing {{produced}} {{a line of}} professional and high-fidelity audio equipment, starting with a line of horn-based loudspeaker systems. First developed for use in motion picture theaters, these products were touted for their fidelity, efficiency and high sound level capability. Products included [...] "biflex" [...] speakers where frequency range was increased by a flexible [...] "decoupling" [...] of a small center area of the <b>speaker's</b> <b>cone</b> from a larger [...] "woofer" [...] area; the 604-series of coaxial speakers employed a high efficiency compression driver mounted {{to the rear of}} the 604's low-frequency magnet, and exited through a multicellular horn that passed through center of the woofer's cone.|$|R

50|$|Note that {{telecoil}} coupling {{has nothing}} to do with the radio signal in a cellular or cordless phone: the audio signal picked up by the telecoil is the weak electromagnetic field that is generated by the voice coil in the phone's speaker as it pushes the <b>speaker</b> <b>cone</b> back and forth.|$|E
50|$|Thus {{conventional}} speaker output, or the fidelity of the device, is {{distorted by}} physical limitations inherent in its design.

Additionally, speaker cones will eventually suffer tensile fatigue from the repeated shaking of sonic vibration.|$|E
50|$|From 2008 to 2012, {{there was}} an {{optional}} Bowers & Wilkins (B&W) sound system available. At its core there are 14 speakers which (with {{the exception of the}} aluminium high-frequency tweeters) employ B&W's Kevlar composite <b>speaker</b> <b>cones.</b> Each front door contains a 168 mm woofer, a 100 mm mid-range speaker and a 25 mm dome tweeter (the latter two wired in parallel with a crossover), while each rear door houses a similar 168 mm woofer and 25 mm tweeter. As a centre speaker there is a 100 mm full-range driver, similar to the two 100 mm full-range 'surround' speakers located on the rear parcel shelf.

50|$|By {{including}} a {{negative feedback loop}} in the amplifier-speaker system, distortion can be substantially reduced. If mounted at the <b>speaker</b> <b>cone,</b> the sensor is usually an accelerometer. It is possible to monitor the back emf generated by the driver voice coil as it moves within the magnetic gap. In either case, specialist amplifier designs are needed and so servo speakers are inherently powered speakers.|$|E
5000|$|Some bass {{amplifier}} combos have a [...] "whizzer cone" [...] {{attached to}} the low frequency woofer's centre.

5000|$|Burnel {{is noted}} for his {{distinctive}} bass guitar sound and melodic bass lines. These are particularly prominent on earlier Stranglers recordings produced by Martin Rushent, {{such as the}} hit singles [...] "No More Heroes" [...] and [...] "Peaches". In the early days, Burnel's distinctive aggressive sound was created using a Fender Precision Bass with RotoSound roundwound strings played with a plectrum {{very close to the}} bridge, through Hiwatt all-valve amplification, however the defining factor was the use of a Marshall 4x12 speaker cabinet in which the <b>speaker</b> <b>cones</b> were ripped, creating a distorted sound. Later, he used a Yamaha BB2000, a Steinberger L2 (headless), and a Kinkade acoustic bass. He currently plays Shuker JJ Burnel signature basses custom-built in England by Jon Shuker. He {{was one of the first}} bass guitarists to use Trace Elliot amplification when the company began production in 1980. He now uses amplification by Ashdown Engineering who have honoured him with his own JJ500 signature amps. Burnel has been a RotoSound endorser since the early 1980s, and has featured in their advertising.|$|R
5000|$|The {{enclosure}} {{also plays}} a role in managing vibration induced by the driver frame and moving airmass within the enclosure, as well as heat generated by driver voice coils and amplifiers (especially where woofers and subwoofers are concerned).

Enclosures designed for use in PA systems, sound reinforcement systems and for use by electric musical instrument players (e.g., bass amp cabinets have a number of features to make them easier to transport, such as carrying handles on the top or sides, metal or plastic corner protectors, and metal grilles to protect the speakers). Speaker enclosures designed for use in a home or recording studio typically do not have handles or corner protectors, although they do still usually have a cloth or mesh cover to protect the woofer and tweeter. These speaker grilles are a metallic or cloth mesh that are used to protect the speaker by forming a protective cover over the <b>speaker's</b> <b>cone</b> while allowing sound to pass through undistorted.|$|R
