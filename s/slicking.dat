Besides Zac Brown Band, there hasn’t been this much audible fiddle and acoustic guitar on a mainstream single in a long time, and she and producer Scott Hendricks deserve credit for not marring the track with any electric guitars or loud crashing drums. I do wish he’d gone further into neo-traditional territory, leaving out the poppish ‘ooohs’ in the intro and adding in steel guitar, but you can’t fault him for <b>slicking</b> it up just enough to get it airplay. In any event, “Whiskey” is allowed to properly breathe, and it’s a refreshing change of pace from the normal mainstream fare." ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{important}} aspect of the Migration Narrative is its emphasis on the differences between the traditional (or folk) and the modern. Migration narratives typically include references to ancestors and strangers, with ancestors being linked to the South and strangers to the North. In Blood on the Forge, the immigrants the Moss brothers work with in the mills would be considered strangers. Ancestors are also linked with folklore and tradition, such as music and food. Melody tries to keep the brother's heritage alive with his guitar. Each brother experiences his own shift from the folk to the industrial that is characteristic of The Great Migration. Melody changes the way he plays the guitar from <b>slicking</b> the chords, as he did at home, to picking them. Chinatown loses his eyes in an accidental explosion in the mills, forcing him to adapt to the industrial world as a blind man. Big Mat is the last one to leave behind his tradition. While at home he lashed out in anger against his oppressors, such as the riding boss, in the North Big Mat joins the oppressor as he becomes a deputy, using his anger to break his fellow workers' strike. Edward E. Waldron describes him as becoming [...] "as destructive as the exploding furnace".|$|E
5000|$|Gum {{tragacanth}} is a viscous, odorless, tasteless, water-soluble {{mixture of}} polysaccharides obtained from sap that is drained from {{the root of}} the plant and dried. The gum seeps from the plant in twisted ribbons or flakes that can be powdered. It absorbs water to become a gel, which can be stirred into a paste. The major fractions are known as tragacanthin, highly water soluble as a mucilaginous colloid, and the chemically related bassorin, which is far less soluble but swells in water to form a gel. The gum is used in vegetable-tanned leatherworking as an edge <b>slicking</b> and burnishing compound, and is occasionally used as a stiffener in textiles. The gum has been used historically as a herbal remedy for such conditions as cough and diarrhea. As a mucilage or paste, it {{has been used as a}} topical treatment for burns. It is used in pharmaceuticals and foods as an emulsifier, thickener, stabilizer, and texturant additive (code E413). It is the traditional binder used in the making of artists' pastels, as it does not adhere to itself the same way other gums (such as gum arabic) do when dry. Gum tragacanth is also used to make a paste used in floral sugarcraft to create lifelike flowers on wires used as decorations for cakes, which air-dries brittle and can take colorings. It enables users to get a very fine, delicate finish to their work. It has traditionally been used as an adhesive in the cigar-rolling process used to secure the cap or [...] "flag" [...] leaf to the finished cigar body.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{identification}} of oil <b>slicks</b> {{on the ocean}} surface from SAR data requires quantitative sound models accounting for the most important characteristics (ocean spectrum, <b>slick</b> viscosity, <b>slick</b> shape, and so on). In this paper we present the implementation of an innovative SAR raw signal and image simulator, which is able to reproduce images relative to ocean surfaces covered by oil <b>slicks</b> with arbitrary shapes. The attention is mainly focused on <b>slicks</b> with fractal contours. The fractal Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function is used to generate <b>slicks</b> with fixed fractal dimension. A box counting technique is employed to evaluate the fractal dimensions of the generated <b>slicks</b> and the corresponding SAR images. Radiometric properties of the area covered by oil are also estimated {{in order to show}} how the simulated data provide a powerful set for processing algorithms...|$|R

5000|$|With {{the four}} {{remaining}} women, the episode begins with Bootz and Deelishis {{still in their}} beds discussing their disdain for New York. Then all the girls go downstairs where Rick delivers the Flav-O-Gram which New York reads. Flav pairs Deelishis and Krazy for the first date to LBC. As usual New York becomes openly upset and goes upstairs. After she leaves Deelishis snidely says that New York is a [...] "loony" [...] and begins to read the Flav-O-Gram aloud again and discovers that New York said <b>slicking</b> where the Flav-O-Gram said slicing. Soon afterward Deelishis follows New York to the balcony where she is standing visibly upset that she hasn't had a date with Flav in four days. The conversation is short but almost escalates into a confrontation after Deelishis tells New York to redirect her hostility. After the discussion Krazy and Deelishis set off for their date with Flav. When they get there Flav greets them and the two climb aboard the yacht. Flav eventually makes out with Deelishis, which upsets Krazy. But soon Deelishis leaves Flav's side, seasick. Krazy and Flav speak intimately. After they get off the yacht Flav takes the girls to the RMS Queen Mary for accommodations where the girls prepare for dinner. During dinner Flav asks Krazy how she feels about him and what she feels they share in common. When she fails to answer appropriately, he asks her to sing. She says she would love a record deal, but doesn't have the money. Afterward he asks Deelishis how she feels about him. Deelishis declares her feelings for him, through tears. Flav decides {{to spend the night}} with Deelishis. Flav turns and bids farewell to Krazy but mistakenly calls her Deelishis. Deelishis and Flav retire to their room where eventually they fall asleep together.|$|E

40|$|Application of dispersants aims {{to enhance}} the natural {{dispersion}} process {{in order to reduce}} the size of the <b>slick</b> and the amount of oil at the surface. This study presents an approach for modeling the development of the surface oil <b>slick</b> as a function of the wind speed, oil viscosity, and dispersant application. We modeled the oil <b>slick</b> mass distribution across a transect through the <b>slick</b> over time taking into account the continuous entrainment of oil, resurfacing process of the different oil droplet size classes and horizontal transport. Outcomes show distinctively different oil <b>slick</b> features, depending on how favorable conditions are for dispersion. A large comet-shaped <b>slick</b> is formed in the case of suboptimal dispersion. Optimal dispersion yields a small surface oil <b>slick,</b> with a large mass of oil suspended. The benefit of dispersants is limited to in conditions with suboptimal natural dispersion, with the exception of extremely unfavorable conditions in which the <b>slick</b> size would be increased. The oil <b>slick</b> length, fraction of oil still floating, lifetime of the <b>slick,</b> and wind drift are highly influenced by wind speed and related mixing conditions, and to a lesser extent by oil properties. In the newly defined “Dispersibility Factor” (DF) the oil <b>slick</b> properties and environmental conditions can be combined into one value that correlates with the simulation outcomes and therefore can be used as an indicator of favorability of natural dispersion and likelihood of added value of chemical dispersion...|$|R
