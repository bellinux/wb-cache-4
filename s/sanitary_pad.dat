50|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} {{alternatives to}} using tampons are the menstrual cup, reusable <b>sanitary</b> <b>pads,</b> menstrual sponges and reusable tampons. Menstrual cups are silicone cups that are worn inside the vagina {{to collect the}} fluid. Reusable <b>sanitary</b> <b>pads</b> are similar to disposable <b>sanitary</b> <b>pads,</b> but differ {{in the sense that}} they can be washed and used as many times as needed by the owner. For women who cannot or don't want to use a menstrual cup, but like internal products, sea sponges inserted like tampons may be a good option. These can also be washed out and reused and when they lose their absorbency can be composted. Some women have also made reusable tampons, often pieces of knit or crocheted fabric that are rolled up and inserted into the vagina, and later washed, dried and reused. These alternatives are environmentally friendly because they are reusable, and in some cases compostable, so they contribute less waste to landfills.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, young Inuit women {{received}} little information about puberty, fertility, and pregnancy. Consequently, elders describe {{that it was}} not uncommon for young women to remain in bed when they reached menarche, believing that they were sick or physiologically different. Once informed, the young woman's mother would instruct her on menstruation practices and often, the camp (or community) would become apprised of her situation. During menstruation, women were expected to follow certain practices including, 1) not sitting where men sat, 2) using rabbit skin, foxes or mosses and other garments, with the exception of men's garments, for sanitary pads, and 3) laying rabbit skin on the bed at night to soak up blood. According to elders, women had to abide by more rules than men because of their menstruation and some rules were not only considered tradition, but also taboo if not followed. For example, using a man's garment for a <b>sanitary</b> <b>pad</b> could prevent the young woman from finding a husband for marriage.|$|E

A tampon without an applicator is beneficial to the user by means that it is easy to use, comfortable, and ultimately provided excellent protection for the user. Dr. Esser-Mittag's idea was to create a product that worked with a woman's body to offer the best protection. As an active swimmer she was dissatisfied with the options available for menstrual hygiene; and as a gynecologist she {{was in a position to}} take the initiative to find a better option for menstruating women. She was not satisfied with pads because they could not be worn in water, and she thought that applicator-tampons were uncomfortable and did not conform to the woman's body. The o.b. tampon is much smaller than an applicator-tampon, and it is easy to insert, comfortable, and provides great protection.|$|E

Menstrual hygiene management {{is a big}} problem for women and girls in Zimbabwe as the sanitary pads are expensive. An average pack of 8 - 10 at $US 1. 50 is significantly expensive for females coming from low income families, which has caused women and girls to resort to unhealthy ways such as using grass and cow dung for managing their menstruation, which exposes them to infections. The aim was to develop a low-cost re-usable microfibre <b>sanitary</b> <b>pad</b> with good performance properties and low cost maintenance, affordable to poor women. The design was based on the Johnson and Johnson re-usable (a rectangular shape) sanitary pads. The new re-usable pad was developed from polyester microfibre materials. It has a pocket for an insert of another material that will enhance the collection of blood. The developed pad was tested for wicking, leakage and strike through properties. The newly developed pad exhibited better properties and yet cheaper than the commercial disposable pads...|$|E

The company is based in Uganda and provides hundreds of local labor jobs for women. A common problem in third-world countries is education for young girls. Without access to affordable sanitary pads young girls {{are not able to}} attend and keep up with school work during their menstrual cycles, missing up to a fourth of their school days. Currently, the MakaPad is the only affordable, biodegradable <b>sanitary</b> <b>pad</b> in Africa. Over 5 million pads are produced per year by T 4 T and the product is used mostly by low income women and refugees. One of the stages in the production of the MakaPad is to seal the paper layers inside of two layers of plastic. The current process uses a commercially available straight line sealer to seal along all four sides of the pads, and is only capable of sealing one side at a time. We have been tasked to improve this process in terms of production time, quality, and ease. With the help of our sponsors, Dr. Moses Musaazi, Professor Elijah Kannatey-Asibu, and Professor Chinedum Okwudire, and the contributions of previous ME 450 teams that have worked on this project, we hope to develop a functional prototype that meets all of our desired specifications and to then travel with the prototype to Uganda and introduce it to the workers...|$|E

40|$|Background. Menstrual {{health has}} emerged as an under {{recognised}} barrier to women and girls' dignity, health, education, and psychosocial wellbeing in low and middle income contexts. Interventions targeting this issue have seen increasing dissemination, despite little evidence for their effectiveness and sparse research to inform intervention development or evaluation. Objectives. 1) Appraise current evidence for the effectiveness of menstrual health interventions; 2) Evaluate {{the effectiveness of a}} reusable <b>sanitary</b> <b>pad</b> and puberty education intervention for girlsâ school attendance; and, 3) Expand understanding of menstrual health to inform future research and practice. Methods. The multiple objectives of this thesis were addressed through a range of methodological approaches, reported across six manuscripts. The first collates and critically appraises existing evidence in a systematic review, while the second provides a broader overview in a position piece advocating for an evidence-based approach to menstrual health. The third paper reports on a cluster quasi-randomised control trial of reusable <b>sanitary</b> <b>pad</b> and puberty education interventions undertaken in Uganda. The fourth and fifth papers report secondary analyses of the trial survey data to investigate the prevalence and consequences of menstrual hygiene, and schoolgirlsâ experiences with menstrual absorbents. The final manuscript presents a qualitative, framework analysis to describe and compare the menstrual experiences of 27 schoolgirls in the controlled trial. Results. Systematic review identified eight controlled trials of menstrual health interventions. There was emerging evidence for the effectiveness of both education and product provision interventions, although methodological quality was poor. The controlled trial of reusable <b>sanitary</b> <b>pad</b> and puberty education provision found both interventions were similarly effective in reducing school absenteeism, with a moderate effect size. Follow-up quantitative papers provided insights into girlsâ menstrual experiences. In the first of these, the prevalence of inadequate menstrual hygiene was estimated to be 91 % when measured consistently with the consensus definition, and did not differ between those using trial-provided reusable sanitary pads and those using existing methods. Aspects of menstrual hygiene were associated with shame, reduced school engagement, and health concerns. In the second follow-up, girls rated the trial-provided reusable sanitary pads favourably. However, greater perceptions of reliability did not translate into reduced rates of soiling or odour in the last menses. Finally, qualitative work provided process evaluation and nuanced understanding of the interventionsâ change mechanisms. Reduced fears of soiling improved school attendance for those provided with absorbents, while improvements in social support may have mediated the impact of the puberty education on attendance. Conclusions. This thesis represents a significant step forward in the emerging field of menstrual health research. The work provides critical appraisal of existing studies and new evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to improve outcomes for girls' in low and middle income contexts. Further, new insights on the prevalence and consequences of menstrual hygiene, girls' appraisal of menstrual absorbents, and qualitative exploration of girlsâ experiences provide guidance for the development of future interventions and evaluations. </p...|$|E

40|$|This mixed-method {{cross-sectional}} study evaluated {{the effect of}} commercial <b>sanitary</b> <b>pads</b> on school attendance and symptoms of vaginal infections in rural Kenyan adolescents aged 11 - 18. It also provides contextual information that situates the data gathered on school attendance and vaginal infections in the broader experience of girls managing their menstruation. A sequential design was {{used for this study}} with a total of 8 qualitative focus groups and a quantitative survey. A total of 482 girls were surveyed, with 321 who were currently attending school and 151 who had dropped out of school. Qualitative data from focus groups was analyzed using applied thematic analysis, while the effect of commercial <b>sanitary</b> <b>pads</b> as well as the effect of using other items on school attendance and symptoms of vaginal infections was estimated using logistic regression analysis. Overall, girls reported that menstruation negatively affects their experience at school and in the classroom and causes an array of negative emotions. Girls also conveyed having to often leave school to change or bathe due to menstrual leaks and missing class lessons as a result. Poor concentration in class attributed to menstrual pain and worry over potential leaks was also mentioned. Lastly, the practice of transactional sex to obtain money to purchase pads was a theme within the data. It was found through the quantitative data that the prevalence odds of missing one or more days of school over a two-month period when using commercial <b>sanitary</b> <b>pads</b> is 1. 6 times as high as the odds of missing one or more days of school over a two-month period when using other items (p = 0. 02, 95 % C.
