How does {{the picture of the}} producer and consumer beavers, for instance, play into a story about internal representations? Papineau and Macdonald describe Millikan's account of this well and loyally, saying [...] "The producing mechanisms will be the sensory and other cerebral mechanisms that give rise to cognitive representations." [...] The consuming mechanisms are those that [...] "use these representations to direct behavior in pursuit of some biological end". [...] Here, we have a picture similar to the beaver example, but this picture portrays the two sub-functions, producer and consumer, operating within a more-obviously unified system, namely, the cognitive system. One <b>sub-function</b> produces mental representations while the other <b>sub-function</b> consumes them in order to reach some end, e.g., danger-avoidance or food-acquisition. The representations consumed by the consumer <b>sub-function</b> guide an organism's behavior toward some biological end, e.g., survival. This is a rather brief sketch of Millikan's overall portrait. Of course, more goes into her account of the relation between producer- and consumer-functions in order to arrive at a nuanced account of mental representation. But that is a matter of how. Details as to the how aside, much of Millikan's efforts are directed towards the why, viz., why it is that perceivers like us have mental representations—why representations are produced in the first place.|$|E

5000|$|Moral {{disengagement}} {{is a term}} {{from social}} psychology for the process of convincing the self that ethical standards {{do not apply to}} oneself in a particular context. This is done by separating moral reactions from inhumane conduct and disabling the mechanism of self-condemnation. Thus, moral disengagement involves a process of cognitive re-construing or re-framing of destructive behavior as being morally acceptable without changing the behavior or the moral standards. In social cognitive theory of morality, self-regulatory mechanisms embedded in moral standards and self-sanctions translate moral reasoning into actions, and, as a result, moral agency is exerted. Thus, the moral self is situated in a broader, socio-cognitive self-theory consisting of self-organizing, proactive, self-reflective, and self-regulative mechanisms. Three major sub-functions are operating in this self-regulatory system in which moral agency is grounded. The first <b>sub-function</b> is self-monitoring of one's conduct, which is the initial step of taking control over it. [...] "Action gives rise to self-reactions through a judgmental function in which conduct is evaluated against internal standards and situational circumstances". Thus, moral judgments evoke self-reactive influence. The self-reactive and judgmental mechanisms constitute the second and third <b>sub-function.</b>|$|E

In the approach, the overall {{function of a}} single-function product is decomposed {{into a number of}} subfunctions.

By analyzing the function models of two single-function products, a functional similarity matrix is constructed based on the quantified similarity indexes of two <b>sub-functions.</b> For indicating the relationship between the <b>sub-functions</b> and the components, a function-component matrix of each single-function product is constructed, and then a component-component matrix of two single-function products can be acquired by multiplying the function-component matrix and the functional similarity matrix. There are three kinds of components' relationships in the component-component matrix, namely, no-correlation, simple-correlation, and complex-correlation. The components of two single-function products can be, respectively, removed, modified, and reserved according to the different correlation relationships, and a design solution of a new multi-function product can be obtained by combining the reserved and modified components. As a case study, a conceptual solution of a new shaver is acquired under the help of the provided approach...|$|R
