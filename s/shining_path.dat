5|$|Donayre's {{tenure as}} Commanding General {{of the army}} was {{controversial}} from the start due to corruption allegations and an international incident with Chile. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala criticized Donayre's designation as irregular because at that time he was not serving as general {{of any of the}} three major army divisions as stipulated by Peruvian law. As commander of the Army, Donayre was also accused of acquiring 50,000 American-made MREs— military rations— to supply troops deployed against <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> guerrillas in the Apurímac and Ene river valleys, instead of acquiring cheaper, locally-made alternatives. An attempt to buy 50,000 more rations led to an inquiry by the Ministry of Defense.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Donayre {{was born}} on January 8, 1952 {{in the city of}} Ayacucho in the {{highlands}} of Peru. He attended San Juan Bosco school, a Salesian institution in his hometown, and studied at a seminary for two years before studying two years of Chemical Engineering at the San Cristóbal of Huamanga University. Donayre's military career started at the Chorrillos Military School, where his first year grades earned him a scholarship to continue his formation in Argentina. At the National Military College in Buenos Aires he graduated with honors as a military engineer. In active duty Donayre has served four times in regions under state of emergency due to <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> guerrilla activity and five times in frontier regions. He has held several command posts, among them commander of the 20th Combat Engineer Battalion, director of the Army Engineer School, commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, commander of the Southern Military Region, and commander of the Central Military Region.|$|E
25|$|In his {{military}} career, Humala was {{also involved in}} the two major Peruvian conflicts of the past 20 years, the battle against the insurgent organization <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> and the 1995 Cenepa War with Ecuador. In 1992 Humala served in Tingo María fighting {{the remnants of the}} <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> and in 1995 he served in the Cenepa War on the border with Ecuador.|$|E

25|$|García faced {{his first}} major {{political}} defeat of his second term in office on January 11, 2007 when his proposal to introduce the death penalty as a punishment for captured <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> rebels was rejected by Congress in a vote of 49 to 26. García had promised to introduce {{the death penalty for}} <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> rebels during the 2006 Presidential election. Following the defeat of the proposal, García suggested a national referendum on the issue but it was blocked by Congress. Legislators who voted against the bill stated {{that it would be a}} breach of the American Convention on Human Rights to which Peru is a signatory. Approximately 3000 supporters of the proposal marched in Lima holding up photos of victims of attacks by the <b>Shining</b> <b>Path.</b>|$|E
25|$|In late 2001, the Directorate against Terrorism {{reported}} that the <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> a terrorist movement which has been active since the eighties, was organizing along new fronts and infiltrating protests, blocking highways, and organizing student marches. The government reacted by reestablishing five counterinsurgency bases, which soon assisted in destroying six <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> camps. But terrorist activity continued and in 2003, Toledo declared {{the first of several}} states of emergency due to the terrorist threat.|$|E
25|$|Toledo {{walked a}} thin line in {{responding}} to both U.S. pressure to severely limit coca-production and protests by coca farmers against the eradication of coca production in poor, rural areas, {{where the majority of}} the population is involved in that business. The presumed link between the <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> and narcotics trafficking was unclear, because the coca farmers gave most of their crops to drug traffickers who then paid the <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> to operate within certain regions.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{charge that}} {{to achieve the}} defeat of <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> the Peruvian {{military}} engaged in widespread human rights abuses, and {{that the majority of}} the victims were poor highland countryside inhabitants caught in a crossfire between the military and insurgents. The final report of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, published on 28 August 2003, brought out that Peruvian armed forces were also guilty of destroying villages and murdering countryside inhabitants whom they suspected of supporting insurgents. The majority of the atrocities committed between 1980 and 1995 however were indeed the work of <b>Shining</b> <b>Path.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the trial}} of Alberto Fujimori, it was {{asserted}} by former Colina member José William Tena Jacinto {{that at least two}} of the victims were positively identified as <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> members.|$|E
25|$|When Fujimori came to power, much of Peru was {{dominated}} by the Maoist insurgent group Sendero Luminoso ("Shining Path"), and the Marxist–Leninist group Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). In 1989, 25% of Peru's district and provincial councils opted not to hold elections, owing to a persistent campaign of assassination, {{over the course of}} which over 100 officials had been killed by <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> in that year alone. That same year, more than one-third of Peru's courts lacked a justice of the peace, because of <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> intimidation. Union leaders and military officials were also assassinated throughout the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Shining</b> <b>Path's</b> {{attacks were}} {{not limited to}} the countryside. It mounted attacks against the {{infrastructure}} in Lima, killing civilians in the process. In 1983, it sabotaged several electrical transmission towers, causing a citywide blackout, and set fire and destroyed the Bayer industrial plant. That same year, it set off a powerful bomb in the offices of the governing party, Popular Action. Escalating its activities in Lima, in June 1985 it blew up electricity transmission towers in Lima, producing a blackout, and detonated car bombs near the government palace and the justice palace. It was believed to be responsible for bombing a shopping mall. At the time, President Fernando Belaúnde Terry was receiving the Argentine president Raúl Alfonsín. In one of its last attacks in Lima, on July 16, 1992, the group detonated a powerful bomb on Tarata Street in the Miraflores District, full of civilian people, adults and children, killing 25 people and injuring an additional 155.|$|R
5000|$|Hot {{cells are}} {{commonly}} used in the nuclear medicines industry:- {{for the production of}} radiopharmaceuticals, according to GMP guidelines (industry)- for the manipulation and dispense of radiopharmaceuticals (hospitals).The user must never be subject to <b>shine</b> <b>paths</b> that are emitted from the radioactive isotopes and therefore there generally is heavy shielding around the containment boxes, which can be made out of stainless steel 316 or other materials such as PVC or Corian. This shielding can be ensured by the use of lead (common) or materials such as concrete (very large walls are therefore required) or even tungsten. The amount of radioactivity present in the hot cell, the energy of the gamma photons emitted by the radioisotopes, and the number of neutrons that are formed by the material will prescribe how thick the shielding must be. For instance a [...] source of cobalt-60 will require thicker shielding than a [...] source of iridium-192 to give the same dose rate at the outer surface of the hot cell. Also if some actinide materials such as californium or spent nuclear fuel are used within the hot cell then a layer of water or polyethylene may be needed to lower the neutron dose rate.|$|R

25|$|Insurgent {{activity}} was in decline {{by the end}} of 1992, and Fujimori took credit for this abatment, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the DINCOTE (National Counter-Terrorism Directorate) led to the capture of the leaders from MRTA and the <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> including notorious <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> leader Abimael Guzmán. Guzmán's capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian Ellen Perry, Fujimori even notes that he specially ordered Guzmán's prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance the image of his capture in the media.|$|E

25|$|The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, {{which had}} been {{implemented}} by interim president Paniagua, was tasked with examining largescale acts of violence and atrocities committed within Peru between 1980 and 2000, to assess responsibility and {{pave the way for}} reparations. The Commission's final report to President Toledo was issued in 2003, and concluded that approximately 69,000 people had been killed by the <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> and other extremist groups, the bulk of the victims being innocent peasants. In January of that year, the Constitutional Court repealed several anti-terrorism measures enacted during Fujimori's administration. It was estimated that 54% of these victims were killed by the extremist guerrilla group <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> 30% by the Peruvian Military and police forces, and the rest were by rural or peasant self-defense militias. These investigations were financed by a portion of the US$360million discovered in foreign accounts {{which had been}} stolen by Fujimori officials.

It {{is important to be}} in cooperation with other states to ensure peace, but it is also imperative to prepare for future conflicts. States that want to survive and have a voice in the international arena must develop their militaries to meet future challenges. Therefore, military innovation through technological advancements and application of new tactics are necessary to have a successful military; however, {{it is not easy to}} achieve. The tremendous developments in the information technology pose great opportunities for leaders that pursue innovation. Leaders of today should be aware that innovation is not a choice but a necessity. As they prepare their militaries for future conflicts in uncertainty and darkness, history can be the light that <b>shines</b> on their <b>path,</b> but only for those who draw the correct lessons...|$|R

25|$|Peruvian–U.S. {{relations}} {{earlier in}} Fujimori's presidency had {{been dominated by}} questions of coca eradication and Fujimori's initial reluctance to sign an accord to increase his military's eradication efforts in the lowlands.

Two weeks after the self-coup however, the George H.W.

25|$|The {{economic}} turbulence exacerbated social {{tensions in}} Peru and contributed {{in part to}} the rise of the violent rebel movement known as the <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> which launched the internal conflict in Peru and began attacking electrical towers, causing a number of blackouts in Lima. The García administration unsuccessfully sought a military solution to the growing terrorism, allegedly committing human rights violations, which are still under investigation. These include the Accomarca massacre, where 47 campesinos were gunned down by Peruvian armed forces in August 1985, the Cayara massacre (May 1988) in which some thirty people were killed and dozens disappeared, and the summary execution of more than 200 inmates during prison riots in Lurigancho, San Juan Bautista (El Frontón) and Santa Bárbara in 1986. According to an official inquiry, an estimated 1,600 forced disappearances took place during García's presidency. His own personal involvement in these events is not clear. García was allegedly tied to the paramilitary Rodrigo Franco Command, which is accused of carrying out political murders in Peru during García's presidency. A U.S. declassified report, written in late 1987, said that García's party, APRA, and top government officials were running a paramilitary group, responsible for the attempted bombing of the El Diario newspaper, then linked to <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> had sent people to train in North Korea and may have been involved in executions. According to investigative journalist Lucy Komisar, the report made it clear that it believed García had given the orders.|$|E
