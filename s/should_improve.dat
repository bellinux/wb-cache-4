Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication. Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these medications related to their widespread use. Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries. For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics. Women with recurrent simple UTIs may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "We should... without deceiving ourselves about Khrushchev's political personality and without nurturing any unreal hopes, be concerned to keep him politically in the running and to encourage the survival in Moscow of the tendencies he personifies".

500|$|The {{workload}} of the Registrar {{has increased}} {{over time as}} the university has increased in size and complexity. In 1914, the Registry had a staff of five; there were eight staff members in 1930 and forty in 1958. Typewriters were rare before 1925 and there was, until then, no diary of recurring dates, with everything depending (in {{the words of a}} later Registrar, Sir Douglas Veale, appointed in 1930) [...] "on someonegenerally the registrar's secretaryhappening to remember." [...] A commission headed by the former prime minister H. H. Asquith recommended in 1922 that Oxford <b>should</b> <b>improve</b> its administration and that the Registrar should become a more significant figure; Veale's appointment was a recognition of this need. In addition, external pressures from the requirements of the University Grants Committee and other governmental funding mechanisms also required more work from the Registrar and staff. As the historian Brian Harrison put it, under Veale (Registrar 1930–1958), Oxford's administration was [...] "edging ...slowly from decentralized amateurism towards centralized professionalism." [...] However, Veale's successor Sir Folliott Sandford was [...] "appalled at the amount of paper", which was [...] "quite beyond [...] conception as a civil servant." [...] The growth in Oxford's administration led to a move in 1968 to purpose-built accommodation in Wellington Square: until that time, the administration had been housed in the Clarendon Building in the centre of Oxford next to the Bodleian Library. , there are 16 administrative sections for the university, and the heads of 12 of these report to the Registrar.
