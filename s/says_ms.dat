40|$|A {{student from}} The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Fremantle Campus {{could be just}} a few years away from {{achieving}} her dream of representing Australia in water polo at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Cathryn Earl, 19, recently returned from a four-day training camp in Sydney as part of an Australian water polo team comprising athletes born in 1993. She is currently training in a bid to be selected for her team which will take part in world championships to be held in Hungary or The Netherlands next year. In the meantime, Ms Earl has her sights set on making a squad of 13 for a series of games in Europe this August. The trip will complete a busy year for the Bachelor of Sport and Recreation Management/Commerce student who competed for a team called ‘The Barbarians’ against the best water polo players from China, Brazil and USA at the January Pan Pacific Championships in Melbourne. Ms Earl hopes to use these unique experiences as a launching pad for possible selection in the Australian water polo squad for the 2016 Olympic Games. “I began playing water polo when I was around eight-years-old because I was a capable swimmer and my two older sisters were playing the sport,” Ms Earl said. “As I got older, I started to really enjoy the competitive and social aspects of the sport which led me to participate in State teams throughout my junior years. ” Juggling study at Notre Dame with water polo training and competition commitments has not been without its challenges, <b>says</b> <b>Ms</b> Earl. Depending on the time of year, training can include pool sessions most mornings and afternoons, plus several hours in the gym. She said Notre Dame had given her the confidence to pursue her sporting dreams as well as maintain her commitment to strive for academic excellence in the Fremantle School of Business. Ms Earl’s efforts were acknowledged at the Business Awards for 2012 as the recipient of the WA Sports Federation Prize in Sport and Recreation Management. It is awarded to the highest achieving first year School of Business student who has performed well and made a significant contribution to the community in the unit Sport and Recreation Industry Practicum. “One important skill I have learnt along the way has been the ability to incorporate the challenges of work, university, schooling, water polo training and social life into my daily calendar,” Ms Earl said. “These skills have developed over the years as there are many important people within the Notre Dame and water polo communities who have helped me and will continue to improve my career. ” Shelley Robinson: Tel (08) 9433 0610; Mob 0408 959 138 Leigh Dawson: Tel (08) 9433 0569; Mob 0405 441 09...|$|E

Find out more about visual arts and craft: from how many people attend galleries and make craft to how much visual artists earn and the international opportunities for the sector. Explore the visual arts ecosystem starting with creation, or use the tags to explore topics such as employment. Spending on visual arts and craft has grown 26 % since 2004. With 11 million attendances annually, exhibitions draw bigger crowds than the footy (10 million). More than 1. 65 million Australians attend Indigenous visual art exhibitions and events each year. These {{are just some of the}} facts drawn together in the Australia Council’s new digital resource, Art Facts: Visual Arts.  Art Facts: Visual Arts outlines the story of the visual arts and craft sector in numbers. As an interactive website, it brings together facts, figures and research from across Australia to inspire people to discover and share facts about visual arts and crafts, sparking quality debate about this important area of Australian culture. Art Facts provides the arts sector with a ‘one stop shop’ for data that has until now only been available in separate reports, including the latest statistical data from the Australia Council, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and industry research reports. The visual arts are the second sector to go under the Art Facts spotlight, following Art Facts: Music, which was released in 2012. ‘While there are a range of reports, facts and figures out there on the arts, Art Facts provides the crucial step of consolidating them in one place, allowing people to examine and compare the figures in new ways. ’ says Australia Council Chair Mr Rupert Myer AM. ‘The Art Facts research program is a rich resource for deepening our understanding of the arts, sector by sector. ’This edition on the visual arts includes analysis of the latest available statistics about visual arts creation, industry, global trade, participation and support. ‘One thing that’s clear is the deep engagement Australians have with visual arts and crafts,’ says Mr Myer. ‘The visual arts and craft are some of the most popular cultural activities in Australia and, in terms of creativity, there are more Australians creating visual arts and crafts than any other type of art. ’‘Australian household spending on the visual arts is also on the rise with people now spending more on paintings, carvings and sculptures, art and craft materials, and art gallery and museum admission tickets,’ says Mr Myer. Many visual artists prefer to practice in regional areas. Like many other types of artists visual artists tend to earn low incomes. Significantly many visual artists also contribute their skills to areas outside of the visual arts. ‘Visual artists are also valued in other industries, with 20 % applying their artistic skills in the creative industries, such as advertising, design and architecture; and another 20 % contributing them to non cultural sectors,’ <b>says</b> <b>Ms</b> Libby Christie, Acting Chief Executive of the Australia Council.

40|$|It seems Max Moore-Wilton’s {{commitment}} to full and frank disclosure is not absolute, writes Peter Browne IN the days since Mike Scrafton revealed {{what he told}} John Howard about the ‘children overboard’ affair before the last election, {{the question of whether}} he should have ignored the risks and spoken out sooner has been intensely debated. Loudest of all was the contribution of Max Moore-Wilton, {{the former head of the}} Prime Minister’s Department, who told ABC Radio that - among other things - Mr Scrafton was a ‘weak personality’ if he had indeed failed to speak out because he feared retribution. Mr Moore-Wilton’s intervention brought to mind an intriguing episode that came to light, without much publicity, during the hearings of the Senate committee on the children overboard affair. A key witness to the inquiry was Jennifer Bryant, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet official who had carried out an internal investigation of how the false accusation against sylum seekers came to be made by ministers during the election campaign. The transcript of her testimony to the Senate committee reveals Ms Bryant to be conscientious and methodical - but also very careful not to say more than is absolutely necessary in response to questions from the senators. By the end of a very long and detailed examination by Labor’s John Faulkner, we start to get an idea of why this might be the case. Senator Faulkner was trying to establish whether anyone had pressured Ms Bryant to modify her views or her testimony on the circumstances surrounding the children overboard allegations. Eventually it emerged that when Ms Bryant had made a lengthy appearance before the Senate Estimate Committee - which had also looked at the incident - two months earlier she had taken the opportunity during the dinner break to seek out one of the Prime Minister’s advisors, Miles Jordana, to check on some factual matters. The transcript continues: Ms Bryant: I went down to the office and, as I recorded at the time, I spoke to Mr Jordana. I certainly saw others in the office, but it was Mr Jordana that I sought clarification from. Senator Faulkner: But you only spoke to Mr Jordana? Ms Bryant: No. There were a number of advisers in the office and we nodded and spoke of the progress of the hearings in the course of the day. But it was Mr Jordana I sought the clarification from in response to the question you had asked me. ‘A number of advisors’ sounds innocuous enough. But, pages later, it emerges that the group was a little more heterogenous than that phrase suggests. In response to a comment from Senator Faulkner Ms Bryant revealed that the Prime Minister ‘said hello to me and made some comments about the events of the day. I spoke to him in that context briefly. ’ Senator Faulkner expressed his surprise that she hadn’t mentioned his presence earlier. Ms Bryant: I did say that there were a number of others in the office that evening. Senator Faulkner: The Prime Minister is a reasonably significant person to speak to. Ms Bryant: Sure. Senator Faulkner: So the Prime Minister is one. Can we be precise about who you did speak to? Ms Bryant: I recall that evening seeing Mr Jordana and Mr Nutt. I spoke to Mr Hazell in the corridor. I nodded to Mr Sinodinos. I also recall a number of the female staff, assistants to the various advisers and so on. Over the next few pages we learn how Ms Bryant had encountered some of these people in the corridor on her way to see Mr Jordana, and how she had ended up in the Prime Minister’s office with Mr Howard, his principal private secretary Tony Nutt, his chief of staff Arthur Sinodinos, and a senior departmental official, Alan Henderson. ‘I think Mr Moore-Wilton was present,’ added Ms Bryant. As Senator Faulkner painstakingly extracts pieces of the jigsaw puzzle Ms Bryant, the transcript makes for gripping reading. But it also raises the tantalising issue: why was she so reluctant to talk about this encounter? Senator Faulkner: No-one suggested to you how you might approach your evidence at the Senate estimates committee? Ms Bryant: I do not think that anyone tried to influence the fact that I intended to place those matters on the record. Senator Faulkner: I did not say ‘influence’; I said ‘approach’. Ms Bryant: As you will recall, at the time I crafted some words which I read out in the room. I had given the flat presentation of those some thought, but I do not think people sought to dictate an approach to me. Senator Faulkner: Did either the Prime Minister or anyone from the Prime Minister’s office indicate to you the importance and significance of the evidence that you were giving in relation to them or the government more generally? Ms Bryant: I do not recall that being particularly the case. I had a sense of the flatter the better, but I do not recall… That’s as close as Senator Faulkner got to finding out what was going on in the Prime Minister’s office that night. ‘I had a sense of the flatter the better,’ <b>says</b> <b>Ms</b> Bryant - which sounds very much like a euphemism for ‘say as little as possible’. Coming from the Prime Minister and a collection of his closest advisors and officials, it’s a message that could have made a deep impression on a departmental officer. According to Ms Bryant’s recollection, Max Moore-Wilton was present at that meeting - the same Max Moore-Wilton who, just a few days ago, attacked Mike Scrafton for not having come out with the whole story when he was interviewed for the departmental inquiry into the children overboard allegations. It’s a pity that Jennifer Bryant wasn’t given the same encouragement to be frank when she was appearing before the Senate Estimate Committee. Peter Browne is editor of APO.

Multinationals seek modern soothsayers to help decide whether to sell smaller {{roasting}} pans. Hi-tech firms hire specialists to predict whether tomorrow 2 ̆ 7 s workers will demand in-office day care. For many {{so much as a}} glimpse of what the future holds, government at all levels spends millions. Call it a human condition, this hankering after the future. 2 ̆ 2 You 2 ̆ 7 ve really got a great gimmick, 2 ̆ 2 an envious Virginia Commonwealth University colleague once quipped to futurologist Howard Ozmon. 2 ̆ 2 Everything has a future, so I guess you 2 ̆ 7 ll always be in business. 2 ̆ 2 Indeed, there 2 ̆ 7 s a virtual bull market in futures out there [...] at least 2, 000 full-time professional prognosticators and more than 200 research groups busily plumbing the future for everything from foreign troop strengths and famine to deforestation and dental floss. We 2 ̆ 7 re not talking palm readers. And we 2 ̆ 7 re not talking peanuts. The futures industry pulls in more than 10 million each year from corporate and government clients [...] the sort of success that even futurologists, the handful of them who were around a few decades ago, couldn 2 ̆ 7 t foresee. And comes now the new year, which means future-analysts are booked solid, cranking out forecasts just as soon as their computers can spit out the numbers. 2 ̆ 2 Business [...] indeed, life [...] is like a chess game. Those who play skillfully look ahead a few moves, 2 ̆ 2 explains Joseph L. Fisher, secretary of human resources and no stranger to Future Fever. 2 ̆ 2 Some of this looking at the future is hairbrained, visionary and impractical, but {{a lot of it has}} become quite technical. And so vital that it can be perilous to make decisions without it, 2 ̆ 2 says Fisher. Two years ago, Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s own boss saw the virtue of future-glancing, as several other governors in other states had done. So Gov. Charles S. Robb urged a 37 -member bipartisan panel to look at Virginia in the 21 st century. The group [...] no mere assortment of supermarket-tabloid astrologers, what with a former secretary of defense, retired chief justice and several corporate executives aboard [...] has reported its findings. Some of the forecasts are so significant they could result in legislative action as early as next year. But the Robb commission 2 ̆ 7 s view of a 2 ̆ 2 New Dominion 2 ̆ 2 was only part of a trend that is sweeping the land. Nothing is too grandiose or too insignificant to escape the divining instruments of these modern-day soothsayers, who use computers instead of crystal balls and 2 ̆ 2 trend extrapolation 2 ̆ 2 instead of palms. And who usually come up with a whopper of a bill. (For a study on the feasibility of solar power in the 1970 s, a large West Coast think tank charged Uncle Sam 275, 000.) Another think tank [...] in a 10 -year forecast that partly considered the fate of dental floss among lower income families [...] predicted that, in the future, 2 ̆ 2 an increasing proportion of males may not wear underpants because trousers can be washed easily and often. 2 ̆ 2 Less outrageous was the formulation during the 1939 World 2 ̆ 7 s Fair, that picture phones would sweep the land. The experts were right about that technology; wrong about consumer demand. Then, during the 1950 s, there was talk of tourists on safari in war-torn Vietnam [...] predicted for the 1960 s. Close, but most futurologists then failed to predict the energy crisis. Time and again, forecasting has failed. Many forecasters have simply built up a dismal record [...] one which won 2 ̆ 7 t likely improve. Some predictions have led economist Lester Thurow, among others, to conclude that futures research is 2 ̆ 2 the intellectual 2 ̆ 7 s version of going to the palm reader. 2 ̆ 2 Government has had its share of soothsaying snafus. In 1980, experts predicted that the United States could become energy independent by using certain minerals. There was one slight catch: America didn 2 ̆ 7 t have enough of the minerals. Then, there 2 ̆ 7 s the fish story. During the Carter Administration, some specialists foresaw that, as the human population grew, greater numbers of fish would be caught. One problem: other experts concluded there weren 2 ̆ 7 t any more fish that could be caught. This is to say nothing of the complaints over America 2 ̆ 7 s weathermen. Which leads to a basic question: Just how reliable is any of this multi-million dollar, high-tech prognosticating? 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 7 ve come a long way since science fiction, H. G. Wells and the speculations of Nostradamus, 2 ̆ 2 maintains Dr. Ozmon, an education professor at VCU. 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 7 ve gained a lot of respectability. 2 ̆ 2 Two universities, in Massachusetts and Arizona, offer degrees in futures studies. In Virginia, the World Future Society [...] an eclectic group of future-thinkers [...] includes marketing experts and career planners, college professors and architects, and the secretary of human resources. The magazine they read, 2 ̆ 2 The Futurist, 2 ̆ 2 dwells on such issues as hyperintelligence, the use of video games to build a personal sense of accomplishment, robot burglar alarms and Europe 2 ̆ 7 s changing taste for lighter beer. More science than art 2 ̆ 2 Very little of it is crystal ball gazing, 2 ̆ 2 says Maria Robotham, a senior researcher at The Futures Group, an 80 -person Hartford, Conn., think tank whose clients include soft drink makers and the CIA. (Government contracts account for half of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s 6 million business.) 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s much more science than art, 2 ̆ 2 says Marvin Cetron, a former Navy planner who claims his Arlington-based firm, Forecasting International, is batting an enviable. 950 [...] which includes predictions of the Shah of Iran 2 ̆ 7 s fall, Ronald Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s rise, and of Poland 2 ̆ 7 s turmoil. Dr. Cetron 2 ̆ 7 s staff of 35 literally takes on the globe: among their clients are 76 industrial firms, 17 foreign countries, and 10 U. S. government agencies [...] all of whom make it a booming 2 million-a-year business. Dr. Cetron insists his views are founded in fact and soldered with pure science. 2 ̆ 2 We look at quantitative indicators and do trend extrapolation. We use computers... We 2 ̆ 7 ve got hundreds of global events in our data banks. 2 ̆ 2 But, warn most futurologists: don 2 ̆ 7 t count on any of it. As noted William and Mary law school Dean William Spong, who chaired Gov. Robb 2 ̆ 7 s panel on the future, 2 ̆ 2 This represents our best judgment, but we don 2 ̆ 7 t pretend to be Moses. 2 ̆ 2 Avoid assumptions In a classic episode of 2 ̆ 2 The Twilight Zone, 2 ̆ 2 a man manages to get a copy of a future newspaper. He duly scans the stock report and invests in the stocks that will gain the most. In his frenzy, the man fails to notice one small item in the same newspaper: his own obituary. Perhaps that 2 ̆ 7 s a good tale to illustrate a common warning issued by soothsayers these days: be careful, especially about assumptions. 2 ̆ 2 If you 2 ̆ 7 re a very responsible futures researcher, 2 ̆ 2 <b>says</b> <b>Ms.</b> Robotham, 2 ̆ 2 you tell your client that 2 ̆ 7 there 2 ̆ 7 s no way I can tell you the future, only of things evolving. 2 ̆ 7 We make it clear to people that we 2 ̆ 7 re not going to give them the magic bullet. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 The artistry is in knowing what assumptions to make, 2 ̆ 2 says Fisher. 2 ̆ 2 And what assumptions not to make. 2 ̆ 2 Fisher, a successful businessman and three-term congressman before joining Robb 2 ̆ 7 s cabinet, counts among his failures numerous predictions in his once-acclaimed 1950 s book, 2 ̆ 2 Resources in America 2 ̆ 7 s Future, 2 ̆ 2 one of the first compendiums of large-scale projections for the American economy. He wasn 2 ̆ 7 t far off the mark on the gross national product, industrial production figures of the aggregate work force? But these successes, he said, 2 ̆ 2 covered up a cancellation of errors in many other directions. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 In energy, we overestimated the nuclear. [But who could have foreseen all the problems that have arisen?] We missed on gas. [But we weren 2 ̆ 7 t so bad on coal. ] We missed on women, too. Ironically, we 2 ̆ 7 d been criticized for overestimating the number of women entering the labor force; in fact, we way undervalued it.

40|$|Liberalization offers greater {{opportunities}} for agricultural producers to market their products. But liberalization {{and changes in}} world trade regulations may also remove protection and support, leaving producers exposed to competition in an increasingly crowded, complex and changing market place. To survive, and hopefully thrive, farmers and processors will have to develop the will {{and the capacity to}} seek, recognize and exploit gaps in the market, which they {{are in a position to}} fill. This will require a change in perception, access to information and available resources to develop and market new products. Since Independence, most ACP countries have placed high priority on agricultural production for export. Export income has been seen as a major source of foreign exchange and, as a result, the number of countries that have become exporters of the major commodities (beverages, fibres, fruits, nuts, oils, rubber, timber) has more than doubled compared with the pre-Independence years. However, producer prices have suffered more often than not, because production has exceeded demand, quality has not been maintained and because government parastatals, responsible for collection, storing and exporting, have token substantial funds to maintain themselves, leaving reduced income for distribution to growers. Producers of the staple food crops have also been demoralized by centralized purchase at fixed prices and late payments. The new era of liberalization is welcomed by many but it also provides several challenges to ACP producers, many of whom have no experience of `free market' conditions. Simultaneously, the latest GATT Round of trade agreements increases the risk that overseas competition may overwhelm domestic production of many products: examples include low-cost soya oil undercutting coconut, groundnut and palm products; imported wheat displacing traditional cereals; and subsidized exports of dairy products and meat being landed at less than the cost of local production. In addition, ACP producers, who have enjoyed favoured access to the EU under the Lomé Convention, may lose their advantage for bananas and other products. A further cause for concern for ACP producers, particularly of fresh produce, is that consumers in the main importing countries (EU, Japan and US) are becoming more demanding of quality and more aware of pesticide residues and bacterial contamination in crops, fish and livestock products. Many importers are also implementing phytosanitary barriers to avoid the risk of introducing pests (e. g. fruit fly in citrus) and diseases (e. g. foot and mouth disease in cattle). Now, the good news The adages that 'necessity is the mother of invention' and that 'adversity is a greater teacher than prosperity' can be demonstrated in agricultural marketing. Competition among the supermarket chains in food importing countries has resulted in a veritable `explosion' in the number of food items on sale. A Sainsbury or Tesco superstore in the UK, or a Mono prix in France, may have ten kinds of sugar on offer, seven varieties of onions, between twenty and thirty spices, fifteen or more fresh herbs, twenty kinds of fresh tropical fruits and hundreds of different canned and bottled products ranging from soups to savoury sauces and juices to jams and other preserves. The raw materials for a very high proportion of these thousands of product lines originate in tropical countries and there remain more tastes to be met and greater choices to be offered. However, the producers of primary products will only win for themselves a bigger share of the ultimate sale price if they are prepared to be proactive, and not just reactive, in terms of supplying, anticipating and even helping to create demand for what they can produce. Producers, smallholder farmers in particular, may at first feel ill-prepared to tackle the tasks of mastering market research, export procedures, import regulations and growing a sufficient quantity of a crop of a preferred variety, of a given minimum quality, to be delivered during a very specific period of the year. Processors will have to meet many of the same challenges, though further down the food chain, and those operating at modest levels may again feel overwhelmed by the prospect of identifying, developing and servicing distant markets. In practice, only the largest farming companies can undertake the development of new niche markets without specialist advice and assistance. Most producers and processors will succeed only if they form groups and pool their resources in order to exploit modern market demands. Market opportunities are not limited to exports. There are at least two other options: supplying the domestic market and supplying resident and visiting expatriates with well grown and selected products of local and exotic origin. Many countries that are quite capable of feeding themselves have come to rely on imported foods; this may have been economic when tourism or commodity exports earned sufficient to pay for food imports but it makes little economic sense when, in the Caribbean for example, 40 cents of every dollar earned through cents of every dollar earned through tourism is then spent on importing a wide range of foods that could be grown and processed locally. Introducing tourists and business visitors to local cuisine is also the first step in creating an overseas demand for local produce and products when the visitor returns home. Lessons learned The classic cases of Tin ding or creating new markets for agricultural products include Israel's introduction of the avocado to the UK market in the 1960 s, when consumers did not yet know whether it was a fruit, a vegetable or a salad adornment; the world-wide launch of the kiwi fruit by New Zealand; and, more recently, the introduction of `baby sweet corn' by Thailand. Carambola, litchi, long an, mango and rambutan are other tropical fruits unknown to the European mass market two decades ago, which are now common in season. And, because they are sourced from different countries, the season of availability to consumers is greater than before. This means that several supplying countries can enjoy a comparative advantage for the same product according to the season when they can harvest and ship, and so complement each other's growing periods. Production of temperate crops in the tropics to supply European and North American countries out-of-season has provided several ACP countries with niche opportunities: the Caribbean with sweet peppers for Canada and the US; Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Senegal, Zambia and Zimbabwe with green beans, mange tout peas, strawberries and cut flowers, such as chrysanthemum and roses, for EU destinations. Non-ACP countries, including Brazil, Malaysia, Thailand and the southern US states and Hawaii are well established and are major competitors in these and other products so all producers must be aware of, and ready to anticipate, changes in demand. A number of countries have been forced to diversify because farmer exports have lost their economic appeal. To replace sugarcane the Windward Islands switched to bananas and now, with the WTO ruling against EU preference overshadowing them, they are very actively developing a multi-strand strategy of further diversification. Accepting that they cannot compete on price alone with Central and South America's extensive, mechanized banana producers Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent are promoting their fruit as smaller, sweeter and more appealing to children. They are also stressing their low pesticide usage, since organically grown bananas can carry a premium. In addition, mangoes can be offered to importers as being free of fruit fly, as can litchi and rambutan. Hot peppers provide both fresh produce and a product for processing into a piquant sauce, and have the added attraction that they return a weekly, year-round income. Adding value has the advantage of keeping more of the final sale income in-country; it offers employment, often in rural communities, and it is an opportunity to package and brand products so that they are identified with the most favourable images associated with the country. Mauritius has token the route of distancing its own sugar from bulk sugar by offering a part-refined sugar as `golden grain sugar', packing it in clear plastic, and selling the product at a premium. Mauritius has also used two local products in combination to add value to both, for example vanilla-flavoured tea. Kenya is renowned world-wide for its wildlife, so offering `Safari' brand whisky, gin and vodka to tourists and others is a smart marketing move. The Bahamas Islands have, with FAO advice and assistance, developed a lemon liqueur for sale to tourists. The product is the outcome of adversity: while some of the Bahamas Islands are close to Florida and are popular tourist destinations or have fertile soils for agriculture, others suffer the twin disadvantages of remoteness and `soil that is little more than coral rock. The only worthwhile crop is lemons, but these cannot be exported competitively. An Italian FAO consultant, with experience of producing a lemon liqueur in his native Sicily, advised how imported alcohol could be flavoured by locally grown lemons and offered for sale in attractive triangular bottles. In Fiji mineral water has been packaged very attractively by printing a colour picture of the mountain and waterfall close to the source on the reverse side of the bottle label: the colour picture is thus viewed through the water in the bottle. Mineral waters are now to be found in a great many countries and imaginative packaging and presentation can help a `new' product to compete successfully in an already crowded market: the Fijian water is available throughout the country itself, which is a major tourist destination, and is exported to the United States. Fiji also packs and sells to tourists 'Fijian' sugar, tea, coffee, spices and kava, the dried root that is used to make the infusion which is central to Fijian ceremonies and hospitality. Tourism has also provided an excellent export market for Dominica's coconut soap production. For some years the product has been common in many hotels throughout the Eastern Caribbean and now is supplied to cruise ships. Island nations seem to have been particularly successful at developing niche markets for both food and non-food items. This may be because they generally have limited options for volume production of commodity crops and when they do (sugar, bananas, citrus) they cannot compete with large-scale, continental producers on price alone. They are therefore forced to look for alternative products or at advantageous ways of marketing existing products. Successful producers have identified and promoted what market gurus refer to as the `unique selling point' or USP of their merchandise. Non-island ACP countries have also been successful, and it could be argued that Kenya is an outstanding example. Kenya has long been a major exporter of coffee, tea, pyrethrum and sisal but in the last two decades has carved a very significant place for Kenyan horticultural products in the world market, particularly in the EU and in the Gulf region. Putting theory into practice To be successful all those involved, from producer to packer, processor or exporter, must want to, succeed and must recognize and respect their interdependent roles. This also includes the scientists and extensionists whose support is essential in researching and communicating new products and technologies. There is no longer room for the attitude that 'this is just a job' because success or failure will determine individual and national incomes and standards of living. Until a few years ago, the banana growers of the Windward Islands were able to earn a modest but secure income and could afford to adopt a fairly relaxed attitude to production. Now, with the prospect of competition from the giant fruit companies operating in Latin America, they have good reason to feel uneasy. However, according to Colin Bulley, Programme Manager of the Agricultural Diversification Programme for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), 'Our farmers are resolute. They recognize the need to improve farm management and to look to other farm enterprises, crops and livestock, in addition to bananas'. There is also a developing cottage industry in Dominica and in Grenada processing a range of fruits, vegetables and spices such as Grenadian nutmeg and Dominican ginger into jams, jellies, juices, pickles and relishes, says Mr Bulley. In Zambia a private company, BIMZI Ltd., provides an example of how smallholders are working with the company to produce a range of food and commercial crops, including paprika and marigold, for the food processing industry. BIMZI Managing Director Cathy Mwanumwamba describes how they select only the best and most reliable farmers to source from. BIMZI provides credit and advice from the Golden Valley Research Station. The farmers are charged for extension visits, because the advisory staff s time and travel must be paid for, but this is an overhead that is token into account when budgeting production. The system appears to work well but, to begin with, up to, 60 % of farmers defaulted on their repayments. 'We have dropped those farmers who didn't pay', <b>says</b> <b>Ms</b> Mwanumwamba, 'and they no longer benefit. Our collection rate is now 95 % and as time goes on the rate of default is decreasing. Where export markets are the target outlet air transport is invariably the preferred carrier, especially for perishable commodities. Not all countries are as well served as Barbados, Fiji, Kenya, Mauritius, St Lucia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, all of which are major tourist destinations with a choice of scheduled flights to, carry air freight on a regular and reliable basis. Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal are also airline route hubs and can provide a similar level of service. But other countries may have to depend on feeder services to international flights, which means that goods have to be double-handled; they risk being left to overheat on the tarmac or being left behind at the transit point if the onward flight is full. Can there be gaps or niches remaining in such a crowded and competitive market? The answer has to be an unequivocal 'Yes'. There are more consumers every year, and greater prosperity in many countries making them able to purchase unusual new products. Thailand recently started canning coconut water for export; Dominica is developing a fruit which locally is traditional, the golden apple, but is being sold abroad as the jordan plum; at HORTEC, the horticultural trade exhibition in Nairobi in Match, the FPEAK stand exhibited a range of Kenyan exports including kiwano or African honey melon, which has been exported to Germany and Switzerland for two years and may now be exported elsewhere. There can be no expectation that surviving in the open market situation of the future will be easy or free of competition and disappointments, but the demand for tropical produce will remain and will grow. The rewards will go to, those who act professionally and who have the imagination and determination to offer something original to consumers. In the words of Ms Mwanumwamba of BIMZI Ltd. in Zambia, 'This liberalized market is very good for everybody. I think that it will create a good primary agricultural base for everybody in this country - in this continent.
