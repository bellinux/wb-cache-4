25|$|Miss Jummy {{began her}} three-year-old season in The Riddlesworth over the Ditch Mile {{course at the}} Newmarket Craven meeting in mid-April. She led from the start and won by half a length from her only opponent, a colt named Oberon. On 30 April, Miss Jummy started at odds of 3/1 for in the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. The field of nine {{included}} her former opponents Modwena (the 2/1 favourite), Sunrise and Argo Navis. When the race began the outsider <b>Sagitta</b> rushed {{to the front and}} opened up a lead of twenty lengths before tiring rapidly after half distance. As <b>Sagitta</b> dropped back, Watts took over the lead on Miss Jummy just ahead of Cataract, Argo Navis and Modwena. Miss Jummy increased her advantage in the final furlong and comfortably held the challenge of Argo Navis to win the £3,250 prize by one and a half lengths; Jewel Song finished a head in front of Modwena to take third place.|$|E
25|$|Finfish (class Osteichthyes) {{have three}} pairs of {{otoliths}} – the sagittae (singular <b>sagitta),</b> lapilli (singular lapillus), and asterisci (singular asteriscus). The sagittae are largest, found just behind the eyes and approximately level with them vertically. The lapilli and asterisci (smallest of the three) are located within the semicircular canals. The sagittae are normally composed of aragonite (although vaterite abnormalities can occur), as are the lapilli, while the asterisci are normally composed of vaterite.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{otoliths}} accrete {{layers of}} calcium carbonate and gelatinous matrix throughout their lives. The accretion rate varies with {{growth of the}} fish – often less growth in winter and more in summer – which results in the appearance of rings that resemble tree rings. By counting the rings, {{it is possible to}} determine the age of the fish in years. Typically the <b>sagitta</b> is used, as it is largest, but sometimes lapilli are used if they have a more convenient shape. The asteriscus, which is smallest of the three, is rarely used in age and growth studies.|$|E
40|$|Otoliths are calcium {{carbonate}} structures {{located in the}} inner ear of fish; {{they are responsible for}} hearing and balance. The inner ear has three pairs of otoliths: the lapilli, the <b>sagittae</b> and the asterisci. The <b>sagittae</b> otoliths are the largest and their format is species-specific. Because of their composition, otoliths can resist to the digestive tract of ichthyophagous species, and they can be used as an important tool for identifying species of fish found in stomach contents. The purpose of this work is to provide a photographic guide of the <b>sagittae</b> otoliths of the main fish species from the Sinos River. This atlas consists of photographs of the <b>sagittae</b> otoliths of 36 species belonging to 15 families distributed in five orders...|$|R

On the other hand, the absolute value of otolith mass asymmetry is increased with the fish length. The value of <b>sagittae</b> mass asymmetry falls between - 0. 2 and + 0. 2...|$|R
25|$|Quite {{early in}} their history, the Carmelites began to develop {{ministries}} in keeping with their new status as mendicant religious. This resulted in the production in 1270 of a letter Ignea <b>Sagitta</b> (Flaming Arrow) by the ruling prior general from 1266 to 1271, Nicholas of Narbonne (also known as Nicholas Gallicus, or Nicholas the Frenchman), who called {{for a return to}} a strictly eremitical life. His belief that most friars were ill-suited to an active apostolate was based on a number of scandals. The letter is symbolic of the tensions the Carmelites grappled with in the thirteenth century between their eremitical origins (expressed particularly in a desire for solitude and a focus on contemplation) and their more recent transformation into a fundamentally mendicant order (expressed in the desire to respond to the Church's apostolic mission).|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 30 May 1939 {{powered by}} two Walter <b>Sagitta</b> I-SR air cooled vee piston engines. The trial flights identified {{problems with the}} cooling of the rear engine and general engine performance. It was proposed to use Rolls-Royce or Daimler-Benz engines in the production aircraft. Concerns were also raised about the pilot clearing the rear propeller {{if he had to}} bail out and an ejector seat was studied. As a provisional solution, rails were put {{on both sides of the}} forward fuselage for the Fokker test pilot, Gerben Sonderman, to use to bail out in an emergency. The aircraft was flown 11 times for a total flight time of less than four hours. The rear fuselage paneling was modified significantly before the last few flights in an attempt to address chronic rear engine cooling problems. On the 11th flight in April, the undercarriage was damaged, and the programme was abandoned in May 1940 when the German forces invaded the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The {{infantry}} (armatura) was heavy, {{because they}} had helmets (cassis), coats of mail (catafracta), greaves (ocrea), shields (scutum), larger swords (gladius maior), which they call broadswords (spatha), and some smaller, which they name half-broadswords (semispathium), five weighted darts (plumbata) placed in the shields, which they hurl {{at the beginning of}} the assault, then double throwables, a larger one with an iron point of nine ounces and a stock of five and one-half feet, which was called a pilum, but now is called a spiculum, in the use of which the soldiers were especially practised, and with skill and courage could penetrate the shields of the infantry and the mail of the cavalry. The other smaller had five ounces of iron and a stock of three and one-half feet, and was called a vericulum but now is a verutum. The first line, of hastati, and the second, of principes, were composed of such arms. Behind them were the bearers (ferentarius) and the light infantry, whom now we say are the supporters and the infantry, shield-bearers (scutum) with darts (plumbata) and swords (gladius), armed just as are nearly all soldiers today. There were likewise bowmen (sagittarius) with helmet (cassis), coat of mail (catafracta), sword (gladius), arrows (<b>sagitta)</b> and bow (arcus). There were slingers (funditor) who slung small stones (lapis) in slings (funda) or cudgel-throwers (fustibalus). There were artillery-men (tragularius), who shot arrows from the manuballista and the arcuballista.|$|E

40|$|Daily {{increment}} validation in fish otolith {{is fundamental}} to studies on fish oto-lith microstructure, age determination and life history traits, and thus is critical for species conservation and fishery management. However, {{it has never been}} done for Schizothoracine fish, which is the dominant component of fish fauna in the Tibetan Plateau. This study validated the daily increment formation of Gymnocypris selincuoensis, as a representative of Schizothoracine fish, by moni-toring the growth of hatchery-reared larvae group and wild-caught post-yolk-sac larvae group under controlled experiments. The results from monitoring the hatchery-reared larvae group showed that <b>sagittae</b> and lapilli were found in yolk-sac larvae, and formed 5 – 7 days before hatching, but asterisci were not found until 11 days post-hatching. The first increment in <b>sagittae</b> and lapilli was formed in the first day after hatching.

Increments were laid down in the <b>sagittae</b> with daily periodicity starting on day of hatching. Standard length (SL) and <b>sagittae</b> radius (OR) were correlated: SL(mm) = 2. 65 + 0. 012 OR(mm). The series of measurements of daily growth increment widths (DWI), food density and water temperature were analyzed by means of time series analysis. The DWI series were strongly autocorrelated, the growth on any one day was dependent upon growth on the previous day. Time series of water temperatures showed, as expected, a random pattern of variation, while food consumed daily was a function of food consumed the two previous days. The DWI series and the food density were correlated positively at lags 1 and 2. The results provided evidence {{of the importance of}} food intake upon the <b>sagittae</b> growth when temperature is optimal (20 ºC). <b>Sagittae</b> growth was correlated with growth on the previous day, so this should be taken into account when fish growth is derived from <b>sagittae</b> growth rates...|$|R
