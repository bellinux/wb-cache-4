To meet the army's increased requirement for national and tactical intelligence, an Intelligence and Security Branch was established effective 1 July 1962, by General Order No. 38, on 3 July 1962. On 1 July 1967, the branch was re-designated as Military Intelligence.|$|E
50|$|In an unfunded {{defined benefit}} pension, no assets are set aside and the {{benefits}} {{are paid for by}} the employer or other pension sponsor as and when they are paid. Pension arrangements provided by the state in most countries in the world are unfunded, with benefits paid directly from current workers' contributions and taxes. This method of financing is known as Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO or PAYG). The social security systems of many European countries are unfunded, having benefits paid directly out of current taxes and social security contributions, although several countries have hybrid systems which are partially funded. Spain set up the Social <b>Security</b> <b>Reserve</b> Fund and France set up the Pensions Reserve Fund; in Canada the wage-based retirement plan (CPP) is partially funded, with assets managed by the CPP Investment Board while the U.S. Social Security system is partially funded by investment in special U.S. Treasury Bonds.|$|E

50|$|However {{its value}} as a famine food has fallen due {{to a number of}} causes, as {{detailed}} in the April 2003 issue of the UN-OCHA Ethiopia unit's Focus on Ethiopia:Apart from an Enset plant disease epidemic in 1984-85 which wiped out large parts of the plantations and created the green famine, in the past 10 years major factors were recurrent drought and food shortage together with acute land shortage that forced farmers more and more into consumption of immature plants. Hence farmers were overexploiting their Enset reserves thereby causing gradual losses and disappearance of the false banana as an important household food <b>security</b> <b>reserve.</b> Even though not all the plant losses can be attributed to drought and land shortage and hence early consumption of immature crops, estimations go as far as more than 60% of the false banana crop stands have been lost in some areas in SNNPR during the last 10 years. This basically means that a great many people who used to close the food gap with false banana consumption are not able to do so any more, and lacking a viable alternative, have become food insecure and highly vulnerable to climatic and economic disruptions of their agricultural system.|$|E
40|$|Since the 1973 - 74 drought, FAO {{has participated}} in several studies in Ethiopia related to food {{security}} and, in 1979, recommended {{the establishment of a}} food <b>security</b> <b>reserve</b> (FSR) in strategically located warehouses of an initial 60 000 tonnes, to rise over time to 180 000 tonnesWarehousing for 350 000 tonnes of grain was constructed under a World Bank programme, and donations of grain were received from the WFP and bilateral sources. The FSR became operational in April 1982; technical assistance was provided, until 1986, through projects GCP/ETH/ 032 /NET and GCP/ETH/ 040 /NET, which were funded by the Government of the Netherlands and executed by FAOHowever, donor support for the FSR was well below target and the management of stocks was not of adequate standard. The Government of Ethiopia therefore requested additional technical assistance to manage and extend the food <b>security</b> <b>reserve.</b> This resulted in the approval of project ETH/ 86 / 018, implemented by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) and executed by FAOThe main purpose of the project was to strengthen the planning and operational management of the FSR, to enable the RRC to maintain grain quality in national and regional stores, and to provide training in warehouse management and food administrationThe project provided support to the RRC and the National Committee for Central Planning on FSR issues, arranged training courses for staff of the RRC and the Agricultural Marketing Corporation, in Ethiopia and abroad, and established five mobile fumigation teamsThe project also undertook additional work on the disinfestation of foodgrain stocks under the FAO Technical Cooperation Programme project TCP/ETH/ 8962, `Emergency Assistance for the Maintenance of Foodgrain Studies'As a result of the project, there has been a significant improvement in the standards of warehouse management and stock quality. Despite difficult circumstances, the Government has maintained and operated a reserve stock since 1982, with technical assistance from this and earlier FAO-executed projects. However, stocks have been well below target levels, as donors have been reluctant to support the reserve under RRC management. The planned decentralization has not taken place, due to the security situation and low level of stocksIt was recommended that the Government complete the institutional arrangements necessary to bring the FSR into full operation, including the establishment of the Food Security Unit as an autonomous unit within the RRC, with an expanded role in relation to national and international donor and technical agenciesIt was essential that the size of the food <b>security</b> <b>reserve</b> be built up to the levels planned, and decentralized by the use of regional warehouses, in order to effectively operate the reserve; it was recommended that warehouse and pest management training be provided on a continuing basis; and that the mobile disinfestation services be maintained.

40|$|Holding {{strategic}} grain {{reserves to}} address food price hikes has received renewed attentions in recent years. This paper examines {{such a program}} in Ethiopia that {{has been successful in}} addressing several emergencies since the 1990 s. The analysis suggests that the key ingredients behind the success are a unique institutional design, coordination during emergencies with food-based safety net programs, and keeping the grain stocks to a minimum. Institutional design is unique because, unlike similar agencies in other countries, Ethiopia’s Emergency Food <b>Security</b> <b>Reserve</b> Administration (EFSRA) is independent of price stabilization and hence is not engaged in buying and selling of grain. The paper also demonstrates that scaling up school feeding programs will generate additional food demand and an effective outlet for stock rotation; and that increasing the stock level for price stabilization will adversely affect both grain markets and the performance of the EFSRA.

40|$|South Sudan faces serious {{problems}} of food insecurity due to low per capita levels of domestic food production, periodic droughts, widespread poverty, political unrest, and since late 2013, renewed armed conflict. Agricultural productivity is low, {{and the country}} is highly dependent on private-sector imports of cereals (maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice) from Uganda to supply domestic markets. National household survey data indicate substantial diversity in consumption of cereals across households, and our econometric estimates suggest highly price- and income-inelastic demand for the two major cereals, sorghum and maize. Drawing on a review of international experience and the constraints facing South Sudan, we conclude that a national food <b>security</b> <b>reserve</b> (NFSR) system with a small national food security stock is feasible for South Sudan. Cereal stocks would be kept mainly for targeted safety nets and emergency distribution, and market interventions would be limited in scope, in keeping with a long-run goal of market development. Nonetheless, even with a functioning NFSR, promotion of private-sector domestic and import trade will remain crucial for ensuring adequate supplies of grain and food securityDiscussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; E Building Resilience; C Improving markets and trade; CRP 2; Strategic Food ReserveDSGD; MTID; PIMCGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM...|$|E

At the same time, Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) have increased in numbers and in the global role of their investment activities, despite within a highly heterogeneous sector.

Moreover, we investigate the impact of the financial crises and to relevance of the ‘home-bias’ issue for both groups. Our results suggest a less aggressive asset allocation and a higher level of home investments for SSRFs, where funding relies on contributions from participants triggering more external scrutiny and despite SPRFs may express additional domestic strategic goals than retirement. We find also a more aggressive asset allocation in emerging markets but no evidence of effects on the home-bias. Finally, we do not find major shifts in asset allocation induced by the financial crisis; instead, we report weak evidence of a reduced home-bias in more recent years, especially after the triggering of the sovereign debt crisis...|$|E

In [1] they consider Turbo SHA- 224 / 256 r and Turbo SHA- 384 / 512 -r with variable number of rounds r from 1 to 8. The authors of [1] show collision attack on Turbo SHA- 256 - 1 with one round which has the complexity of 2 64. For other r from 2 to 8 they don't find better attack than with the complexity of 2 128. Similarly, for Turbo SHA- 512 they find only collision attack on Turbo SHA- 512 - 1 with one round which has the complexity of 2 128. For r from 2 to 8 they don't find better attack than with the complexity of 2 256. In this paper we show collision attack on SHA- 256 -r for r = 1, 2, [...] ., 8 with the complexity of 2 16 r.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a growth model with overlapping generations {{of workers who}} save for life-cycle reasons and Ricardian capitalists who save from a bequest motive. The population of workers accommodates growth,so {{that the rate of}} capital accumulation is endogenous and determines the growth of employment. Two regimes are possible, one in which workers’ saving dominates the long-run and a second in which the long-run equilibrium growth rate is determined completely by the capitalist saving function, sometimes called the Cambridge equation. The second regime exhibits a version of the Pasinetti Paradox: changes in workers’ saving affect the level, but not the growth rate, of capital in the long run. Applied to social security, this result implies that an unfunded system relying on payroll taxes reduces workers’ lifetime wealth and saving, creating level effects on the capital stock without affecting its long-run growth rate. These effects are mitigated by the presence of a reserve fund, various levels of which are examined. Calibrating the model to realistic parameter values for the U. S. facilitates an interpretation of the controversies over the percentage of the national wealth originating in life-cycle saving and the effects of social security on saving. The model is offered as an analytical framework for the review of current topics in fiscal policy, in particular identifying the social <b>security</b> <b>reserve</b> fund as a potential vehicle for generating capital accumulation and effecting a progressive redistribution of wealth. overlapping generations growth; social security; Pasinetti paradox...|$|E

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pension Statistics are presented in the following tables: Pensions statistics This dataset includes pension funds statistics with OECD classifications by type of pension plans and by type of pension funds. All types of plans are included (occupational and personal, mandatory and voluntary). The OECD classification considers both funded and book reserved pension plans that are workplace-based (occupational pension plans) or accessed directly in retail markets (personal pension plans). Both mandatory and voluntary arrangements are included. The data includes plans where benefits are paid by a private sector entity (classified as private pension plans by the OECD) {{as well as those}} paid by a funded public sector entity. Data are presented in various measures depending on the variable: millions of national currency, millions of USD, thousands or unit. The data runs from 1980 onwards. Pensions indicators This dataset comprises statistics pertaining to pensions indicators. It includes indicators such as occupational pension funds' asset as a % of GDP, personal pension funds' asset as a % of GDP, DC pension plans' assets as a % of total assets. Pension fund and plan types are classified according to the OECD classification. Three dimensions cover this classification: pension plan type, definition type and contract type. The data runs from 1980 onwards. Public pension reserve funds' assets This dataset covers both social <b>security</b> <b>reserve</b> funds and sovereign pension reserve funds, the two main categories of public pension reserve funds. Social <b>security</b> <b>reserve</b> funds are set up as part of the overall social security system. They are funded chiefly by surpluses from employee and/or employer contributions over current payouts and, in some cases, by top-up contributions from the government through fiscal transfers and other sources. Sovereign pension reserve funds are funds established by governments (independently of social security systems), who finance them directly through fiscal transfers. This table provided statistics on total asset, asset allocation, nominal net investment return, operating expenses and derivatives. Data are expressed in various measures such as stock and flow, data for asset classes are available in national currency million, nominal net investment returns are provided in percent, operating costs are expressed as a percent of total assets under management. The value of derivatives held is available in thousands of national currency. The data runs from 2000 onwards. Pensions at a Glance/ELS Pensions This dataset covers all OECD countries and is designed to show future entitlements for workers who enter the labour market in a particular year and spend their entire working lives under the same set of rules. These data were first provided by the UK Data Service in November 2014. The UK Data Service web site includes further information on the OECD Pensions Statistics holdings, including a dataset user guide and details of latest database updates.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{is defined as}} economic access to food along with food production and food availability. Agriculture in the SAR (South Asian Region) is caught in a low equilibrium trap with low productivity of staples, supply shortfalls, high prices, low returns to farmers and area diversification - all these factors can {{be a threat to}} food security. South Asia still has the highest number of people (423 millions) living on less than one dollar a day. The region has the highest concentration of undernourished (299 million) and poor people with about 40 per cent of the worlds hungry. Despite an annual 1. 7 per cent reduction in the prevalence of undernourishment in the region in the past decade, the failure to reduce the absolute number of the undernourished remains a major cause for concern. Estimates by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) indicate that by 2010, Asia will still account for about one-half of the worlds undernourished population, of which two-thirds will be from South Asia. Though SAARC countries have established a food bank {{to meet the needs of}} food security in the region, it has not been operational even during times of crisis. This is despite the felt need of member nations to evolve mechanisms to make the SAARC Food <b>Security</b> <b>Reserve</b> operational. It is against this background that this study has been undertaken. Conducted in collaboration with think-tanks from South Asian countries, it aims to identify issues relating to food security, the policy initiatives taken to tackle these issues, evaluate these policies and suggest measures to overcome identified constraints in order to improve the food security situation in the region.
