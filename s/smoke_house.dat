5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette <b>smoke,</b> <b>house</b> fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
25|$|Edward Kemp's {{plan was}} for a formal garden {{containing}} a conservatory and plant houses {{to the north of}} the house. Beyond these were a garden yard, a stable yard, a coach house and a farm yard. To the west of these was a substantial kitchen garden. The other outbuildings included a vinery, with a heated wall, and a <b>smoke</b> <b>house</b> for curing bacon and ham. Joseph Stubs was a collector of rare plants and many of these were planted in what he called the American Garden.

The property {{included many}} related buildings {{such as a}} casting house and a stove house, twenty-one log homes, a wagon shop, <b>smoke</b> <b>house,</b> stable, sawmill, boarding house, and store. The employees were often paid in kind rather than in cash. The furnace {{was never able to}} achieve a profit and was forced to close for several reasons: the Pennsylvania Railroad chose the Conemaugh Valley for its new route rather than the Blacklick, the furnace utilized outdated technologies, and the cost of hauling iron to the Canal was high. David Ritter experienced financial problems, losing property in Armagh as payment when sued by former partner George Rodgers for $350. In July 1848, the property was seized and sold at sheriff's sale to Soloman Alter and Joseph Replier of Philadelphia. After being purchased by Alter and Replier, the property passed hands many times before ultimately passing from Manor Realty of the Pennsylvania Railroad to the Cambria County Historical Society.|$|E
