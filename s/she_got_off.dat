500|$|Almirante Latorre {{was renamed}} HMS Canada and {{slightly}} modified for British service. The bridge {{was taken off}} in favor of two open platforms, and a mast was added in between the two funnels to support a derrick that would service launches. The super-dreadnought completed fitting-out on 20 September 1915, and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 October. She initially served with the 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. Canada saw action in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916, firing 42 rounds from her 14-inch guns and 109 6-inch shells during the battle, and suffered no hits or casualties. During the battle, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> two salvoes at the disabled cruiser [...] at 18:40, and fired five more at an unknown ship around 19:20. Her 6-inch guns were utilized for firing at German destroyers at 19:11.|$|E

500|$|Phoebe and Ross {{arrive at}} the airport as Rachel boards the plane again. Ross tells her he loves her, but she is unable {{to deal with his}} {{confession}} and gets on the plane anyway. Ross returns home, dejected, and finds a message from Rachel on the phone. She explains her actions and decides to get off the plane, but the message cuts off. Ross panickingly tries fixing the answering machine, wondering to himself out loud if <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the plane. From behind him, Rachel says she did. They kiss and get back together for good, both agreeing that this is where they want to be. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on the kitchen counter and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, [...] "Where?". The final scene is a shot of the apartment, panning round slowly from the living space to the front door.|$|E
2500|$|While in high school, {{she began}} taking drugs– cocaine, LSD, and methamphetamine– {{accompanied}} by her brother (who {{was addicted to}} heroin) and at times her father. Her addiction worsened during her four years with her boyfriend. She eventually stopped eating properly and became too thin to model; Jack left her in 1994. She weighed [...] when a friend {{put her in a}} wheelchair and sent her to her father, who was then living in Redding, California, in order to detox; her father did not recognize her when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the plane.|$|E
2500|$|Caresse became {{politically}} active again and founded the organizations Women Against War and Citizens of the World, which embraced {{the concept of}} a [...] "world community", which other activists like Buckminster Fuller also supported. Caresse continued her work to establish a world citizen's center in Delphi, Greece, where in 1942 she bought a small house that overlooked the Grove of Apollo. In October 1952, she attempted to visit her property, but she was met by armed guards at Corfu as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the ferry from Brindisi. The police placed her under house arrest in the Corfu Palace Hotel, and after three days they told her she was not welcome in Greece and ordered her to leave. The American consul told her that the Greek government thought she was still [...] "considered dangerous to the economy and politics of Greece." [...] When her plan failed, she sought to create the [...] "World Man Center" [...] in Cyprus, which was to include a geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller. This effort, too, came to naught, and she continued to search for a center for her world citizen project.|$|E

She now knew where she was and could find the direct route to the Conants, had she dared go there. To gain time for thought the girl stepped into the doorway of the bank, which was closed for the day, thus avoiding being jostled by pedestrians. She set down her suit case, leaned against the door-frame and tried to determine her wisest course of action.|$|E

6000|$|I don't {{think that}} Lord Ragnall quite liked it, but {{fortunately}} Lady Longden was a talkative person. First she conversed about her {{cold in the}} head, sneezing at intervals, poor soul, and being reduced to send for another handkerchief after the entrées. Then <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> upon business matters; to judge {{from the look of}} boredom on her host's face, I think it must have been of settlements. Three times did I hear him refer her to the lawyers--without avail.

Archie followed more slowly. When he reached the door of his room, the passage was empty. He inserted the key in his door, turned it, pushed the door open, and pocketed the key.

If the manageress was in a good temper she would let her go at seven. Philip had agreed to wait outside from a quarter past seven onwards. He looked forward to the occasion with painful eagerness, for in the cab on the way from the theatre to the station he thought she would let him kiss her. The vehicle gave every facility for a man to put his arm round a girl's waist (an advantage which the hansom had over the taxi of the present day), and the delight of that was worth the cost of the evening's entertainment.|$|E

And it required no great conceit on young Esmond's part to see that his own brains were better than his patron's, who, indeed, never assumed any airs of superiority over the lad, or over any dependant of his, save when he was displeased, in which case he would express his mind in oaths very freely; and who, on the contrary, perhaps, spoiled [...] "Parson Harry," [...] as he called young Esmond, by constantly praising his parts and admiring his boyish stock of learning.|$|E

The madcap Lee, whom Clinton had faced at Boston, now met him at Charleston. Lee, and the gallant garrison there, made a brilliant and most successful resistance. The fort on Sullivan's Island, which we attacked, was a nut we could not crack. The fire of all our frigates was {{not strong enough to}} pound its shell; the passage by which we moved up to the assault of the place was not fordable, as those officers found--Sir Henry at the head of them, who was always the first to charge--who attempted to wade it. Death by shot, by drowning, by catching my death of cold, I had braved before I returned to my wife; and our frigate being aground for a time and got off with difficulty, was agreeably cannonaded by the enemy until <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> her bank.|$|E
