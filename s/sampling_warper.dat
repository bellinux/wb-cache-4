40|$|We {{describe}} an importance sampling method to generate samples {{based on the}} product of a BRDF and an environment map or large light source. The method works by creating a hierarchical partition of the light source based on the BRDF function for each primary (eye) ray in a ray tracer. This partition, along with a summed area table of the light source, form an approximation to the product function that is suitable for importance sampling. The partition is used to guide a <b>sample</b> <b>warping</b> algorithm to transform a uniform distribution of points so that they approximate the product distribution.

This generalization has immediate applicability in rendering, e. g., importance sampling the product of a BRDF and an environment map where the lighting is stored as a single high-resolution wavelet and the BRDF is represented in spherical harmonics. Since spherical harmonics can be efficiently rotated, this product can be computed on-the-fly even if the BRDF is stored in local-space.

Furthermore, many warps are asymmetric, as they show up in only one side of the disk or exhibit large differences in amplitude in the approaching and receding sides of the galaxy.

40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects of burning on saw mark characteristics of isolated semi-fleshed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) long bones as a substitute for human remains. Different classes of saws were examined to determine which type of saw mark characteristics are obliterated when burned and which are not. The saw mark characteristics that were examined are superficial false start scratches, false start kerfs, and completely sectioned cuts with breakaway spurs/notches. The long bones were burned at the Boston University School of Medicine using a muffle furnace, at differing temperatures and at differing time increments. The author hypothesized that the higher the temperature and the longer the duration of bone burning, the greater will be the obliterative effect on saw mark characteristics. All samples were examined using a Motic® Digital Light Microscope 12 VDC with a Nikon® MKII Fiber Optic Light attached with accompanying Motic® imaging and measuring software. Distances were measured between striations on complete cuts, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths using the Motic® imaging and measuring software. Images were also taken of the cross sections of the kerf floors. The striations on the kerf walls, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths were compared to the control samples. Measurements taken from false start scratches, false start kerfs, and complete cuts were averaged and compared to the averages from each temperature and the control samples, to assess the degree of shrinkage from thermal alteration. The false start kerf profile shapes were blindly examined and classified into Class A, B, C, or D(following the system of Symes 1992) and compared to the control samples. Kerf flare and blade drift were examined to determine if thermal alteration obliterated those saw mark characteristics. The chainsaw false start kerfs and complete cuts were examined macroscopically to determine what effects thermal alteration had on those types of marks. All thermally altered samples were assessed for color change, heat-related fracturing, and whether or not the saw marks were still visible. The author found that all saw marks made with the mitre saw, crosscut saw, and bow saw were still visible and identifiable, even in a fractured state and, when burned up to 700 °C for one hour. Most of the false start kerf samples were classified into the correct kerf profile shape as outlines in Symes (1992). False start kerfs and complete cuts made with the chainsaw were blindly examined and showed that these marks are distinct and easily identifiable when the bone is completely intact or has very minimal fracturing. The crosscut saw false start scratch and crosscut saw complete cut samples showed signs of shrinkage. The average width of the false start scratch samples burned at 700 °C for one hour was about 50 % smaller than the control sample's average width. The same was true for the complete cut striation widths. Shrinkage did not appear to alter the crosscut saw false start kerf widths or the bow saw false start scratch widths. For all cuts made with the mitre saw shrinkage did appear to alter the <b>samples.</b> <b>Warping</b> did occur where some of the burned averages were larger than the control sample averages. This suggests that some warping did take place by widening the kerf, thus changing the analysis of the saw mark characteristics. Blade drift and kerf flare were seen in the samples and thus were not affected by thermal alteration. The author's hypothesis was not rejected, because in some cases thermal alteration did modify the saw mark characteristic measurements and in some cases thermal alteration did not alter the measurements. Some of the saw marks were affected by shrinkage, while others were not. False start kerf profile shape classification was not affected by thermal alteration. The chainsaw samples were affected most by the thermal alteration, because of the obliterative effects of heat-related fracturing which progressed generally with the greater temperature...|$|R

Though this seems {{to work for the}} majority of cases, no detailed analysis exists about the impact of undersampling on the accuracy of the final classifier. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing an integrated analysis of the two elements which have the largest impact on the effectiveness of an undersampling strategy: the increase of the variance due to the reduction of the number of <b>samples</b> and the <b>warping</b> of the posterior distribution due to the change of priori probabilities. In particular we will propose a theoretical analysis specifying under which conditions undersampling is recommended and expected to be effective. It emerges that the impact of undersampling depends on the number of samples, the variance of the classifier, the degree of imbalance and more specifically on the value of the posterior probability. This makes difficult to predict the average effectiveness of an undersampling strategy since its benefits depend on the distribution of the testing points.

Unlike the splatting methods, it guarantees surface continuity and it also controls aliasing using a novel filtering method adapted to forward mapping. Unlike the triangle-mesh method, it requires considerably less computation per input sample, reducing the rasterization-setup cost by a factor of four...|$|R
40|$|The texture-based volume {{rendering}} is a memory-intensive algorithm. Its performance {{relies heavily}} {{on the performance of}} the texture cache. However, most existing texture-based volume rendering methods blindly map computational resources to texture memory and result in incoherent memory access patterns, causing low cache hit rates in certain cases. The distance between samples taken by threads of an atomic scheduling unit (e. g. a warp of 32 threads in CUDA) of the GPU is a crucial factor that affects the texture cache performance. Based on this fact, we present a new <b>sampling</b> strategy, called <b>Warp</b> Marching, for the ray-casting algorithm of texture-based volume rendering. The effects of different sample organizations and different thread-pixel mappings in the ray-casting algorithm are thoroughly analyzed. Also, a pipeline manner color blending approach is introduced and the power of warp-level GPU operations is leveraged to improve the efficiency of parallel executions on the GPU. In addition, the rendering performance of the Warp Marching is view-independent, and it outperforms existing empty space skipping techniques in scenarios that need to render large dynamic volumes in a low resolution image. Through a series of micro-benchmarking and real-life data experiments, we rigorously analyze our sampling strategies and demonstrate significant performance enhancements over existing sampling methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of digital image registration and geometric correction can be subdivided into two parts: 1) {{determination of the}} warping function which will transform the geometry of the scene to the desired geometric coordinate system; and 2) processing of the digital image intensity <b>samples,</b> given the <b>warping</b> function, to produce image samples on the desired coordinate grid. The latter process, called 2 ̆ 2 resampling 2 ̆ 2, is {{a subset of the}} {{problems of}} image reconstruction, i. e., determination of the continuous (analog) image from a set of samples of the image, and {{is the subject of this}} paper. This paper defines the process of image resampling in more detail in terms of general imager system models, the requirements of digital image geometric manipulation and constraints of available digital processing systems. The problem is then formulated as a constrained linear estimation problem with suitable image models and optimization criteria. The resulting reconstruction filters are compared to more heuristic approaches, such as nearest neighbor, bilinear interpolation, Lagrange interpolation, and cubic convolution (cubic and quartic spline interpolators). Finally, the various resampling techniques are compared against theoretical image models, synthetically generated imagery, and actual ERTS MSS data. Nearest neighbor, bilinear, and Lagrange interpolation resamplers are shown to give significantly poorer reconstruction accuracy than TRW Cubic Convolution and the optimal constrained linear estimator...|$|R
