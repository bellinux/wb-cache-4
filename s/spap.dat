Between 1929 and 1931 <b>SPAP</b> trains would access the Lavrion line at Attiki station using a temporary short connection passing over the standard gauge line north of Athens Central ("Larissis") station.|$|E

5000|$|In 1926, the Hellenic Electric Railways S.A.

In 1929 <b>SPAP</b> (Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways) took over the Iraklio - Lavrio branch line. The Athens terminal for Lavrio was moved from Lavrio Square to Athens Peloponnese Station. To join the Lavrio line to its network, <b>SPAP</b> built a connection between Agioi Anargyroi (Kato Liosia) and Iraklio (1931). The Lavrio line was eventually closed in 1957, due to political pressures from the road lobby.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{development}} of railway transport in Greece involved {{a number of}} different companies, which had created their own workshops for maintenance and constructions. The most important were Railway Works in Piraeus, originally operated by Athens-Piraeus Railways (SAP, which later transformed into Hellenic Electric Railways, EIS), and Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways (<b>SPAP,</b> forerunner of OSE), which, in addition to maintenance, repair and rebuilding, have entirely constructed a significant number of railroad cars, mostly between 1880 and 1960. Other noteworthy constructions included a small number of electric trams (clearly copies of a Dick Kerr model) built by EIS in 1939, and one of Greece’s first Diesel locomotives, designed and built by <b>SPAP</b> in 1961.|$|E

50|$|This 16 km branch line, {{part of the}} <b>SPAP</b> network, {{served the}} port of Kyllini, from which ferries sail to Zakynthos Island.

The line was shut down in 1969.|$|E
50|$|Initially Attica Railways used nine Tubize 0-6-2T steam {{locomotives}} (1885). Later it acquired nine Krauss Z 2-6-0T, {{plus one}} of the same type constructed in Piraeus by Vassiliadis Works. After 1929 only the Tubize locomotives remained in use on the Kifissia line, as the Krauss locomotives were transferred to <b>SPAP</b> for the Lavrion branch.|$|E
