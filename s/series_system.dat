This model is 20% thinner and 15% lighter compared to the original model, has an additional hour of battery life, an LCD instead of OLED, includes a micro USB Type B port, 1GB of internal storage memory. It was released in Japan on October 10, 2013 in six colors: white, black, pink, yellow, blue, and olive green, and in North America on May 6, 2014.|$|E

40|$|For the bad as old (BAO) {{model for}} system reliability, {{asymptotic}} distributions for {{time between failures}} and time of rth failure are obtained. For <b>series</b> <b>systems,</b> inequalities are obtained for the BAO and superimposed renewal (SR) models for distributions of number of failures and time between failures. Approximations for the distribution of number of failures are obtained for the BAO model for new, large <b>series</b> <b>systems.</b> Consideration {{is given to the}} use of BAO probabilities as approximations to SR probabilities for <b>series</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The {{decision}} to gradually change Brisbane's street lighting to the <b>series</b> <b>system</b> {{was taken in}} 1927, and the BCC decided to switch Balmoral and Coorparoo's street lighting to the <b>series</b> <b>system</b> in May 1930. In a parallel circuit system, each item receives its own full voltage from the power supply, but in the <b>series</b> <b>system</b> the current flows through each item in turn, in a loop from the power source. A series street lighting circuit usually consisted of about 100 lamps, and required a minimum of 2000 volts. If more lamps were added, a higher voltage was required to maintain the necessary current. If a lamp burnt out, two metal disks would carry the current and maintain the circuit. Incandescent street lights had become economically practical by 1917, and Brisbane developed its street lighting system using incandescent lamps, in series. The only other towns to use the <b>series</b> <b>system</b> for street lighting, since they had AC generators, were Maryborough, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns. Other towns used incandescent lights on the parallel system.|$|E

50|$|The <b>series</b> <b>system</b> {{of street}} {{lighting}} was being {{replaced with the}} parallel system by the 1960s. In 1970-71 there were 3135 lamps in series, and 33,951 in parallel. Since the final annual report of the BCC's Department of Electricity, 1976-77, noted that {{the last of the}} <b>series</b> <b>system</b> street lighting substations had been disconnected and dismantled during the year, Coorparoo Substation No. 210 would have been disconnected before or during 1977. For a period, the building was leased by the Buranda Bowls Club and used for storage, but it is currently empty.|$|E

40|$|Summary The main {{findings}} of a detailed literature search on solar-assisted heat pumps (SAHP) are presented. The various system types are described and the relevant performance criteria by which sys-tems can be assessed are defined.

While most work in the literature has focused on <b>series</b> <b>systems</b> there is no evi-dence that these can compete with parallel systems, either in non-purchased energy delivery or, more significantly, in cost. Efforts to improve control strategies for <b>series</b> <b>systems</b> are unable to achieve better performance. Technology is sufficiently advanced to exploit {{the best of these}} systems if the economic climate becomes favourable.
