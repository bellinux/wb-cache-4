25|$|In 1968, the European {{countries}} {{signed the}} Vienna Convention on Road Traffic treaty, {{with the aim}} of standardizing traffic regulations in participating countries in order to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety. Part of the treaty was the Vienna Convention on Road <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Signals,</b> which defined the traffic <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>signals.</b> As a result, in Western Europe the traffic signs are well standardized, although there are still some country-specific exceptions, mostly dating from the pre-1968 era.|$|E

This includes the same network of roads and streets used by motorists, except those roads from which cyclists have been banned (e.g., many freeways/motorways), plus additional bikeways that are not available to motor vehicles, such as bike paths, bike lanes, cycle tracks and, where permitted, sidewalks, plus amenities like bike racks for parking and specialized traffic <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|E
25|$|Signs, signals, {{markings}} {{and other}} features are often used to make priority explicit. Some signs, such as the stop sign, are nearly universal. When {{there are no signs}} or markings, different rules are observed depending on the location. These default priority rules differ between countries, and may even vary within countries. Trends toward uniformity are exemplified at an international level by the Vienna Convention on Road <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Signals,</b> which prescribes standardized traffic control devices (signs, signals, and markings) for establishing the right of way where necessary.|$|E
25|$|Shared space schemes {{extend this}} {{principle}} further {{by removing the}} reliance on lane markings altogether, and also removing road <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>signals,</b> allowing all road users to use {{any part of the}} road, and giving all road users equal priority and equal responsibility for each other's safety. Experiences where these schemes are in use show that road users, particularly motorists, undirected by signs, kerbs, or road markings, reduce their speed and establish eye contact with other users. Results from the thousands of such implementations worldwide all show casualty reductions and most also show reduced journey times. After the partial conversion of London's Kensington High Street to shared space, accidents decreased by 44% (the London average was 17%).|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{control devices}} are markers, <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> devices used to inform, guide and control traffic, {{including}} pedestrians, motor vehicle drivers and bicyclists. These devices are usually placed adjacent, over or along the highways, roads, traffic facilities {{and other public}} areas that require traffic control.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{argues for}} the {{importance}} of an intersubjective and impure film theory in which the <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> the signaletic is considered as figures for approaching film. This {{in order to make the}} argument that the signaletic mode indeed enables a novel perspective on moving image history. The aesthetics of the signaletic has thus a history preceding that of electronic media, in particular when it comes to animation and experimental film. When constructing such an archaeology, however, dichotomies into <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> should be avoided; otherwise, the complexity of many of the films is reduced. In order to illuminate the latter point, four films by Gunvor Nelson is analyzed (both analog and digital), showing not only how both <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> interact but also how the aesthetics of the <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> the signaletic material is not dependant on the electronic as such...|$|R

25|$|The already-widespread {{use of the}} MUTCD {{stop sign}} became law in the United States in 1966. In 1968, this sign {{was adopted by the}} Vienna Convention on Road <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Signals</b> as part of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's effort to {{standardize}} road travel across borders. The Convention specifies that 'stop' be written in English or the national language and allows an alternative circular yellow sign. Many European countries are party to the Convention. English-speaking countries, the exception being India, are not party to the Convention but usually use the red octagonal stop sign per their own standards, like the MUTCD. Even in countries not associated with either standard mentioned above, the red octagonal stop sign is often used. Unique types of stop signs may still be observed in countries like Japan.|$|E

In sign language, information is mainly conveyed through hand gestures (Manual Signs). Non-manual signals, such as facial expressions, head movements, body postures and torso movements, are used to express {{a large part of}} the grammar and some aspects of the syntax of sign language. In this paper we propose a multichannel HMM based system to recognize manual <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> non-manual <b>signals.</b> We choose a single non-manual signal, head movement, to evaluate our framework when recognizing non-manual <b>signals.</b> Manual <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> non-manual <b>signals</b> are processed independently using continuous multidimensional HMMs and a HMM threshold model.

50|$|The first Official Handbook, subtitled A Handbook of Woodcraft, Scouting, and Life-craft was {{published}} from July 1910 until March 1911 and appeared in eight distinct variations. It {{was written by}} Ernest Seton and drew greatly on Baden-Powell's Scouting for Boys, it included information on the organization of Scouting, <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>signaling,</b> <b>and</b> camping, as well as Scouting games and a description of several Scouting honours. Notably, this book did not place emphasis on first aid, knife and axe use, or map and compass work, as later editions would. Because this edition was intended solely as a temporary guide until an authoritative handbook could be made, it {{is now known as}} the 1910 Original Edition Handbook. The cover art was an illustration by Baden-Powell. There were about 28,000 copies printed, not 68,900 as previously thought.|$|R

2500|$|The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Signals</b> {{allows for}} {{two types of}} stop sign, as well as three {{acceptable}} variants. Sign B2a is a red octagon with the inscription [...] "STOP" [...] in white. Sign B2b is a red circle with a red inverted triangle with either a white or yellow background, and the inscription [...] "STOP" [...] in either black or dark blue. The Convention allows for the word [...] "STOP" [...] to be in either English or the national language of the particular country. The finalized version by the United Nations Economic and Social Council's Conference on Road Traffic in 1968 (and in force in 1978) proposed the standard stop sign diameters of 600, 900 or 1200mm.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{countries}} use various methods {{similar to}} the above examples to establish {{the right of way}} at intersections. [...] For example, in most of the United States, the default priority is to yield to traffic from the right, but this is usually overridden by traffic control devices or other rules, like the boulevard rule. This rule holds that traffic entering a major road from a smaller road or alley must yield to the traffic of the busier road, but signs are often still posted. The boulevard rule can be compared with the above concept of a major and minor road, or the priority roads that may be found in countries that are parties to the Vienna Convention on Road <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Signals.</b>|$|E

Funding for DelDOT projects is drawn, in part, from the Delaware Transportation Trust Fund, established in 1987 to help stabilize transportation funding; {{the availability of the}} Trust led to a gradual separation of DelDOT operations from other Delaware state operations. DelDOT manages programs such as a Delaware Adopt-a-Highway program, major road route snow removal, traffic control infrastructure (<b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>signals),</b> toll road management, Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles, the Delaware Transit Corporation (branded as [...] "DART First State", the state government public transportation organization), among others. In 2009, DelDOT maintained 13,507 lane miles of roads, totaling 89 percent of the state's public roadway system; the remaining public road miles are under the supervision of individual municipalities. This far exceeds the United States national average of 20 percent for state department of transportation maintenance responsibility.|$|E
