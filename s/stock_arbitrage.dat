40|$|This note is {{intended}} to stimulate awareness and discussion of social issues in Requirements Engineering. It classifies issues according to what groups are involved, and sketches some issues in each class. 1 Introduction A computer-based system is built for people and by people. It {{is intended}} to serve some human purpose, and it exists in some human context, {{whether it is a}} university information system, jet fighter, heart pacemaker, or <b>stock</b> <b>arbitrage</b> system. The goal of Requirements Engineering is to determine what properties a system should have in order to succeed. Sometimes this is relatively straightforward; but often, it is not. Some of the most vexing difficulties are social, political and/or cultural. Many requirements engineers feel that such issues fall outside the scope of their profession, and instead fall under management, interpersonal skills, or ethical quibbles; some even argue that social issues should be ignored in the requirements process, {{in order to make it}} as c [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{the direction and}} magnitude of the aggregate order-imbalance of the index stocks can explain the arbitrage spread between index futures and the underlying cash index. The data are for the Asian financial crisis period and hence entail wide variations in order imbalance and the index-futures basis. The analysis controls for realistic trading costs and actual dividend payments. The {{results indicate that the}} arbitrage spread is positively related to the aggregate order imbalance in the underlying index stocks; negative order-imbalance has a stronger impact than positive order imbalance. Violations of the upper no-arbitrage bound are related to positive order imbalance and violations of the lower no-arbitrage bound are related to negative order imbalance. Asymmetric response times to negative and positive spreads {{can be attributed to the}} difficulty, cost, and risk of short <b>stock</b> <b>arbitrage</b> when the futures is below its no-arbitrage value. The significant relationship between order imbalance and arbitrage spread confirm that index arbitrageurs are important providers of liquidity in the futures market when the stock market is in disequilibrium. ...|$|E

30|$|Nevertheless, other {{scholars}} have held {{the view that}} Internet big data’s forecasting ability with regard to stock market performance is affected by other factors, including the difficulty of a <b>stock</b> being <b>arbitraged,</b> level of attention on the company concerned, event type, and disclosure environment. Joseph et al. (2011) compiled search data on S&P 500 component stocks and defined search intensity as the indicator for investors’ market sentiments. Search intensity is considered to forecast weekly stock returns and trading volumes steadily. Moreover, the relationship between returns and search volume might {{be affected by the}} difficulty of a <b>stock</b> being <b>arbitraged.</b> For companies that received less attention from the market, Blankespoor et al. (2013) established that the posting of information via Twitter can reduce the degree of information asymmetry. Furthermore, the authors established that a positive correlation exists between the level of information dissemination and stock liquidity. In addition, Sprenger et al. (2014 a) indicated that advanced stock returns for good news are higher than those for bad news and that the impact of news events on stock markets significantly differs for various event types.|$|R

40|$|Hedge {{funds have}} {{the past few}} years become an {{increasingly}} popular investment alternative and in the last decade hedge fund assets managed have quadrupled to USD 2000 billion, a growth rate of around 25 - 30 % per year. One explanation for this substantial increase is that hedge funds' minimum limits on capital invested has declined, which have made ​​them available to retail investors. The recent turmoil in financial markets has also contributed to investors finding their way to hedge funds, whose goal is to generate stable returns regardless of how the market develops. Using Sharpe’s, Treynor’s and Jensen's performance measures, I have investigated whether hedge funds manage to generate higher risk-adjusted returns than traditional managed funds. The data set for the funds’ returns have been collected from Handelsbanken's website and the time period examined is limited to the period 2006 - 02 to 2011 - 02. The results of performance measurements show that hedge funds {{have not been able to}} generate as high risk-adjusted returns as traditionally managed funds.

40|$|We {{examine the}} ability of online ticker {{searches}} (e. g. XOM for Exxon Mobil) to forecast abnormal stock returns and trading volumes. Specifically, we argue that online ticker searches serve as a valid proxy for investor sentiment [...] a set of beliefs about cash flows and investment risks that are not necessarily justified by the facts at hand [...] which is generally associated with less sophisticated, retail investors. Based on prior research on investor sentiment, we expect online search intensity to forecast stock returns and trading volume, and also expect that highly volatile stocks, which {{are more difficult to}} arbitrage, will be more sensitive to search intensity than less volatile stocks. In a sample of S&P 500 firms over the period 2005 - 2008, we find that, over a weekly horizon, online search intensity reliably predicts abnormal stock returns and trading volumes, and that the sensitivity of returns to search intensity is positively related to the difficulty of a <b>stock</b> being <b>arbitraged.</b> More broadly, our study highlights the potential of employing online search data for other forecasting applications.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{convertible bond}} arbitrage on the Canadian {{market for the}} period 1998 to 2004. Convertible bond arbitrage is {{the combination of a}} long position in convertible bonds and a short position in the underlying <b>stocks.</b> Convertible <b>arbitrage</b> {{has been one of the}} most successful strategies of hedge funds. This paper shows that the convertible arbitrage strategy has considerable effects on capital markets. First, there is a downward pressure on cumulative average abnormal returns of the underlying stocks between the announcement and the issuance dates of convertible bonds. Second, short sales of the underlying equity around the issuance dates strongly increase for equity-like convertibles. Third, convertible bonds are underpriced at the issuance dates. All effects are stronger for equity-like than for debt-like convertible bonds. Finally, we find that over a one-year period following the issue, equity-like convertibles earn a return that is more than 23 percentage points higher than the return of debt-like convertibles. In the last years of our sample, convertible arbitrage returns have strongly decreased. This seems to be related to a shift from equity-like to debt-like convertibles by the issuing companies. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1990, the NYSE amended its Rule 80 A to {{restrict}} <b>stock</b> index <b>arbitrage</b> on days of large price movements. We design empirical tests {{to evaluate the}} impact of Rule 80 A on trading costs and intermarket arbitrage. We find that Rule 80 A significantly curtails [...] or “collars” [...] index arbitrage activity. Despite the significant curtailment of index arbitrage activity, the cash and futures markets remain linked. Pricing discrepancies between the markets are simply eliminated less quickly. Our {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that information is conveyed from one market to the other by means other than formal arbitrage. We also find that trading costs in the stock market, as measured by the average bid-ask spread for S&P 500 stocks, do not change following the triggering of Rule 80 A, in spite of the binding constraint on index arbitrage volume.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role that risk and mispricing play in the {{negative}} relation between extreme positive returns and future returns. We document a strong ‘MAX effect’ in Australian equities over 1991 – 2013 that is robust to risk adjustment, controlling for other influential stock characteristics and, importantly, manifests in a partition of the 500 largest stocks. While {{there is no evidence}} that MAX proxies for sensitivity to risk, the findings are highly consistent with a mispricing explanation. Adapting the recent methodological innovation of Stambaugh et al. (2015) to classify stocks by their degree of mispricing, we show that the MAX effect concentrates amongst the most-overpriced stocks but actually reverses amongst the most-underpriced <b>stocks.</b> Consistent with <b>arbitrage</b> asymmetry, the magnitude of the MAX effect amongst overpriced stocks exceeds that amongst underpriced stocks, leading to the overall negative relation that has been well documented...|$|R
40|$|We explore whether {{investor}} sentiment (proxied by the Baker-Wurgler US sentiment index) impacts 38 {{developed and developing}} equity markets, over the period 1977 to 2004. We find that this US sentiment measure has predictive power on returns for various long-short portfolios designed to reflect sentiment prone (difficult to value and difficult to <b>arbitrage)</b> <b>stocks.</b> This is particularly the case for developed markets, and the predictability lasts for at least 2 years. Our analysis indicates that compensation for systematic risk cannot explain sentiment predictability. The US sentiment impact seems further strengthened when local sentiment is high. Interestingly, we also find that greater market integration, richer information, and stronger collectivism, to varying degrees, help strengthen the predictive power of the sentiment index. Finally, the sentiment predictability is mainly prevalent among those portfolios that are highly correlated with US counterparts...|$|R

Existence of these derivatives changes the price process of the underlying. We show that in the presence of such warrants one cannot assume that the <b>stock</b> market is <b>arbitrage</b> free and that the stock is tradeable at every time moment with the same price for buying and selling. This means that the usual methods for deriving fair prices for such warrants cannot be used. We start from a simple model for the firm's value process and discuss some ways to specify a related model for the stock price process in the presence of warrants with threshold conditions. We also discuss how indifference pricing approach can be used for pricing such warrants...|$|R

40|$|Insider trading studies {{related to}} the German market have {{emphasized}} that outside investors may earn excess returns by mimicking the transactions of corporate directors. Such a result, provided that it holds, would constitute a serious violation of the efficient market hypothesis. The results presented in this paper, though, show that this anomaly is mainly caused by a subset of <b>stocks</b> with high <b>arbitrage</b> risk as measured by their idiosyncratic volatility. This restrains arbitrageurs from engaging in otherwise profitable and price-correcting trades. As arbitrage risk is positively related to a stock’s bid/ask-spread, we show that the information conveyed by insider trades cannot be exploited in terms of generating abnormal returns once these transaction costs are taken into account. We conclude that the market’s under-reaction to reported insider trades can mainly {{be explained by the}} cost associated with risky arbitrage. Our findings provide evidence that the German stock market is efficient with respect to insider trades in the sense that prices reflect publicly available information {{to the point where the}} marginal benefit of acting on information exceeds marginal costs...|$|R
40|$|Compared with {{previous}} research, the present work extends existing literature by considering long-run relations among major international stock market indices, under different market conditions, {{and the implications}} of these relations on the implementation of statistical arbitrage strategies. The examined data contain two bust phases interrupted by a mild bullish period. Employing cointegration analysis, reported results initially indicate that changes in market performance affect the stability of long-run relations, therefore suggesting that arbitrageurs should perform rebalancing among the examined indices when a change in a market trend is evident. Furthermore, extreme market performance harms the mean-reverting properties of a potential long-run relation while moderate market performance points to cointegration between a pair of indices. However, the absence of a stationary spread does not suggest the potential of abnormal returns realization, in the short-run, through exploitation of deviations from its mean value. The applicability of our results may be of importance to market participants since the cointegration approach has recently received considerable attention by hedge funds adopting statistical arbitrage strategies.

In this paper, we analyze and compare the arbitrage proportions (through violation of put-call parity) of publicly traded cross-listed Canadian stocks, and those of industry and performance matched US domestically-listed shares. The cross-listed Canadian stocks are listed on both of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and either the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the American <b>Stock</b> Exchange (AMEX). <b>Arbitrage</b> opportunities exist when put-call parity is violated.

40|$|The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) has {{dominated}} finance theory for over thirty years; {{it suggests that}} the market beta alone is sufficient to explain stock returns. However evidence shows that the cross-section of stock returns cannot be described solely by the one-factor CAPM.

The <b>Arbitrage</b> Pricing Theory (APT) has been proposed as the first multifactor successor to the CAPM without being a real success.

Alternative studies come {{as a response to the}} poor performance of the standard CAPM. They argue that investors choose their portfolio by using not only the first two moments but also the skewness and kurtosis.

The selection of the best model is based on the highest coefficient of determination. The kurtosis-FFPM turned out to be the best model. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} issue in applications of multifactor models of asset returns {{is the appropriate}} number of factors. Most extant tests {{for the number of}} factors are valid only for strict factor models, in which diversifiable returns are uncorrelated across assets. In this paper we develop a test statistic to determine the number of factors in an approximate factor model of asset returns, which does not require that diversifiable components of returns be uncorrelated across assets. We find evidence for one to six pervasive factors in the cross-section of New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange <b>stock</b> returns. THE <b>ARBITRAGE</b> PRICING THEORY (APT) of Ross (1976) has generated an in-creased interest in the application of linear factor models in the study of capital asset pricing. The APT has the attractive feature that it makes a minimal number of assumptions {{about the nature of the}} economy (a factor structure for the returns generating process, a large number of assets, and frictionless trading). The costs of these minimalist assumptions include cer-tain ambiguities such as an approximate pricing relation and an unknown number of pervasive factors.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that weather-based {{indicators}} of mood impact perceptions of mispricing and trading decisions of institutional investors.

These findings complement existing studies on how weather impacts stock index returns and identify another channel through which it can manifest. (JEL D 84, G 11, G 12, G 14, G 23) Anumber of recent studies show that weather patterns in major financial centers influence stock index returns and suggest that investor mood influences asset prices. For example, using data from international stock exchanges, Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) show that stock market returns are higher on days {{when the weather is}} sunny, which is presumably when market participants are in a good mood. 1 The findings from this finance literature are consistent with evidence in the psychology literature, in that individuals misattribute mood We thank two anonymous referees, Jawad Addoum, David Hirshleifer (the editor), George Korniotis, and Lisa Kramer for helpful discussions and valuable comments.

40|$|The {{analysis}} undertaken, firstly aims {{to identify}} {{the extent to which}} equities, their indexes and their derivatives priced in accordance with their fair value. Secondly, presuming that the traded values of the instruments do not in all instances equate to the fair value, the research aims to develop an effective means to identify and manage profitable opportunities arising from the mispricing. General concepts relating to profitability, trade identification, risk and continuous improvement of the processes are addressed. This includes recommendations on the management of the risks through a structured reporting process. The research looks at arbitrage trading in the South African market from the perspective of an empirical review into the market's participation in equity and equity derivative arbitrage. In addition to this empirical analysis, a time series analysis into various arbitrage strategies is conducted with the view to determining their relative profitability. The first component of the empirical research focuses on the arbitrage trading strategies adopted by a sample of 80 institutions. Where the institutions trade arbitrage strategies, the research undertook to establish what methods are used to identify, trade and manage the index <b>arbitrage,</b> single <b>stock</b> futures <b>arbitrage,</b> risk arbitrage, statistical arbitrage and volatility arbitrage trading opportunities that present themselves within the South African Market. Information gathered did not only focus on the actual trading strategies but also determined the relative cost structures, profitability and risk management processes that are employed to support these trading initiatives. The time series analysis focused on index futures, single stock futures, risk, dual listed and statistical arbitrage methods, and reflects the results before and after transaction costs. These arbitrage strategies were applied to the ALSI Top 40 index or its associated shares and generally spanned a period of about four years. Finally the research presents an arbitrage business model that is aimed at providing a blue print for arbitrage trading which covers: new arbitrage strategy, implementation, market risk, execution, profit, traders, cost Finally, the research provides a multiple regression method for application in identifying further arbitrage trading opportunities within the South African environment.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that stock market prices tend to move together. However, {{very little is}} known about what factors influence the underlying co-movements between two stock markets. This thesis contributes to the literature by presenting a number of studies exploring different sources of stock market dynamic spillovers. The first part of the thesis presents a theoretical framework to link stock market integration with economic activity. Chapter 2 introduces international equity trading in a stochastic general equilibrium model. We explore the role of international portfolio diversification on transmission of shocks as well as the role of supply shocks in generating international stock returns co-movements. The second part of the thesis empirically investigates stock price co-movements using high frequency data sets. Chapter 3 analyses stock price spillovers between the London and New York equity markets. With multivariate GARCH models for intra-day data, we test the "global factors hypothesis" to assess whether equity market linkages are attributable to reactions of traders to information originating from foreign stock price movements. Chapter 4 explores the role of macroeconomic news as a source of international stock market co-movements using one minute frequency data. We use an unrestricted Vector Autoregressive model with the DAX, the Eurostoxx 50 and the FTSE 100 futures' returns to examine the short-term dynamic spillovers between these markets.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five studies on empirical {{aspects of the}} market microstructure on the Stockholm Stock Exchange (StSE). The first study presents a stock pricing model which talkes trading and non-trading time effects into account. The model provides a framework for an empirical analysis of daily returns as well as trading/non-trading time returns of the OMX-index. The {{results show that the}} process generating the OMX-prices seems to be non-normal, discontinuous and serially correlated. Most noteworthy {{is the fact that the}} behaviour of the Monday returns appear to deviate from other weekday returns. The analysis shows that the OMX-index returns appear to be generated by a more complicated process than is usually assumed in e. g. conventional option pricing theory. In the second study, it is argued that the interplay between stock market participants and trading mechanisms gives rise to friction in the market prices. This makes the observed market prices differ from the intrinsic equilibrium values of the stocks. A model for explaining the process by which prices adjust towards their equilibrium values is presented. Accordingly the presence of friction causes the returns to be more volatile and serially correlated. The theoretical model is used to emphasise the persistence of the friction on an intradaily basis on the StSE. A set of data, comprised of OMX-prices obtained evay 15 th minute during the daily trading session, i used. Daily 24 -hour returns are calculated in different time intervals during the day: open-to-open, intraday-to-intraday and close-to-close. Evidence of different OMX-return generating distributions is found. In particular, the variances of the returns terminating at the beginning of the day are higher compared to the variances of the returns terminating during the middle and towards the end of the day. This implies that there is comparatively more noise in the pricing process just after the opening of the StSE. The third study investigates the profitability and riskiness of <b>stock</b> index <b>arbitrage</b> between the StSE and the OM. Transactions prices of standarised forward contracts, with the OMX-index as the underlying security, and minute-by-minute transactions prices as well as bid-ask quotes of the OMX-index are observed. Several deviations from the cost-of-carry relationship are reported. However, these arbitrage signals do not always give rise to realised profits. Instead, the specific structures of the stock and forward market impose restrictions on index arbitrage The results show that the size of an observed arbitrage signal appears to be a poor predictor of the actual outcome. The restrictions on index arbitrage, especially the settlement risk, are shown to make the strategies risky rather than riskless. The fourth study examines the effects of the extended trading session at the StSE. The variance of OMX-index stock returns is estimated over trading and non-trading time periods, as well as on a 24 -hour basis, before and after this event. The variances of the corresponding OMX-forward returns are also estimated and used as a benchmark. The results show that the ratio of trading/non-trading time return variances has increased. It is argued that this increase is due to the extended trading time period pes se, since the same phenomenon can not be observed at the forward market. Since the development of the overall 24 -hour variance appears to be unaffected by the extension, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that information is the main source behind the variance of stock returns and inconsistent with the idea that noise trading genrates some of the variance. The fifth study investigates the dynamic behaviour of trading and non-trading time conditional variance of the OMX-index stock and forward returns, using a dynamic GARCH specification. The results show that the conditional variance during both trading and non-trading time depend mainly on the return shocks eminating from trading time. Evidence of a leverage effect in the conditional variance is found during both trading and non-trading time. The study also investigate the effects on the GARCH specification of the trading time extension at the StSE. The extension of the trading hours has affected the relative levels of the unconditional index return variances for trading and non-trading time, but not their dynamic GARCH processes...|$|R
40|$|High Frequency Data are data {{characterized}} by an overwhelming number of observations {{in the period of}} reference, often a single day. Typically, these data are synthesized by their average or by the variation of the observed values in terms of the upper and lower values (or suitable quantiles). Usually, this interval or range provides interesting information on the data for the representation of the data variability. Recently, histograms and boxplots have been employed in order to obtain a more informative representation of high frequency data. Anomalies and casual or systematic errors can affect such high frequency data representation and consequent interpretation and use. In order to face such problems assuming the classical decomposition of data as the sum of a model plus an error, we propose to represent intra-period high frequency data by density models such as the beanplots, based on a suitable mixture of distributions. The location, size and shape of such models are summarized in the estimated model coefficients and visualized by means of classical beanplot silhouettes. On this modeling based approach we build a beanplots time series consisting of a vectorial time series whose elements are the estimated coefficients of each bean plot. In this way we can solve the problem of the storage of high frequency data through few coefficients: in fact, only one beanplot and the generating matrix are required. But the main advantage of using this kind of representation and the corresponding visualization is in their capacity to highlight anomalies or anticipate structural pattern changes in a beanplot time series, as well as to provide useful tools for short period forecasting. In this respect, it is fruitful to use multivariate control chart techniques to provide signals of anomalous observations or early warnings for structural changes. At the same time, these models are useful to study the evolution in the mid and long run by considering classical approaches developed for multivariate time series or approaches based on a time series factor analysis for multivariate successions of vectors of coefficients. These modelizations of single or multiple beanplot time series over the chosen period interval are also useful in forecasting problems. In the case of multiple beanplot time series based on different sets of high frequency data observed simultaneously, or of the same set observed in different occasions, cluster analysis methods can be used to search for suitable prototypes in building composite indicators or to discover homogeneous (and contiguous) time segments corresponding to pattern changes.

40|$| {{currency}} crisis outbreaks, {{and risk of}} withdrawal from the EMU. The first paper (Chapter II) contributes to a vast literature on the determinants of exchange rates. An incomplete list of exchange rate determinants analyzed in the literature includes: labor productivity (Chinn, 2000; Cheung et al., 2007); inflation rates (Lothian and Taylor, 1996; Taylor et al., 2001); interest rates (Froot and Thaler, 1990; Chinn, 2006); overvaluation of the domestic currency (Glick and Rose, 1999; Corsetti et al., 2000); or export growth (Williamson, 1994; Isard, 2007). I study {{the impact of these}} macroeconomic fundamentals on ADR investors’ exchange rate expectations for China. China makes a good case to study standard exchange rate theories since the Chinese central bank manages the official yuan/U. S. dollar exchange rate, which therefore reacts much less to changes in macroeconomic fundamentals than is suggested by theory. Using ADR market data, I can test exchange rate theories for the Chinese peg/managed float regime under free market conditions. The second paper (Chapter III) contributes to a literature, which analyzes the determinants of {{currency crisis}} outbreaks (Eichengreen et al., 1995; Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; Karmann et al., 2002). Existing papers employ low-frequent and backward-looking macroeconomic data to forecast currency crises. This dissertation uses ADR market data to derive more accurate and up-to-date currency crisis signals on a daily basis. Moreover, the determinants of currency crisis expectations, such as banking or sovereign debt crisis risk, can be studied using daily market-based risk proxies. The third paper (Chapter IV) contributes to a literature on the sustainability of the EMU. Several papers discuss the possibility of withdrawal from the EMU (Cohen, 1993; Scott, 1998; Buiter, 1999; Eichengreen, 2007). I present empirical evidence that daily ADR market data reflects the risk that vulnerable member countries may leave the EMU and analyzes which determinants drive this withdrawal risk perceived by ADR investors. Second, this dissertation contributes to the literature on the pricing of ADRs. A common finding in the literature is that the outbreak of a currency crisis negatively affects the returns of U. S. dollar-denominated ADRs as the devaluation of the local currency depresses the dollar value of the underlying stock (see, for example, Bailey et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2000; Bin et al., 2004). Several papers find that the introduction of capital controls (typically meant to prevent a currency crisis outbreak) can lead to a permanent violation of the law of one price between ADRs and their underlying <b>stocks</b> since cross-border <b>arbitrage</b> cannot take place (Melvin, 2003; Levy Yeyati et al., 2004, 2009; Auguste et al., 2006). Arquette et al. (2008) and Burdekin and Redfern (2009) find that the price spreads of Chinese cross-listed stocks are significantly driven by market-traded forward exchange rates. This dissertation builds on these findings and uses the relative prices (or returns) of ADRs and their underlying stocks to derive exchange rate expectations. I present empirical evidence that ADR investors’ exchange rate expectations are driven by theory-based determinants of exchange rates, currency crisis outbreaks, or the risk of withdrawal from the EMU. This analysis therefore provides new insights into the price (return) determinants of ADRs. I. 4 Main findings and policy implications The findings of this dissertation may broaden the understanding of exchanger rate expectations. The results of the first paper (Chapter II) suggest that stock market investors form their exchange rate expectations in accordance with standard exchange rate theories. Based on a monthly panel data set comprised of 22 ADR/underlying stock pairs and 52 H-share/underlying stock pairs from December 1998 to February 2009 I find that stock market investors expect more yuan appreciation against the U. S. dollar: if the yuan’s overvaluation decreases (the incentive of competitive devaluation); if the inflation differential vis-à-vis the United States falls (relative purchasing power parity); if the productivity growth in China accelerates relative to the United States (the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson effect); if the Chinese interest rate differential vis-à-vis the United States decreases (uncovered interest rate parity); when Chinese domestic credit relative to GDP decreases (lower risk of a twin banking and currency crisis); or, if Chinese sovereign bond yields fall (lower risk of a twin sovereign debt and currency crisis), ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that the theoretical links between macroeconomic variables and exchange rates in most cases also apply to exchange rate expectations. In this way, the results support the validity of many exchange rate theories and substantiate the rationality of stock market investors’ expectations. This approach (based on stock prices formed under free market conditions) provides an opportunity to test exchange rate theories in managed floating regimes, where the official exchange rate is manipulated by the central bank and does therefore not necessarily respond to changes in macroeconomic fundamentals. Moreover, I use a rolling regressions forecasting framework in order to evaluate the quality of exchange rate expectations. I find that exchange rate expectations drawn from the ADR and H-share market have a better ability to predict changes in the yuan/U. S. dollar exchange rate than the random walk or forward exchange rates, at least at forecast horizons longer than one year. The People’s Bank of China may take advantage of ADR and H-share based exchange rate expectations in order to determine possible misalignments of the yuan/U. S. dollar exchange rate. In this way, the Chinese central bank may improve the timing and intensity of foreign exchange market interventions meant to manipulate the yuan/U. S. dollar exchange rate. The second paper (Chapter III) focuses on the derivation and determination of currency crisis signals formed by ADR market investors. Using daily data on 17 ADR/underlying stock pairs for the capital control episodes in Argentina (2001 - 2002), Malaysia (1998 - 1999), and Venezuela (1994 - 1996 and 2003 - 2007) we find that ADR investors anticipate currency crises or realignments well before they actually occur. Policymakers could use ADR investors’ up-to-date assessment of the peg’s sustainability in order to identify currency crisis risk earlier and to take the necessary steps to realign an (unsustainable) peg rate before a crisis breaks out. In this way, they could prevent the outbreaks of damaging currency crises without holding excess amounts of costly foreign exchange reserves. Using panel regressions we find that ADR investors anticipate a higher currency crisis risk when export commodity prices fall, the currencies of trading partners depreciate, sovereign bonds yield spreads rise, and interest rate spreads increase. These findings suggest that ADR investors’ currency crisis expectations are based on currency crisis theories even on a daily basis underlining the validity of these theories. The third paper (Chapter IV) studies a particular form of currency crisis risk: the risk that vulnerable member countries could leave the EMU. I use a multifactor pricing model to test whether the financial vulnerability measures assumed to reflect the incentives of national governments to withdraw from the EMU (banking crisis risk, sovereign debt crisis risk, and overvaluation of the euro) are priced in ADR returns. Using daily data on 22 ADR/underlying stock pairs of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain in the period January 2007 to March 2009 I find that ADR investors perceive a higher risk of withdrawal (priced in ADR returns) when the risk of banking and sovereign debt crisis and the overvaluation of the euro increase. Policymakers could use ADR market data in order to assess the stability of the EMU. Higher correlations between ADR returns and currency crisis risk factors would suggest a higher risk of withdrawals from the EMU. In such a case, financial vulnerabilities may be addressed within the EMU in order to preserve the integrity of the eurozone. However, time will show how long the policymakers in the EMU will continue with the implementation of even more anti-crisis measures. Growing controversies on the ECB’s sovereign bond purchases and the bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal cast doubt on the sustainability of the EMU in its current form...|$|R
