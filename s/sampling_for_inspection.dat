A computer program is used to simulate the sampling process and provide estimates of the true values of a plan's Operating Characteristic curve, its average sample number, as well as the probability of implementing the truncation and acceptance rule. Results suggest that truncation and rejection of a lot at the natural truncation point will maintain a plan's desired Operating Characteristic curve. The cases examined also suggest that any modification to the natural truncation point truncation and acceptance rule may cause an unacceptable deviation from the desired Operating Characteristic curve. Finally, a linear equation was developed which provides an estimate of the upper limit on the probability of implementing a truncartion and acceptance rule, and that is most cases, this upper limit is less than 0. 15.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis, {{piecewise}} deterministic Markov processes, an analytic approach, is {{on the border between}} analysis and probability theory. Such processes can either be viewed as random perturbations of deterministic dynamical systems in an impulsive fashion, or as a particular kind of stochastic process in continuous time in which parts of the sample trajectories are deterministic. Accordingly, questions concerning theses processes may be approached starting from either side. The approach we used is an analytic one flavoured by probability, as the title says. The topic we study in this thesis is the long [...] term behaviour of a system that results from a particular type of stochastic perturbation of a deterministic dynamical system. As examples of such systems as they appear naturally in the modelling of particular real world phenomena, one can think of harvesting from a growing bacterial colony, and a ma rine [...] ecosystem from which fish are harvested with a net. In experimental set [...] ups where one grows bacteria or fungi like baker's yeast in a fermenter, or plant cells in a cell suspension culture, one regularly draws small <b>samples</b> <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> as part of the experimental protocol.

40|$|Conformity {{assessment}} {{of the distribution of}} the values of a quantity is investigated by using a Bayesian approach. The effect of systematic, non-negligible measurement errors is taken into account. The analysis is general, {{in the sense that the}} probability distribution of the quantity can be of any kind, that is even different from the ubiquitous normal distribution, and the measurement model function, linking the measurand with the observable and non-observable influence quantities, can be non-linear. Further, any joint probability density function can be used to model the available knowledge about the systematic errors. It is demonstrated that the result of the Bayesian analysis here developed reduces to the standard result (obtained through a frequentistic approach) when the systematic measurement errors are negligible.

40|$|There is an {{especially}} strong need in modern large-scale data analysis to prioritize <b>samples</b> <b>for</b> manual <b>inspection.</b> <b>For</b> example, the <b>inspection</b> could target important mislabeled samples or key vulnerabilities exploitable by an adversarial attack. In order to solve the "needle in the haystack" problem of which samples to inspect, we develop a new scalable version of Cook's distance, a classical statistical technique <b>for</b> identifying <b>samples</b> which unusually strongly impact the fit of a regression model (and its downstream predictions). In order to scale this technique up to very large and high-dimensional datasets, we introduce a new algorithm which we call "influence sketching. " Influence sketching embeds random projections within the influence computation; in particular, the influence score is calculated using the randomly projected pseudo-dataset from the post-convergence Generalized Linear Model (GLM). We validate that influence sketching can reliably and successfully discover influential samples by applying the technique to a malware detection dataset of over 2 million executable files, each represented with almost 100, 000 features. For example, we find that randomly deleting approximately 10 % of training samples reduces predictive accuracy only slightly from 99. 47 % to 99. 45 %, whereas deleting {{the same number of}} samples with high influence sketch scores reduces predictive accuracy {{all the way down to}} 90. 24 %.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Every day, about 3, 000 young people become regular smokers. It is estimated that one-third of them will die from smoking-related diseases. If children and adolescents can be prevented from using tobacco products {{they are likely to}} remain tobacco-free {{for the rest of their}} lives. In 1992, Congress enacted legislation, known as the Synar amendment, to reduce the sale and distribution of tobacco products to individuals under the age of 18. States are required to enforce laws that prohibit tobacco sales to minors, conduct random inspections of tobacco retail or distribution outlets to estimate the level of compliance with Synar requirements, and report the results of these efforts to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Synar amendment and regulation are the only federal requirements that seek to prohibit the sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors. GAO found that weaknesses in the states' implementation of Synar and in HHS oversight may be adversely affecting the quality and comparability of state-reported estimates of the percentage of retailers that violate laws prohibiting tobacco sales to minors. First, some states used inaccurate and incomplete lists of over-the-counter and vending machine tobacco outlets from which to select <b>samples</b> <b>for</b> <b>inspection,</b> which affect the estimated statewide violation rate. Second, states allowed the use of minors younger than 16 as inspectors, even though research suggests that using such minors can artificially lower violation rates. Third, HHS approved a few states' reported violation rates even though the rates included inspection results that were invalid because of the ages of the inspectors and the outcomes of the inspections were unknown. Fourth, HHS relied on states to validate their own inspection results with limited verification of the accuracy of state data even though the potential reduction in a state's block grant award for not meeting annual violation-rate goals could be an incentive for states to report artificially low rates. A little more than half the states reported for fiscal year 1999 that they used fines and suspension or revocation of retailers' licenses to penalize violators of youth tobacco access laws as part of their enforcement strategy. States also reported issuing warning letters and citations. HHS requires states to report evidence of actions taken to enforce state laws but does not require the use of penalties as an enforcement tool. Research shows that penalties reduce minors' access to tobacco products. ...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{assurance}} (QA), {{as practiced}} today, was developed {{largely in the}} 20 th century. The basic tools of this approach, which is {{also referred to as}} conventional quality assurance, are in-spection and statistical process control (SPC). Initially, inspection was used to cull nonconforming parts and either rework or scrap such parts. In the 1920 s, Walter Shewhart introduced the con-trol chart concept that lent the quality assurance processes a scientific basis. Following the control chart, Dodge, Romig, and Juran introduced <b>sampling</b> plans <b>for</b> <b>inspection.</b> These were based on statistical foundations. Quality as-surance as practiced today uses sam-pling-based inspection to keep produc-tion processes under statistical control. This was the QA approach that American quality gurus like Deming and Juran preached to the Japanese in the 1950 s. At that time, Japanese prod-ucts did not enjoy the reputation they do today. In fact, to a large extent, “made in Japan ” meant junk. The reali-ties of an island economy and war losses, however, pressured the Japa-nese to seek new and novel ways to boost productivity and quality. There-fore, in spite of the indifferent response that Deming received in the United States, he had a very captivated audi-ence in Japan. The adoption of these quality procedures led to Japan’s emer-gence in the 1970 s as a formidable global competitor. Since then, Japan has been innovat-ing and furthering these fundamental quality assurance concepts. The result has been the development of such con-cepts and methodologies as the Taguch...|$|R

This strategy basically reflects the operating experience because the piping failure frequency {{is based on the}} piping failure database. The new concept of minimum inspection rate was also introduced in this new ISI strategy. As pilot study, the new ISI strategy was applied to the Class 1 piping system such as reactor coolant system and safety injection system of Ulchin Unit 5 which is the 1, 000 MWe Korean Standard PWR. The results from the proposed new strategy were compared to those from the ASME Code Sec. XI. The results show that the new ISI strategy reasonably reflects the operating experience. The results also show that the concept of the minimum inspection rate can compensate the unbalance in the number of inspection points between the very large differences in the piping failure frequency...|$|R
