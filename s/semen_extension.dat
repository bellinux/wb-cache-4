The results of the experiments indicated that fresh semen characteristics were fair good; the volume, consistency, motility, live-dead ratio, concentration (106 /ml), total spermatozoa (109 /ejaculate) and abnormality were 29. 25 ± 9. 33 ml, watery, 7. 00 ± 0. 12, 67. 08 ± 9. 08 %, 77. 89 ± 6. 46 %, 211. 88 ± 21. 15, 6. 28 ± 2. 45 and 27. 26 ± 4. 64 %, respectively. The supplementation of different type and concentration of carbohydrates did not significantly affect the motility and viability. However, the supplementation of 50 mM fructose significantly increased the motility and viability of the sperm compared to the control.

40|$|Cryoprotectant {{is one of}} {{determining}} factors {{for the success of}} stallion semen cryopreservation. Formost mammalian sperm cryopreservation,glycerol has been widely used as the cryoprotectant. Glycerol inhigh concentration is toxic to the sperm but in low concentration it has protective effect on the semen. Theobjectives of this experiment were to find appropiate glycerol concentration by using skim milk extender inorder to maintain motility and viability of spermatozoa of stallion frozen semen. Semen was collectedfrom three sexually mature stallions by using artificial vagina. The semen characteristics and qualitywere examined both macro and microscopically. Prior to <b>extension,</b> <b>semen</b> was centrifugated at 3000 rpmfor 15 minutes. The pellet was re-extended with skim milk extender with glycerol 5 % (G 5) 7. 5 % (G 7. 5), and 10 % (G 10). The extended semen as then packed in mini straw (0. 3 ml), equilibrated at 5 oC for 2 hours,frozen in the liquid N 2 vapor for 15 minutes and then stored in liquid N 2 container until futher evaluation. The frozen semen, was thawed at 37 oC for 30 seconds. The percentages of sperm motility and viabilitywere examihed. The result of this research showed that the sperm motility and viability in G 5 was (23. 8 %; 35. 6 %) significantly hihger (P< 0. 05) as compare a with G 7. 5 (18. 1 %; 28. 6 %) and G 10.

Three extenders were used; sterilized whole cow's milk (UHT Milk), unpasteurized (CW) and pasteurized coconut water (PCW), and diluted to 50, 100, 150, and 200 × 106 spermatozoa/ml. Experiment 1 : 200 ejaculates were extended for liquid storage at 5 ∘C and evaluated every day for 5 days to determine FPM% and its rate of deterioration. Experiment 2 : 150 ejaculates were extended for storage as frozen pellets in liquid nitrogen at − 195 ∘C, thawed at 30 ∘ to 70 ∘C for 20 to 50 seconds after 5 days and evaluated for FPM% and its rate of deterioration. Samples treated with UHT milk and storage at concentrations of 100 × 106 spermatozoa/ml produced the highest means for FPM% and the slowest rates of deterioration during Experiment 1. During Experiment 2 samples thawed at 30 ∘C for 20 seconds exhibited the highest means for FPM% (12. 18 ± 1. 33 %), 85 % rate of deterioration. However, samples were incompletely thawed.

40|$|Presently AI in the koala {{has been}} based on the {{insemination}} of fresh undiluted semen collected with an artificial vagina (1). While this approach has been extremely successful, further refinement and implementation of AI for use with cryopreserved semen will require protocols that incorporate diluted semen collected by EE. Recent studies have shown that koala semen is likely to have an "ovulation factor" such that over-dilution may result in ovulation failure (2). The current study determined whether AI of EEed neat and/or diluted semen was capable of inducing a luteal phase and/or resulted in the production of pouch young. All koalas were inseminated in the breeding season between day 2 and 5 of oestrus and subsequently monitored for evidence of parturition (day 35) and return of oestrus. Successful induction of a luteal phase was based on evidence of an elevated progesterone concentration 28 days after insemination (2). All semen samples were collected by EE and seminal characteristics recorded (3). The diluent used for <b>semen</b> <b>extension</b> was Tris-citrate glucose (TCG) which contained antibiotics but no egg yolk (4). AI was conducted on conscious koalas using a "Cook koala insemination catheter" and a glass rod used to mimic penile thrusting (1). Three insemination treatments were used; (A) 1 mL of undiluted semen (n = 9); (B) 2 mL of 1 : 1 diluted semen (n = 9); and (C) 1 mL of 1 : 1 diluted semen (n = 9). The results of the AI trial are shown in Table 1. This study has shown {{that it is possible to}} use both neat and diluted semen (1 : 1; 1 or 2 mL) to successfully produce koala offspring at conception rates similar to those achieved following natural mating.

40|$|Dilution and {{extension}} of semen longevity {{has been widely}} used in the swine industry to improve reproductive efficiency and genetic progress through artificial insemination. Through the dilution {{and extension}} {{of the life of}} the sperm cell, other organisms such as bacteria are also maintained and can produce a negative impact on sperm cell motility and potential reproductive capacity. Bacterial contamination in porcine semen is a widespread problem in semen collection facilities and routinely testing is essential to determine which organisms are present and the effectiveness of the antimicrobial in the semen diluents (extender). The antibiotics used in porcine semen extenders are generally chosen to be effective against the most common bacterial contaminants, gram-negative bacteria. Two isolates, Achromobacter xylosoxidans (AX) and Ralstonia pickettii (RP), were identified in the water distillation system of a boar stud facility that uses this water to extend the raw semen and found to produce pyometras in sows post-insemination. The effects of these bacteria have not been investigated in porcine semen diluents in long term storage (14 days). The objective of this study was to determine the effects of AX and RP on pH, motility, and progressive motility in culture negative semen samples over a 14 day period in 3 different diluents (BTS: Beltsville Thawing Solution; XC: X-cell; and TXC: Tri-X-cell; IMV USA; Maple Grove, MN, USA) at 16 ??C. Banked isolates of AX and RP were grown on Columbia blood agar for 48 h at 37 ??C. For each isolate, a single colony was selected and transferred to 10 ml of Luria broth and then incubated for 24 h at 37 ??C in 5 % CO 2. The broth cultures were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min. and used to make the final concentrations of approximately 2. 5 x 107 CFUs/ml (AX) and/or 2 x 106 CFUs/ml (RP). There were four treatment groups per extender: AX, RP, AX + RP, and Control (no bacteria added). All samples were incubated at 16 ??C and rotated once daily. Motility and morphology of all samples were viewed using the Computer Automated Semen Analysis Program (SpermVision??, Minitube of America, Verona, WI), and pH were measured daily for each sample. Data from 6 replicates were was analyzed using PROC MIXED (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) with repeated measurements divided into 5 time periods (1 - 2 d; 3 - 5 d; 6 - 8 d; 9 - 11 d; and 12 - 14 d) post-inoculation. Overall, sample pH did not significantly increase over time, but was found to be the highest (p 0. 05) drastically in the semen samples inoculated with RP+AX as compared to AX, RP or Control sample. The motility of the samples remained similar during the first week of incubations, but began dropping during period 4 (9 - 11 days) with the most notable decline during period 5 (12 - 14 days). This study showed that the presence of A. xylosoxidans and R. pickettii in water for <b>semen</b> <b>extension</b> of porcine semen does not detrimentally affect sperm motility or pH of the final solution regardless of choice of semen diluent...|$|E

Report number 64 Preservation of canine <b>semen</b> by <b>extension</b> and chilling {{has provided the}} AI veterinarians {{with an opportunity to}} overcome limitations of both time and space. Several parameters are assessed to predict the fertility of canine spermatozoa for a given sample. Motility is one of them. Spermatozoa stay immotile while preserved in CLONE (Cryogenetic Laboratories of New England, Inc, USA) Chilled Semen Extender whereas they maintain motility over the whole 23 days period of study while preserved in a Tris egg yolk glucose extender at 5 °C. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the immotility induced by the CLONE chilled semen extender prolongs the lifespan of dog spermatozoa stored at 5 °C, compared with a Tris-egg yolk-glucose (TG) extender, which maintains motility. Semen from eleven dogs was pooled, split in four aliquots, centrifuged, and the supernatants removed. The four sperm pellets were mixed with a TG extender; with the CLONE chilled semen (CL) extender; with TG extender mixed with TG but without egg yolk and with less glucose (TG+ATG); or with the CLONE extender mixed with the CLONE activator (CL+ACL) to a final sperm concentration of 200 x 106 spermatozoa / mL. The samples were stored at 5 ºC for 23 days and examined twelve times for sperm motility by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA), as well as for plasma membrane and acrosome integrity, glucose consumption, and DNA fragmentation index (DFI). The experiment was performed in triplicate. The third replicate was examined for presence of bacteria. For the statistical calculations, the 23 experimental days were divided into three periods, the first period comprising days 1 – 8, the second period days 9 – 14, and the third period days 15 – 23. Total motility (TM%) did not differ between extenders in the first period, but was higher in TG and TG+ATG compared with CL+ACL in the second and third periods, and with CL in the third period (P 0. 05). In the third period, however, TG, TG+ATG, and CL maintained acrosome and plasma membrane integrity better than CL+ACL. Glucose consumption was not significantly different between extenders until the third period, when it was higher in CL and CL+ACL than in TG (P= 0. 0055) and TG+ATG (P= 0. 0010). No breakdown of DNA chromatin (P> 0. 05) occurred until day 14. A lower DFI was observed in TG+ATG than in TG and CL in the third period. Microorganisms found were mainly a sparse growth of Escherichia coli (days 1, 8, and 14) and a mixed flora (days 1, 8, 14, and 23), but also included yeast (days 14 and 23) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (day 23). In conclusion, spermatozoa preserved in TG or TG+ATG showed better values for all the different parameters throughout the experiment compared with sperm subjected to CL or CL+ACL. Consequently, the immotility induced by the CLONE chilled semen extender during long-term cold storage at 5 °C did not prolong the lifespan of spermatozoa compared with the lifespan following storage in Tris-egg yolk-glucose. In addition, our results indicate that good quality dog semen may possibly be stored for up to 14 days in TG extender at 5 °C, with retained fertilizing capacity. In vivo studies should,however, be performed to further support this conclusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{overarching}} {{theme of this}} thesis was {{to gain a better}} understanding of male koala reproductive biology that would lead to improved outcomes for the application of artificial insemination (AI) in this species. The primary aims of the thesis were centred around (1) the male 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to the success of AI with respect to any influence of breeding season (Chapters 2 and 3), (2) the ovulation-induction capacity of the semen in regard to the effect of its dilution and preservation (Chapter 4) and (3) the preliminary development of methods for controlling anterior pituitary (AP) function, leading to the control of oestrus and ultimately the timing of insemination (Chapters 4 and 5). Testosterone secretion in mammals typically occurs in random pulses such that a single blood sample provides limited information on reproductive endocrine status. However, it has been shown in several species that an index of the prevailing testosterone biosynthetic capacity of the testes can be obtained by measuring the increase in circulating plasma testosterone after injection of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Hence, studies conducted in Chapter 2 examined fluctuations in testosterone secretion of the koala (n = 6) over a 24 h period and then characterised testosterone secretion after injection of the GnRH agonist buserelin (4 μg mL- 1) or hCG (1000 IU). The latter was used to establish an index of the prevailing testosterone biosynthetic capacity of the koala testis. Individual koalas showed major changes in blood testosterone concentrations over 24 h but there was no apparent diurnal pattern of testosterone secretion (P > 0. 05). Injection of buserelin or hCG resulted in an increase (P < 0. 05) in blood plasma testosterone concentration. Near maximal concentrations of plasma testosterone occurred at around 60 min after injection of exogenous hormone. There was a tendency for plasma testosterone to decline after 90 min with buserelin but concentrations following administration of hCG remained near maximum for 240 min. There were strong positive correlations between the average testosterone concentration for each individual koala over 24 h and the maximum observed testosterone concentration after stimulation with GnRH or hCG (GnRH, r = 0. 772; P = 0. 07 and hCG, r = 1. 0; P < 0. 01). These findings showed that individual male koalas can show large fluctuations in plasma testosterone concentrations over time and that a GnRH agonist and hCG can be used in the koala to obtain an index of the prevailing steroidogenic capacity of the testes. This technique was then used in Chapter 3 as part of larger study to investigate seasonal changes in male koala reproduction in south-east Queensland (SEQ). The effects of breeding season on male koala fertility have not been investigated in detail so that a better understanding of this phenomenon should help to improve the efficacy of the artificial insemination procedure in this species. Seasonal changes in male reproductive function were assessed in a wild free-range population (n = 14; obtained every six weeks from January to November 2005), a deceased wild population (n = 84; obtained monthly from September to August 2005) and a captive population (n = 7; obtained monthly from October 2005 to October 2006) of koalas in SEQ. In addition to improving AI procedures, this study was also used to determine the practicality of using free-range wild male koalas as potential semen donors for genome resource banks. Examination of a range of reproductive variables initially revealed no significant seasonal change in the 3 koala populations; however, when the data were adjusted to account for individual koalas, their size and/or their health status, the majority of reproductive parameters showed evidence of seasonal variation that was supported by statistical modelling. Relationships between variables were based on simple polynomials, up to a cubic for some variables (Chapter 3, Figures 3 – 5 and the corresponding discussion). Total testicular volume changed throughout the year in the wild and captive populations with an increase over spring and summer and a decrease in autumn and winter; no such change was detected in the deceased population. Maximum area of the sternal gland stain occurred in spring in both the deceased and captive populations but in winter for the wild free-range population. Total bulbo-urethral gland volume showed an increase over spring, a decrease over summer and autumn and then an increase towards the end of winter. The steroidogenic capacity of the koala testis (testosterone secretion) in both the wild free-range and captive populations showed a peak during spring and a nadir in autumn. The quality of semen samples collected by electroejaculation (EE) from the wild and captive koala populations showed evidence of being influenced by season. Initial percentage motility of the wild population decreased marginally throughout the study and initial rate of sperm movement was highest in winter. Motility of spermatozoa after thawing from the wild koala population was also highest in winter as was the percentage of cryopreserved spermatozoa with intact plasma membranes collected from the captive population. This study has shown that male koala reproduction in SEQ appears to be seasonal and that it is possible to repeatedly collect semen from free-range koalas as potential genetic donors. Nevertheless, the semen quality of captive and wild caught animals may be susceptible to seasonal change and winter seems to be the optimal season in which to collect such samples. Artificial insemination in the koala using chilled, electroejaculated semen provides for a marked improvement in the reproductive and genetic management of captive koala colonies in Australia and internationally, as well as making available the option of using semen collected from wild populations to expand restricted gene pools. Dilution of koala semen for AI is complicated by this species being an induced ovulator and it is thought that ovulating factors are present in the semen; hence <b>semen</b> <b>extension</b> for preservation purposes might be anticipated to result in a failure to induce ovulation. The first two experiments of Chapter 4 were designed to determine whether AI using undiluted, extended and extended-chilled semen collected by EE was capable of inducing a luteal phase and/or the production of pouch young (PY). In Experiment 1, 1 mL of undiluted EE semen, 2 mL of diluted (1 : 1) semen and 1 mL of diluted (1 : 1) semen resulted in 7 out of 9, 6 out of 9 and 6 out of 9 koalas showing a luteal phase respectively; 4 PY were produced in each treatment. A second AI experiment was conducted in which 2 mL of diluted (1 : 1) semen was administered in 3 groups of 9 koalas. The first group received semen that had been collected and diluted immediately without chilling, the second group was deposited with semen stored chilled for 24 h, while the final group received semen that had been chilled for 72 h. In the first group, 5 females had a luteal phase but none became pregnant. In group 2, 2 of the 5 females that had a luteal phase gave birth, while in group 3, 4 of the 6 females that had a luteal phase produced PY. In addition, Experiment 3 was conducted to determine whether it was possible to produce PY by naturally mating koalas that were in the latter stages of their behavioural oestrus; this information is important to the logistics of transporting koala semen for AI by establishing the maximum time frame in which females might be expected to shed a fertile oocyte. Of the 12 females mated on day 8 of oestrus, 6 gave birth, whereas only 3 of the 10 females naturally mated on day 10 of oestrus produced PY. The majority of females (21 out of 22) in Experiment 3 showed evidence of a luteal phase. Together, these experiments have shown that it is possible to use undiluted, extended or extended-chilled semen to produce koala offspring, up to day 8 of oestrus, at conception rates similar to those achieved following natural mating. These findings represent a significant advancement in the use of reproductive technology in marsupials and provide the basis for the shipment of koala semen over long distances. The PY produced in this study represent the first marsupials born following AI of extended-chilled semen and bring the total number of koalas produced by AI to 31. The final series of experiments conducted in Chapter 5 explored the efficacy of GnRH analogues to control the koala AP as a preliminary investigation for the development of methods of oestrus control. The aim of Chapter 5 was to determine whether analogues of GnRH could be used to both induce an acute testosterone response and suppress anterior pituitary function in male koalas, and induce a luteal phase in female koalas. Experiment 1 characterised the steroidogenic response of male koalas to administration of 30 μg (4. 3 μg kg- 1) natural sequence GnRH. Injection IM of natural sequence GnRH induced the release of LH and testosterone with respective peak concentrations at 30 min (3. 7 ± 1. 9 ng mL- 1) and 2 h (5. 4 ± 0. 5 ng mL- 1). In Experiment 2, a single injection of the GnRH antagonist acyline [100 μg (14. 3 μg kg- 1) or 500 μg (71. 4 μg kg- 1) ] did not influence the testosterone response to subsequent injections of natural sequence GnRH. In Experiment 3, 4 μg (≈ 0. 67 μg kg- 1) of the GnRH agonist buserelin induced a luteal phase in five female koalas based on a LH surge, secretion of progestogen, and a normal length oestrous cycle. The findings have shown (1) natural sequence GnRH can be used to test gonadotroph cell function and determine the testosterone secreting capacity of male koalas, (2) the GnRH antagonist, acyline, at the dose rates used does not suppress the pituitary-testis axis in male koalas, and (3) the GnRH agonist, buserelin, induces a normal luteal phase in female koalas. Overall, this thesis has resulted in an improved understanding of koala reproductive biology as it relates to the further refinement of AI and the contribution of the male. A total of 31 koala PY, 18 conceived during this study, have now been produced following AI, making the koala AI program one of the most successful assisted breeding programs for wildlife species in the world. The findings of this thesis are essential for the next step in the development of this technology, the production of koala pouch following insemination of frozen-thawed spermatozoa and the establishment of a functional genome resource bank for the species...|$|E
