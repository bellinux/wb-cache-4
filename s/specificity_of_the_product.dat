The objective {{is to develop a}} conceptual model that explains the choice of supplier for manufacturing through transaction costs and organizational competences. Following earlier studies, the model proposes competences of the product´s owner influence the vertical scope in a relation moderated by transaction costs. The constructs in the model are: "governance structure", the dependent variable categorized as internal or external supplier, "transaction costs", measured by asset <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> and bargain power of the firm in the manufacturing stage, and "competences on operations”, measured by experience and diversification of the firm. The study presents some methodological implications for applying the model in Brazilian pharmaceutical industry, through searching for secondary data on drugs and firms in a public database of the federal regulatory agency...|$|E
40|$|Due to its {{heterogeneous}} resources, the peculiarity of {{a certain}} Region or Country provides specific attributes to a product (quality), possibly generating competitive advantages. Consequently, the definition of these attributes supposes the existence of coordination between {{a large number of}} agents in which the negotiation of rules and norms define the social construction of competitive advantages. Therefore, the article aims to identify how the coordination of strategic territorial assets established by the Producers Association in the beef cattle production chain in Rio Grande do Sul has contributed for the social construction of competitive advantages. The research comprises a case study, with the application of in-depth interviews with members of the Association. The results point out that a local agro-alimentary system can be considered more or less articulate depending on which quality conventions ? or combination of conventions ? are present throughout the system. These dynamics are linked to the legitimacy of its governance forms, or in other words, the acceptance of the firm?s resource organization models and the coordination of inter-firm resources. The <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> therefore derives from the variety of ways the strategic territorial assets are coordinated. 2011 VII Congreso Internacional de Agronegocios PAA-PENSA.

40|$|We {{established}} a yeast-based method to screen chain-terminating mutations that is readily applicable to any gene of interest. Based on {{the finding that}} 18 - to 24 -base-long homologous sequences are sufficient for gap repair in vivo in yeast, we used a strategy to amplify a test-gene fragment with addition of 24 -bp sequences homologous to both cut-ends of a yeast expression vector, pMT 18. After co-transformation with the amplified fragment and the linearized pMT 18, each yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cell automatically forms a single-copy circular plasmid (because of CEN/ARS), which expresses a test-gene::ADE 2 chimera protein. When the reading frame of the test-gene contains a nonsense or frameshift mutation, truncation of the chimera protein results in lack of ADE 2 activity, leading to formation of a red colony. By using a nested polymerase chain reaction using proofreading Pfu polymerase to ensure <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product,</b> the assay achieved a low background (false positivity). We applied the assay to BRCA 1, APC, hMSH 6, and E-cadherin genes, and successfully detected mutations in mRNA and genomic DNA. Because this method—universal stop codon assay—requires only 4 to 5 days to screen a number of samples for any target gene, it {{may serve as a}} high-throughput screening system of general utility for chain-terminating mutations that are most prevalent in human genetic diseases...|$|E

To test <b>the</b> suitability <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> amoCAB genes for community studies, a strategy involving nested PCR was employed.

50|$|ZSM-5 {{has a high}} silicon to {{aluminum}} ratio. Whenever an Al3+ cation replaces a Si4+ cation, {{an additional}} positive charge is required to keep the material charge-neutral. With proton (H+) as the cation, the material becomes very acidic. Thus the acidity {{is proportional to the}} Al content. The very regular 3-D structure and <b>the</b> acidity <b>of</b> ZSM-5 can be utilized for acid-catalyzed reactions such as hydrocarbon isomerization and <b>the</b> alkylation <b>of</b> hydrocarbons. One such reaction is <b>the</b> isomerization <b>of</b> meta-xylene to para-xylene. Within <b>the</b> pores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ZSM-5 zeolite, para-xylene has a much higher diffusion coefficient than meta-xylene. When the isomerization reaction is allowed to occur within <b>the</b> pores <b>of</b> ZSM-5, para-xylene is able to traverse along <b>the</b> pores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zeolite, diffusing out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catalyst very quickly. This size-selectivity allows the isomerization reaction to occur quickly in high yield.ZSM-5 {{has been used as a}} support material for catalysis. In one such example, copper is deposited on the zeolite and a stream of ethanol is passed through at temperatures of 240 to 320 °C as a vapour stream, which causes the ethanol to oxidize to acetaldehyde; two hydrogens are lost by the ethanol as hydrogen gas. It appears that the specific pore size of ZSM-5 is of benefit to this process, which also functions for other alcohols and oxidations. The copper is occasionally combined with other metals, such as chromium, to fine tune <b>the</b> diversity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>products,</b> as there is likely to be more than one. Acetic acid is an example of one possible byproduct from hot copper oxidation.It is used to convert alcohols directly into gasoline.|$|R

In this study, a SYBR® Green I based real-time reverse transcriptase reaction assay was developed to measure viral RNA in <b>the</b> bursae <b>of</b> SPF chickens infected with IBDV. <b>Specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplified <b>products</b> was confirmed by melting temperature analysis. A linear relationship was observed between <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> input viral RNA and the threshold values for IBDV-specific product over five log 10 dilutions. The viral RNA level following infection with UPM 94 / 273 was significantly higher at day 1 and 2 post-inoculation (p. i.) compared to UPM 97 / 61 infected chickens. However, chickens infected with UPM 97 / 61 had significantly higher numbers of bursal cells undergoing apoptosis compared to UPM 94 / 273 infected chickens. In both groups, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> apoptotic cells and viral RNA levels peak at day 3 p. i. This study indicates that UPM 97 / 61 and UPM 94 / 273 have different efficiency of replication and percentage of apoptotic cells in bursae during <b>the</b> acute phase <b>of</b> IBDV infection...|$|R

40|$|Random {{amplification}} of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) {{was used}} to generate species-specific markers, which were exploited in <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a fast and convenient PCR-based diagnostic assay for <b>the</b> causative agent <b>of</b> fish pasteurellosis or pseudotuberculosis, the bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, formerly known as Pasteurella piscicida. In RAPD genomic fingerprints of this bacterium, two distinctive fragments were observed. These fragments were cloned, sequenced and found to bear no significant homology with known DNA sequences. Two sets of primers were then synthesized to amplify, by PCR, fragments within the sequences between the terminal RAPD primers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fragments. Another primer pair was designed to perform nested PCR internally to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplified fragments. <b>The</b> species <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PCR <b>products</b> was analyzed, by dot blotting and Southern hybridization, with DNA from 13 other bacterial species. Cross-reactivity was obtained only with isolates of P. damselae subsp. damselae (formerly Vibrio damselae) a bacterial species {{with a high degree}} of overall genomic homology with P. d. piscicida. <b>The</b> detection limit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assay was 20 fg of template DNA by PCR and 2 fg by nested PCR. The assay was effective in revealing P. d. piscicida when applied to an aliquot of DNA extracted from 50 -mg samples of kidney, spleen and liver tissues from naturally infected fish.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) released by infected individuals or present in human and hospital wastes can potentially cause contamination problems. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> HIV- 1 was investigated in 16 environmental samples, including raw wastewater, sludge, final effluent, soil, and pond water, collected from different locations.

40|$|Improving {{access to}} food and {{nutrition}} data 2. A language for <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> foods in databases This paper presents a highly flexible and powerful language for <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> foods in food composition and food use databases and for <b>the</b> precise specification <b>of</b> recipes and food standards. The language is the conceptual foundation for a proposed master database of food descriptions which would offer vastly improved capabilities for retrieval and combination of data from food composition and food use databases. The language incorporates principles from classification theory, database theory, and artificial intelligence. It uses the entity-relationship approach to structuring food data {{in a way that}} mirrors <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foods themselves. The entity types and relationship types needed to build food descriptions are detailed in the conceptual schema, and the most important ones are arrayed in a frame to guide indexers and searchers. The data structure uses hierarchical inheritance to avoid redundancy in storage. This paper also discusses food names and codes and their relationship to food description. It defines explicit names or codes that carry their own explanation and brief nonexplicit names or codes that merely refer to an explanation stored in one's memory or a database. In this context the paper discusses levels <b>of</b> <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> food <b>products</b> named, from product type to individual sample analyzed or portion consumed.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether continuous monitoring of SYBR Green I fluorescence provides {{a reliable and}} flexible method of quantitative RT-PCR. Our aims were (i) to test whether SYBR Green I analysis could quantify {{a wide range of}} known VEGF template concentrations, (ii) to apply this method in an experimental model, and (iii) to {{determine whether}} 20 existing primer pairs could be used to quantify their cognate mRNAs. Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a LightCycler rapid thermal cycler (Roche). Retinal VEGF mRNA levels were measured in a murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy during vaso-obliterative and hypoxic phases. Results: This technique was able to detect as few as 10 control template copies, with quantitative data available routinely for 1000 or more copies. <b>The</b> levels <b>of</b> retinal VEGF mRNA expression followed the hypoxia-induced pattern determined previously by conventional methods. All gene-specific primer pairs which amplify a specific product by conventional PCR were successfully converted to SYBR Green analysis, including those for housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), cyclophilin, and acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO (ARP/ 36 B 4) and for 28 S rRNA. In each case melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplification <b>product.</b> Conclusions: <b>The</b> sequence-independent detection <b>of</b> DNA with SYBR Green I means that {{it can be used to}} quantify <b>the</b> amplification <b>of</b> any cDNA using gene-specific primers.

40|$|SET 8 (also {{known as}} PR-SET 7) is a histone H 4 -Lys- 20 -specific methyltransferase that is implicated in cell-cycle-dependent {{transcriptional}} silencing and mitotic regulation in metazoans. Herein we report <b>the</b> crystal structure <b>of</b> human SET 8 (hSET 8) bound to a histone H 4 peptide bearing Lys- 20 and <b>the</b> <b>product</b> cofactor S-adenosylhomocysteine.
