The objective {{of this study was to}} critically assess the accuracy of current monitoring strategies by quantifying the spatial (lateral and longitudinal distance) and temporal (seasonality and tidal state) concentrations of FIOs (Escherichia coli and total coliforms) within a single intertidal commercially harvested <b>shellfish</b> <b>bed.</b> Spatial and temporal FIO dynamics, including the effects of tidal state and seasonality, were quantified in mussel flesh and sediment samples from a single intertidal mussel (Mytilus edulis) bed.

These results have important implications for both public health and the economic prosperity of the shellfish industry, and demonstrate the importance of accommodating both spatial and temporal fluctuations in routine bacteriological monitoring protocols.

40|$|Accidental {{spillage}} {{of chemicals}} {{by the process}} industries can pose both immediate and long-term threats to the natural environment. Long-term damage from frequent, low-level releases is difficult to predict {{and may not be}} evident until the damage is done. This thesis reviews techniques for environmental risk evaluation and proposes a number of improvements. These improvements include: •	Definition of an endpoint in the natural environment around which to evaluate risk; •	Estimation of risk from the cumulative stresses assaulting the endpoint; •	Using a specially established maximum acceptable concentration for the endpoint, •	rather than using an acute toxicity based on a fractional kill; •	(III Using a probabilistic analysis rather than a deterministic analysis, thus avoiding the •	use of an average or a worst-case scenario; •	Including a sensitivity and an uncertainty analysis. Aspects of the improved environmental risk method are demonstrated in a case study. The case study considered in this thesis evaluates the potential long-term effects to an important <b>shellfish</b> <b>bed</b> in a harbour near an oil refinery. Modelling is the analytical tool used. It is a relatively inexpensive method, compared with ongoing field-sampling and laboratory analysis, to identify specific chemicals, industrial operations, and sites which might require further testing and investigation. The case study in this thesis focuses on an estimation of the annual volume of hydrocarbons spilled at the refinery wharf and also on the estimation of BTEX exposure from these spills. A large fraction of automotive petrol is composed of BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylene) and this was selected as the contaminant. Benzene is present in concentrations of order 5 % w/w and the combined mono-aromatics, BTEX, amount to 45 % w/w in New Zealand motor fuel (premium grade, 96 octane). The exposure concentration was estimated from refinery wharf off-loading spills in Whangarei Harbour, New Zealand to a nearby <b>shellfish</b> <b>bed,</b> the Mair Bank, {{at the mouth of the}} tidal estuary. The <b>shellfish</b> <b>bed</b> is not only a fishing resource, but also lends stability to the coastline where the petroleum refinery stands. BTEX is a significant contaminant to evaluate in regard to <b>shellfish</b> <b>bed</b> health because molluscs are generally more sensitive to light fuel or refined oils than crude oils. The probable annual volume of all hydrocarbons spilled, as well as the probable exposure concentration over one operational year from small-scale, oil-spills were estimated from reconstructed historical frequency data and calculations of environmental transport. The frequency of harbour spills over 24 years was used from Northland Regional Council records. Unfortunately, only those spills estimated to be over one cubic meter in size were recorded and spills under one cubic meter were of most concern in this study. Therefore, in order to estimate the total number of spills per year, including those spills under one cubic meter, additional data were required. Detailed spills data collected over five years from marine terminals were obtained from the California State Lands Commission. Using these data, two methods of data reconstruction were used. In general, the shape of the Californian spill-size distribution was maintained, although a frequency proportionality factor was used since spills were more frequent at this refinery wharf. In addition, there were large spills at the refinery wharf (4 in 24 years), so the tail of the distribution needed to be lengthened and thickened. The result was that the mean spill size at the refinery wharf was estimated at 0. 166 and 2. 55 cubic meters for each of the two reconstruction methods. The average number of spills per year in loading and unloading operations predicted by these methods were 112 and 98. The exposure model combined and integrated the contaminant-transport rate processes. The significant rate processes affecting the exposure of BTEX or aromatic fraction of automotive petrol to the shellfish were evaporation, advection-induced dispersion, buoyancy-induced dispersion, and spill break-up or entrainment. Other transport processes were comparatively minor for the time frame of concern. The significant contaminant-transport rate processes were then combined with the dynamics of the natural environment to result in an exposure to the <b>shellfish</b> <b>bed</b> as a function of time. These dynamics included periodic tidal flow, temperature, and wind speed which fluctuated with the time of year. The modelled exposures over time were compared with published sub-lethal, sensitive life-stage and adult lethal marine toxicity criteria. The exposure concentration range of interest in this study was the sub-lethal range which affected reproduction and growth. Not only is the exposure concentration important, but also the frequency of exposure must be considered when evaluating shellfish health. Bivalves, in general, compared to fish and crustacea, have a very low level of activity of enzymes capable of metabolising organic contaminants, such as aromatic hydrocarbons and, once exposed, the time taken to rid tissue of the contaminant is critical. Monte Carlo simulation results of spillage at the refinery wharf showed that depending on the spill-size distribution used, the annual volume may range from 15 to 283 cubic meters. The lower range of this spillage volume compared well, proportionately, with Port Tauranga's published total of annual successful prosecutions for oil spillage. Monte Carlo simulation results of Mair Bank shellfish exposure to BTEX for one year are available for several scenarios of input spill-size distribution and spill frequency. These results indicate sub-lethal exposures greater than 10 pm BTEX at average intervals of 9 to 27 days and average exposure concentrations of 5000 to 19, 500 ppb, respectively. This exposure frequency may not provide enough time between exposures for the shellfish to adequately recover. While a few excursions exceed the adult lethal toxic level, it is difficult to make fatality predictions for tidal creatures which have the ability to close up for long periods of time. What is of concern is that the exposures are closer together than the ability of the creatures to eliminate the toxins from their tissues. The output of the Monte Carlo simulation was sensitive to the input probability distributions, as well as the number of transfer events in a year, and the evaporation rate. Small spills under 1 cubic meter were almost as damaging to the shellfish in terms of sublethal exposure as the large ones, 20 to 70 cubic meters. Because the evaporation rate was significant in this analysis of mono-aromatic compounds, the volatile aromatics in the smaller spills (less than about 0. 060 cubic meters) would often evaporate completely, depending on the spill size and the time it took for the slick to get to the <b>shellfish</b> <b>bed.</b> Therefore, the greater the proportion of spills under 0. 100 cubic meters, the smaller the exposure and the exposure frequency. Because extensive chemical analyses or biological monitoring can be so expensive and because a natural community may appear healthy even when it is sick, the proposed methodology is a comparatively inexpensive way to check the need for further analysis. The results of this analysis are the first step to determine the long-term risk to a nonhuman population. The next step is to refine population and growth models to include the effect of sub-lethal contaminants. Given the presently available distribution of spillage size and frequency, damage to the long-term health and population of this <b>shellfish</b> <b>bed</b> is possible. Further, more detailed analysis and monitoring are recommended...|$|E

The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the spatial distribution and population structure of an exploited <b>shellfish</b> <b>bed</b> of Callista chione at a location of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea and analyse its potential causes. To this end field surveys for the years 2004 and 2010 covering the whole distribution area of the species were performed and all historical data on commercial landings, clam biomass and density, and locations and volume of dredged sand for beach nourishment were compiled. Results showed that the distribution had been hugely reduced, showing a sharp decline in density and biomass and a decrease in the mean population size in 2010. Our results confirm that the species is a slow-growing bivalve that is highly vulnerable to disturbances prolonged in time. Persistent sand dredging operations since 1987 have gradually reduced the distribution area of the smooth clam to the northeastern part of the clam bed. Consequently, fishing activity has concentrated on a smaller area, thus increasing the fishing effort in the northern part. Therefore, the results clearly suggest that the decline of C. chione bed was mainly caused by the interaction of two coastal uses: sand dredging and clam fisheries.

40|$|<b>Shellfish</b> <b>bed</b> {{closures}} {{along the}} North Carolina coast have {{increased over the}} years seemingly concurrent with increases in population (Mallin 2000). More and faster flowing storm water has come to mean more bacteria, and fecal indicator bacterial (FIB) standards for shellfish harvesting are often exceeded when no source of contamination is readily apparent (Kator and Rhodes, 1994). Could management reduce bacterial loads if {{the source of the}} bacteria where known? Several potentially useful methods for differentiating human versus animal pollution sources have emerged including Ribotyping and Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) (US EPA, 2005). Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) studies on bacterial sources have been conducted for streams in NC mountain and Piedmont areas (U. S. EPA, 1991 and 2005) and are likely to be mandated for coastal waters. TMDL analysis estimates allowable pollutant loads and allocates them to known sources so management actions may be taken to restore water to its intended uses (U. S. EPA, 1991 and 2005). This project sought first to quantify and compare fecal contamination levels for three different types of land use on the coast, and second, to apply MAR and ribotyping techniques and assess their effectiveness for indentifying bacterial sources. Third, results from these studies would be applied to one watershed to develop a case study coastal TMDL. All three watershed study areas are within Carteret County, North Carolina.

Ayear later, starting March 2002, an offshore HAB developed from Cabo Corrientes North to Solano Bay. The typical abundance during the blooms reached 7. 5 x 10 (6) cells l- 1 for the 2001 event and 1. 6 x 10 (6) cells l- 1 for the 2002 event.

Values observed during the two events were 24 - 24. 6 °C and 33 - 34 psu; 3 °C below normal and more than 2. 5 psu above average values. These conditions are indicative of local upwelling processes {{at the time of the}} events. On both occasions, cells corresponding to the Alexandrium catenella/fundeyense/tamarense complex represented 99 - 100 % of the biomass. It was difficult to differentiate the cells from A. catenella, but the presence of short chains of only 4 cells (single cells represented most of the biomass) was suggestive of A. tamarense. Shape, dimensions, and detailed structure of the apical pore complex, first apical plate, posterior sulcal plate, and position of the ventral pore on plate 1 ’ of cells were consistent with the description of A. tamarense, which has not been reported in the tropical East Pacific. The Control Center of Pacific Contamination of the Maritime General Direction of the Colombian Navy has been monitoring the area since 1994 without finding this species or HABs. This leads us to consider the two events as caused by recently introduced species, where local upwelling processes favor permanent and cyclic HABs.

We report an illness cluster in the United States in which toxins were confirmed in shellfish from a commercial harvest area, leading to product recall. Ongoing surveillance {{is needed to}} prevent similar illness outbreaks. Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is an acute gastrointestinal illness caused by consumption of bivalve mollusks that have accumulated okadaic acid (OA) or related dinophysistoxins through filter feeding. DSP toxins are produced by several species of marine dinoflagellates from the genera Dinophysis and Prorocentrum (1 – 4). Symptoms of DSP include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, chills, and fever (5). Onset occurs 0. 5 – 4 hours after consumption of contaminated food, and symptoms last up to 72 hours; treatment is supportive. To date, no sequelae have been reported, but speculation has suggested that chronic exposure may increase risk for gastrointestinal cancers (6, 7). The earliest clinical reports of DSP were from the Netherlands in 1961; however, DSP toxins were structurally elucidated> 15 years later in Japan (2, 8, 9).

25|$|This project, {{receiving}} {{attention and}} {{funding from the}} President’s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), is a typical example {{of the types of}} projects Mussel Watch is being used for. Looking at Areas of Concern (AOC) in the US Great Lakes, Mussel Watch has increased sampling sizes and rates as well as updated techniques including doing caged mussel testing when <b>shellfish</b> <b>beds</b> are not available. By looking at both sediment and mussel tissue concentrations researches have been able to better identify remediation efforts at Great Lake AOC. Like many other current Mussel Watch projects, the GLRI is using both historical data from Mussel Watch as well as increasingly more temporally and spatially prioritized data leading to more robust data sets far more applicable to specific AOC.|$|R
