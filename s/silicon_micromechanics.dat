40|$|Abstract|A {{portable}} {{gas chromatograph}} with integrated micromachined ushed injector and thermal mass detector (TCD) has been developed. The silicon/glass injector operates in a xed volume (27 µL) or electronically operated mode. An integrated, pneumatically operated, fast cross-valve is ap-plied in the injector. The TCD detector {{consists of two}} Pt microheaters and thermoresistors packaged in a silicon/glass micromachined chip. The temperature of two capillary molec-ular sieve separation columns is controlled by a thick-lm heater fabricated on polyimide foil. The chromatograph is equipped with two 16 -bits microprocessors communicating with the external portable PC. The instrument may operate in the on-line continuous analysis mode.

40|$|The {{technology}} of <b>silicon</b> <b>micromechanics</b> for the fabrication of sensors and actuators offers the unique possibility of creating microsystems by monolithic integration of such micromachined devices with integrated circuits for signal processing. In this paper {{we will discuss}} {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of such types of smart sensors and actuators. The main technological problems regarding monolithic integation of micromechanical devices in IC processes are shown. Most of them are related to the wet anisotropic selective etching of silicon.

40|$|In the past, {{acceleration}} sensors {{have mostly}} {{been used for}} measurements of earthquakes or in aerospace applications. In recent years they have found new applications {{in the fields of}} machine monitoring and diagnostic. The automobile sector is another new application area for acceleration sensors, e. g. as a colision sensor for airbags or for driving safety control systems. The application of acceleration sensors in heavy and large machines has not been researched yet. <b>Silicon</b> <b>micromechanic</b> delivers decisive advantages. Micromechanic acceleration sensors with on-chip readout circuits can detect small signals and translate them into an interference-proof signal, such as a digital data format. Micromechanical sensors are produced in batch fabrication, with low cost and consistently high performance. In this work a sensor system has been developed that meets the special requirements of heavyload manipulation systems. The geometrical structure of the sensor has been adapted to the acceleration range of large manipulators. In addition, a new almost exclusively digital readout circuit has been developed. This special circuit allows the measurement of high precision accelerations during regular operation, but can also detect very high accelerations (shock), e. g. those generated by the collision of the manipulator with another object. First measurements of the fabricated sensorstructures and the readout circuit demonstrate the performance of the design...|$|R

40|$|Electron beam {{lithography}} {{is limited}} by the extremely low throughput of currently working machines. This paper describes a multiple beam forming unit for a new line printer type lithography system called High Speed, High Resolution Electron Lithography System (HISEL). The simultaneous use of a multiple number of individually controllable electron beams allows an essential reduction of the pattern transfer time. In a first version, a total number of 1024 electron beams is used. The control unit consists of two independent elements: the aperture plate (illuminated by an electron line type source) which forms a line of 1024 square -shaped (10 x 10) mym high 2 electron beams and the deflection plate with a corresponding set of 1024 microcapacitors. The capacitors allow an individual beam deflection, e. g. on-off switching of the beams. The fabrication is based on <b>silicon</b> <b>micromechanics</b> and X-ray lithography...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} is the {{development}} of a manufacturing technology for integrated optical devices with passive alignment fibre coupling. The main task is the monolitic integration of the V-grove alignment structures (<b>Silicon</b> <b>micromechanics)</b> together with the waveguides on a single chip. The project demonstrator is a complete module with a 2 x 2 optical switch. Such type of switches are used for line changing and optical cross-connects in telecommunication systems or cross-bar switches in datacommunication. Results: -Si rib-waveguides with an attenuation of 0, 1 dB/cm are manufactured. - Monolitic 2 x 2 switches with Si rib-waveguides and MMI elements are produced after extensive modelling of various switching concepts by taking into account the manufacturing tolerances of different processes. - Various processes for the manufacturing of on-chip waveguide endfaces with right angle for the alignment free passive fibre coupling were investigated and an optimised sawing technique is selected. - Devices with passive optical fibre coupling were manufactured but the results will not promise a satisfactory yield in a volume production. -Therefore two alternative concepts with passive alignment in the material system PFCB polymer on silicon were developed and tested. The attenuation of the waveguides with 1300 nm and 1550 nm wavelength is in the order of 0, 2 dB/cm. A high quality on-chip fiber coupling with low optical loss is achieved with sawed endfaces. The technique is well suited for volume production because a good reproduction of the results is possible. (orig.)

Industrial aspects and feasibility for the practical sensor design of the introduced concept were considered. As a main result a proof-of-concept was shown by demonstrating the device sensitivity to humidity. A surface plasmon sensor fabricated with a silicon nitride waveguide technology has applications as a chemical and biochemical sensor. A thermally tunable integrated optical ring resonator device was developed to study the optical characteristics of a ring resonator, waveguide quality, and electrical characteristics of thermo-optical control with in situ temperature sensing. The device was based on Si 3 N 4 waveguides. The ring perimeter of the resonator was 6. 76  mm and the free spectral range was 26  GHz. The thermal control was implemented by using poly-silicon resistive heaters integrated {{on top of the}} waveguide layer. The thermal tuning was demonstrated to be a feasible tool for an accurate optical phase control. The measured temperature coefficient of Si 3 N 4 rib waveguide can be applied in the design of future devices based on similar structures. This type of ring resonator structures are suitable for sensing applications, as high refractive index difference enables flexible designs with small radius waveguide bends. New type of integrated optical beam combiner circuits were proposed, designed and fabricated based on a silicon oxynitride waveguide technology, to provide a replacement for optical fiber coupler components in a phased array antenna demonstrator. The insertion loss of the pigtailed devices turned out to be moderately high but the coupling ratio of the 3  dB couplers were better than 47 : 53, and polarization extinction ratio was above 10  dB. Based on the results of the fabricated test devices the specified optical requirements for a practical application were considered achievable with the proposed SiON technology by further reducing the propagation loss of the waveguide and the excess loss of the 3  dB couplers. Lastly, microelectromechanical variable optical attenuators (VOA) based on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology were developed for optical fiber networks. Two novel VOA architectures were proposed and developed. As a result both configurations were shown to have optical performance satisfying the general requirements set by modern fiber optical networks for VOAs. The major achievement was a reflective type VOA device with low insertion loss below 0. 8  dB, ultra-low polarization sensitivity below 0. 1  dB, 30  dB dynamic attenuation range, and with optical repeatability better than 0. 03  dB. reviewe...|$|E
