The SCC operates the bulk system, controls intertie flows, and balances the generation supply to meet the real time demand for electrical energy.

Coordination between the SCC and the regional centres ensures that the electric system can operate reliably while meeting customer demands, facilitating electricity trade, and accommodating maintenance outage requirements. BCTC replaced the current SCC and RCCs with a centralized control centre {{in the fall of}} 2008. The centralization project, known as the System Control Modernization Project (SCMP), consists of a geographically separate backup facility, to streamline control and operating infrastructure, replace obsolete technology, and to resolve seismic risk issues.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explains}} a fast acting Under Frequency Load Shedding and restoration scheme. This load shedding technique has an added advantage of selecting {{the amount of}} load {{which is to be}} dropped at a particular frequency threshold. The amount of load dropping is selected based on the rate of change of the frequency. Automatic restoration of loads is discussed with engaging a command signal from the <b>system</b> <b>control</b> <b>centre.</b> On/Off control of the power factor correction capacitor is also explained based on the magnitude of its terminal voltage. A three phase voltage vector Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is developed in EMTDC/PSCAD environment to measure the frequency of the power system. The PLL is tuned together with a filter to smooth the frequency measurement. This PLL measures the frequency online and based on phase angle deviation. Therefore it has a fast initial response. A load shedding factor is selected based on the rate of change of frequency between the specified thresholds. According to the load shedding factor the amount of load is selected. Load shedding and automatic load restoration operations are triggered accordingly when the frequency passes its relevant thresholds. The proposed distributed load shedding and restoration control technique was tested for IEEE 12 bus system at two different grid substations. The simulation results confirmed the fast, proper and smooth operations of the proposed technique...|$|E

So any whether pattern change in other areas would not be affected to the demand pattern considerably. But night peak this is not true. // By examining the past load curve patterns, it is revealed that the major influencing factors are time of the day, Day No., Month No., Public Holiday status & School day or not others are minor factors. But however temperature & Humidity also contribute to some extent, so these two factors also considered.

However, there are no measures taken as yet to include the influence of weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, sky cover, wind speed, etc. in this forecasting exercise. Ambient temperature and humidity has become dominant parameters for electricity demand {{with the introduction of}} space cooling methods in recent history. The study focuses not only the influence of temperature and humidity to electricity demand of Sri Lanka but also the influence of wind speed and wind direction. Study focused to build up a linear model using hourly historical demand data and meteorological data of four consecutive years using IBM SPSS statistics V 21 software. Meteorological parameters were taken as the independent parameters and hourly demand data was taken as the dependent parameter. Correction factor was needed to include the effect of yearly demand growth, for a better correlation. Every demand data point was corrected based on the average demand growth (yearly) and time of day. Weekdays were taken as one set and Saturday and Sunday were taken separately. Model consists of 72 independent equations (24 representing a weekday, 24 for Saturday and 24 for Sunday). Correction factors were calculated for calendar holidays which have major influence on electricity demand. Model validation was done for historical weather data as well as forecasted weather data. Predicting average absolute error was under 9 % decreasing more with the prediction date close to the real date. Model is recommended to be used for short term demand forecasting and power plant dispatching in Sri Lanka...|$|E

It was identified that the incorporation of optical fibers to selected lines linking generation stations and grid substations to <b>System</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> (SCC) can make the backbone optical fiber communication network. // Thirty numbers of transmission lines of total length 562. 1 km can link all important generation stations and grid substations to SCC of CEB and those lines were selected to incorporate optical fibers for stage I communication network of this study. // Optical fibers manufactured to different standards {{are available in the}} market. It was found that the optical fibers manufactured to the standard ITU-T-G. 652 is the best for the stage I communication network. // The replacement of one shielding wire by OPGW is the best method to incorporate optical fibers to CEB transmission lines, out of the different methods used in the world to incorporate optical fibers to overhead lines. It is beneficial for CEB to select a single OPGW type to replace all types of ground shielding wires in transmission lines selected for stage I communication network. OPGW types available in the market with overall diameter 11. 80 mm, ultimate tensile strength 68. 0 KN and tube (to enclose the fibers) made of stainless steel with aluminum clad was selected as the best suited OPGW for this purpose. // Practical problems and cost associated with power outages proved that the live-line stringing is more economical for the lines selected for stagel. Supply and live-line installation cost of OPGW for stage I is 7, 796 USD/km (805, 716 LKR km, as per the present exchange rate) and it is 15. 6 % higher than the supply and dead-line installation cost of the same. Further, {{it was found that the}} addition of one OPGW mentioned above to new 132 kV double circuit Zebra lines is only 3. 2 % of the total construction cost of the line. Therefore, adding one OPGW to all new transmission lines to be constructed in CEB is justifiable. // There is a good opportunity for CEB to enter into a communication business using the extra fibers available with its transmission network which covers all populated areas of the inland. However, it is to be studied in detail before entering to this challenging business...|$|E
