50|$|In 1850, growing {{attendance}} meant another move, to Wellington Buildings, Queen Street. At this time, a 'Preliminary Savings Bank' {{scheme was}} also {{introduced in the}} Institution, linked to the Huddersfield Banking Company, which took almost 7000 deposits during its first year of operation. Based on the Scottish system of encouraging working people to make small, regular <b>saving</b> <b>deposits,</b> it was a forerunner of the Post Office Savings Bank, founded in 1861. In 1854, after Phillips resignation, Frank Curzon took over as Secretary and remained in post until 1883. During his tenure a prize giving and distribution ceremony was introduced to reward attendance and good conduct. He not only oversaw a recruitment drive, but also the move to the first purpose built home of the institution, on Northumberland Street. The institution took possession in 1861, as student numbers passed 800 annually.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to solve the}} problem dealing with a good profitability of bank which occurs when net interest margin (NIM) on bank rises from year to year.

The aim of this study to determine the influence of demand deposits, <b>saving</b> <b>deposits,</b> time deposits, loan received, interbank placement, securities and loans both simultaneously and individually have significant effect on the NIM growth in local government banks. It uses multiple regressions for the analysis. It shows that demand deposits, <b>saving</b> <b>deposits,</b> time deposits, loan received, interbank placement, securities and loans growth simultaneously did not significantly affect the NIM growth in local government banks.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of studies that have {{explained}} why China should transit to a consumption-driven growth model or achieve a more rebalanced growth model. But there are few studies to test the relationship between saving, consumption and economic development in the Chinese economy. Thus, this study conducted two panel data analysis to test the relationship between saving, consumption and economic development in China. Since the area of research by the previous studies focused on urban-rural, provincial level, and national level, regional variations of saving have not been widely researched upon. Therefore, this study would try to reveal the regional saving variations and used the regional’s context to explain the phenomenon. The method of Ordinary least square (OLS) regression has been used for the two regression models and the data is obtained from the CEIC China Premium Database. The time period for the prefecture level panel data analysis is from 2003 to 2013, while the provincial level panel data analysis is from 1989 to 2014. The regression results showed that the real saving deposit in the eastern prefecture level cities are determined by most factors in the regression model. The central prefecture level cities’ real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits</b> are influenced by fewer factors while the western prefecture level cities are affected by the fewest factors in the regression model. There are six main findings for regional variations of saving. First, the higher the cost of living and the price of fixed asset, the lower the real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits.</b> Second, as real average wage increase, real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits</b> would also increase. Third, government social expenditure does not necessarily reduce real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits.</b> Fourth, an increase in population does not automatically increase real saving deposit as real saving deposit depends on the capacity of land. Fifth, urbanization affects regions’ real saving differently as it hinges on regional characteristics and development. Besides, the study found that there exists a positive relationship between China’s saving, consumption and economic development and Keynes’ paradox of thrift is inapplicable in China’s case. Keynes’ paradox of thrift is inapplicable to China as it incorrectly defined saving as hoarding of cash, assumed investments are based on interest rates and failed to incorporate the differences between the West and China. published_or_final_versionChina Development StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in China Development Studie...|$|E

Dollarization of credit and deposit of commercial banks - across all sectors and maturities - has declined, with larger declines for commercial credit and time and <b>saving</b> <b>deposits.</b> The analysis {{presented in this paper}} confirms that de-dollarization has been driven by macroeconomic stability, introduction of prudential policies to better reflect currency risk (such as the management of reserve requirements), and the development of the capital market in soles. Further de-dollarization efforts could focus on these three fronts. Given the now consolidated macroeconomic stability, greater exchange rate flexibility could foster de-dollarization; additional prudential measures could further discourage banks’ lending and funding in foreign currency; while further capital market development in domestic currency would help overall financial de-dollarization.
