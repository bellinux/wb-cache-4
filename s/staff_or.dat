5|$|In 1989, {{the death}} of Emperor Hirohito once again raised moral issues about the {{national}} flag. Conservatives felt that if the flag could be used during the ceremonies without reopening old wounds, they might {{have a chance to}} propose that the Hinomaru become the national flag without being challenged about its meaning. During an official six-day mourning period, flags were flown at half <b>staff</b> <b>or</b> draped in black bunting all across Japan.

5|$|Most {{students}} {{participate in}} the Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP). In 2009, the school held eight AMSP seminars. AMSP is intended to educate students in military arts and science, and focuses on operational art and covers a variety of subjects, including military problem solving; military theory and history, military doctrine, operational planning; battle dynamics, operational theory and practice, contemporary military operations, {{and the application of}} national elements of power. Besides classroom studies and operational exercises, students must complete a research monograph and an oral examination. After graduating, officers serve on a division, corps, or Army Service Component Command <b>staff,</b> <b>or</b> in a functional area assignment.|$|E
5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas. Nichols was seen as too closely identified with the wartime Manhattan Project; he had opinions at variance with the commissioners on whether the Director of Military Applications was a <b>staff</b> <b>or</b> a line position; {{and he had a}} strong disagreement with the commissioners over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find another candidate.|$|E

A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert <b>staff</b> <b>or</b> passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E

5|$|Oh, What a Knight! is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows a young woman, named May Brandon, who dreams a medieval fantasy in which she is wooed, rescued and married by a loyal knight. When she awakes, she dismisses her fiancé and tells him of her dream. He decides to become the knight of her dreams and dresses as one, but the experience is unpleasant and ruins her fantasy. There are no known <b>staff</b> <b>or</b> cast credits for the film, but a surviving film still shows three actors. The film was released on October 18, 1910 and was met with praise by The New York Dramatic Mirror. The film had a wide national release and was also shown in Canada, but is now presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about {{recruiting}} processes for local 610 Offices. In rare instances where such information is available, 610 officers appeared to have been drawn from other party or state agencies (such as the Political and Legislative Committee <b>staff</b> <b>or</b> Public Security Bureaus). Hao Fengjun, a defector and former officer with the 610 Office in Tianjin City, was one such officer. Hao had previously worked for the Public Security Bureau in Tianjin, and was among the officers selected to be seconded to the newly created 610 Office. According to Hao, few officers volunteered for a position in the 610 Office, so selections were made through a random draw. Some 610 Offices conduct their own recruiting efforts to bring in staff with university degrees.|$|E

During this campaign, Alderson was presented with the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society after diving into the Nile to rescue a drowning soldier. For his service in these campaigns, Alderson was promoted to Captain and was stationed at Aldershot with the European Mounted Infantry Depot. The same year he married the daughter of the vicar of Syresham, Northamptonshire, a Miss Alice Mary Sergeant.|$|E

5|$|The {{intervention}} in May 2000 {{was the first}} major deployment of British forces to Sierra Leone during the civil war, but {{was not the first time}} British personnel had served there. In May 1997, a two-man training team from the British Army was sent to train SLA officers but discovered that the SLA's strength was much lower than it had reported. The government was overthrown in a coup before any training could take place. Following the restoration of the elected government by the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in February 1998, HMS Cornwall sailed to Freetown with food and medical supplies. Her crew assisted with infrastructure repairs and her helicopter was used to move people and supplies around Sierra Leone until she left in mid-April. As the security situation in Sierra Leone deteriorated later in the year, the Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted a non-combatant evacuation operation under the codename Operation Spartic over Christmas 1998. Approximately 80 people—predominantly British citizens, many of them <b>staff</b> <b>or</b> dependants from the British High Commission—were evacuated over two days.|$|E
5|$|French women's {{rights advocates}} invited {{international}} feminists {{to participate in}} a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain permission to participate in the official conference. The Inter-Allied Women's Conference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations and commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing specifically with women and children. Though they asked for enfranchisement and full legal protection under the law equal with men, those rights were ignored. Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as <b>staff</b> <b>or</b> delegates in the League of Nations organization. They also won a declaration that member nations should prevent trafficking of women and children and should equally support humane conditions for children, women and men labourers. At the Zürich Peace Conference held between 17-19 May, 1919, the women of the WILPF condemned the terms of the Treaty of Versailles for both is punitive measures, as well as its failure to provide for condemnation of violence and exclusion of women from civil and political participation. Upon reading the Rules of Procedure for the League of Nations, Catherine Marshall, an English suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely undemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1958, Wells was {{appointed}} the first Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC); the professional {{head of the}} Australian Military. The position had previously existed as an extension to {{the responsibilities of the}} senior service chief—either the Chief of Naval Staff, Chief of the General <b>Staff</b> <b>or</b> Chief of the Air Staff—but Wells was the first to occupy the position as a separate post. The chairmanship of COSC was created as part of the Australian government's response to a review of the Defence group of departments conducted by Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead in 1957, which recommended greater centralisation of the armed forces. Although the Chairman was the Government's principal military advisor and reported directly to the Minister for Defence, Wells was not promoted and remained at the same rank as the heads of the Navy, Army and Air Force. He was also hampered by being given only a small staff. The role of the Chairman, COSC was not strengthened until 1965, when Air Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger—who had been appointed to the position in 1961—was promoted to air chief marshal so that he out-ranked the service heads. Wells served in this capacity until his retirement from the Australian military on 22 March 1959.|$|E

Seventy <b>staffs</b> from <b>OR</b> were compared with a matched similar number of ward staffs about their hematologic and hepatic laboratory findings in a historical cohort study. &# 13; Findings. Mean of leukocyte and platelet counts were significantly lower in <b>OR</b> <b>staffs,</b> but in normal range. Mean of monocyte count was significantly higher in <b>OR</b> <b>staffs.</b> No {{significant differences were found}} between two groups for other hepatic and hematologic tests.
