5|$|The study {{undertaken}} by the <b>Space</b> <b>Technology</b> Laboratory suggested {{the use of a}} Thor-Hydra booster, however the more capable and more readily available Atlas-Agena B booster was selected instead.

5|$|Although NASA was {{supporting}} {{his work with}} grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop <b>space</b> <b>technology</b> faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University. SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.|$|E

5|$|NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, {{was built}} as a {{high-resolution}} earth satellite by Surrey <b>Space</b> <b>Technology</b> Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic (very high resolution), 5-metre multispectral (high resolution, NIR red, green and red bands), and 32-metre multispectral (medium resolution, NIR red, green and red bands) antennas, with a ground receiving station in Abuja. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built {{at a cost of}} over £35 million. This satellite was launched into orbit from a military base in China.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union {{launched}} Sputnik 1, {{the first}} artificial satellite. This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating {{a wave of}} anxiety known as the Sputnik crisis. Among his responses, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Space Race. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop <b>space</b> <b>technology.</b> One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was Project Mercury, which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{proposal}} {{had called}} for locating the station in Ny-Ålesund due to its topographical advantage. In January 1964, ESRO started informal discussions with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who stated {{that they had no}} initial objections. By then, supported by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, ESRO instead proposed situating the station at Longyearbyen because it was less remote and would incur lower costs. This was opposed by Norwegian authorities; mining in Ny-Ålesund had ceased after the 1963 Kings Bay Affair and the authorities wanted permanent activity in the town. An official request was made by ESRO in February, and in May, official political support for the project was awarded. The main motivation was to establish a permanent <b>space</b> <b>technology</b> center in Norway that could stimulate further scientific growth.|$|E

40|$|The {{right of}} any State to develop outer <b>space</b> <b>technologies</b> is, in principle, unquestionable. In practice, {{problems}} arise when technology development approaches the very {{fine line between}} civil and military application, largely because most the technologies {{can be used for}} dual military and civil purposes. This dichotomy has raised a series of political, military, and other concerns which affect the transfer of outer <b>space</b> <b>technologies,</b> and particularly between established and emerging space-competent States. Accordingly, several States have sought means to curb the transfer of specific dual-use outer <b>space</b> <b>technologies,</b> particularly launcher technology, while allowing some transfer of these technologies for civil use. This document argues that the interests of both suppliers and recipients States can best be served not through selective control regimes but through joint co-operative measures, because it is {{the most efficient way to}} control civil-use of outer <b>space</b> <b>technologies,</b> while at the same time ensuring their transfers...|$|R
