40|$|The paper reviews four {{approaches}} (substitution (<b>SUB),</b> <b>control</b> function (CF), system reduced form (SRF) {{and artificial}} instrumental regressor (AIR)) dealing with endogenous regressors in censored response models, and compares {{them through a}} simulation. Based on mean-squared-error type criteria, CF and AIR perform better than SUB and SRF; in terms of computation, however, SUB and CF are the easiest, closely followed by SRF. Although CF does well in both accounts, its assumptions are restrictive, and CF provides very different results from the other estimators when a real data set is used. Therefore, although the choice of an estimator among the four should be case-specific, for practitioners, we would recommend SUB. Copyright 2010 The Authors.

40|$|Tissue {{morphogenesis}} {{in plants}} requires communication between cells, a process involving the trafficking of molecules through plasmodesmata (PD). PD conductivity is regulated by endogenous and exogenous signals. However, the underlying signaling mechanisms remain enigmatic. In Arabidopsis, signal transduction {{mediated by the}} receptor-like kinase STRUBBELIG (SUB) contributes to inter-cell layer signaling during tissue morphogenesis. Previous analysis has revealed that SUB acts non-cell-autonomously suggesting that <b>SUB</b> <b>controls</b> tissue morphogenesis by participating in the formation or propagation of a downstream mobile signal. A genetic screen identified QUIRKY (QKY), encoding a predicted membrane-anchored C 2 -domain protein, {{as a component of}} SUB signaling. Here, we provide further insight into the role of QKY in this process. We show that like SUB, QKY exhibits non-cell-autonomy when expressed in a tissue-specific manner and that non-autonomy of QKY extends across several cells. In addition, we report on localization studies indicating that QKY and SUB localize to PD but independently of each other. FRET-FLIM analysis suggests that SUB and QKY are in close contact at PD in vivo. We propose a model where SUB and QKY interact at PD to promote tissue morphogenesis, thereby linking RLK-dependent signal transduction and intercellular communication mediated by PD...|$|R
40|$|When {{we look at}} {{historic}} {{developments in}} logistics organization and control concepts, we can conclude that the past shows an ongoing trend towards a more integral approach to achieve logistical coordination. The decentralized reorder point techniques used in the fifties gradually changed from MRP-I (sixties, seventies) to MRP-II (eighties, nineties). This trend is now extending beyond the walls of an individual factory. Companies {{feel a need to}} cooperate in the areas of logistics structures, forecasting, master scheduling and ordering. When we look to this integration challenge we can conclude that a different approach than used in the past is necessary. Since implementing a centralized control concept across companies is not possible, new developments are required in the area of decentralized control. We foresee that future control systems are able to communicate with supplier and customer control systems. Furthermore, we expect that these developments will also influence the setup of decentralized control systems within the company. Instead of having one control system with a scope that covers the entire production chain within the company, we will see a more modular approach where each <b>sub</b> <b>control</b> system covers only a part of the production system, e. g., a department. The expected benefits of this approach is that such an architecture provides departments with better opportunities to incorporate their specific planning requirements in the control system...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. Power {{fluctuations}} in a microgrid {{are caused by}} disturbances due to the connection and disconnection of Distributed Generators (DG’s), {{as well as the}} irregular input of the sun and wind renewable energy. Renewable penetration such as the sun, wind and tidal energy causes intermittency which directly affects the input and resultant output power of a microgrid. Control systems have to be implemented on three different levels to ensure the stability and reliability of the power supplied to the load. This can be achieved by implementing the following: 1) Primary control with mechanical valves and actuators to translate feedback signals through droop control. 2) Secondary control with power electronics to facilitate maximum power point tracking, phase lock loops and switch mode inverters to manipulate the electrical signals to a desired set points including PID control. 3) Tertiary control with software program management to monitor the power flow as well as to evaluate congregated logic and implement decision making. Energy storage systems like super capacitors can compensate for power imbalance by providing excess stored energy to the microgrid for short periods of time. The added advantage of capacitor banks is that it can facilitate power factor correction where inductive loads like rotating motors form large part of the total load. Battery banks can compensate for energy shortage for longer periods of time. The duration of the compensation can be determined by the size, topology and the type of batteries used. The objectives {{of this study is to}} improve the unstable power output responses of a renewable energy microgrid by designing and analysing control strategies intended at power wavering compensation which also includes energy storage. <b>Sub</b> <b>control</b> systems is created and simulated in Matlab/Simulink for analytical comparative observations.

This phenomena always occur when monsoon season where persistent rain triggered landslide or floods and because of thus all human activities and development also deforestation is affected {{as a result of the}} disaster. Therefore, for safety and maintenance process, it’s important to make sure the stability of the slope area to be monitored. Thus, in order to monitor the movement of slope area, once of the technique are introduced is a Digital Close Range Photogrammetry (CRP) field. The development of photogrammetry nowadays allow to calculate of high accuracy Three-dimensional (3 D) coordinates for points on an around the slope area. A side from others technique that was introduces, the CRP technology become getting popular for monitoring slope instability that can lead the disaster. The privilege of using CRP is that no physical contact with the monitoring objects such as slope area body like in conventional land surveying technique. This thesis describes the effectiveness use a digital CRP in deformation studies on slope area. The proposed technique uses a non-metric camera as a tool for capturing slope area images. Before that the camera has been calibrated using calibration sheet provided by PhotoModeler Scanner (PMS) software. The 3 D model of slope area has been created using Agisoft software and additional analysis for statistical hypothesis test with Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The selected site has been chosen in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) which located at behind the Bioscience and Medical Engineering Faculty building because of there is soil erosion in the area. The Total Station has been used to establish control network points for preliminary results and be continued with Global Positioning Station for the <b>sub</b> <b>control</b> station almost near with slope area. All data processing for CRP image were processed using PMS and Agisoft software. Finally, the 3 D digital modelling is presented and the results shows CRP data could be an effective method to monitor deformation studies and capable to achieve a high accuracy compared to others technique...|$|E
