A new index was developed, based on the deviation of pup mass at age in each year compared to the multiyear mean, that was not dependent on assumptions of linearity. The indices of growth deviates produced a more logical relationship with other indices of pup development and related more appropriately to variations in prey availability. The potential impact of methodological biases on the interpretation of growth rate suggests that comparisons of growth rates should not rely on assumptions regarding the underlying growth pattern. ...|$|E

Microbial communities inhabiting sea ice ecosystems currently contribute 10 - 50 % of the annual primary production of polar seas, supporting overwintering zooplankton <b>species,</b> especially <b>Antarctic</b> <b>krill,</b> and seeding spring phytoplankton blooms. Ocean acidification is occurring in all surface waters but the strongest effects will be experienced in polar ecosystems with significant effects on all trophic levels.

40|$|Ephemeral {{patches of}} {{hydrodynamic}} and chemical sensory cues at fine scales are fundamentally {{important to the}} life success of plankton populations and thus the overall health and vitality of nearshore marine ecosystems. We employed various tools from experimental fluid mechanics to create ecologically-relevant hydrodynamic and chemical conditions in a recirculating flume system for zooplankton behavioral assays. The goal was to quantify and correlate changes in zooplankton behavior with coincident sensory cues. A laminar, planar free jet (the Bickley jet) was used to create finescale, free shear layers with targeted hydrodynamic characteristics as well as finescale, sharp-edged layers of both beneficial and toxic ("red tide") phytoplankton species. Planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) were used to quantify the flow and concentration fields, respectively. Behavioral assays {{with a variety of}} crustacean zooplankton <b>species</b> including <b>Antarctic</b> <b>krill</b> (Euphausia superba), estuarine crab larvae (Panopeus herbstii), and calanoid copepods (Temora longicornis and Acartia tonsa), each unique in its ecology, morphology, and life history, show clear and statistically-significant behavioral responses to relevant hydrodynamic and chemical cues. Estuarine crab larvae optimize short term and long term behavioral needs (foraging and habitat selection) by sensing and exploiting the information contained in multi-directional free shear flows. In the presence of thin layers of toxic algal exudates (Karenia brevis), T. longicornis and A. tonsa exhibit explicit avoidance behaviors through significant increases in swimming speed and overall behavioral variability resulting in a conspicuous hydrodynamic signature in a risk/benefit behavioral response. Finally, <b>Antarctic</b> <b>krill</b> exploit the hydrodynamic cues contained in a free shear layer to modify swimming behaviors and ultimately graze in a thin phytoplankton layer (Tetraselmis spp.). Each species is able to sense and exploit the information contained in coherent hydrodynamic and chemical sensory cues to change swimming kinematics and alter macroscale trajectory characteristics. Quantifying changes in zooplankton behavior in response to ecologically-relevant sensory cues is a crucial step towards modeling (e. g. via biophysically-coupled individual-based ecosystem models) and managing sustainable marine fisheries.

40|$|The polar pelagic {{environment}} {{is characterized by}} the extreme seasonal cycle of its environments such as day length, light intensity, sea ice extent and food availability. Possessing biological timing that guarantees regulation of their physiology and behaviour in response to seasonal cycles of environment is of particular advantage, and not surprisingly, many polar pelagic organisms have evolved endogenous rhythmic physiological and behavioural functions, which are synchronized with these cyclic changes. The polar environment is currently subject to the fastest warming on the planet affecting patterns of the polar marine environment (e. g. sea ice decline) as well as causing changes in water properties such as temperature rise and ocean acidification. In order to predict effects of these changes on ecosystems at species and community levels, it is of paramount importance to understand the basic principles of how the life cycle of key species is synchronized with their seasonal environment. The mechanisms leading to these rhythms, however, are far from clear.

40|$|The diets of six of {{the main}} seabird species (two petrels, two albatrosses, two penguins) {{breeding}} at Bird Island, South Georgia were studied simultaneously during the chick-rearing period in 1986. For five <b>species,</b> <b>Antarctic</b> <b>krill</b> Euphausia superba was the main food (39 – 98 % by mass); grey-headed albatrosses took mainly the ommastrephid squid Martialia hyadesi (71 %) and only 16 % krill. The size of the krill taken was similar between seabird species, although there were small but significant differences between penguins and the other species. Sex and reproductive status of krill, however, was different between all seabird species, reflecting some combination of differences in foraging ranges, selectivity by predators, or differences in escape responses of krill. For the krill-eating species, {{the rest of the}} diet varied substantially between species, comprising Martialia and nototheniid fish (blackbrowed albatross and, along with lanternfish, white-chinned petrel), lanternfish and amphipods (Antarctic prion and macaroni penguin), and icefish (gentoo penguin). Long-term data on breeding success and information on diet in 5 – 10 other years suggest that in 1986 seabird diet and reproductive performance was indicative of a year of good availability of krill around South Georgia. In such circumstances, ecological segregation between krill-eating species appears to be maintained chiefly by differences in foraging range and feeding methods, which are reviewed. This situation is rather different from the few studies of seabird communities elsewhere, where prey type and size are believed to be the main mechanisms of dietary segregatio...|$|E

Our current molecular understanding of biological rhythms and clocks is largely restricted to circadian and seasonal rhythms in land model species such as the fruit fly, the mouse or the thale cress. In marine organisms in general, {{little is known about the}} principles of endogenous clocks and how these clocks interact with environmental cycles.

Our seasonal investigations on krill, both field based and in the laboratory, revealed that important physiological functions such as metabolic activity, feeding and growth, as well as maturity are affected by different light-dark cycles, irrespective of food supply, suggesting that the photoperiod acts as the main Zeitgeber for these annual cycles. In recent investigations we identified an endogenous timing system, which is synchronized by the seasonal cycle of photoperiod, and its link to metabolic key processes. We will further outline the implication of these findings for krill stocks in a changing environment and will present a recently started 5 years project on clocks and rhythms in polar pelagic organisms. ...|$|E

Organochlorine pesticides dominated measured krill contaminant burdens with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) as the single most abundant compound quantified.

40|$|The Southern Ocean {{ecosystem}} {{is characterized}} by extreme seasonal changes in environmental factors such as day length, sea ice extent and food availability. The key <b>species</b> <b>Antarctic</b> <b>krill</b> (Euphausia superba) has evolved metabolic and behavioural seasonal rhythms to cope with these seasonal changes. We investigate the switch between a physiological less active and active period for adult krill, a rhythm {{which seems to be}} controlled by internal biological clocks. These biological clocks can be synchronized by environmental triggers such as day length and food availability. They have evolved for particular environmental regimes to synchronize predictable seasonal environmental changes with important life cycle functions of the species. In a changing environment the time when krill is metabolically active and the time of peak food availability may not overlap if krill's seasonal activity is solely determined by photoperiod (day length). This is especially true for the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean where the spatio-temporal ice cover dynamics are changing substantially with rising average temperatures. We developed an individual-based model for krill to explore the impact of photoperiod and food availability on the growth and demographics of krill. We simulated dynamics of local krill populations (with no movement of krill assumed) along a south-north gradient for different triggers of metabolic activity and different levels of food availability below the ice. We also observed the fate of larval krill which cannot switch to low metabolism and therefore are likely to overwinter under ice. Krill could only occupy {{the southern end of the}} gradient, where algae bloom only lasts for a short time, when alternative food supply under the ice was high and metabolic activity was triggered by photoperiod. The northern distribution was limited by lack of overwintering habitat for krill larvae due to short duration of sea ice cover even for high food content under the ice. The variability of the krill's length-frequency distributions varied for different triggers of metabolic activity, but did not depend on the sea ice extent. Our findings suggest a southward shift of krill populations due to reduction in the spatial sea ice extent, which is consistent with field observations. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the explicit consideration of spatio-temporal sea ice dynamics especially for larval krill together with temporal synchronization through internal clocks, triggered by environmental factors (photoperiod and food) in adult krill for the population modelling of krill...|$|E

The CCAMLR model of fishery management is critically examined in this study in order to determine whether and in what ways it is useful in the living resource management of the Southern Ocean and possibly in other regimes in the world. The question of whether it has been successful or not is a complex one that cannot be answered simply by 'yes' or 'no'. The question is therefore divided into several sub-questions, which are addressed in eight chapters. Legal, political and biological aspects of marine harvesting in the Southern Ocean are identified. Pre-existing international law relating to the Southern Ocean is examined to ascertain attitudes to conservation of species and ecosystems. It is argued that attitudes of the Antarctic Treaty parties towards the conservation of the Antarctic regions and their biota facilitated the development of ecosystem paradigms and enabled them to conclude a convention. The three central chapters of the thesis analyse the implementation of the ecosystem standard. This was a slow and difficult process, beset as it was with lack of information, p olitical dissent between parties within the Antarctic Treaty and pressures from outside. Work was undertaken to enhance the knowledge of Southern Ocean ecosystems to lend validity to advice used in making decisions on harvesting levels. It was difficult to keep pace with concurrent changes in harvesting patterns. Nonetheless, progress made in implementation of ecosystem standards in the Southern Ocean began gradually to influence ocean harvesting regimes elsewhere in the world. It is argued that changes in international law concerning state responsibility on the high seas will be required before ecosystem approaches to living resource management can become fully effective. Several alternative schemas for ocean management combining ecosystem considerations and enforcement methods are therefore proposed. The inseparable dual aims of these will be to ensure a reliable supply of protein for human use while maintaining or restoring as far as possible the integrity of ocean ecosystems...|$|E

The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>krill</b> is a small crustacean that {{is one of the}} most pivotal species in the vulnerable Antarctic ecosystem. Accordingly, it is extremely important that the krill is given adequate legal protection by the international regulatory and management regime. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the world's international legal regime in the context of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>krill.</b> In particular, this thesis examines the adequacy of the current legal regime to provide effective management of <b>krill</b> and other <b>Antarctic.</b> marine <b>species</b> in light of the problem of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in the Southern Ocean. The thesis examines both legal theory and practical management in the specific context of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>krill.</b> The aim of the thesis is to recommend an appropriate regulatory framework for the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>krill</b> in light of the "precautionary approach" to fisheries management, given the krill's importance to the Antarctic ecosystem...|$|R
