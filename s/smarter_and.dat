5|$|In the laboratory, Susan, Russell, wrangler Carter Blake, marine {{biologist}} Janice Higgins, and engineer Tom Scoggins witness the shark smash Jim's stretcher against the laboratory's main window, drowning him and flooding the facility. With few options left, the group {{goes to the}} facility's wet entry, where they plan to take a submersible to escape. Upon being confronted, Susan confesses to the others that she and Jim genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size, as they were not large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; this has the side effect of making them <b>smarter</b> <b>and</b> deadly. When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged. While delivering a monologue emphasizing the need for group unity, Russell is dragged into the submersible pool by the shark and killed.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the growth}} of {{multilingualism}} {{in different parts of}} the world, there are controversies on the positive and negative impacts of bilingualism on the education of children. Studies have brought part of the answer to frequent questions such as: are bilingual children distressed? Does multilingualism make children smarter? Defenders of multilingualism assert that speaking another language contributes to an intelligent and healthy brain whereas opponents of multilingualism vehemently insist that speaking another language does not make children <b>smarter</b> <b>and</b> that on the contrary, it can disturb their learning journey. Researcher Ellen Bialystok examined the effect of multilingualism on Alzheimer's disease and found that it delays its onset by about 4 years. The researcher's study found that those who spoke two or more languages showed symptoms of Alzheimer's disease at a later time than speakers of a single language. Interestingly, the study found that the more languages the multilingual knows, the later the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Multilingualism aids in the building up of cognitive reserves in the brain; these cognitive reserves force the brain to work harder—they, themselves, restructure the brain. Multilingualism leads to greater efficiency of use in the brain, and organizes the brain to be more efficient and conservative in using energy. More research is required to determine whether learning another language later in life has the same protective effects; nonetheless, it is evident from the variety of studies performed on the effects of multilingualism and bilingualism on the brain, that learning and knowing multiple languages sets the stage for a cognitive healthy life.|$|E
500|$|Many critics praised Eklund and his character, {{with one}} calling Milo [...] "spindly, intense, and nicely chilling".

Race Bannon (Jessie's father) age 38, retained his classic, laconic sense of humor and fearless, dependable nature. He retired from government work over ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency. Writers noted that Race was helplessly overprotective of Jessie, and Jonny was [...] "the boy Race never had". Race was also given a western-US accent and a knack for crafting elaborate, colorful similes. Peter Lawrence sculpted Race to be a [...] "cowboy philosopher or philosopher-warrior". Writers tasked Race with physical and self-defense training for the Quest team.|$|E
500|$|She {{appeared}} in The Dark Knight (2008), {{the sequel to}} Batman Begins (2005), in which she replaced Katie Holmes as Assistant District Attorney, Rachel Dawes. Gyllenhaal acknowledged her character was a damsel in distress to an extent, but said director Christopher Nolan sought ways to empower her character, so [...] "Rachel's really clear about what's important to her and unwilling to compromise her morals, which made a nice change" [...] from the many conflicted characters she had previously portrayed. The Dark Knight was a financial and critical success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of US$1billion worldwide, it became the fourth-highest grossing film of all time, and remains Gyllenhaal's most commercially successful picture to date. In a Salon review of the film, Stephanie Zacharek called Gyllenhaal's character [...] "a tough cookie in a Stanwyck-style bias-cut gown" [...] and stated that [...] "the movie feels <b>smarter</b> <b>and</b> more supple when she's on-screen". IGN film critic Todd Gilchrist wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal adds real depth and energy to Rachel Dawes".|$|E
500|$|While La jolie fille was in rehearsal, Bizet {{worked with}} three other composers, each of whom contributed a single act to a four-act {{operetta}} Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre. When the work was performed at the Théâtre de l'Athénée on 13 December 1867, {{it was a great}} success, and the Revue et Gazette Musicale's critic lavished particular praise on Bizet's act: [...] "Nothing could be more stylish, <b>smarter</b> <b>and,</b> at the same time, more distinguished". Bizet also found time to finish his long-gestating Roma symphony and wrote numerous keyboard works and songs. Nevertheless, this period of Bizet's life was marked by significant disappointments. At least two projected operas were abandoned with little or no work done. Several competition entries, including a cantata and a hymn composed for the Paris Exhibition of 1867, were unsuccessful. La Coupe du Roi de Thulé, his entry for an opera competition, was not placed in the first five; from the fragments of this score that survive, analysts have discerned pre-echoes of Carmen. On 28 February 1869, the Roma symphony was performed at the Cirque Napoléon, under Jules Pasdeloup. Afterwards, Bizet informed Galabert that on the basis of proportionate applause, hisses, and catcalls, the work was a success.|$|E

Despite leading the game with 90 minutes played, Benfica allowed the {{visitors}} to score two goals in extra time to draw the match 3–3. Camacho took responsibility for the goals in extra-time, admitting the team needed to be <b>smarter</b> <b>and</b> waste time. The next match was the Clássico away on the 21st; Porto had a five-point lead in the league table, although Benfica had played one less game. Porto won 2–0. Camacho complained of bad luck: [...] "What happened was that one team entered the game to dominate, achieved some control, {{but it was the}} other team who scored. What matters in football is goals, and Porto scored, while we did not." [...] Three days later, Benfica started their UEFA Cup campaign against La Louvière, a Belgian team that António Simões described as [...] "easy". The game ended in a 1–1 draw, with Camacho dismissing the idea that it was a bad result, saying that an away draw in a European competition was still a satisfying outcome. On the 28th, Benfica closed the month with a home win against Nacional, with Tiago scoring the only goal. Despite the fans whistling the team, Camacho was pleased with the performance, noting the opportunities the team had to double the lead.|$|E

[...] Treadway said the show is [...] "accessible to all" [...] that [...] "adults will enjoy the witty satire and sly in-jokes subtly inserted into every episode." [...] He also mentioned that [...] "children will love the bright colors, spunky pace, and lively characters" [...] and that [...] "parents will {{not have to worry about}} violence or crude humor." [...] Jason Bovberg of DVD Talk called SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "the coolest Saturday morning cartoon since the heyday of Warner Bros."

500|$|Some of the show's {{plots and}} ideas {{are drawn from}} the lives of both creators' daughters; the {{decision}} to have Ron eventually join his school's football team was inspired by Schooley's daughter being involved in her high school band, which resulted in them attending several school football matches. Citing Ron as his favorite character, McCorkle admitted that he reminds him {{of his high school}} self. Although not as strong an action hero as Kim, {{at the same time the}} creators were careful to highlight Ron's courage and attributes by emphasizing the fact that he constantly finds himself in dangerous situations. By the fourth and final season, the writers had taken into consideration male fans' requests to see Ron succeed more often than he had in earlier seasons, developing him into a more confident character as he gradually [...] "come into his own" [...] and becomes more of a partner than a sidekick. Drakken and Shego's relationship [...] "weirdly" [...] mirrors Kim and Ron's to some extent, with the female character remaining <b>smarter</b> <b>and</b> more competent than her fumbling male teammate. Initially envisioned as a [...] "standard sidekick", Sullivan's sarcastic interpretation of Shego ultimately inspired Schooley and McCorkle to expand upon the humor revolving around the fact that Shego is barely able to tolerate Drakken. The creators had always intended for Kim and Ron to eventually become romantically involved but avoided this storyline in fear of [...] "paint ourselves in a corner", citing Sam and Diane's ill-fated relationship in the sitcom Cheers as an example. Throughout the first three seasons, the idea of Ron having feelings for Kim is alluded to, but he never pursues them for various reasons. Production on new episodes of Kim Possible had virtually ceased by the end of Season 3 when Kim and Ron finally become a couple, which McCorkle felt had ended the series perfectly in the film , thus initially eliminating any need to determine how they were to proceed with them as a new couple. However, when the series was surprisingly renewed for a fourth season, Schooley and McCorkle were forced to confronted the challenge of writing for Kim and Ron as a couple for the first time but eventually grew to appreciate their [...] "new dynamic", which provided the show with [...] "new life" [...] while allowing the writers to explore previously uncharted comedic territory. In fact, fans' interest in the new power couple's relationship was one of the main reasons the show was renewed. Schooley and McCorkle returned from other projects they had begun working on to complete the series.|$|E
