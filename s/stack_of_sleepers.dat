60|$|The train {{came to a}} stand-still at a siding a short {{distance}} outside the station, which was crowded by {{a long line of}} waggons with stores of all kinds. A number of sailors were unloading shells for their guns, and a crowd of Kaffirs, under the orders of military officers, were getting out the stores. As they alighted, after hearty thanks to the officer whose kindness had been the means of their getting forward so promptly, and who now went to report his arrival to Captain Jones, who was superintending the operations of the sailors, Chris and his party hurried to the rear waggon. It was a work of considerable difficulty to get the horses out, and could not have been accomplished had there not been a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleepers</b> near the spot. A number of these were carried and piled so as to make a sloping gangway, by which the horses were brought down. The sleepers being returned to their places, Chris and his friends mounted and rode to the camp, which was placed behind a long, low ridge which screened it from the sight of the enemy on the opposite hills, although within easy range of their heavy guns.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of the 23 December 1901 a motor on a train pulling into the station fused, causing large amounts of sparking, which ignited a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> wooden <b>sleepers</b> by the railside. The {{resulting}} fire spread to the train carriages and station and resulted in the deaths of six people; the train's guard and driver, the station foreman, a carriage cleaner, and two passengers. The general manager of the railway stated that the fusing would [...] "scarcely have caused £5 worth of damage" [...] if not for the wind which was blowing into the tunnel and fanning the flames. The station was closed for more than a year.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBallasted track {{sleepers}} have the important function of providing sufficient lateral resistance {{to prevent the}} lateral movement of rails. If the lateral force induced by the thermal expansion of steel rails overcomes the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers,</b> rail buckling may occur. More {{attention has been paid}} to this problem of lateral stability since the introduction of continuous welded rails. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the prediction of the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers.</b> In view <b>of</b> the foregoing, a series of laboratory tests was conducted on 1 / 5 -scale models to evaluate the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers.</b> Single-sleeper pullout tests and track panel pullout tests were conducted on different types <b>of</b> concrete <b>sleepers.</b> The results <b>of</b> the pullout tests revealed the effects <b>of</b> the <b>sleeper</b> shape, the sleeper spacing, and the number <b>of</b> <b>sleepers</b> on the lateral resistance. Based on the model test results, a new numerical method for evaluating the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers</b> is proposed...|$|R

In {{order to improve}} the prediction accuracy of the ballast settlements in the ballasted track, a series of cyclic loading tests were performed to be focused attention {{on the condition of}} minimum load and the shape <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> in the various design condition. It was found that the settlement of railway ballast increased to be supported at the central part <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> for the ballasted track on the standard rigid roadbed when the small void became to be grown between the bottom surface <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> and upper surface of railway ballast around the end <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> by the cyclic loading...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> size on cyclic deformation properties of railway ballast under the cyclic loading. Two-dimensional FE linear elastic {{analyses were performed}} in order to investigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> size on the stress distribution in the ballasted track. Based {{on the results of}} FE analyses, a series of full-scale cyclic loading tests were performed by using various <b>sleepers</b> <b>of</b> different lengths and heights. It is found that the track settlement in the state where a clearance gap exists between sleeper and ballast can be estimated by amount of displacement amplitude up to a full contact and a maximum displacement rate <b>of</b> <b>sleeper...</b>|$|R
