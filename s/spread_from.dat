5|$|On 7 March 1949, a fire <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> {{the library}} roof; over 300 printed {{books and the}} manuscripts on {{exhibition}} were completely destroyed, and over 3,000 books needed repair, though the main structure suffered little damage and restoration took less than a year.|$|E

5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{outbreak of}} colony losses <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> the Isle of Wight {{to the rest}} of the UK in 1906. These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, but at the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was similarly mysterious and unknown.|$|E
5|$|Before the storm's arrival, {{residents}} of Grand Isle, Louisiana, were evacuated. As a weak tropical storm, damages from Hermine were light. Rainfall <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> Louisiana through Georgia, causing isolated flash flooding. In some areas, the storm tide prolonged the coastal flooding from a tropical cyclone. Gusty winds were reported. Associated tornadoes in Mississippi damaged mobile homes and vehicles, and inflicted one injury. While Hermine {{was not of}} itself a particularly damaging storm, its effects combined {{with those of other}} tropical cyclones, and resulted in agricultural damage.|$|E

5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{existed in}} China from about 1st century AD {{and in the}} West from the High Middle Ages. They <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air (hot blast), patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{have many}} other uses. They {{are used for}} human food and as fodder for animals, usually after burning off their spines. In {{addition}} to their use as psychoactive agents, some cacti are employed in herbal medicine. The practice of using various species of Opuntia in this way has <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> the Americas, where they naturally occur, to other regions where they grow, such as India.|$|E
5|$|During August 2016, it was {{announced}} that 650 soldiers of the British Army would be deployed on an enduring basis in Eastern Europe, mainly in Estonia with some also being deployed to Poland. This British deployment forms part of a four-battle group (four-battalion) deployment by various allies, NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, one each <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> Poland (the Poland-deployed battle group mostly led by the U.S.) to Estonia.|$|E

5|$|HCV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion {{is less than}} one per two million. It may also be <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It {{is one of five}} known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
5|$|Nose {{piercing}} {{also has}} a long history. c. 1500 BCE, the Vedas refer to Lakshmi's nose piercings, but modern practice in India {{is believed to have}} <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> the Middle Eastern nomadic tribes by route of the Mughal emperors in the 16th century. It remains customary for Indian Hindu women of childbearing age to wear a nose stud, usually in the left nostril, due to the nostril's association with the female reproductive organs in Ayurvedic medicine. This piercing is sometimes done the night before the woman marries.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> {{person to person}} through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease {{for up to six}} weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E

5|$|Saffron {{cultivation}} in Europe declined steeply {{following the}} fall of the Roman Empire. For several centuries thereafter, saffron cultivation was rare or non-existent throughout Europe. This was reversed when Moorish civilisation <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> North Africa to settle the Iberian peninsula as well as parts of France and southern Italy. One theory states that Moors reintroduced saffron corms to the region around Poitiers after they lost the Battle of Tours to Charles Martel in AD 732. Two centuries after their conquest of Spain, Moors planted saffron throughout the southern provinces of Andalucia, Castile, La Mancha, and Valencia.|$|E
5|$|The Mongalla region {{suffered}} {{an outbreak of}} cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) between 1918 and 1924, apparently introduced by Ugandan porters who had served in German East Africa during World War I. CSM caused high mortality for a six-year period as it <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> one family to another. A less devastating CSM epidemic started in 1926, causing 335 deaths in 1928, 446 in 1929 and 335 {{in the first three}} months of 1930 before rapidly dying out.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss peasant war of 1653 was {{a popular}} revolt in the Old Swiss Confederacy {{at the time of}} the Ancien Régime.
