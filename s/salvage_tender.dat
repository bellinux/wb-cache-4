5000|$|Glasgow Salvage Corps {{despatched}} {{a vehicle}} to the scene {{as part of the}} initial attendance, and their men began their normal fireground task of attempting to protect stock from fire and smoke damage by covering with plastic sheeting. On the [...] "Make Pumps 4" [...] message, a second <b>salvage</b> <b>tender</b> was despatched. Crews using breathing apparatus ("BA"), searching the building for the seat of the fire, found conditions very difficult with thick smoke and the crowded layout of the premises hampering progress.|$|E
50|$|The Glasgow Fire Service was {{initially}} alerted by a 999 call at 7.15pm from the foreman of the Eldorado Ice Cream Company which {{was near the}} whisky bond. He reported smoke coming from a second floor window of the warehouse. In response two pumps from West Station with Sub Officer James Calder in charge was sent, along with a Turntable Ladder from Central Station. Also responding initially was the Fire Boat 'St Mungo' and a <b>Salvage</b> <b>Tender</b> and crew of the Glasgow Salvage Corps.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main unit}} support and {{headquarters}} barge: a towed Repair <b>Salvage</b> <b>Tender</b> --- which housed the Officer in Charge, Assistant Officer in Charge and crew of 34, including divers. Equipped with repair shops and a working {{platform for the}} fabrication of salvage patches, it also provided electrical power to wrecks. It contained the Headquarters Group, including a Naval Engineering Duty Officer (Naval Architect and Salvage Engineer), diving Medical Officer, Supply Officer, and Admin Officer, plus appropriate personnel. According to the Naval Vessel Register (NVR), the former YRST-1 (redesignated [...] "YR 94 FLOATING WORKSHOP") still remains in service: http://www.navsource.org/archives/14/3394.htm ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Salvage</b> <b>tenders</b> {{were not}} front line fire {{fighting}} and rescue vehicles. Their function and equipment was to prevent avoidable damage from fire fighting operations. Most major fires are extinguished using water {{and it is}} this that can result in extensive damage. A modern fire appliance can deliver many tons of water onto a fire in {{a very short period of}} time. Huge savings can be made by expert crews who have been trained in loss prevention measures and can prioritise their actions based on commercial knowledge. It therefore goes without saying that speed is of the essence if unnecessary damage is to be avoided, which was why <b>Salvage</b> <b>Tenders</b> were painted red and used claxons - it is pointless turning up to a fire when all the damage has already occurred.|$|R

50|$|The last {{horse drawn}} <b>salvage</b> <b>tender</b> was {{withdrawn}} in 1923, {{two years after}} the last of the London Fire Brigadeâ€™s horses were retired from service at Kensington fire station. By May 1936 the LSC fleet consisted of seven Leyland 3-tonners that had been in operation since 1923. It also had a 30-cwt and a 5-cwt. van; the larger used for carrying extra waterproof clothes and other gear, whilst the smaller vehicle could be used for taking first-aid gear to smaller outbreaks and thus save the expense of turning out a major tender. One of the LSC tenders, which carried a crew of two, was equipped with a portable pump used for pumping out basements which had been flooded.|$|E
50|$|USS Laysan Island (ARST-1) was a Laysan Island class <b>salvage</b> craft <b>tender</b> of the United States Navy. She was {{converted}} from a Landing Ship, Tank in December 1944 and conducted salvarge operations in Manila Bay. Laysan Island was decommissioned in 1947 and mothballed, struck 1973 and sold for scrap in 1994.|$|R
40|$|Elegant commentary, {{noting that}} the novel touches on "the {{twilight}} territory of the father-figure as lover" and "demanding" companion; that it is autobiographical in complex ways; and that its "most resonating sound is the silence that lies between sentences. " The reviewer "would like to savour again its gracious gratitude and <b>salvaged</b> celebrations, <b>tender</b> is the night that belongs to this novelist. ...|$|R
50|$|Tackle made {{a voyage}} from Algeria to Marseilles in November and spent December 1944 {{shuttling}} between Algerian ports. On 30 January 1945, {{she returned to}} Marseilles. Her designation was changed to ARS(T)-4 (<b>Salvage</b> Craft <b>Tender)</b> on 1 February. The ship steamed to Palermo on the 13th. While she was there, her designation was changed to IX-217 (Miscellaneous Unclassified). She returned to Algeria on 20 March.|$|R
5000|$|The Laysan Island {{class were}} three <b>salvage</b> craft <b>tenders</b> serving with the United States Navy during World War II. They were {{converted}} from LSTs {{in response to}} a Commander Service Forces, Pacific Fleet request that for <b>tenders</b> to support <b>salvage</b> vessels during amphibious operations which would carry pumps, air compressors, repair materials and firefighting equipment. They were also to include extra divers on board and repair facilities for the salvage ships. The ships of the class were built as LSTs and modified to tenders during construction at the Jeffersonville Boat and Machine Company.|$|R
5000|$|The Lapwing-class {{minesweeper}}, {{often called}} the Bird class, was an early [...] "AM-type" [...] oceangoing minesweeper of the United States Navy. Forty-eight ships of the class were commissioned during World War I, and served well into the 1950s. A number were refitted to serve as ocean-going tugs, <b>salvage</b> vessels, seaplane <b>tenders,</b> or submarine rescue ships.|$|R
5000|$|Reacquired {{five years}} later, Naubuc was {{reinstated}} to the Naval Vessel Register 1 June 1967 arid {{scheduled to be}} converted to a <b>Salvage</b> Craft <b>Tender.</b> In March 1968 she was reclassified (ARST-4) and assigned to the 13th Naval District for conversion. In her later years, she was outfitted with four 12-cylinder diesel engines that powered four rotating thrusters mounted on vertical shafts. She was configured as a cable laying and implantment vessel with a cable drum located in the bow along with a cable guide going over the stern. The four thrusters allowed the vessel to stay [...] "on station". When underway, however, only the two bow or stern thrusters were operated at any one time. The vertical thruster shafts increased the vessel's draft significantly. The thrusters were easily damaged by impact with the bottom. The Naubuc's final mission was as a support vessel for a cable underwater recovery vehicle (CURV-2) in the Tongue of the Ocean, off Andros Island.|$|R
