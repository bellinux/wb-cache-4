5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{election}} there were 17 registered parties (a party has to collect signatures from at least 5,000 eligible voters in order to be accepted on the official party register, which is maintained by the Ministry of Justice). Eight of the parties were represented in the current parliament: the Centre Party, National Coalition Party (NCP), Social Democratic Party (SDP), Left Alliance, Green League, Swedish People's Party (SPP), Christian Democrats and True Finns. The MP representing Åland <b>sits</b> <b>with</b> the Swedish People's Party in the parliament.|$|E

A few months later, on Thanksgiving Day, Eva drives by Albert's home and {{stops in front of}} the house on her way to pick up Ellen from the airport. He sees her and she awkwardly waves. He {{eventually}} comes outside, to Eva's surprise, and <b>sits</b> <b>with</b> her on the porch while they begin to renew their relationship.|$|E

50|$|S.53 of the High Court Ordinance {{provides}} that {{a judge in}} the Court of First Instance may <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> one or more assessor who holds special qualifications. It is not normal practice for the court to <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> assessors.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} ways of {{sitting on the}} floor {{involves}} bending the knees. One can also <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> the legs unbent, using something solid as support for the back or leaning on one's arms. <b>Sitting</b> <b>with</b> bent legs can be done with the legs mostly parallel or by crossing them over each other.|$|R
5|$|Other portraits {{include one}} by William Nicholson dating from 1814 in which Bewick <b>sits</b> <b>with</b> a pencil {{in his hand}} and a dog beside his chair; the one at his birthplace; and the {{full-length}} seated portrait of 1827 by Thomas Sword Good (see above). Another painting by Sword in the National Portrait Gallery is now no longer thought to be of Bewick. An unsigned painting supposedly of him in the Yale Center for British Art is equally dubious.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom <b>sits</b> <b>with</b> her legs outstretched together and the bars of the xylophone resting across her legs rather than on a separate resonator box. Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, Natasha blames Andrew for the crash. She learns Ed has a {{fractured}} collarbone and <b>sits</b> <b>with</b> {{him until he}} wakes up. When he does, Natasha kisses him. They begin dating, but Natasha worries {{that they do not}} have much in common. Natasha helps organise a ball for the university and takes an immediate dislike to Ed's vintage suit. She spills coffee on it and then lends Ed a nicer one that she found. Ed realises what she has done and they fight. After apologising to each other, Natasha decides to break up with Ed, as they are too different. When Natasha finds Andrew having a fit in Charlie's, she learns that he has epilepsy. She agrees to keep it a secret. After he collapses, Natasha encourages Andrew to go to the hospital for tests. Before he can leave, he suffers a fit in front of Paul. Andrew initially blames Natasha for causing the fit when Paul takes Charlie's away from him. She then helps him to convince Paul to change his mind. Natasha and Andrew begin dating again in secret. They later decide to tell everyone and Summer reveals that she already knew and does not mind. Natasha later finds an old email from Andrew proclaiming his love for Summer and she begins to worry about her relationship with him. However, Andrew reassures her that he loves her and their relationship is different this time around. Natasha asks Andrew to take a month of celibacy, but they end up breaking it early. Natasha quits university and tells Andrew that she is leaving Erinsborough to travel around Europe. She asks Andrew to come with her and he agrees. They leave the following day with Paul's blessing.|$|E

25|$|De Grønne from Denmark were {{expelled}} from the EGP in 2008.

25|$|In the Azuchi-Momoyama period {{not only}} sukiya style but the {{contrasting}} shoin-zukuri of residences {{of the warrior}} class developed. While sukiya was a small space, simple and austere, shoin-zukuri style was that of large, magnificent reception areas, the setting for the pomp and ceremony of the feudal lords. As an example, in a shoin, the flower arrangement in the tokonoma {{is indicative of the}} relative wealth of the host, the guest however <b>sits</b> <b>with</b> their back to it as it is not meant for their enjoyment. Whereas, in a tearoom, the guest sits facing the tokonoma and enjoys its beauty.|$|E
25|$|When hearing {{civil and}} {{criminal}} matters, the Court of Appeal usually <b>sits</b> <b>with</b> three Judges of Appeal, one of whom may be the Chief Justice. However, the Court may also sit with a greater uneven number of Judges of Appeal. This is done in cases of unusual difficulty or importance. As of December 2010 the Court had sat twice with a bench of five judges. The more recent case was the 1995 decision Public Prosecutor v. Tan Meng Khin, in which the Court overruled its own decision handed down the previous year that had set out a different interpretation of section 40(3) of the Penal Code.|$|E
