5000|$|One reason MELs are {{difficult}} to reduce is because the use of <b>small</b> <b>electric</b> <b>devices</b> are controlled directly by a building’s inhabitants. One way to reduce MELs is {{by the use of}} energy feedback devices which report real-time energy use to a house’s occupants. The use of these devices has been tested in numerous studies which suggest whole-house savings of 5%-15%. [...] With recent advances in technology, energy feedback devices can be purchased for $100-$150. Feedback devices allow people to identify and reduce standby power and as well as cut back on unnecessary power draws. In addition, occupants can see the effects of running pool pumps/heaters, supplemental space heaters, air conditioners, etc.Energy feedback devices can further assist zero energy buildings, where it is desirable to align electric loads with photovoltaic panel output.|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{growth is}} an {{exothermic}} process. Biotechnological industries produce {{large amounts of}} heat, usually considered an undesirable by-product. In this work, we report the construction and characterization of the first microbial thermoelectric cell (MTC), in which the metabolic heat produced by a thermally insulated microbial culture is partially converted into electricity through a thermoelectric device optimized for low DT values. A temperature of 41 uC and net electric voltage of around 250 – 600 mV was achieved with 1. 7 L baker’s yeast culture. This {{is the first time}} microbial metabolic energy has been converted into electricity with an ad hoc thermoelectric device. These results might contribute towards developing a novel strategy to harvest excess heat in the biotechnology industry, in processes such as ethanol fermentation, auto thermal aerobic digestion (ATAD) or bioremediation, which could be coupled with MTCs in a single unit to produce electricity as a valuable by-product of the primary biotechnological product. Additionally, we propose that small portable MTCs could be conceived and inoculated with suitable thermophilic of hyperthermophilic starter cultures and used for powering <b>small</b> <b>electric</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

Therefore, new electrochemical systems with higher energy densities are being sought, and metal-air batteries with conversion chemistry are considered a promising candidate.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a general design tool {{that can be}} used for small and extra <b>small</b> <b>electric</b> and magnetic <b>devices.</b> Such devices generate micro motions. Due to their dimensions and specially due to the short axial length compared to the radial dimensions a three dimensional analysis of the field is required. Complex geometries recommend a well tuned engineering tool to guarantee reliable results. Here, a standard three dimensional finite element approach is chosen to compute the electric and magnetic field quantities respectively. In combination with a user-friendly Computer interface, controlling the necessary finite element procedures, a powerful engineering tool with a general application range is obtained. For that reason it was possible to apply numerical optimization algorithms to realize a fully automated design tool. Various configurations are studied using the same software tools.

40|$|Abstract—Wind {{stations}} of small power (small WPS) {{are intended to}} ensure the operation of a <b>small</b> number of <b>electric</b> <b>devices.</b> Under these conditions, the connection of even a single additional consumer may result in operation disturbances. In [1, 2], a mathematical model of a small WPS operation was proposed, which allowed a qualitative explanation of the energy output hysteresis phenomenon experimentally observed under variation in the external load. In the present paper, {{on the basis of}} this model, we study the problems of existence and stability of steady-state modes and describe their attraction domains. We show that there exist different types of bifurcations of these modes, which result, in particular, in the onset of finite-amplitude periodic motions. For the first time, the performance of a power plant is estimated by the maximal consumption power criterion. The results are compared with the results obtained by other criteria. DOI: 10. 3103 /S 002565440902006 X 1. MECHANICAL AND MATHEMATICAL MODEL We assume that the wind turbine and the electric generator rotor of a small WPS form a rigid body G, which can rotate about a fixed axis in an electromagnetic field created by the generator stator.

It analyses metrological properties of <b>electric</b> measuring <b>devices</b> and sensors of the NI Multisim 10. 1 environment. To calculate the reliable parameters of periodic non-sinusoidal electrical values based on their physical feasibility the mathematical expressions have been defined. To verify the virtual <b>electric</b> <b>devices</b> a circuit model of the power section of buck DC converter with enabled devices under consideration at its input and output {{is used as a}} consumer of pulse current of trapezoidal or triangular form. It is used as an example to show a technique to verify readings of virtual <b>electric</b> measuring <b>devices</b> in the NI Multisim 10. 1 environment. It is found that when simulating the pulsed DC <b>electric</b> <b>devices</b> to measure average and RMS voltage supply and current consumption values it is advisable to use the probe. <b>Electric</b> <b>device</b> power consumption read from the virtual power meter is equal to its average value, and its displayed power factor is inversely proportional to the input current form factor.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveImplantation of a left {{ventricular}} assist device {{as a bridge}} to transplantation has become an acceptable approach for patients with end-stage heart failure. Our long-term results with 3 Thoratec HeartMate devices are presented to outline improvements in successful bridging to transplantation and post-transplant survival. MethodsFrom August 1990 through January 2003, 243 patients underwent implantation of Thoratec HeartMate devices as a bridge to transplantation. This included 52 (21. 4 %) pneumatic devices, 17 (7. 0 %) dual-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices,</b> and 174 (71. 6 %) single-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices.</b> ResultsMean age was 49. 7 ± 13. 7 years. Mean support time was 78. 1 ± 82. 9 days (0 - 541). Bridging success increased from 63. 5 % (n = 33) for pneumatic devices to 64. 7 % (n = 11) for dual-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices</b> and 72. 4 % (n = 126) for single-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices</b> (P =. 005). Posttransplant 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year actuarial survival increased from 87. 5 %, 78. 1 %, and 71. 9 % in patients with pneumatic devices to 91. 5 %, 86. 9 %, and 81. 3 %, respectively, for patients with single-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices.</b> Device infection and malfunction occurred in 17. 7 % (n = 43) and 12. 8 % (n = 31) of patients, respectively. ConclusionsSuccessful bridging to transplantation and posttransplant survival has improved over time. Left ventricular assist devices have become increasingly more effective in bridging patients with end-stage heart failure to transplantation. This is likely due {{to a combination of}} better patient selection, improvements in clinical practice, and evolution in device design...|$|R

As we know, the fundamental of a driving method for electric vehicle can be separate into two types, which are one motor system and in-wheel motor system. There are many advantages by using in wheel motors such as motors torque generation is faster and accurate, motors can be installed in 2 or 4 wheels, and motors torque can be known precisely. For a <b>small</b> <b>electric</b> vehicle, in-wheel motor is more suitable than one motor.
