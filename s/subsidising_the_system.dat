40|$|In an overlapping-generations {{model with}} {{endogenous}} birth rates, I design a reform of <b>the</b> pay-as-you-go pension <b>system,</b> which internalises positive externalities of children - their pension contributions. Individuals may {{differ in their}} preferences for children {{and their ability to}} have children at all. They can choose between the status-quo flat-rate benefits and a new system, in which they get just the benefits that are (on average) financed by their own children, reduced by an amount which is used to <b>subsidise</b> <b>the</b> flat-rate <b>system.</b> Whereas people with low child preferences keep the status quo, people with high child preferences choose <b>the</b> individualised <b>system,</b> having <b>the</b> optimal incentives to raise children and a higher utility.

40|$|Since the mid- 1970 s, Vietnam {{experienced}} {{a period of}} transition to socialism, before bringing in economic reforms {{which led to the}} gradual dismantling of <b>the</b> <b>subsidised</b> <b>system</b> of planning and the opening up of the country to the global capitalist economy. Economic reform and renovation has important implications for the urban areas of Vietnam. The emergence of markets and the abandonment of many restrictions on travel resulted in a freeing up of the urbanisation process during the 1980 s and early 1990 s. These processes are considered, and the implications for Vietnam's largest urban area, Ho Chi Minh City, are examined. The likely impact of Vietnam's long-term socioeconomic strategy on the urban network in the remainder of the decade is considered. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Poor Law Commissioners' Report of 1834 called <b>the</b> Speenhamland <b>System</b> a [...] "universal <b>system</b> of pauperism". <b>The</b> <b>system</b> allowed employers, {{including}} {{farmers and}} the nascent industrialists of the town, to pay below subsistence wages, because the parish {{would make up}} the difference and keep their workers alive.

25|$|In 2001, a 50% {{share in}} long-distance {{passenger}} services {{was sold to}} directors of Australian company West Coast Railway, but neither it nor any other company elected to purchase the Southerner without {{the promise of a}} subsidy. The Ministry of Economic Development funded a feasibility study into the economic impact of <b>subsidising</b> <b>the</b> Southerner, but this failed to demonstrate a viable business case for the service - patronage had fallen to an average of between 40 and 50 people per day in each direction.

40|$|With a three-stage game model, {{this article}} {{theoretically}} assesses {{the effectiveness of}} different research and development subsidy strategies under asymmetric duopoly. The findings indicate that <b>subsidising</b> <b>the</b> small firm instead of the large is the optimum for the maximisation of social welfare in general. Meanwhile, if the initial marginal costs of the two firms are close to each other, providing subsidies to the small firm leads to more social R&D investment and higher aggregate production, but lower consumer surplus. Conversely, while the cost gap of the duopoly is large, <b>subsidising</b> <b>the</b> big firm becomes the preferable option for the authority to stimulate both R&D investment and total output of the industry, while sacrificing consumer surplus...|$|R
