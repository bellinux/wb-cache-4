40|$|Examining committee: Jean Stockard, chair, Anthony HicksThe City of Eugene {{acknowledges}} {{the benefits that}} neighborhood organizations bring to the community (City of Eugene, 1981). Although the City of Eugene’s Neighborhood Organization Policy states that neighborhood organizations {{are open to the}} diversified interests of the neighborhood residents, cultural and language barriers often prevent <b>Latino</b> <b>residents</b> from participating. Eugene’s Trainsong neighborhood has the highest percentage (17. 2 %) of <b>Latino</b> <b>residents,</b> in comparison <b>to</b> the total number of its residents, among Eugene’s 21 recognized neighborhoods (City of Eugene, 2003). Due <b>to</b> the high <b>Latino</b> <b>resident</b> population in Trainsong and the lack of <b>Latino</b> <b>resident</b> involvement with the Trainsong Neighborhood Association, an examination of the cultural and language barriers that impact Latino residents’ participation with the Trainsong Neighborhood Association is the focus of this research. Using a snowball sampling approach, eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with people believed to be familiar with Latino and/or Trainsong neighborhood residents and effective outreach strategies. Interviews were used to gather information on effective outreach strategies <b>to</b> increase <b>Latino</b> participation in neighborhood associations and the Eugene Municipal government. Results of interviews with knowledgeable citizens indicate that specific strategies can be implemented by the Trainsong Neighborhood Association and by Eugene Neighborhood Associations <b>to</b> effectively engage <b>Latino</b> <b>residents,</b> and by City of Eugene Neighborhood Services <b>to</b> support <b>Latino</b> participation in Neighborhood Associations in general...|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{survey was}} administered <b>to</b> <b>Latino</b> and White <b>residents</b> of Omaha, NE, to assess {{perception of the}} childhood obesity problem, attribution of responsibility, and support for obesity-related policies.

This difference persisted after adjusting for age, gender, and education level (odds ratio (OR) 2. 10, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 07 – 4. 14). Latinos {{were more likely to}} agree that government was responsible for addressing childhood obesity compared to Whites (OR 2. 81, 95 % CI 1. 82 – 4. 35).

Despite city-wide efforts to address obesity, differential penetration in community subgroups appears evident. There is room <b>to</b> further engage <b>Latinos</b> in the cause of obesity.

40|$|Scholarly {{literature}} has focused predominantly {{on the role}} of the gentrifiers and the developers in the gentrification process without formally addressing the perceptions of existing residents. New studies that incorporate local resident sentiment reveal that contrary to popular wisdom, gentrification can actually have certain beneficial and appreciated effects on low-income communities. The reactions to gentrification of residents from different neighborhoods vary however, depending on the context of the neighborhood. For example, while studies of Harlem suggest that residents appreciate many changes in their neighborhood resulting from gentrification, the area had reached levels of blight unknown by other low-income communities. Although also low -income, other areas like working-class ethnic enclaves may be more hostile towards gentrification because their communities have not reached the same levels of disinvestment and abandonment. This thesis explores the experiences of long-term <b>Latino</b> <b>residents</b> in San Francisco's gentrifying Mission District with the aim of providing a fuller understanding of gentrification's impact on low-income communities. I conducted field research in the Mission District between September 2007 and January 2008 which included interviews with long-term <b>Latino</b> <b>residents.</b> I also conducted an historical analysis of the neighborhood in order to give my interview and participant observations context. I found that although <b>Latino</b> <b>residents</b> were concerned about certain changes to their neighborhood resulting from gentrification, their perceptions about the process were complex and incorporated other contextual factors. Instead of blaming all changes in the community on gentrification, they mapped out relationships between family, crime, unemployment, youth, and community cultur...|$|R
