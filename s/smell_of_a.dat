5|$|Chlorine gas, {{also known}} as bertholite, was first used as a weapon in World War I by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres. As {{described}} by the soldiers, it had the distinctive <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mixture of pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung {{the back of the}} throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form hydrochloric acid, destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal. Human respiratory systems can be protected from chlorine gas by gas masks with activated charcoal or other filters, which makes chlorine gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben, which developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an entrenched enemy. After its first use, both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly phosgene and mustard gas.|$|E
25|$|During the night, the Portuguese {{concentrated}} their repairs on the bastions of Conception and Santiago, using palm trunks {{to cover}} the damaged sections. Meanwhile, a body of Dutch troops infiltrated and attacked the bastion of Santiago {{and the men who}} were engaged in repairs. As the light and <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> burning match could give away their position, this Dutch infiltration unit used flintlock muskets instead of matchlocks. They managed to wound some men but were forced to withdraw due to a charge made by the Portuguese guards. In retaliation, Lourenço Ferreira de Brito, the captain of the fort, organized a raiding party consisting of Lascarins, but after sallying and arousing the Dutch, they defected to them. Similarly, Dissanayake Mudali, a Lascarin leader, also defected and was seen collaborating with the Dutch.|$|E
25|$|To date, few {{effective}} traps {{for adult}} Asian tiger mosquitoes are available. Those traps that catch {{other species of}} mosquitoes do not catch tiger mosquitoes efficiently. A form of an ovitrap called a lethal ovitrap mimics the breeding site for Ae. albopictus just like the monitoring tool, but it has {{the added benefit of}} contained chemicals that are toxic to the mosquitoes when they enter, but do not harm humans. These traps have had success in some countries to control Aedes mosquito populations. A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of Ae. albopictus. This device, {{with the help of a}} ventilator, produces an upward air current of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acids that takes a similar form and <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human body. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult tiger mosquitoes, and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, the mosquitoes had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics. Recent research also indicates this trap type may also have a use as a control tool; in a study in Cesena, Italy, the number of biting tiger mosquitoes was reduced in places where traps were installed.|$|E

25|$|The trampled and de-stemmed {{harvest is}} then pressed. The {{type of wine}} press also affects the {{potential}} quality of the wine. Since the 1980s, pneumatic presses have improved the work involved by working in airtight conditions and allowing a fine control of the pressure to extract the juice without damaging the grapes. The juice or moût de goutte (Must of Drops) is the juice that flows naturally from the berries crushed under their own weight prior to pressing (on {{the way to the}} press). Trampling increases its proportion and makes the material profitable by processing a higher tonnage of grapes in the same time. The moût de presse (Must of the Press) is the juice flowing from the press from the pressure on the grapes. It concentrates the qualities or the defects of the grape: it is rich in aromas, colloids, or phenolic compounds. However, it can also be marked by olfactory defects, such as the smell of fungus on spoiled grapes or the vegetable <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> harvest with insufficient maturity. The blending or not of the moût de goutte and the moût de presse musts and release depends on the health of the grapes, the method of pressing, and the style of wine intended. Manipulation of the grape before pressing increases the amount of lees and complicates pressing. For the development of a quality wine, their use is excluded or very limited.|$|E
500|$|The Upanishad expounds the {{principles}} behind Om mantra {{as part of}} the yogic practice asserting that [...] "A", [...] "U" [...] and [...] "M" [...] are three letters that mirror the [...] "three Vedas, three Sandhyas (morning, noon and evening), three Svaras (sounds), three Agnis and three Guṇas". Metaphorically this practice is compared to realizing the hidden <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flower, reaching the ghee (clarified butter) in milk, reaching the oil innate in sesame seeds, effort to extract gold from its ore, and finding the Atman in one's heart. The letter [...] "A" [...] represents the flowering of lotus, [...] "U" [...] represents the blooming of the flower, [...] "M" [...] reaches its nada (tattva or truth inside, sound), and [...] "ardhamatra" [...] (half-metre) indicates the Turiya, or bliss of silence.|$|E
2500|$|Fishes {{can also}} learn from others the {{identity}} of predatory species.

[...] Fish can also learn to recognize the odor of dangerous sites when they are simultaneously exposed to it and to other fish that suddenly show a fright reaction. [...] Hatchery-raised salmon can learn the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> predator by being simultaneously exposed to it and to the alarm substance released by injured salmon.|$|E

2500|$|When {{threatened}} or harmed, they will [...] "play possum", mimicking the appearance and <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sick or dead animal. This physiological response is involuntary (like fainting), {{rather than a}} conscious act. [...] In the case of baby opossums, however, the brain does not always react this way at the appropriate moment, and therefore they often fail to [...] "play dead" [...] when threatened. When an opossum is [...] "playing possum", the animal's lips are drawn back, the teeth are bared, saliva foams around the mouth, the eyes close or half-close, and a foul-smelling fluid is secreted from the anal glands. The stiff, curled form can be prodded, turned over, and even carried away without reaction. The animal will typically regain consciousness {{after a period of}} a few minutes to four hours, a process that begins with slight twitching of the ears.|$|E
