2500|$|<b>Secretary</b> <b>birds</b> are {{endemic to}} Sub-Saharan Africa and are non-migratory, {{though they may}} follow food sources. [...] Their range extends from Mauritania to Somalia and south to the Cape of Good Hope. These birds are also found {{at a variety of}} elevations, from the coastal plains to the highlands. <b>Secretary</b> <b>birds</b> prefer open grasslands and savannas rather than forests and dense {{shrubbery}} which may impede their cursorial existence. While the birds roost on the local Acacia trees at night, they spend much of the day on the ground, returning to roosting sites just before dark.|$|R
50|$|The Anchieta's cobra is preyed upon by {{birds of}} prey, such as <b>secretary</b> <b>birds</b> and snake eagles and {{mammalian}} carnivores such as honey badgers. It is also {{prey to the}} white-throated monitor (Varanus albigularis).|$|R
25|$|The <b>secretary</b> <b>bird</b> {{has been}} a common motif for African {{countries}} on postage stamps: over 65 stamps from about 30 countries are known, including some from stamp-issuing entities such as Ajman, Manama, the Maldives and the United Nations where the bird does not exist.|$|E
25|$|The secretarybird or <b>secretary</b> <b>bird</b> (Sagittarius serpentarius) {{is a very}} large, mostly {{terrestrial}} bird of prey. Endemic to Africa, it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the sub-Saharan region. Although {{a member of the}} order Accipitriformes, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, hawks, vultures, and harriers, it is given its own family, Sagittariidae.|$|E
25|$|From a {{distance}} or in flight it resembles a crane {{more than a}} bird of prey. The tail has two elongated central feathers that extend beyond the feet during flight, as well as long flat plumage creating a posterior crest. <b>Secretary</b> <b>bird</b> flight feathers and thighs are black, {{while most of the}} coverts are grey with some being white. Sexes look similar to one another as the species exhibits very little sexual dimorphism, although the male has longer head plumes and tail feathers. Adults have a featherless red face as opposed to the yellow facial skin of the young.|$|E
5000|$|The {{generic name}} Sagittarius is Latin for [...] "archer", perhaps likening the <b>secretary</b> <b>bird's</b> [...] "quills" [...] to a quiver of arrows, and the {{specific}} epithet serpentarius recalls the bird's skill as a hunter of reptiles.|$|R
25|$|More than 470 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} in the park, many of which are migrants, with almost 60 species being raptors. Birds that call this area home for {{at least part of the}} year include: vultures, marabou storks, <b>secretary</b> <b>birds,</b> hornbills, crowned cranes, ostriches, long-crested eagles, African pygmy-falcons and the lilac-breasted roller, which is the national bird of Kenya.|$|R
25|$|Predators of Cape cobras {{include the}} honey badger (ratel). Other {{carnivorous}} mammals such as meerkats {{and a few}} species of mongoose often prey on the Cape cobra and are its main predators; they have a low susceptibility to its venom. Various birds of prey, including <b>secretary</b> <b>birds</b> and snake eagles may also prey on this species, and so do some other species of snakes.|$|R
25|$|In 1779 English {{illustrator}} John Frederick Miller was {{the first}} European to describe the secretarybird, and it was soon after assigned to its own genus Sagittarius by French naturalist Johann Hermann in his Tabula Affinitatum Animalium. It was not until 1935 that the species was moved to its own family, distinct from all other birds of prey—a classification confirmed by molecular systematics. Recent cladistic analysis has shown Sagittariidae to be an older branch of the {{diurnal birds of prey}} than Accipitridae and Falconidae, but a younger divergence than Cathartidae. Sometimes, the enigmatic bird Eremopezus is classified as an early relative of the secretarybird, though this is uncertain as the bird is only known from a few fragmentary body parts such as the legs. The earliest fossils associated with the family are two species from the genus Pelargopappus. The two species, from the Oligocene and Miocene respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family. In spite of their age, it is not thought that the two species are ancestral to the <b>secretary</b> <b>bird.</b>|$|E
500|$|The flight {{feathers}} of adults and juveniles can differ considerably in length, {{particularly among the}} raptors. [...] Overall, juveniles tend to have slightly longer rectrices, and shorter, broader wings (with shorter outer primaries, and longer inner primaries and secondaries) than do adults of the same species. However, there are many exceptions. In longer-tailed species, such as swallow-tailed kite, <b>secretary</b> <b>bird</b> and European honey buzzard, [...] for example, juveniles have shorter rectrices than adults do. [...] Juveniles of some Buteo buzzards have narrower wings than adults do, while those of large juvenile falcons are longer. It is theorized that the differences help young birds compensate for their inexperience, weaker flight muscles and poorer flying ability.|$|E

50|$|The {{park has}} abundant, varied wildlife. It {{is home to}} large {{mammalian}} predators such as Kalahari lions (Panthera leo vernayi, Panthera leo krugeri, or Panthera leo melanochaita), Namibian cheetahs, leopards, and hyenas. Migratory herds of large herbivores such as blue wildebeest, springbok, eland, and red hartebeest also live and move seasonally within the park, providing sustenance for the predators. More than 200 species of bird {{can be found in}} the park, including vultures and raptors such as eagles, buzzards, and <b>secretary</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Unlike most {{birds of}} prey, the <b>secretary</b> <b>bird</b> is largely terrestrial, hunting its prey on foot. Adults hunt in pairs and {{sometimes}} as loose familial flocks, stalking through the habitat with long strides. [...] Prey may consist of insects, mammals {{ranging in size}} from mice to hares and mongoose, crabs, lizards, snakes, tortoises, small birds, bird eggs, and sometimes dead animals killed in grass or bush fires. Larger herbivores are not generally hunted, although there are some reports of secretary birds killing young gazelles and cheetah cubs. The importance of snakes in the diet has been exaggerated in the past, although they can be locally important and venomous species such as adders and cobras are regularly among the types of snake preyed upon.Secretarybirds are kept as pest controllers by farmers to rid of snakes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{young are}} preyed upon by crows, ravens, hornbills, large owls and kites {{as they are}} {{vulnerable}} in Acacia tree tops, with no known incidents of predation on adults. As a population, the <b>secretary</b> <b>bird</b> is mainly threatened by loss of habitat and deforestation. [...] In 1968 the species became protected under the Africa Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Loss of grassland to bush encroachment driven by rising CO2 levels has also been implicated, as has a susceptibility to power line collisions. Nevertheless, the species is still widespread across Africa, and has adapted well to arable land where prey animals such as rodents are more common than in traditional habitat. The species is well represented in protected areas as well. They are assessed as vulnerable by the IUCN due to a recent rapid decline across their entire range.|$|E

The spectacular wildlife witnessed in the park generally refers to [...] where a million wildebeests chase green lands across the rolling plains of Serengeti in Tanzania and Masai Mara in Kenya. Sometimes they are seen in [...] long columns migrating across the rivers to the north, over a distance of , after spending three weeks of mating and giving birth to 8000 calves daily. This migration and life cycle creation is an annual feature witnessed in the park. This migration is in unison with 200,000 zebra and 300,000 Thomson's gazelle in search of grazing pastures, aptly described as [...] "six million hooves pound the open plains". Other mammals seen here are buffaloes, elephants, giraffe, large number of elands, topis, kongonis, impalas, and Grant's gazelles. The predators inhabiting the park are lions, leopards, jackals, spotted hyenas, and serval cats. Reptiles seen are agama lizards and rock hyraxes. Bird species recorded are more than 500, which include ostrich and <b>secretary</b> <b>bird.</b> 100 varieties of dung beetle are also reported.|$|E
5000|$|Tyrannosaur {{arms are}} short when {{compared}} to other known predators. Horner argues that the arms were too short to make the necessary gripping force to hold on to prey. Other paleontologists such as Thomas Holtz Jr. and James Farlow however gave examples of animals that do not use their forelimbs to hunt such as wolves, seriemas and <b>secretary</b> <b>birds.</b> Holtz later stated that the use of forelimbs are not the only viable way of prey capture giving examples of modern predators such as canids and hyaenids(hyenas). He also cited other extinct animals such as the Diatryma (also known as Gastornis) and Phorusrhacids. Gregory S. Paul cited thylacines as another example.|$|R

25|$|Prey {{is often}} flushed out of tall grass by the birds stomping on the {{surrounding}} vegetation. It also waits near fires, eating anything it can {{that is trying}} to escape. They can either catch prey by chasing it and striking with the bill and swallowing (usually with small prey), or stamping on prey until it is rendered stunned or unconscious enough to swallow. Larger or dangerous prey, such as venomous snakes, are instead stunned or killed by the bird jumping onto their backs, at which point they will try to snap their necks or backs. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, the <b>secretary</b> <b>birds</b> will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will tear apart prey with their feet before consuming it.|$|R
