Apart from highly priced turbot, brill, striped red mullet and sea bass, these 12 species comprise also 3 gurnard species and 4 flatfishes. This report presents information for these 12 species that are becoming increasingly important for fisheries in NW Europe, partly due to the generally poor state of some of the main commercial fish species. The information presented in this report is based on analyses of data from research vessel surveys, landings statistics, data from on board observers, market sampling programmes and from biological sampling. Some economical analyses have been carried out as well. Through this project a better insight is gained in aspects such as distribution of the species, length- and sometimes age-composition of the catches, growth and maturity, ageing, <b>stock</b> <b>ID</b> etc...|$|E

Many research developed to know the influential factors of probability of experiencing financial distress. Besides information in financial statement, there are others information that needed to predict the financial distress, such as corporate governance mechanisms in thefirm. This research seeks to know relationship between ownership structure, board size, independent board of commissioners,firm size, leverage, and liquidity withfinancial distress. This research used a sample of 14 financial distress firms and a matchedpair sample of 14 non-financial distressfirms. Data was gathered by using purposive sampling of manufacturing companies listed in Indonesian <b>Stock</b> Exchange (<b>ID.</b> I 9 during 2004 - 2007. For analyzing data, this research used logistic regression method The results showed that director size, firm size, and liquidity are negatively associated with probability of experiencing financial distress, while commissioner size and leverage are positively associated This researchfailed to prove the relationship of blockholders' ownership, directors' ownership, commissioners' ownership, and independent board with probability of experiencing financial distress.

50|$|A {{time series}} is {{one type of}} Panel data. Panel data is the general class, a multidimensional data set, whereas a time series data set is a {{one-dimensional}} panel (as is a cross-sectional dataset). A data set may exhibit characteristics of both panel data and time series data. One way to tell is to ask what makes one data record unique from the other records. If the answer is the time data field, then {{this is a time}} series data set candidate. If determining a unique record requires a time data field and an additional identifier which is unrelated to time (student <b>ID,</b> <b>stock</b> symbol, country code), then it is panel data candidate. If the differentiation lies on the non-time identifier, then the data set is a cross-sectional data set candidate.|$|R

Background: Pervasive, 24 -hour rhythms from the biological clock affect diverse biological processes in metabolism and behaviour, including the human cell division cycle and sleep-wake cycle, nightly transpiration and energy balance in plants, and seasonal breeding in both plants and animals. The clock mechanism in the laboratory model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana is complex, in part due to the multiple interlocking, negative feedback loops that link the clock genes. Clock gene mutants are powerful tools to manipulate and understand the clock mechanism and its effects on physiology. The LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 genes encode dawn-expressed, Myb-related repressor proteins that delay the expression of other clock genes until late in the day. Double mutant plants (lhy cca 1) have low-amplitude, short-period rhythms that have been used in multiple studies of the plant circadian clock. Results: We used in vivo imaging of several luciferase (LUC) reporter genes to test how the rhythmic gene expression of wild-type and lhy cca 1 mutant plants responded to light:dark cycles. Red, blue and red+blue light were similarly able to entrain these gene expression rhythms. The timing of expression rhythms in double mutant plants showed little or no response to the duration of light under 24 h light:dark cycles (dusk sensitivity), in contrast to the wild type. As the period of the mutant clock is about 18 h, we tested light:dark cycles of different duration (T cycles), simulating altered rotation of planet Earth. lhy cca 1 double mutants regained as much dusk sensitivity in 20 h T cycles as the wild type in 24 h cycles, though the phase of the rhythm in the mutants was much earlier than wild type. The severe, triple lhy cca 1 gi mutants also regained dusk sensitivity in 20 h cycles. The double mutant showed some dusk sensitivity under 28 h cycles. lhy cca 1 double mutants under 28 h cycles with short photoperiods, however, had the same apparent phase as wild-type plants. Conclusion: Simulating altered planetary rotation with light:dark cycles can reveal normal circadian performance in clock mutants that have been described as arrhythmic under standard conditions. The features rescued here comprise a dynamic behaviour (apparent phase under 28 h cycles) and a dynamic property (dusk sensitivity under 20 h cycles). These conditional clock phenotypes indicate that parts of the clock mechanism continue to function independently of LHY and CCA 1, despite the major role of these genes in wild-type plants under standard conditions.

40|$|Background People with {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID) {{generally have}} a poor level {{of physical activity}} and poor adherence to this (Hughes et al., 2011). There have been some studies that use ICTs (Information Technology and Communication) to improve physical activity in other disabilities, but not in ID (Quilici et al., 2013). Usability involves ease in using a tool, so {{it is important to understand}} the usability of an application. In this study we will examine the usability of an application which is intended to improve physical activity in people with ID. Method. This is a prospective study. We installed an application onto the smart phones of people with ID, which was a reminder with some advice about physical activities that people with ID can use if they follow this advice. Usability was measured by SUS (System Usability Scale). This scale was based on a 10 item questionnaire with 5 possible answers. The total punctuation was between 0 and 100. We used this scale because it has been used in other studies and it has a high reliability (0. 85). Results and discussion. We found there to be only limited usability for this application in people with ID, with a punctuation of 48, 13 (± 7, 15). There are studies that measure the usability of mobile phones in people with <b>ID</b> (<b>Stock,</b> Davies, Wehmeyer and Palmer, 2008). However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the usability of an application to improve physical activity in people with ID. Conclussion. The application to improve physical activity in people with ID had mild usability. This may reflect the difficulty that these people often have in using mobile phones and applications.
