Two basic types of passive stack problems have been found: poor installation and basement depressurization.

One additional requirement for a vent stack connection occurs when there are very long horizontal drain runs with very little slope to the run. Adding a vent connection within the run will aid flow, and when used with a cleanout allows for better serviceability of the long run.|$|R
40|$|Planting {{trees that}} weigh over 200 pounds {{normally}} requires {{three or more}} able persons. Therefore, a device that allows a single person to easily and efficiently plant such trees possible by one person is highly desirable. During a Product Design class in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a group of 14 students developed a series of four concept models which culminated in a Final Prototype of such a product that can successfully lift, move and plant trees of over 200 pounds. This paper is aimed at documenting this series of designs and analyzing, testing and further developing the Final Prototype built in the course {{in order to make}} it marketable. Based on customer feedback, testing results, and user interaction, revisions to the next prototype of this device are proposed. Testing with trees of 170 and 370 lbs determined that the current outrigger stabilizing mechanism needs modification. The current outriggers, which are stored inside the frame, sustained maximum loads of 29 lbs for the 170 lbs tree, and 46 lbs for the 370 lbs tree. A sketch model built to simulate the outrigger mechanism suggests that the outriggers should be attached outside the base frame of the device rather than stored inside. (cont.) The revised device is also to include two <b>stacked</b> <b>pipe</b> clamps for securing the vertical member members of the outriggers. The upper and lower frames are to be reduced in width from 42 to 36 inches, making the device more compact while still accommodating tree root balls of up to 3 feet in diameter. Nylon insulation of the current winch wire is necessary to prevent damage to tree trunks while operating the device. These design revisions will improve the performance of the device Final Prototype and are believed to make the revised device commercially viable on the product market. by Sean J.

5000|$|Every {{engineering}} {{discipline is}} engaged in sustainable design, employing numerous initiatives, especially life cycle analysis (LCA), pollution prevention, design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD), and design for recycling (DfR). These are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms. For example, concept of a [...] "cap and trade" [...] has been tested and works well for some pollutants. This is a system where companies are allowed to place a [...] "bubble" [...] over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a [...] "stack-by-stack" [...] and [...] "pipe-by-pipe" [...] approach, i.e. the so-called [...] "command and control" [...] approach. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operation and maintenance (O&M) technologies for the more difficult to treat <b>stacks</b> and <b>pipes.</b> But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each <b>stack</b> or <b>pipe</b> as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a life-cycle analysis, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), difficulty in treating, and feasibility. The most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat, i.e. less feasible. Of course, as with all paradigm shifts, expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective. [...] Historically, sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated. The hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these did not entirely do the job, limiting rates of production. Green engineering recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach. Green engineering attempts to achieve four goals: ...|$|R

A family of blowout pipes from Namibia exhibit a variety of seismic characteristics, with the largest pipes containing a blowout crater and evidence of possible <b>stacked</b> palaeo-pockmarks. <b>Pipe</b> formation is shown to be intermittent and persistent throughout the Neogene. The spatial position of pipes adheres to both basinal and local controls. A group of large buried pockmarks on the NDSF are interpreted to have formed between 15, 000 yrs BP and 125, 000 yrs BP, the majority of which are believed to have formed at the same time c. 60, 000 - 80, 000 yrs BP.   These buried pockmarks show evidence for highly focused, episodic fluid flow following burial of the pockmark.   The longevity of post formation fluid migration is estimated to be ~ 50, 000 - 100, 000 yrs. A field of > 13, 800 small seabed pockmarks (Nile Deep Sea Fan) are interpreted to have formed within the last 1, 000 yrs.   Spatial statistics identified an exclusion zone or drainage cell surrounding each pockmark which is not penetrated by the formation of any other pockmark.   A conceptual model for a drainage cell is proposed whereby pockmark formation dissipates, a radius/area of fluid and overpressure, thereby preventing the formation of another pockmark within that cell.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} {{surprising}} things about photonic crystals is not {{the existence of the}} band gap, but the fact that a large, ordered array of scatters can be transparent to light within certain spectral regions. We have identified a new, general effect in which the band gap of a photonic lattice can be suppressed by unexpected mode degeneracy, rendering a photonic crystal completely transparent to all frequencies across two or more distinct bands. Two-dimensional photonic crystal structures, consisting of a periodic plane and a third extruded or non-periodic dimension, have received a significant amount of recent attention [1]. These crystals have important practical significance because they offer the tantalizing possibilities of guiding and manipulating light in planar defect circuits and photonic crystal fibers [2] and controlling polarization through their anisotropic band structures [3]. Typical 2 D photonic crystal lattices include dielectric rods or hollow pipes (tubes) arranged periodically in air, and spaced air holes in a dielectric block. These two-dimensional lattices are often described in terms their air-filling fraction (AFF), the ratio of the air volume in the structure to its total volume. The hollow-pipe lattice—a connected array of hollow pipes or tubes—is of particular practical interest because it is structurally rigid and can be practically constructed for optical wavelengths over a relatively large range of air-filling fractions by <b>stacking</b> macroscopic dielectric <b>pipes</b> i...|$|R

Pure fluid flows out of the porous walls while impurities are left in the channel.

We develop a mathematical model for the flow in a 2 D filtration channel and a 3 D pipe, with a capped end, to describe the behaviour within a direct-flow device. We study the axial dependence of the transmembrane pressure (TMP) across the membrane walls on the imposed flux, wall permeability and the proximity of the neighbouring fibres. The mathematical models derived are used to predict the operating regimes of the device that maximize the spatial uniformity in the TMP and thus optimize the use of the entire membrane area. We show how {{a large portion of the}} available membrane area is not used when the fibres are packed too closely together, with the majority of the filtration behaviour localized near to the impermeable capped end; this leads to inefficient filtration. We quantify the device performance by examining the uniformity of the filtration across the length of the device and the output of filtered fluid for a given operating pressure...|$|R
