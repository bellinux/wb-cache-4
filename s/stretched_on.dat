5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, <b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E

25|$|In {{the tournament}} quarterfinals Royce and Sakuraba battled {{for an hour}} and a half (six 15 minute rounds). Gracie opened the fight aggressively, raining punches from Kazushi's back while the Japanese worked an armlock from standing, but Sakuraba kept calm, knowing Royce had no {{knockout}} power and expecting him to waste his energy; he even came to the point of smiling to the cameras during the attack (Sakuraba went on later to claim that he was actually greeting a cameraman who was a personal friend of his). Towards the end of the round, Sakuraba nearly ended the match with a kneebar, while Gracie came back with a guillotine choke at the second, but Kazushi again joked to show he was out of danger by simulating to pull down Royce's gi pants. Sakuraba switched to attack at the third round, dominating the stand up and making Royce lie repeatedly on the ground to avoid him. As the confrontation <b>stretched</b> <b>on,</b> the Gracie's own no time-limit rules began to work against Royce as Sakuraba's wrestling skills and balance nullified Royce's ability to score a takedown and—in some instances—even pull guard. Even Royce's ever-present jiu-jitsu gi became a weapon for the wrestler to use against him as Sakuraba used it to help him control Gracie on the instances the fight did come to the ground. However, with Sakuraba's control of the takedown, these instances of ground warfare became increasingly sporadic. After Kazushi landed a long series of punishing leg kicks at the fifth and sixth rounds, Royce's brother, Rorion threw in the towel.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} bichrome and polychrome vessels {{have also been}} found at Moundville. Stylistically they closely {{resemble}} pottery found along the Tennessee, Cumberland, the lower Ohio River and the central Mississippi Valleys. This pottery was long {{thought to have been}} imported from these other areas as trade items, and modern chemical analysis has shown that much of it is. The same analysis has also proved that some of the pottery was made locally in the Moundville polity. The polychrome pottery has representational motifs painted with red, white, and black pigments. The red and white are applied as slips of colored clay, while the black was made from carbon and applied with a negative or resist technique. Similar in manufacture to the engraved ceramics, the painted pottery has thin walls, was tempered with finely ground mussel shell and was given a polished exterior. This style comes in two major shapes, a bottle with a spherical body and a narrow curving neck and a terraced rectangular bowl that is a Moundville specialty. The rectangular bowl is a vertical-sided, flat-bottomed, rectangular vessel with an eccentric rim, specifically with one side lower than the other three so as to display the containers contents. The designs painted on the rectangular vessels are similar to motifs found on other locally produced wares and include the oblong emblem with an embedded cross-in-circle motif(thought to be a graphic representation of a scalp <b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> a hoop), the hand, the skull, the ogee, concentric circles, rayed concentric circles, rayed semicircles, and rayed spirals.|$|E
500|$|A {{composite}} bow is {{a traditional}} bow made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together, cf., laminated bow. The horn is on the belly, facing the archer, and sinew on the outer side of a wooden core. When the bow is drawn, the sinew (<b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> the outside) and horn (compressed on the inside) store more energy than wood for the same length of bow. The strength can be made {{similar to that of}} all-wood [...] "self" [...] bows, with similar draw-length and therefore a similar amount of energy delivered to the arrow from a much shorter bow. However, making a composite bow requires more varieties of material than a self bow, its construction takes much more time, and the finished bow is more sensitive to moisture.|$|E

500|$|Michigan played {{its final}} home game on November 23 and won, 89–0, over Beloit College. The {{game was played}} in 30-minute halves at Regents Field in Ann Arbor. Michigan scored 15 touchdowns, six by Albert Herrnstein, three by Neil Snow, and single touchdowns by Shorts, Heston, White, Graver, Sweeley and Redner. Shorts also scored on 14 goals from touchdown, giving him 19 points. The game was played on a wet field that was [...] "practically a pond in the centre, filled in with sawdust before the game started." [...] Because of the field conditions, Michigan {{was not able to}} execute its end runs and relied principally on [...] "line bucking." [...] Right end Albert Herrnstein scored six touchdowns for 30 points, {{including}} two kickoff returns for touchdowns in the second half. Coach Yost later recalled the scene on the field after one of Herrnstein's runs: [...] "Once when Herrnstein made a long run for a touchdown I remember of seeing four Beloit players <b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> the ground in a line where they had made useless efforts to stop him." [...] Right tackle Bruce Shorts scored a touchdown and kicked 14 extra points for 19 points. Fullback Neil Snow added three touchdowns for 15 points, and single touchdowns were scored by Heston, White, Graver, Sweeley and Redden. The Beloit team managed to gain the five yards required for a first down on only one drive late in the game. Beloit's one first down came on a fake kick followed by a run of 15 yards—the largest gain made by any team against Michigan in 1901. The New York Times reported: [...] "The strong team from Beloit was unable to do anything against the Ann Arbor men." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1955, St. Laurent tabled {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Department of Defence Production permanent. This would also extend the extraordinary powers of the Minister. [...] Fearful of another damaging confrontation between Howe and the Opposition, the Cabinet agreed that St. Laurent would guide the bill through, but after {{the first day of}} debate St. Laurent, who was prone to depression, absented himself. Tory frontbencher Donald Fleming contended that the extension could make the minister [...] "the virtual dictator of the economy". [...] With St. Laurent absent (or when present, silent), Howe took charge of the bill, and according to his biographers, Robert Bothwell and William Kilbourn, [...] "utterly failed to perceive that the bill and his manner of defending it were a godsend to the opposition". When Howe alluded to the Avro Arrow project and that he [...] "was out on a limb for $30 million", which gave him [...] "the shudders", the Opposition met the statement with jeers and cries of [...] "What's a million?" [...] The Tories were supported by the Social Credit MPs, while the Government gained the support of the CCF on this issue. [...] Interrupted by a lengthy governmental trip by Howe to Australia and New Zealand, the debate <b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> until midyear. In early July, Howe left town for a long weekend, after asking St. Laurent and Minister of Finance Walter Harris to maintain his stand while he was gone, although he gave Harris the authority to do as he saw fit. Without informing Howe, St. Laurent contacted Drew, and the two men agreed that the minister's powers would expire in 1959 unless sooner renewed. The amended bill passed the Commons in Howe's absence, and when he returned, he furiously accused Harris of making a deal behind his back. However, when Howe was told that it had been the Prime Minister's decision, he accepted it. [...] Howe had earlier turned down an Opposition offer to agree to a three-year extension of his ministerial powers, saying [...] "That would mean coming back to Parliament in three years, and I've more to do with my time than amusing Parliament." [...] The extension was allowed to expire in 1959, although by then, Howe had left office.|$|E

40|$|This {{narrative}} review {{examined the}} biomechanical effect of <b>stretching</b> exercises <b>on</b> skeletal muscles. While {{there is a}} long history of clinical research on the effect of <b>stretching</b> <b>on</b> flexibility, there have only been a few years of research on the acute and chronic effects of <b>stretching</b> <b>on</b> the biomechanical parameters of muscle function. The acute effect of stretching appears to be a significant increase in range of motion primarily due to increased stretch tolerance and significant reductions in most all forms of muscular performance. Stretching also creates significant acute reductions in passive tension (stress-relaxation) in the muscle, but does not appear to affect its stiffness/elasticity. Stretch training significantly increases range of motion, but it also tends to increase the passive tension and stiffness of the musculature. Future research of human muscle in vivo during stretching and normal movement using ultrasound promises to help clarify the effects of <b>stretching</b> <b>on</b> the active and passive components of muscle and the many biomechanical variables of muscular performance...|$|R
