5|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media <b>sound</b> <b>bites,</b> and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone. Recorded during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} animation by American {{graphic designer}} and cartoonist Bill Plympton. To illustrate key concepts, Fuck uses <b>sound</b> <b>bites,</b> music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two {{films in the}} documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear {{to be talking to}} each other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} was in power, press {{secretary}} Alastair Campbell installed a centralised organisation to co-ordinate government communication and impose a united message to be delivered by ministers. Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's press officer, was often in conflict with Campbell because of the former's attempts to brief the press by his own initiatives; this continued until his resignation in 1999. Campbell followed a professional approach to media relations {{to ensure that a}} clear message was presented, and the party planned stories in advance to ensure a positive media reaction. Campbell used his own experience in journalism; he was known for his attention to detail and effective use of <b>sound</b> <b>bites.</b> Campbell developed a relationship with News International, providing their newspapers with early information in return for positive media coverage.|$|E

25|$|It is true, as {{the critics}} suggest, that the {{readings}} forego overt emotion, but what emerges instead {{is a solid}} sense of structure, letting the music speak convincingly for itself. It {{is also true that}} Strauss's tempos are generally swift, but this, too, contributes to the structural cohesion and in any event is fully in keeping with our modern outlook in which speed is a virtue and attention spans are defined more by MTV clips and news <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> than by evenings at the opera and thousand page novels.|$|E
25|$|As {{classroom}} technologies {{become more}} prolific, so do multimodal assignments. Students {{in the 21st century}} have more options for communicating digitally, be it texting, blogging, or through social media. This rise in computer-controlled communication has required classes to become multimodal {{in order to}} teach students the skills required in the 21st-century work environment. However, in the classroom setting, multimodality is more than just combining multiple technologies, but rather creating meaning through the integration of multiple modes. Students are learning through a combination of these modes, including sound, gestures, speech, images and text. For example, in digital components of lessons, there are often pictures, videos, and <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> as well as the text to help students grasp {{a better understanding of the}} subject. Multimodality also requires that teachers move beyond teaching with just text, as the printed word is only one of many modes students must learn and use.|$|E
25|$|During {{the golden}} age of hip hop, samples were heavily used. The ability to sample {{different}} beats, riffs and patterns {{from a wide variety of}} sources gave birth to a new breed of producers, DJs who did not necessarily need formal musical training or instruments, just a good ear for sound collages. These samples were derived from a number of genres, ranging from jazz, funk and soul to rock and roll. For example, Paul's Boutique, the Beastie Boys' second studio album, drew from over 200 individual samples, 24 of which were featured on the last track of the album. Samples and <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> were not limited to just music. RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, a hip hop collective formed in the 1990s, sampled sound clips from his own collection of 1970s kung-fu films to bolster and frame the group's gritty lyrical content. Many of the sample-laden albums released during this time would not be able to receive legal clearance today.|$|E

This inspired a similar, revamped <b>sound</b> <b>bite</b> that was used during [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] on the Return of the Spice Girls.

25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Yitzhak Rabin, his temporary successor Shimon Peres decided to call early elections {{in order to give}} the government a mandate to advance the peace process. Netanyahu was the Likud's candidate for Prime Minister in the 1996 Israeli legislative election which took place on 26 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which Israelis elected their Prime Minister directly. Netanyahu hired American Republican political operative Arthur Finkelstein to run his campaign, and although the American style of <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> and sharp attacks elicited harsh criticism from inside Israel, it proved effective (the method was later copied by Ehud Barak during the 1999 election campaign in which Barak beat Netanyahu). When Netanyahu won the 1996 election, he became the youngest person {{in the history of the}} position and the first Israeli Prime Minister to be born in the State of Israel (Yitzhak Rabin was born in Jerusalem, under the British Mandate of Palestine, prior to the 1948 founding of the Israeli state).|$|E
500|$|Politics {{dominated}} {{network news}} in 1992. Jennings moderated the final debate among the Democratic presidential candidates in March, and anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is Ross Perot? and a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June. On September 9, 1992, ABC {{announced that it}} would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged <b>sound</b> <b>bites.</b> [...] "We're aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put {{at least some of the}} blame on us," [...] Jennings told viewers on World News Tonight. [...] "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> designed exclusively for television." [...] After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, D.C. junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte.|$|E

He typically spoke slowly, and carefully chose his words. Although he was not considered a great orator, his speeches conveyed [...] "his personal commitment, charm and humour".|$|E

500|$|Fear of a Black Planets music {{features}} assemblage compositions {{that draw}} on numerous aural sources. The production's musique concrète-influenced approach reflects {{the political and}} confrontational tones of the group's lyrics, with sound collages that feature varying rhythms, aliased or scratchy samples, media <b>sound</b> <b>bites,</b> and eccentric music loops. Recordings sampled for Fear of a Black Planet include those from funk, soul, rock, and hip hop genres. Elements such as choruses, guitar sounds, or vocals from sampled recordings are reappropriated as riffs in songs on the album, while sampled dialogue from speeches is incorporated to support Chuck D's arguments and commentary on certain songs. The Bomb Squad's Hank Shocklee compared their produced sounds, surrounding Chuck D's rhythmic, exhortative baritone voice, to putting [...] "the voice of God in a storm".|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "Contract on the World Love Jam", {{is a sound}} collage made up of samples, scratch cuts, and snippets {{recorded}} by Chuck D from radio stations and <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> of interviews and commercials. The tension-building track introduces the album's dense, sample-based production. According to Chuck D, the song features [...] "about forty-five to fifty [...] voices" [...] that interweave {{as part of an}} assertive sonic collage and underscore the album’s themes. [...] "Incident at 66.6 FM", another collage that segues into [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome", contains snippets from a radio call-in show interview of Chuck D and alludes to the media persecution perceived by Public Enemy. [...] "Burn Hollywood Burn" [...] assails the use of black stereotypes in movies, and [...] "Who Stole the Soul?" [...] condemns the record industry's exploitation of black recording artists and calls for reparations. [...] "Revolutionary Generation" [...] celebrates the strength and endurance of black women with lyrics related to black feminism, an unfamiliar topic in hip hop. It also addresses sexism within the black community and misogyny in hip hop culture.|$|E

500|$|Having {{always wanted}} to write a tribute to The Flintstones, Yankovic next focused his energy on {{creating}} a song that he hoped would be current with the impending release of The Flintstones live action film in 1994. In order to collect <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> and animation and [...] "re-familiarize" [...] himself with the characters, Yankovic watched over 100 episodes of the original show. A parody of both Red Hot Chili Peppers's [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] and [...] "Give It Away", the resulting song was a comedic tribute to the program. It ended up becoming the second single released from Alapalooza. Yankovic directed the video for the single, which featured scenes of band members playing the song in Bedrock dressed as characters from the show. In the third and final single, [...] "Achy Breaky Song", a parody of Billy Ray Cyrus' [...] "Achy Breaky Heart", Yankovic lists things he would rather experience than having to listen to the original track. The parody received radio play on country music stations in the United States. The proceeds from the track were donated to United Cerebral Palsy, as both Don Von Tress (the songwriter of [...] "Achy Breaky Heart") and Yankovic felt that the parody was [...] "a little bit [...] mean-spirited".|$|E
500|$|AllGame's Michael L. House {{enjoyed the}} use of <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> in civilizations' native languages, which he said was [...] "very {{influential}} in developing an era-enhancing atmosphere". Eurogamer said this feature [...] "gives [...] a personality, rather than the standard 'Acknowledged' grunt of military RTS games", also stating that {{the use of}} female villagers provided a good variety. Game Revolution's review explained that by being set in a more recent epoch of human history, The Age of Kings was able to [...] "add character to an otherwise impersonal style of gameplay". Computer and Video Games approved of The Age of Kings use of shorter, more focused campaigns, compared to its predecessor, while Game Revolution noted that even in slower sections of the campaign, the historical narrative helped maintain player interest. GameSpot said that with the screen full of units, [...] "you can begin to imagine how their historical equivalents once prospered", while GameSpy said The Age of Kings presents [...] "realism rarely seen in the RTS genre". IGN staff argued that while the strengths and weaknesses attributed to different civilizations made the game more realistic, {{the fact that they were}} still mostly the same prevented The Age of Kings from [...] "delivering the same battlefield impact of StarCraft or [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{expressed}} mixed {{opinions of}} the game's audio. The D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro said that the [...] "whimsical" [...] background music is [...] "quite enjoyable" [...] and the character <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> are [...] "varied enough to avoid becoming annoying." [...] Doug Perry of IGN had a more mixed take, saying that the [...] "classic bouncy, xylophone-heavy beat" [...] is [...] "not necessarily great", and that after a few courses, [...] "you either stop hearing it, or the incessant simplicity of it {{makes you want to}} cry or pull your hair out". On the subject of the voice acting, he concluded that there is [...] "nothing really that cute, clever or memorable" [...] in the game, and noted that Crash's voice in the game is extremely similar to that of Luigi from the Mario Kart series. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote that while the music and sound effects [...] "push the game's cartoon theme," [...] the themes were not too [...] "over the top" [...] or incessant. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution passed the music off as [...] "standard kitschy fare" [...] and added that while the sound effects [...] "add to the cartoon quality of the game", some of the character voices were unsatisfactory. Joe Ottoson of Allgame noted that the characters [...] "are all quite vocal", and the music [...] "sets off the whimsical mood nicely".|$|E

500|$|Originally, Fincher {{envisioned the}} film's soundtrack to be {{composed}} of 40 cues of vintage music spanning the nearly three decades of the Zodiac story. With music supervisor George Drakoulias, the director searched for the right pop songs that reflected the era, including Three Dog Night's cover of [...] "Easy to Be Hard" [...] because [...] "it's so ingrained in my psyche as being what the summer of '69 sounded like in northern California". Initially, Fincher did not envision an original score for the film, but rather a tapestry of sound design, vintage songs of the period, <b>sound</b> <b>bites</b> and clips of KFRC (an AM radio giant) and [...] "Mathews Top of the Hill Daly City" [...] (home of a prominent hi-fi dealership of the time). The director told the studio {{that he did not}} need a composer and would buy various songs instead. They agreed, but as the film developed, sound designer and longtime Fincher collaborator Ren Klyce felt there were places in some scenes that could have used music. So, he inserted music from two of his favorite soundtracks, David Shire's scores for The Conversation and All the President's Men. Fincher was eager to work with Shire as All the President's Men was one of his favorite films and one of the primary cinematic influences on Zodiac. He reminded Klyce of the deal that he had made with the studio.|$|E
500|$|The Angel of Darkness was {{unveiled}} under its official name in March 2002, with a fuller demonstration appearing at E3 that year. Problems {{with the game}} were sensed at an early stage, as Heath-Smith forgot himself and began swearing at the game while trying to demonstrate the opening level at a buyer's conference. A release date was announced for November 2002, but the game got delayed into spring 2003. Eidos believed The Angel of Darkness would benefit from additional marketing support from , the sequel to the [...] Despite the delays, the company pushed Core Design to release the game {{in time for the}} marketing support. In order to meet the deadline, areas of the game containing key narrative elements had to be cut; one of the losses was the explanation of how the character survived the events of The Last Revelation. Among other concepts that needed to be cut were two further locations, character animations, <b>sound</b> <b>bites,</b> and unique gameplay elements involving Kurtis. Some completed environmental assets also ended up being cut by mistake. Some of those elements were also deliberately left out by the team, who wished to bring them into future games. The team at Core Design later said that they felt Eidos forced them to get the game out before it was ready. The game was also reportedly submitted eight times to Sony before its release. The game went gold on 18 June 2003, two days before its original release date, although there was some confusion as the game had reportedly gone gold on 2 June. The game was finally released in the summer of 2003, alongside The Cradle of Life.|$|E
