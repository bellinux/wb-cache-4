25|$|The Catholic Church {{believes}} that it is guided by the Holy Spirit, {{and that it is}} protected from definitively teaching error on matters of faith and morals. According to the Church, the Holy Spirit reveals God's truth through <b>sacred</b> <b>scripture</b> and sacred tradition. Sacred tradition consists of those beliefs handed down through the church since the time of the Apostles. <b>Sacred</b> <b>scripture</b> and sacred tradition are collectively known as the deposit of faith. This is in turn interpreted by the magisterium, the teaching authority of the Church. The magisterium includes those pronouncements of the popes that are considered infallible, as well as the pronouncements of ecumenical councils and those of the College of Bishops in union with the pope when they condemn false interpretations of scripture or define truths. The first person to distinguish Catholic theology from secularism was the Italian Protestant Alberico Gentili.|$|E
25|$|It {{implies that}} the concern with canon is viewed as another historical-critical {{technique}} which can take its place alongside of source criticism, form criticism, rhetorical criticism, and the like.

The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to ask for it. Equality of women with men is enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib, the <b>sacred</b> <b>scripture</b> of the Sikh faith.|$|E

25|$|The four dogmas of {{perpetual}} virginity, Mother of God, Immaculate Conception and Assumption {{form the basis}} of Mariology. However, a number of other Catholic doctrines about the Virgin Mary have been developed by reference to <b>sacred</b> <b>scripture,</b> theological reasoning and Church tradition. The development of Mariology is ongoing and since the beginnings it has continued to be shaped by theological analyses, writings of saints, and papal statements, e.g. while two Marian dogmas are ancient, the other two were defined in the 19th and 20th centuries; and papal teachings on Mary have continued to appear in recent times.|$|E
25|$|Guru Granth Sahib {{is always}} the focal point in any Gurudwara, being placed in the centre on a raised {{platform}} known as a Takht (throne), while the congregation of devotees sits {{on the floor and}} bow before the Guru as a sign of respect. Guru Granth Sahib is given the greatest respect and honour. Sikhs cover their heads and remove their shoes while in the presence of this <b>sacred</b> <b>scripture,</b> their eternal living Guru. Guru Granth Sahib is normally carried on the head and as a sign of respect, never touched with unwashed hands or put on the floor.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} consequences of the Secular Franciscan charism is that the spiritual formation of the OFS must cater for those whose vocation is, motivated by the dynamic power of the Gospel, to live in secular circumstances.

Therefore, Secular Franciscans should seek to encounter the living and active person of Christ in their brothers and sisters, in <b>Sacred</b> <b>Scripture,</b> in the Church and in liturgical activity. They do this by studying, loving and most of all by living in an integrated way the human and evangelical aspects of their life.|$|E
