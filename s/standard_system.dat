5|$|The Bofors 40 mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun was used {{on almost every}} major warship in the US and UK fleet from about 1943 to 1945. Although a descendant of German, Dutch, and Swedish designs, the Bofors mounts used by the US Navy during World War II had been heavily Americanized to bring the guns up to the standards placed on them by the Navy. This resulted in a gun system set to British standards (now known as the <b>Standard</b> <b>System)</b> with interchangeable ammunition, which simplified the logistics situation for World War II. When coupled with hydraulic couple drives to reduce salt contamination and the Mark 51 director for improved accuracy, the Bofors 40mm gun became a fearsome adversary, accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} French standard until 1799 {{was based}} on a famous artefact called the , which probably dates back to {{the second half of the}} 15th century. It is an elaborate set of nesting weight pieces, with a total metric weight of 12.238kg. The set is now shown in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. The total nominal value of the set is 50 marcs de Troyes or marcs de Paris, a mark being 8ounces. The ounce poids de marc had therefore a metric equivalent of 30.59g. The poids de marc was used as a national French standard for trading, for gold, silver and jewels, and for weighing medicine. It was also used in international communications between scientists. In the time before the French Revolution, the civil pound also played the role of the apothecaries' pound in the French apothecaries' system, which otherwise remained a <b>standard</b> <b>system</b> of the Romance (24 grains per scruple) type.|$|E

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] For its proponents, America's {{voluntary}} <b>standards</b> <b>system</b> is a "best practice" model for innovation policy. Foreign observers however are concerned about possible drawbacks of a <b>standards</b> <b>system</b> that is largely driven by the private sector. There are doubts, especially in Europe and China, whether the American system can balance public and private interests in times of extraordinary national and global challenges to innovation. To assess the merits of these conflicting perceptions, the paper reviews the historical roots of the American voluntary <b>standards</b> <b>system,</b> examines its current defining characteristics, and highlights its strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, a tradition of decentralized local self-government, has given voice to diverse stakeholders in innovation, avoiding the pitfalls of top-down government-centered <b>standards</b> <b>systems.</b> However, a lack of effective coordination of multiple stakeholder strategies tends to constrain effective and open standardization processes, especially {{in the management of}} essential patents and in the timely provision of interoperability standards. To correct these drawbacks of the American <b>standards</b> <b>system,</b> the government has an important role to play as an enabler, coordinator, and, if necessary, an enforcer of {{the rules of the game}} in order to prevent abuse of market power by companies with large accumulated patent portfolios. The paper documents the ups and downs of the Federal Government’s role in standardization, and examines current efforts to establish robust public-private standards development partnerships, focusing on the Smart Grid Interoperability project coordinated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In short, countries that seek to improve their <b>standards</b> <b>systems</b> should study the strengths and weaknesses of the American system. However, persistent differences in economic institutions, levels of development and growth models are bound to limit convergence to a US-Style market-led voluntary <b>standards</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
