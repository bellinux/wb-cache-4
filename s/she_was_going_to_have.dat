25|$|Charwell was {{commissioned}} in April 1803 under Commander Phillip Dumaresq. In early May Charwell {{was in the}} Hamoaze completely rigged and fitted for sea, but was short a crew. Once he had succeeded in forming a crew, Dumaresque sailed her in the Channel. However, by 1 September {{she was back in}} the Hamoaze. She had grounded on some rocks on the French coast. There she had had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her sufficiently that the next incoming tide could lift her. At Plymouth <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some of her copper plates removed to permit inspection of her hull.|$|E
500|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's jockey at the time, C. W. Cascio, said of {{her when}} he raced her at Del Rio, Texas, [...] "I thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to go all out just {{to keep up with}} those big two-year-olds—what with her little enough to run under their bellies." [...] Her last race was at Enid, Oklahoma, and it was a match race against Bob K K, which she won.|$|E
500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, she {{appeared}} as the mystery guest on the December 21, 1952, episode of What's My Line?. [...] After the panelists guessed her identity, she told John Daly {{she was in}} New York for the holidays. [...] She also said that on January 16, 1953, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a recital at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
2500|$|The costumes of the prequel trilogy are purposefully more {{elaborate}} {{than those of}} the original trilogy. Lucas asserts that galactic society in the prequels is much more sophisticated. Commenting on the disparities between the two trilogies, Carrie Fisher mused, [...] "Harrison Ford wears the same outfit for three flicks, and I was complaining that I wear, like, six outfits. And my mother – Natalie Portman – she wears three million. She walks through a doorway and there's another outfit. It's like the Liberace of sci-fi changing of clothes." [...] Trisha Biggar reveals that originally there were only three costumes planned for Amidala in The Phantom Menace, but [...] " [...] decided that every time we saw [...] <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a different costume." [...] Lucas explains, [...] "Someone of that stature would automatically be changing their costumes to fit the occasion." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{later in}} December, Kennedy had mounted {{a concerted effort}} to gain support around the state, and had made several trips and {{appearances}} as well. [...] Kennedy's appointment was supported by Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, State Assemblyman Vito Lopez, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch and the New York Post editorial page. [...] She received criticism for not voting in a number of Democratic primaries and general elections since registering in 1988 in New York City and also for not providing details about her political views. Kennedy declined to make disclosures of her financial dealings or other personal matters, stating that she would not release the information publicly unless she was selected by Paterson, at which time she would be subject to the same background checks as all appointees. Kennedy acknowledged that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to prove herself: [...] "Going into politics is something people have asked me about forever. When this opportunity came along, which was sort of unexpected, I thought, `Well, maybe now. How about now?' [...] work twice as hard as anybody else ... I am an unconventional choice ... We're starting to see there are many ways into public life and public service." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write a {{telegram}} {{that she knew}} would bring Crappen headlong--to disinherit her absolutely.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Leanne was created {{as the mother}} of established character Nicole Miller (Sally Martin) in a storyline that saw her come out as bisexual to her family and reveal her relationship with Maia Jeffries (Anna Jullienne). Jennifer Ludlam was offered the role due to what she believed as, [...] "being a certain age, and looking like I could pass for Nicole's mother." [...] Leanne debuted onscreen in April 2010 and Ludlam enjoyed shooting the show due to the outspoken nature of her character. Ludlam was offered a reprisal of the role the following year and she appeared for 5 weeks in recurring role. She made her last appearance on 25 February 2011. Ludlam was offered to reprise the role 3 years later and agreed upon learning <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> [...] "my own arc and be a person." [...] Leanne returned in March 2014, in a more central role that saw her become the receptionist at the hospital. Ludlam found it daunting filming at the reception desk due to its [...] "iconic" [...] nature and having worked with several former actors who played the receptionist role such as Elizabeth McRae (Marj Brasch), Geraldine Brophy (Moira Crombie) and Alison Quigan (Yvonne Jeffries).|$|E
2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E

60|$|Thanks {{to these}} attentions, she {{got through the}} afternoon, went early to bed, and next morning did her lessons with an energy which made Uncle Fritz wish that a new game could be invented every day.
