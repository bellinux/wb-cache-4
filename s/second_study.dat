5|$|A {{fresh look}} at this concept started at ARPA around 1963–64 under the name Hardpoint. This led to the {{construction}} of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The <b>second</b> <b>study,</b> HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E

5|$|In 1987 Nuttin {{published}} his <b>second</b> <b>study,</b> describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 {{with the help}} of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards prices when they were secretly manipulated to match subjects’ birthday dates, thus resulting in a higher chance of purchase. However a <b>second</b> <b>study</b> using birth year as price did not lead to the same result. A study of the liking of products found that participants with high self-esteem liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>second</b> <b>study</b> {{resulted}} in no further movement toward divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) {{in response to}} the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had never}} {{finished}} high school, {{with the help of}} the GI Bill, Rothenberg completed a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1954. He attended graduate school at the University of Chicago, where he was recognized as an argumentative, sometimes abrasive, graduate student with a keen mind. As a graduate student, Rothenberg reviewed W.E.D. Allens Caucasian Battlefields: A History of the Wars on the Turco-Caucasian Border, 1828–1921 (Cambridge University Press, 1953) for Journal of Modern History, He wrote his 1956 masters' thesis entitled General Crook and the Apaches, 1871–1874: the campaign in the Tonto Basin. Rothenberg received his doctorate from the University of Illinois: his 1959 dissertation, Antemurales Christianitatis: then military border in Croatia, 1522–1749, was published in 1960 by the University of Chicago Press, as The Military Border in Croatia, 1522–1749; he followed this with a <b>second</b> <b>study,</b> The Military Border in Croatia, 1750–1888: a study of an imperial institution in 1966, also published by University of Chicago Press.

5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a <b>second</b> <b>study</b> showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Bureau of Ships {{prepared}} two {{feasibility studies}} to explore whether Alaska and Guam could be suitably converted into guided-missile cruisers. The first study involved removing {{all of the}} guns in favor of four different missile systems. At $160million, {{the cost of this}} proposed removal was seen as prohibitive, so a <b>second</b> <b>study</b> was initiated. The study left the forward batteries (the two 12-inch triple turrets and three of the 5-inch dual turrets) unchanged, and added a reduced version of the first plan on the stern of the ship. Even though the proposals would have cost approximately half as much as the first study's plan ($82million), it was still seen as too expensive. As a result, both ships were stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960. Alaska was sold for scrap on 30 June 1960, and Guam on 24 May 1961.|$|E

5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the <b>second</b> <b>study,</b> peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kalacoon research station enabled Beebe to research {{the ecology of the}} surrounding jungle in far more detail than had been possible during his earlier expeditions. Using Kalacoon as his base of operations, Beebe performed a novel type of study: methodically dissecting a small area of jungle, and all of the animals which inhabit it, {{from the top of the}} canopy to below the ground. In a <b>second</b> <b>study,</b> Beebe performed the same task for a much larger area of jungle, approximately a quarter mile (0.4km) square. During his first season at Kalacoon in 1916, Beebe brought back 300 living specimens for the zoo. This time he succeeded at capturing a hoatzin, the bird that he had narrowly missed during his earlier trip to Guiana, although he was unable to keep it alive for the zoo during the trip back to New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the 1827 North Carolina {{hurricane}} is unclear {{in the absence of}} reliable data across the Atlantic Ocean, but it is surmised the storm began as a classic Cape Verde hurricane. On a west-northwest track, the hurricane moved through the Lesser Antilles on August17 and August18, grazing the coastline of Hispaniola the following day. It reached the Turks and Caicos Islands on August20 and the Bahamas on August21, subsequently curving northward east of Florida and South Carolina a few days later. On August25, the storm – thought to have been as strong as Category4 strength on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale – moved ashore along the North Carolina coastline. Its exact landfall point remains unclear, with one study suggesting a landfall along the Outer Banks, and a <b>second</b> <b>study</b> concluding a landfall along the Carolinas border on the basis of surface observations from Wilmington, North Carolina. Nonetheless, the storm then turned northeast and emerged into the Atlantic around Norfolk, Virginia. It grazed the New England coastline before being last documented around Sable Island offshore Nova Scotia on August28.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The <b>second</b> <b>study,</b> also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E
