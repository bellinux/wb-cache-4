5|$|Scully is told by {{the scarred}} man that William is part alien and that she {{is being used to}} raise the child. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses to believe it. While the three are talking, the scarred man quietly slips into William's room with a <b>syringe.</b> Though William's crying alerts the agents, the scarred man manages to sneak out of the room before they reach William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the {{hospital}} and Doggett discovers the man's <b>syringe.</b> The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts the scarred man about his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half-brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that the <b>syringe</b> contained magnetite meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but now they have lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Syringes</b> of {{ephedrine}} {{are usually}} prepared {{ahead of time}} {{in order to reduce the}} time to injection. Commercial pre-filled <b>syringes</b> of ephedrine have been introduced to minimize the amount of waste. Our primary objective was to determine the economic impact of commercial <b>syringes.</b> We hypothesized that costs could be reduced compared to standard <b>syringes.</b> Methods Using data extracted from our medical records system, we retrospectively measured the total dose of ephedrine received per patient in 2013 to estimate the number of administered standard <b>syringes.</b> The proportion of administered standard <b>syringes</b> was calculated as the total number of administered standard <b>syringes</b> divided by the number of delivered ampoules in 2013. Thereafter, we calculated the annual cost difference as the difference between the cost for commercial <b>syringes</b> and the cost for standard <b>syringes.</b> Endpoints were calculated overall and for each operating room. Results At least one dose of ephedrine was given in 19, 422 patients (44, 943 administrations). The overall proportion of administered standard <b>syringes</b> was estimated to 52. 8...|$|R

Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular <b>syringe,</b> attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.|$|E
5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic <b>syringe</b> in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Heparin binds {{positively}} charged electrolytes. In blood gas <b>syringes,</b> electrolyte-balanced heparin {{is used to}} prevent a negative bias in electrolyte concentrations. The potential pre-analytical errors introduced by blood gas <b>syringes</b> are largely unknown. Here, we evaluate electrolyte concentrations in non-anticoagulated blood compared with concentrations measured in electrolyte-balanced blood gas <b>syringes.</b> METHODS: Venous blood was collected into plain tubes. Ionized calcium, potassium, sodium and hydrogen ions were analyzed directly using a blood gas analyzer and the remaining blood was collected into different blood gas <b>syringes</b> in random order: Preset (Becton Dickinson), Monovette (Sarstedt) and Pico 50 - 2 (Radiometer). RESULTS: Ionized calcium and sodium concentrations were significantly lower in blood collected in Becton Dickinson and Sarstedt <b>syringes</b> compared to non-heparinized (NH) blood. The mean bias exceeded biological variation-based total allowable error, which in most cases leads to clinically misleading individual results. In contrast, ionized calcium concentrations in blood collected in Pico 50 - 2 <b>syringes</b> were identical to values obtained from NH blood. Sodium showed a minor, yet statistically significant, bias. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that blood gas <b>syringes</b> now contain electrolyte-balanced heparin, one {{should be aware of}} the fact that these <b>syringes</b> can introduce pre-analytical bias in electrolyte concentrations. The extent of the bias differs between <b>syringes...</b>|$|R

5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a <b>syringe</b> or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a <b>syringe</b> in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although plastic {{arterial}} sampling <b>syringes</b> are now commonly used, {{the effects}} of sample storage time and temperature on blood gas tensions are poorly described for samples with a high oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2) taken with these high density polypropylene <b>syringes.</b> METHODS [...] Two ml samples of tonometered whole blood (PaO 2 86. 7 kPa, PaCO 2 4. 27 kPa) were placed in glass <b>syringes</b> and in three brands of plastic blood gas <b>syringes.</b> The <b>syringes</b> were placed either at room temperature or in iced water and blood gas analysis was performed at baseline and after 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. RESULTS [...] In the first 10 minutes measured PaO 2 in plastic <b>syringes</b> at room temperature fell {{by an average of}} 1. 21 kPa/min; placing the sample on ice reduced the rate of PaO 2 decline to 0. 19 kPa/min. The rate of fall of PaO 2 in glass at room temperature was 0. 49 kPa/min. The changes in PaCO 2 were less dramatic and at room temperature averaged increases of 0. 47 kPa for plastic <b>syringes</b> and 0. 71 kPa for glass <b>syringes</b> over the entire two hour period. These changes in gas tension for plastic <b>syringes</b> would lead to an overestimation of pulmonary shunt measured by the 100 % oxygen technique of 0. 6 % for each minute left at room temperature before analysis. CONCLUSIONS [...] Glass <b>syringes</b> are superior to plastic <b>syringes</b> in preserving samples with a high PaO 2, and prompt and adequate cooling of such samples is essential for accurate blood gas analysis...|$|R

40|$|Many {{people who}} inject drugs (PWID) use <b>syringes</b> with {{detachable}} needles, which have high dead space (HDS). Contaminated HDS blood may substantially {{contribute to the}} transmission of HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), and other blood-borne viruses within this population. Newly designed low dead space (LDS) syringe-needle combinations seek to reduce blood-borne virus transmission among PWID. We evaluated the infectivity of HCV-contaminated residual volumes recovered from two LDS syringe-needle combinations. We tested two different design approaches to reducing the dead space. One added a piston to the plunger; the other reduced the dead space within the needle. The two approaches cannot be combined. Recovery of genotype- 2 a reporter HCV from LDS syringe-needle combinations was compared to recovery from insulin <b>syringes</b> with fixed needles and standard HDS syringe-needle combinations. Recovery of HCV from <b>syringes</b> was determined immediately following their contamination with HCV-spiked plasma, after storage at 22 °C for up to 1 week, or after rinsing with water. Insulin <b>syringes</b> with fixed needles had the lowest proportion of HCV-positive <b>syringes</b> before and after storage. HCV recovery after immediate use ranged from 47 %± 4 % HCV-positive 1 mL insulin <b>syringes</b> with 27 -gauge ½ inch needles to 98 %± 1 % HCV-positive HDS 2 mL <b>syringes</b> with 23 -gauge 1 ¼ inch detachable needles. LDS combinations yielded recoveries ranging from 65 %± 5 % to 93 %± 3 %. Recovery was lower in combinations containing LDS needles than LDS <b>syringes.</b> After 3 days of storage, as much as 6 -fold differences in virus recovery was observed, with HCV recovery being lower in combinations containing LDS needles. Most combinations with detachable needles required multiple rinses to reduce HCV infectivity to undetectable levels whereas a single rinse of insulin <b>syringes</b> was sufficient. Our study, the first to assess the infectivity of HCV in residual volumes of LDS <b>syringes</b> and needles available to PWID, demonstrates that LDS syringe-needle combination still has the greater potential for HCV transmission than insulin <b>syringes</b> with fixed needles. Improved LDS designs {{may be able to}} further reduce HCV recovery, but based on the designed tested, LDS needles and <b>syringes</b> remain intermediate between fixed-needle <b>syringes</b> and HDS combinations in reducing exposure to HCV...|$|R

5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a <b>syringe,</b> and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
