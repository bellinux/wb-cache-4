25|$|For {{practical}} purposes, different {{measures of}} location and dispersion are often compared {{on the basis}} of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the <b>sample</b> <b>median,</b> has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the efficiency of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient than the <b>sample</b> <b>median</b> when data are uncontaminated by data from heavy-tailed distributions or from mixtures of distributions, but less efficient otherwise, and that the efficiency of the <b>sample</b> <b>median</b> is higher than that {{for a wide range of}} distributions. More specifically, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance mean (for large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean—see asymptotic efficiency and references therein.|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{analysis}} {{has long been}} used {{as an indicator of}} water quality. Since the passing of the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, microbial standards have been strictly set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that the public health is protected from bacterial pathogens. The bacteriological quality of water generally deteriorates as it travels from water treatment facilities through the main distribution system and into private plumbing and distribution systems. For example, Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) values typically increase once the water has entered plumbing devices such as beverage vending machines. Upon reaching a private facility, the opportunity for bacterial growth and human contamination is present. In this study used the EPA water quality standards were used as a reference to analyze ice and soda samples collected from local food establishments for the presence of heterotrophic and coliform bacteria. The samples were evaluated with respect to the U. S. drinking water standards as indicators {{of the quality of the}} ice and soda. The study provided important information regarding the quality of the ice and soda dispensed in Las Vegas food establishments. Of the samples analyzed in this study, 33. 3 % of ice samples and 55. 6 % of soda samples exceeded the EPA limits set for heterotrophic bacteria concentration for drinking water. Of the ice samples collected, 72. 2 % were positive for presumptive coliform bacteria presence, and 88. 9 % of the soda samples were positive for presumptive coliform presence. No statistical significance was observed between the concentration of heterotrophic bacteria in ice <b>samples</b> (<b>median</b> = 202 CFU/ml) and soda <b>samples</b> (<b>median</b> = 775 CFU/ml). However, the presumptive coliform bacteria data did show that the soda <b>samples</b> (<b>median</b> = 139 CFU/ml) had a significantly higher concentration when compared to the ice <b>samples</b> (<b>median</b> = 3 CFU/ml). The type of food establishment from which the samples were collected did not have a significant influence on the bacteriological quality of the ice and soda.

40|$|ABSTRACT A small {{fraction}} of the herbicides applied to midwestem crops are lost from fields and either move rapidly to nearby streams via overland (or surface-) runoff, near-surface flow, or subsurface drains (herein called “short flow”) or infiltrate slowly to ground water. Herbicides that enter the slow-moving ground-water system have more time, prior to discharge to streams, to be transformed than herbicides moving with short flow. Hence, ratios of the concentration of herbicide transformation products (TP) to their parent herbicides in ground-water samples tend to be much larger than ratios from shortflow samples. Because of this difference, a simple two-component mixing model can be used to estimate the proportion of herbicides in an unregulated stream that comes from short flow verses ground water. The proportion of atrazine transported to streams from short flow was calculated for samples collected from 25 midwestem streams in fall of 1989 after crop harvest, in spring of 1990 prior to herbicide application, and in early-summer of 1990 during runoff events just after herbicide application. For this calculation, we estimated that the ratio of atrazine TPs (deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine) to atrazine in short flow was 0. 07, and the ratio of atrazine TPs to atrazine in ground water was 1. 0 (the median ratio from 50 ground-water samples collected from near-surface midwestem aquifers in 1992 - 94). The estimated contribution of atrazine to streams from short flow ranged from less than 0 to 100 %. The estimated contributions from short-flow were largest for the postapplication <b>samples</b> (<b>median</b> contribution of 92 %), smallest for the pre-application <b>samples</b> (<b>median</b> contribution of 34 %), and intermediate for the post-harvest <b>samples</b> (<b>median</b> contribution of 66 %). Hence, for two of the three sampling periods, the bulk of atrazine in midwestem streams originates from short flow, but ground water is the dominant source in the pre-application (early spring) samples.

40|$|ObjectiveBicuspid aortic valve, {{the most}} common {{congenital}} cardiac malformation, is caused by fusion of valve cushions {{at the onset of}} valvulogenesis. Although its exact pathogenesis is still unclear, a genetic basis is appearing more and more likely. Search for a potential candidate gene by reviewing semilunar valve morphogenesis led us to the ubiquitin fusion degradation 1 –like gene (UFD 1 L), which is highly expressed in the cardiac outflow tract during embryogenesis. MethodsAortic valves were collected during surgery from 39 patients with bicuspid aortic valve (mean age 56. 8 ± 18. 1 years) and from 38 patients with tricuspid aortic valve (mean age 61. 7 ± 16. 1 years). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed for detection of microdeletion, quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction to measure gene expression, and Western blotting to analyze the amount of UFD 1 L gene product. ResultsNo microdeletion was found in either group in the critical region of chromosome 22 containing the UFD 1 L gene. UFD 1 L gene expression, however, was significantly reduced in bicuspid aortic valve <b>samples</b> (<b>median</b> 787 -fold) relative to tricuspid aortic valve <b>samples</b> (<b>median</b> 10, 887 -fold, P =. 001).
