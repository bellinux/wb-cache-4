50|$|Ferdinand Hurter (1844-1898) and Vero Charles Driffield (1848-1915) were nineteenth-century {{photographic}} {{scientists who}} brought quantitative scientific practice to photography through {{the methods of}} <b>sensitometry</b> and densitometry.|$|E
5000|$|Goldberg {{was best}} known for his {{extensive}} studies in <b>sensitometry</b> summarized in his book Der Aufbau des photographisches Bildes (1922) and the “Goldberg Condition” (Goldberg Bedingung), a design principle for high quality reproduction in two stage, negative-positive photographic processes better known in English as “the gamma rule.” ...|$|E
50|$|Film {{speed is}} the measure of a {{photographic}} film's sensitivity to light, determined by <b>sensitometry</b> and measured on various numerical scales, the most recent being the ISO system. A closely related ISO system is {{used to describe the}} relationship between exposure and output image lightness in digital cameras.|$|E
50|$|The {{reciprocal}} relationship is assumed in most <b>sensitometry,</b> for example when measuring a Hurter and Driffield curve (optical density versus logarithm of total exposure) for a photographic emulsion. Total {{exposure of the}} film or sensor, the product of focal-plane illuminance times exposure time, is measured in lux seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{time over}} which {{development}} takes place, {{and the type}} of developer, affect the relationship between the density of silver in the developed image and the quantity of light. This study is called <b>sensitometry</b> and was pioneered by F Hurter & V C Driffield in the late 19th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sensitometry</b> is the {{scientific}} study of light-sensitive materials, especially photographic film. The study has its origins in the work by Ferdinand Hurter and Vero Charles Driffield (circa 1876) with early black-and-white emulsions. They determined how the density of silver produced varied with the amount of light received, and the method and time of development.|$|E
5000|$|Ansel Adams {{went out}} of his way to give Archer equal credit for the Zone System: [...] "I take this {{opportunity}} to restate that the Zone System is not an invention of mine; it is a codification of the principles of <b>sensitometry,</b> worked out by Fred Archer and myself at the Art Center School in Los Angeles, around 1939-40." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Zone System is a {{photographic}} technique for determining optimal film exposure and development, formulated by Ansel Adams and Fred Archer. Adams described the Zone System as [...] "... not an invention of mine; it is a codification {{of the principles}} of <b>sensitometry,</b> worked out by Fred Archer and myself at the Art Center School in Los Angeles, around 1939-40." ...|$|E
50|$|Goldberg {{patented}} improved {{methods for}} electroplating zinc on iron in 1902 and published numerous technical papers on improved printing techniques, reducing moiré effects in half-tone printing, photoengraving and other topics. In 1910 he became {{well known for}} an improved method for making neutral gelatin wedges (“Goldberg wedge”) that was widely used in <b>sensitometry</b> and the , an instrument that greatly reduced the labor required to measure the characteristic curves of photographic emulsions.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{is based on}} the late 19th century <b>sensitometry</b> studies of Hurter and Driffield. The Zone System provides photographers with a systematic method of precisely defining the relationship between the way they visualize the photographic subject and the final results. Although it originated with black-and-white sheet film, the Zone System is also applicable to roll film, both black-and-white and color, negative and reversal, and to digital photography.|$|E
50|$|Following {{graduate}} school, Jones {{moved to}} Washington D.C., {{where he worked}} for several years as a laboratory assistant at the U.S. Bureau of Standards doing research in photometry, colorimetry, spectro-photometry, spectroscopy, and retinal sensitivity. In 1912, he joined the scientific research staff at Eastman Kodak Company, where he became chief physicist in 1916, a position he continued in until his retirement (Behrens 2009, p. 201). His research at Eastman Kodak generally related {{to the subject of}} <b>sensitometry.</b>|$|E
50|$|The true {{characteristic}} of most photographic emulsions is not actually linear (see <b>sensitometry),</b> {{but it is}} close enough over the exposure range of about 1 second to 1/1000 of a second. Outside of this range, it becomes necessary to increase the exposure from the calculated value to account for this {{characteristic of}} the emulsion. This characteristic is known as reciprocity failure. The film manufacturer's data sheets should be consulted {{to arrive at the}} correction required, as different emulsions have different characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Emanuel Goldberg (עמנואל גולדברג; עמנואל גאָלדבערג; Эмануэль Гольдберг) (born: 31 August 1881; died: 13 September 1970) was an Israeli {{physicist}} and inventor. He {{was born in}} Moscow and moved first to Germany and later to Israel. He described himself as “a chemist by learning, physicist by calling, and a mechanic by birth.” He contributed {{a wide range of}} theoretic and practical advances relating to light and media and was the founding head of Zeiss Ikon, the famous photographic products company in Dresden, Germany. His inventions include microdots, the Kinamo movie camera, the Contax 35 mm camera, a very early search engine, and equipment for <b>sensitometry.</b>|$|E
50|$|Archer {{collaborated with}} Ansel Adams to codify the Zone System, {{which is a}} {{photographic}} technique for determining optimal film exposure and development.

50|$|Variable density (VD) {{recording}} systems {{developed from}} Movietone gradually lost market share to variable area (VA) ones developed from Photophone from the 1940s onwards, {{a process that}} gathered pace as VA-related patents expired. Though both methods are theoretically capable of achieving similar standards of recording, duplication and reproduction, quality control in the lab proved {{to be far more}} critical in the duplication of VD tracks than VA ones: slight errors in printer light settings and <b>sensitometry</b> and densitometry control will affect the signal-to-noise ratio far more on a VD track than on a VA one. For this reason archives have tended to remaster original VD tracks to VA negatives for preservation and the creation of new prints.|$|E

The technique used was to computer model the photographic system and to compare theoretical results to known or measured radiometric values. The two sources used as known targets for radiometric evaluation were the film broadband <b>sensitometry</b> and the lunar disc. From the analysis it appears feasible to attain an accuracy of 10 % or better in radiometric accuracy. This however is contingent on contemporaneously exposing the target and spectral <b>sensitometry...</b>|$|E

40|$|A new stepwedge {{has been}} {{developed}} for bootstrap <b>sensitometry,</b> which is used for determining the characteristic curve of radiographic screen/film systems. Since {{each step of the}} stepwedge is separated by the lead septum, flare generated under one step will not penetrate the region of another step. The metal of the stepwedge can be changed with various materials. Characteristic curves obtained with new stepwedge bootstrap (NSB) and conventional stepwedge bootstrap (CSB) techniques were compared with those obtained for screen/film systems with inverse sqare <b>sensitometry.</b> The inverse square method was used as the reference standard for accuracy. The NSB method provided characteristic curves that agreed well with those obtained using the inverse square method. The slope of the curve in the CSB method was lower than that in the inverse square or NBS method, because of scatter radiation. The shape of the characteristic curve from the NSB method did not vary with the materials of step metals (aluminum and copper). The cumulative error involved when using the bootstrap method is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{research}} uses 0. 45 urn octahedral AgBr emulsion {{to study}} chemically produced silver clusters. Reduction sensitization {{has been carried}} out with DMAB, SnCk, and NaOH. The progress of the reaction has been monitored both with <b>sensitometry</b> and diffuse reflectance spectra of the chemically produced silver clusters. The reflection minimum occurs at about 476 nm, independent of reagent. The absorbency by these clusters, derived from the Kubelka-Munk transform, is related to the concentration of the sensitizing agent. Exposure to light causes a decrease in the absorbency by these silver clusters, indicating that some of the silver clusters are hole traps. However, these silver clusters cannot be completely photobleached ~ indicating some of them may be electron traps...|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} {{feasibility}} of remotely measuring the albedos of terrestrial surfaces from photographic images, an inquiry was carried out at ground level using several representative common surface targets. Problems of making such measurements with a spectrally selective sensor, such as photographic film, have been compared to previous work utilizing silicon cells. Two photographic approaches have been developed: a multispectral method which utilizes two or three photographic images made through conventional multispectral filters and a single shot method which utilizes the broad spectral sensitivity {{of black and white}} infrared film. <b>Sensitometry</b> related to the methods substitutes a Log Albedo scale for the conventional Log Exposure for creating characteristic curves.

30|$|In this study, a Catphan 504 phantom (The Phantom Laboratory, Salem, NY, USA) {{was used}} to perform all image quality tests. It is a {{cylindrical}} phantom of 20 -cm length and 20 -cm diameter, containing several test modules: a solid image uniformity module (CTP 486), a 21 -line pair and point source high resolution module (CTP 528), a module for slice width, <b>sensitometry</b> and pixel size evaluation (CTP 401), and a low-contrast module (CTP 515). In particular, the low contrast CTP 515 module contains two sub-regions: the supraslice region with three groups of low-contrast objects, consisting of nine circular objects with diameters {{in the range of}} 2 – 15  mm and contrast of 0.3 %, 0.5 % and 1.0 %, respectively, and a subslice region with three groups of four circular objects each (diameters in the range of 3 – 9  mm, contrast of 1.0 %).|$|E
40|$|Green {{plant tissue}} {{should not be}} {{considered}} as having a uniguely high near-infrared reflectance but rather a low visual reflectance. Leaf tissue without chloroplasts appears to reflect well both visual and near infrared wavelengths. The <b>sensitometry</b> of color infrared film is such that a spectral imbalance strongly favoring infrared reflection is necessary to yield a red record. It is the absorption of visual light by chlorophyll that creates the imbalance that makes the typical red record for plants possible. Reflectance measurements of leaves that have been chemically blanched or which have gone into natural chloride decline strongly suggests that it is the rise in the visual reflectance that is most important in removing the imbalance and degrading the red CIR record. The role of water in leaves appears to be that of rendering epidermal membranes translucent so that the underlying chlorophyll controls the reflection rather than the leaf surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{two-step process}} for the {{formation}} of sensitivity centers different from earlier described two-step processes was found for sulfur sensitized emulsions. After deposition of sulfur in the first step, {{it was found that the}} second step does not consist of rearrangement of sulfur over the surface, but of the supply of silver interstitial ions towards the deposited sulfur clusters. The two processes could be separated by adsorbing and desorbing TAI (4 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 3 a, 7 -tetraazaindene) at/from the silver halide surface. When 1. 5 mmol TAI/mol Ag is added before the sulfur reaction, the silver interstitials are immobilized but sulfur still can be deposited at the same level. By lowering the pH to 2. 50 after this sulfur reaction, TAI is desorbed from the surface and the released interstitials then cause a restoration of the properties of a sulfur system without TAI. These effects could be demonstrated via diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), <b>sensitometry</b> and dielectric loss measurements. We could also confirm the isolation of silver sulfide clusters by TAI from other chemicals in the solution, by adsorption of TAI on the clusters...|$|E
40|$|Three {{medium speed}} screen-type medical x-ray films were exposed and {{manually}} processed {{in accordance with}} the procedures outlined in A. N. S. I. Standard PH- 2. 9, 2 ̆ 2 <b>Sensitometry</b> of Medical X-Ray Films 2 ̆ 2. Subsequent to processing, all samples were evaluated upon the response variables of base plus fog density, maximum density, A. N. S. I. speed, and A. N. S. I. contrast. A second set of film samples, exposed identically to the manually processed samples, were processed in a ninety-second cycle automated system. After sensitometric evaluation of the automated samples, a statistical comparison of the results obtained by both processing procedures was executed. In {{the second phase of the}} investigation, a factorial experiment was executed in an attempt to generate a mathematical model for the sensitometric responses of the films under test to manual processing with metol - hydroquinone developer formulations. Based upon the data yielded from the factorial experiment, several optimized developer formulas and manual processing procedures were devised in an attempt to more closely approximate the results achieved with automated processing of the films utilized in the experiment...|$|E
40|$|Development {{adjacency}} {{effects and}} optical spread in photographic systems cause difficulties in predicting small-scale densities. These {{effects can be}} quantified as spread functions. The optical spread func tion describes the light scatter of the film. The chemical spread func tion describes the lateral diffusion of development- inhibiting and dev elopment-accelerating reaction products. These spread functions can be used along with the <b>sensitometry</b> and covering power relationships of the system to predict small-area densities from the object exposure profile. A study based on C. N. Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s work was undertaken to develop a math ematical model that uses the optical and chemical spread functions to predict small-area densities of an image from the original object ex posure profile. This model was developed for a fine-grain aerial dup licating film processed in KODAK D- 76 (1 : 4). It {{was found that the}} model predicted the image profile of a log-periodic target to within 0. 02 D on the peaks of the bars. However, the model overshot the edges of the bars by about - 0. 0 D. This difference, even though significantly greater than the experimental error, does not affect the usefulness of this model to image quality studies...|$|E
40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 60 The {{atmospheric}} {{transmission and}} airlight in three spectral bands {{as a function}} of an angle off nadir were calculated from radiometric measurements with cameras and film for a particular solar irradiance and atmosphere; the sun zenith angle was 49 °, the airpaths were from 15, 000 ft m. s. l. to the surface at 1, 900 ft on a clear day in Tucson, Arizona, and the azimuth was into the sun. The three spectral bands had peak transmissions at 430 nm (blue), 530 nm (green), and 800 nm (infrared). The statistics derived from numerous measurements show that a standard deviation of 2 % can be attained in the relative radiances read out of multiband photography obtained with calibrated cameras and processed with carefully controlled <b>sensitometry.</b> In the blue and green bands, the atmospheric effect on contrast {{as a function of}} an angle off nadir became statistically noticeable at about 35 ° and 50 °, respectively. The standard deviations of the relative radiances measured in the blue and green bands were 3 % and 2 %, respectively. The effect in the infrared band probably became significant at even larger angles; greater inaccuracy in the infrared band data precludes a more definitive statement.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the sensitometric characteristics of Ultraspeed, Ektaspeed Plus and Insight dental radiographic films using manual and automatic processing systems. METHODS: In this experimental invitro study, an aluminum step-wedge was used to construct characteristic curves for D-, E- and F-speed radiographic films (Kodak Eastman, Rochester, USA). All films were processed in Iranian processing solution (chemical industries Co., Iran, Tehran) both manually and automatically in a period of six days. Unexposed films of three types were processed manually and automatically to determine base plus fog density. Speed and film contrast were measured according to International Standard Organization definition. RESULTS: There was significant difference in density obtained with the D-, E- and F-speed films in both manually and automatically processing systems (P < 0. 001). There was significant difference in density obtained with the Ultraspeed and insight films. There was no significant difference in contrast obtained with the D-, E- and F-speed films in both manually and automatically processing systems (P = 0. 255, P = 0. 260). There was significant difference in speed obtained with the D-, E- and F-speed films in both manually and automatically processing systems (P = 0. 034, P = 0. 040). CONCLUSIONS: The choice of processing system can affect radiographic characteristics. The F-speed film processed in automatic system has greater speed in comparison with manual processing system, and it provides a further reduction in radiation exposure without detriment to image quality.
