5000|$|The lead {{organization}} for the International Year was UNESCO. There was a logic to this, in that UNESCO is the United Nations organization dealing with education, and also in that the constitutional mandate of UNESCO involves the encouragement of a global culture of peace.

Members of the Taskforce included: David Adams (Chair), Enzo Fazzino, [...] Di Bretherton, Katherine Stoessel, Zeynep Varoglu [...] and Jan Visser.|$|R

5000|$|The building, {{under the}} {{provisional}} name [...] "Centre Administratif Europe", {{was designed by}} Lucien De Vestel, in association with Jean Gilson (Groupe Alpha), André & Jean Polak and with {{the recommendations of the}} engineer Joris Schmidt. It was directly inspired by the 1958 <b>secretariat</b> building of <b>UNESCO</b> in Paris (which was designed by Marcel Breuer, Pier Luigi Nervi and Bernard Zehrfuss). The technical design was ground breaking at the time and generated an enthusiastic response from one particular Brussels journal: [...] "This design concept reflects both the 20th century innovative spirit and sheer audacity and brings to mind the astonishing civil engineering arrow at the 1958 exhibition."

50|$|Greek archaeologists led by Jean-Yves Empereur re-discovered the {{physical}} {{remains of the}} lighthouse in late 1994 {{on the floor of}} Alexandria's Eastern Harbour. Some of these remains were brought up and were lying at the harbour on public view at the end of 1995. A Nova program chronicled the discovery. Subsequent satellite imaging has revealed further remains. It is possible to go diving and see the ruins. The <b>secretariat</b> of the <b>UNESCO</b> Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage are currently working with the Government of Egypt on an initiative to add the Bay of Alexandria (to include remains of the lighthouse) on a World Heritage List of submerged cultural sites.|$|R

50|$|The Buenavista Protected Landscape is a {{conservation}} area and an archaeological site located on Bondoc Peninsula {{in the southern}} Luzon province of Quezon in the Philippines. It conserves an important watershed area composed of secondary-growth forest, grassland and coconut land in the rural village of Buenavista within the coastal municipality of Mulanay. The area was primarily set aside for watershed protection and timber production in 1937 covering approximately 356 ha. In 2000, it was reestablished as a protected landscape area under the National Integrated Protected Areas System. The area {{is known as the}} site of an ancient village containing unique limestone graves discovered in 2011. The protected area, including the limestone tombs of Kamhantik were recommended by various scholars {{to be included in the}} tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, yet no government or private entities have yet to file a tentative nomination to the <b>UNESCO</b> <b>Secretariat.</b>|$|R
40|$|When United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was {{established}} {{by the end of}} 1945, Joseph Needham (1900 - 1995) and some progressive scientists were recruited to build the Natural Sciences Department. Needham was supported by Julian Huxley (1887 - 1975), the first Director general, also issued from the social relations of Science Movement of the 1930 s. Needham’s agenda was a complete re-foundation of the international scientific relations, applying in particular a ‘Periphery Principle’, according to which UNESCO’s priority was to be turned towards the countries which needed the most a scientific development. Such a principle opened a space within <b>UNESCO’s</b> <b>Secretariat</b> for scientists coming from Latin America, India or China, a conscious political geographically-oriented action. This principle also lead UNESCO to attempt the creation of an international research institute in the Amazon Region; to establish a Field Scientific Co-operation Office (firstly in Rio, afterwards in Montevideo); and finally to organize in Montevideo (September 1948) the first Latin American Conference for the Development and the Organization of Science (LACDOS) ...|$|R
40|$|The Guidelines for Quality Provision in Cross-Border Higher Education were {{developed}} and adopted {{to support and}} encourage international cooperation and enhance {{the understanding of the}} importance of quality provision in cross-border higher education. The purposes of the Guidelines are to protect students and other stakeholders from low-quality provision and disreputable providers (that is, degree and accreditation mills) as well as to encourage the development of quality cross-border higher education that meets human, social, economic and cultural needs. The Guidelines are not legally binding and member countries are expected to implement them as appropriate in their national context. Based on a survey about the main recommendations of the Guidelines, this report monitors the extent to which OECD countries and a few non-member countries comply with its recommendations. The Survey was sent out in June 2010 to all OECD countries. The Secretariat has also collaborated with the <b>UNESCO</b> <b>Secretariat</b> to have the questionnaire sent to all UNESCO non-OECD country delegations. Twenty-three responses were obtained from 22 Members: Australia, Austria, Belgium (Flemish and French communities), Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Netherlands, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States; and 9 non-Members: Bulgaria, Colombia, Fiji, Indonesia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Oman, Rwanda. Government representatives were asked to co-ordinate with the other stakeholders covered to answer the survey. The main conclusion of the survey is that (responding) countries report a high level of compliance with the Guidelines recommendations. On average, responding OECD countries conform to 72 % of the main recommendations made to governments, tertiary education institutions, and quality assurance and accreditation agencies. The level of compliance decreases to 67 % when recommendations to student bodies are included, but the level of missing information, and thus uncertainty about actual compliance, increases significantly...|$|R
