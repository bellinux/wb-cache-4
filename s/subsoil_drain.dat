50|$|Within the Carbonera Creek {{watershed}} {{is one of}} {{the three}} known Maritime Coast Range Ponderosa Pine forests, a rare assemblage of vegetation narrowly restricted to sandy, infertile Zayante soils formed over Santa Margarita Sandstone. This habitat is only found in coastal Santa Cruz County and is found {{in a part of the}} Carbonera Creek catchment in the southwestern part of the City of Scotts Valley on the slopes of Mount Hermon, extending to the south. The surface soil and <b>subsoil</b> <b>drain</b> very rapidly and do not retain enough water to support local climax species such as Coast redwood or Douglas fir. The Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) withstands the stresses of this xeric habitat and typifies the open plant community, which also supports rare species of flora such as the Bonny Doon manzanita (also called the silver-leaved manzanita) (Arctostaphylos silvicola) and the endangered Ben Lomond wallflower (Erysimum teretifolium). There are two Federally listed endangered species of insects within this sparse forest.|$|E

50|$|The {{acquisition}} of a former apple orchard and horse ranch {{just north of the}} winery in 2009 allowed Benovia to plant an additional 18 acre of vines. To encourage soil uniformity, the winery installed a network of <b>subsoil</b> <b>drains</b> in 2008. After a site evaluation, Benovia chose to plant with a high-density vine count; planting vines four feet apart with 5 ft rows. The winery chose to plant 21.3 acre of Pinot noir on devigorated rootstock (420A) with a diverse clonal mix. Benovia also planted abbr=on 6 acre with an heirloom clone of Chardonnay chosen for its low yields and concentrated flavors. Benovia is also experimenting with abbr=on 1.5 acre of white Rhone varietals (Viognier and Roussanne).|$|R

When this field is subject to uniform irrigation, a free boundary forms in the porous region above the zone of saturation.

40|$|Leaching and {{reclamation}} of saline sodic clay soils, particularly where montmorillonite is {{the dominant}} mineral, is technically difficult and expensive. When water is applied, the clay peds swell rapidly, destroying the macropores which provide the primary drainage pathways. The hydraulic conductivity of the fully saturated soil is usually very low and drainage cannot be provided at economic spacing. In such circumstances leaching and reclamation can take {{months or even years}} to complete. Restructuring the soil into smaller aggregates by intensive mechanical <b>subsoiling</b> can increases <b>drain</b> spacing by increasing the clay's hydraulic conductivity by artificial means. Investigation into the literature has shown a lack of research into the effect of leaching on the physical and chemical properties of restructured saline-sodic clay soils. Studies have therefore been performed in order to provide {{a better understanding of the}} behavior of saline-sodic clays after restructuring and during leaching...|$|R
40|$|During the 1980 s the {{management}} and nutrient requirements of Stylosanthes in pastures and cropping systems were investigated at several ILCA research sites in northern Nigeria. While Stylosanthes guianensis cv Cook and cv Schofield responded to phosphorus (P), Stylosanthes hamata cv Verano did so to a lesser extent. Results from nutrient omission trials showed that the soils of one specific experimental area were deficient {{in most of the}} essential nutrients. Application of Kanwa (a local mineral salt) of up to 100 kg/ha on old and newly established Verano stylo increased dry mater (DM) yield significantly. Good growth of Stylosanthes capitata was associated with low pH and calcium, but high levels of organic carbon and total nitrogen (N) in the top soil.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the suitability of a laboratory vane apparatus, a cone penetrometer as well as a shear vane tester and a pocket penetrometer for determination of the parameters of the undrained shear strength of fly ash from the Power Plant “Skawina”. The suitability of the cone penetrometer and the laboratory vane apparatus for the determination of the undrained shear strength of the fly ash has been shown. On the bases of the obtained test results,, drained and undrained shear strengths of the subsoil made of the fly ash under the square pad foundation were calculated according to Eurocode 7. The calculations of the ultimate resistance of the <b>drained</b> <b>subsoil</b> showed that it was several times bigger than its value in undrained conditions. This confirms the need for the proper determination of the angle of internal friction and cohesion as well as the undrained shear strength of fly ashes...|$|R
40|$|Perth is {{a rapidly}} growing city {{and the demand for}} urban land has been {{steadily}} increasing over recent years (D. P. I., 2011) and the meeting of environmental legislations for storm-water management and floodplain strategic management is the kernel around which a variety of skills and deep speculation revolves. Technological advancement and multi-variable calculus have made possible the ability to predict how a given artefact will behave according to a defined series of variables in the environment within which the apparatus is expected to perform its duty. This is to introduce the key role that modelling resembles within the design process. In geological terms, it is known with deposition that Perth is accommodated over a rather variegated spectrum of soil types that ranges from sand, silt, clayey sand and clay. Due to this multi-faceted nature there are no standard design guidelines for subsoil drainage systems at date. A calibrated mathematical model can readily facilitate the design process and decision making thanks to its ability to provide groundwater mounding height values for environments with different physical and hydrogeological characteristics. Subsoil drainage is used throughout the world to control shallow groundwater levels to facilitate land use in both agricultural and urban development. The term subsoil implies that a buried pipe is used as opposed to an open drain, usually where land values are high. The primary mechanism by which subsoil drainage functions is the provision of an outlet from a slotted pipe system such that groundwater can flow by gravity, according to Darcy’s law, towards the pipe thus lowering groundwater levels. Subsoil drainage is usually constructed in parallel or sub-parallel lines, so that the water table mounds between the parallel drainage lines. Critical parameters determining whether a subsoil drainage system operates as intended are: the soil permeability, the volume of water to be drained in unit time and drain spacing. On the Swan Coastal Plain subsoil drainage has been used in urban developments where the water table has been shallow for decades, generally with success owing to the characteristically sandy soils and the relatively low rainfall in the South West of Western Australia. This paper describes a subsoil drainage experimental site in the City of Armadale, instrumented to monitor water table mounding between a set of parallel <b>subsoil</b> <b>drains</b> in imported sand fill in 2009 and 2010. The paper describes the data collected together with application of a suitable model to represent the relevant components of water flux, and an application of that model to design the subsoil drainage systems on the Swan Coastal Plain. It is the contention of this paper that a properly designed and calibrated model is to foresee the rise and decline of the perched water table under a given set of environmental conditions. Doing so, {{it will be possible to}} implement the Best Practice Technique (BPT) while addressing the need to avoid the oversizing of sand-fill requirements and consequent levitation of capital budget, maximise the security of assets and obviate the violation of buildings’ structural integrity. In terms of literature review, it has been deliberately decided to report references that are relevant to the Western Australia scenario solely: this is justified by the unique morpho-geological arrangement of the Swan Coastal Plain; in fact, overseas regulators for urban development may enforce building codes, approval schemes and land sub-divisional requirements that are not parallel to the Australian decisional criteria for such practices...|$|R
40|$|On-site {{research}} {{was carried out}} in Ireland to assess and compare the treatment capabilities of freely <b>draining</b> <b>subsoils</b> receiving both septic tank and secondary effluents in tandem with a treatment assessment of a horizontal subsurface-flow reed bed. This is due to recent concern being expressed as to whether a sufficient level of treatment is being achieved in the subsoil?s vadose zone coupled with doubts being raised as to the treatment capabilities of horizontal flow reed beds as stand-alone secondary treatment systems. Results over an 18 -month period have shown the reed bed to remove only 52 % of the organic load but achieve 2 - 3 log removal in total coliforms and E. coli. The majority of nitrification is seen to occur in the first 0. 3 m of subsoil for all sets of percolation trenches and, coupled with poor denitrification throughout the subsoil, has compromised groundwater quality in the form of nitrate infiltration. The research also shows that in general the septic tank effluent has received a comparable quality to the secondary effluent in terms of E. coli by the time the point of discharge to groundwater is reached in the subsoil...|$|R
40|$|Application of vacuum {{assisted}} preloading is an imperative method when {{a considerable}} load {{is required to}} meet the desired rate of settlement {{and an increase in}} the undrained shear strength upon consolidation. Moreover, where lateral displacements {{at the edge of a}} coastal embankment need to be controlled, application of vacuum pressure with a cut off offers the optimum solution. To facilitate vacuum propagation, vertical drains are usually employed in conjunction. The installation of vertical drains using a steel mandrel creates significant remoulding of the <b>subsoil</b> surrounding the <b>drains</b> thereby, reducing soil permeability and adversely affecting the soil consolidation process. In this paper, the simulation of vacuum assisted consolidation using the spectral method and finite element analysis is carried out. Subsequently, the 2 D and 3 D numerical multi-drain analyses are conducted to predict the excess pore pressures, lateral and vertical displacements. The performance of two selected case histories at the sites of Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thailand and Tianjin Port, China are discussed and analysed. The numerical predictions are then compared with the available field data. Finally, a procedure for the design of vertical drains is presente...|$|R

Introduction: The best {{location}} for strawberries is an East slope with soil {{of a strong}} loam and a cool well <b>drained</b> <b>subsoil,</b> but they will flourish on {{a great variety of}} soils. They should never be planted on dry sand, chalk, or dry gravel, but in some instances they will flourish on a gravel which has a mixture of clay. The soil should be prepared as for other fruit, by extra deep cultivation. It is best to plow deep and subsoil with subsoiling plow. Then it should be thoroughly pulverized, leveled and rolled. The land should be perfectly clean and in good condition. It is best to put on a heavy coat of manure, which should be thoroughly mixed with soil before the plants are put out. The time for setting out plants in Kansas is either in April, or September, but they may be put out any time during the summer months under favorable conditions. The month of April is the best, unless the plants are put out early enough in September to enable them to become established in the soil before winter, otherwise they are liable to be lifted out of the soil by the frost. There are many methods of planting strawberries; some do well in hills, some in wide matted rows, and others do best in narrow matted rows. The different methods must be determined by the kind of soil, the place to be planted and scarcely of the land...|$|R
40|$|For many years, soil {{drainage}} investigators, {{from a practical}} view point, have had to content themselves with expert appraisal of certain direct and indirect soil and environmental characteristics in order to ascertain {{the cause of a}} particular drainage problem. In a great many instances, observations of vegetative composition, topography and general soil type, aided by aerial photography and local experience, give completely adequate information. Normally, derivation of conclusions from such observations is based on well established principles, and the recognition of general broad classes of the cause of mal-drainage conditions. Such classes may be grouped as; (I) where infiltration capacity of a soil is inadequate to deal with the amount of water supplied to the surface, because of topography, abnormal rainfall, or through inherent inability of the soil to transmit water internally, (II) where the groundwater table rises to a height detrimental to vegetative survival and/or soil structure, or where its presence hinders the function of a free <b>draining</b> <b>subsoil,</b> end (III) where a similar situation exists, due to a perched or elevated ground-water table. The allocation of a particular drainage problem to {{one or more of these}} broad classes is not usually difficult, but identification of causal processes within classes presents quite another problem. Often, drainage investigators have been content to evolve general treatments for each class, and, as a basic rule, such procedures have, more often than not, proved reasonably effective. However, with the increasing intensification of pastoral and agricultural farming, the fundamental causes of individual mal-drainage conditions must be positively identified and rectified within the broadly classified groups...|$|R
40|$|Few superintendents {{take into}} {{consideration}} the quality of the water they use for irrigation purposes. Yet, poor quality water weakens the quality of turfgrass. It only takes a few basic tests to identify such a problem. You only have to collect a water sample directly from the sprinklers and send it to a laboratory. The selection of a water source for irrigation purposes should be related to the type and concentration of inherent substances therein dissolved or in suspension. It also depends upon the physical and chemical soil characteristics. Some water sources are pure, but others contain high ratios of salts, microorganisms and other residues. They could directly harm the turfgrass or affect the soil properties and thus cause indirect problems. The major elements that influence the quality of water are: • the total concentration of soluble salts; • the relative proportion of sodium, bicarbonate, calcium and magnesium; • the amount of boron in water. Essentially, all irrigation water sources contain dissolved salts. Many of these salts promote the growth of turfgrass, but some can be phytotoxic. Water quality is based upon the amount of soluble salts it contains. Acceptable quality: the soluble salt concentration is between 100 and 1000 ppm. Unacceptable quality: : the soluble salt concentration is over 2000 ppm. A soluble salt concentration over 2000 ppm can be detrimental to the growth rate of new turf shoots. It is recommended to irrigate turfgrass with a water source containing no more than 800 to 1000 ppm of soluble salts, unless the soil is exceptionally leachy and the <b>subsoil</b> is well <b>drained.</b> The Table below shows an irrigation water classification proposed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The degree of salinity is expressed in terms of electrical conductivity, which is easy to calculate with non-expensive measuring instruments (the more salts in the water, the higher is the conductivity).
