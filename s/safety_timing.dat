Towards this end, motivated by the concepts of state predicate detection and state predicate correction, we identify three types of faulttolerance components, namely, detectors, weak δ-correctors, and strong δ-correctors. We show that any hard-masking program can be decomposed into its fault-intolerant version plus a collection of detectors, and, weak and strong δ-correctors. We argue that such decomposition assists in providing assurance about dependability and time-predictability of embedded systems...|$|E

The paper suggested that due to poor oil personnel experience in Sudan lubricant oil choosing and change shows less effectiveness. The objectives {{of this study are}} to give the condition of maintaining correct time for the motor oil changing and the suitable oil type that helps to optimize lubricant cost and performance for motor engine. For that the process of fixing motor oil type and changing duration is done by using a mathematical model that has a direct relation to economical concepts and machine technical condition. The study used a data of an experimental work done by Honda International Company for an engine oil to fix its duration interval. Also the paper shows that the machine lubricant industry specifications, its general grades and machine manufacturer directions are very confusable.

40|$|Abstract. Providing {{assurance}} that a software system satisfies its critical properties is difficult, {{particularly when the}} system must satisfy many classes of properties, such as <b>safety,</b> fault-tolerance, <b>timing,</b> and security. This paper describes the application of an incremental development and verification approach [13, 14], based on composition and refinement, to an airlock system. Initially, {{a model of the}} basic functional behavior of the system is developed and proved to satisfy a set of safety properties. This basic model is then extended with timing behavior. This timed model is a full refinement of the basic model, and related safety properties are shown to still hold for the timed model. In the third and last step, the timed model is extended with fault handling behavior. This “fault-tolerant” model, a partial refinement of the other two models, is shown to satisfy both weakened versions of the safety properties and additional fault-tolerance properties. ...|$|R
