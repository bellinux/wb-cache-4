Competency-based education began in the early 1970 s in the United States as part of a movement towards accountability in schools. It was influenced both by the 1960 s trend towards individualization and the increasing use of behavioural objectives. Systematic educational objectives had been developed in the late 1940 s and early 1950 s as part of the growing popularization of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, with its cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains (Woodill, 2004) ...|$|R

30|$|Generally, {{we expect}} a firm to build a higher <b>skills</b> <b>inventory</b> by {{training}} apprentices if overage costs are relatively low compared to underage costs, i.e., {{in case of a}} high critical ratio. However, Fig.  3 shows that firms may provide little training despite low overage costs (and thus, a high critical ratio) if they expect future demand to be low, or that firms may provide much training despite high overage costs (and thus, a low critical ratio) if they expect future demand to be high. In fact, we find the optimal level of <b>skills</b> <b>inventory</b> for both, low and high demand expectations, by identifying the x-axis value for a specific critical ratio on the y-axis of the distribution function of skills demand.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Study habit, <b>skill,</b> and {{attitude}} <b>inventories</b> and constructs {{were found to}} rival standardized tests and previous grades as predictors of academic performance, yielding substantial incremental validity in predicting academic performance. This meta-analysis (N = 72, 431, k = 344) examines the construct validity and predictive validity of 10 study skill constructs for college students. We found that study <b>skill</b> <b>inventories</b> and constructs are largely independent of both high school grades and scores on standardized admissions tests but moderately related to various personality constructs; these results are inconsistent with previous theories. Study motivation and study skills exhibit the strongest relationships with both grade point average and grades in individual classes.

Scores on traditional study habit {{and attitude}} inventories are the most predictive of performance, whereas scores on inventories based on the popular depth-of-processing perspective are shown to be least predictive of the examined criteria.

High school preparation consists of activities in which students participated during high school. Post-secondary outcomes relate to {{the current status of}} students following high school graduation in relation to the four major outcomes areas: (a) post-secondary education, (b) employment, (c) independent living, and (d) recreation and leisure. The target population included all students graduating from one school district in a mid-sized city in Texas. A stratified random sample of 228 students both with and without disabilities was selected. Post-secondary follow-up surveys, consisting of one survey administered prior to graduation and one survey administered six-months following graduation, were given to the participants. The response rate for the initial exit survey was 82. 9 % while the response rate for a post-school survey was 61. 4 %. Differences between groups were analyzed using loglinear analyses based upon educational setting, disability category, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. In addition, a sub-study was completed to determine the level of agreement among students and teachers on a post-secondary readiness <b>skill</b> <b>inventory.</b> The findings indicated that differences among groups did exist in terms of both high school preparation and post-secondary outcomes. In terms of high school preparation, the participation among various groups produced few results that were significantly different. Statistically significant results occurred only with respect to extracurricular activity participation by educational setting and socio-economic status. Post-secondary outcome results produced more statistically significant findings than high school preparation. The variable of educational setting produced statistically significant post-secondary outcomes in the three areas of employment, post-secondary education, and recreation and leisure. Ethnicity was the next largest determinant to influence post-secondary outcomes, and statistically significant results were found for both post-secondary education and independent living. Socio-economic status produced statistically significant results for employment outcomes. The variable of gender produced no results that reached statistical significance.

40|$|The {{conductor}} {{of a large}} instrumental ensemble is constantly confronted {{with the task of}} detecting and correcting rhythm and pitch performance errors in daily rehearsals. The purpose of this investigation was to design a computer-assisted instruction program for error detection skills development and then evaluate this program's effectiveness in training beginning conductors to identify rhythm and pitch errors within 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -voice synthesized music excerpts from the existing band literature. The transfer of error detection skills from synthesized to acoustic sounds also was explored indirectly by virtue of utilizing taped excerpts from wind band performances to assess error detection skills. Subjects (N= 24) in this study were drawn from the pool of undergraduate instrumental music education majors at Ball State University and were randomly assigned to control treatment groups prior to the administration of the Acoustic Error Detection <b>Skills</b> <b>Inventory.</b> Following this pretest, the treatment group used the Computer Error Detection Skills Program for approximately eight hours during an eight week treatment period. At the end of the treatment period, and control and treatment groups were administered the Acoustic Error Detection <b>Skills</b> <b>Inventory</b> posttest. The data were analyzed using a series of one-way, repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) to assess pretest to posttest changes in subjects' scores on the Acoustic Error Detection <b>Skills</b> <b>Inventory.</b> Composite scores (reflecting general skill in error detection) improved significantly for the treatment group (p =. 007), while the pretest to posttest gain for the control group was not statistically significant (p =. 232). These results suggest that the Computer Error Detection Skills Program was effective in enhancing subjects' rhythm and pitch error detection skills and the viability of using synthesized sound sources for training was confirmed.

30|$|To begin with, overage costs {{originate}} from firms training apprentices internally {{that they may}} or may not need in the future. Producing skilled workers requires time and money. If a firm trains too many apprentices, either it is stuck with inventory, thereby facing storage costs such as wage, or it encounters trained apprentices leaving (Cappelli 2008). Therefore, if firms overshoot demand, they face costs of having excess inventory. Since expected costs of a surplus increase monotonically with increasing inventory, we expect a firm’s overage costs to be negatively related to the level of <b>skills</b> <b>inventory</b> held (Backes-Gellner 1996).|$|E

Researchers have found that political skill has significant relationships with constructs such as contextual performance, career satisfaction and leadership. Based on these empirical findings it may be beneficial to include a measure of political skill as part of a selection process. In this study, different methods were explored for measuring political skill that may be appropriate for administrative purposes such as the self-rated questionnaire called the Political <b>Skill</b> <b>Inventory</b> (PSI), a situational judgment test (SJT) and the structured interview. A sample of 100 graduate business students, most of whom had extensive managerial experience, completed the previously mentioned measures in exchange for feedback on their assessments. The participants were subsequently rated on political skill by their coworkers. The only significant association with the coworker scores was the PSI; neither the SJT nor the structured interview showed a significant relationship with the peer ratings of political skill. However, there were unforeseen technical limits to the measures that might explain the negative findings.
