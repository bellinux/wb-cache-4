If I went out for lunch or a coffee, there was always someone who would come over and say, 'We'd love you to stay'. I'm just glad that, in the end, nothing came of it [...] because it wasn't {{something}} I ever asked for." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Smith, [...] "The song {{is about}} hyperventilating—kissing and fainting to the floor." [...] The lyrics were {{inspired}} by a trip with his then-girlfriend (and later wife) Mary Poole to Beachy Head in southern England. Smith said the opening line of the song ("Show me, show me, <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you do that trick") refers to his childhood memories of mastering magic tricks, but added [...] "on another , it's about a seduction trick, from much later in my life".|$|E
500|$|... "Hold It Against Me" [...] {{is three}} minutes and forty-nine seconds long. It is a dance-pop song that blends {{pulsating}} industrial and trance beats with elements of grime. Spears' vocals {{have been described}} as [...] "a bit treated" [...] but not heavily Auto-Tuned. The chorus, reminiscent of other pop productions by Max Martin, has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats. After the second chorus, the beats drop and Spears speaks the lines in the hook. This is followed by a dubstep-influenced breakdown, which lasts about thirty seconds. Spears moans, blows kisses and sings the lines [...] "Gimme something good, don't wanna wait I want it now / Pop it like a hood and <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you work it out." [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] continues with a second breakdown, which is more similar {{to the sound of the}} track. The final chorus has a smattering of rave chords and the song has a sudden end.|$|E

500|$|On 18 May 2011, it was {{announced}} Barber had joined the cast of Neighbours as Rhys Lawson. His casting announcement came as the show lost regular cast member Scott McGregor (Mark Brennan). Barber was appearing in a small guest role in fellow Australian soap opera Home and Away when {{he was given the}} role of Rhys. He began filming his first scenes for Neighbours opposite Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) and Jackie Woodburne (Susan Kennedy) the week before his casting announcement. Of appearing in Neighbours, the actor told Matt Neal of The Warrnambool Standard [...] "I catch myself and have a moment where I realise that I'm working with actors I watched on TV growing up. My first scenes were with Alan and Jackie. It was great to have them there to help out and <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> it's done. I was in safe hands." [...] Barber revealed he loved his character and was looking forward to what was ahead. He made his first on screen appearance as Rhys in July 2011.|$|E

2500|$|NA {{meetings}} usually {{close with}} a circle of the participants, a group hug and a prayer of some sort. Prayers used to close meetings today include the [...] "we" [...] version of the [...] "Serenity Prayer" [...] ("God, Grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, the courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference."); the Third Step Prayer ("Take my will and my life. Guide me in my recovery. <b>Show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to live.") or the [...] "Gratitude Prayer" [...] ("That no addict seeking recovery need ever die. ... My Gratitude speaks when I care and when I share with others the NA way.") ...|$|E

2500|$|George McCready Price was {{important}} in developing flood geology, and while he had limited influence {{at a time when}} all geologists had long accepted an ancient earth, many of his ideas that a young earth could be deduced from science were taken up later. Price was a Seventh-day Adventist, and followed {{one of the founders of}} the church, Ellen White, in seeing fossils as evidence of the Great Flood. In 1906, Price published Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory in which he offered $1000 [...] "to any one who will, in the face of the facts here presented, <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bedi has {{expressed}} strong opinions on {{many aspects of}} modern-day cricket and {{has been described as}} [...] "being jealous of modern day great spinners". In particular, he was a vehement critic of the bowling action of Muttiah Muralitharan ("if Murali doesn't chuck, then <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to bowl") which he bluntly referred to as cheating and likened to a javelin throw and shot putting, saying that Muralitharan would [...] "complete 1000 Test wickets but they would count as mere run-outs in my eyes". He takes a very dim view of chucking, which he calls [...] "a bigger threat than bribing and betting" [...] and claimed in 2004 that many bowlers on the subcontinent chuck, calling Muralitharan a [...] "Sri Lankan bandit closing in on a dream artist called Shane Warne". He has stated, though, that he has nothing personal against Muralitharan, although Muralitharan has threatened to sue him. He levelled the same criticisms against his countryman Harbhajan Singh. Regarding suspect actions in cricket, he said [...] "When a bowler is chucking, he's referred to panels and the home cricket board. Why not do the same for a wide or no-ball, then?". He has accused one-day cricket, modern cricket bats and small grounds of causing a decline in classical spin bowling in India.|$|E

2500|$|RUTH: Yes, sir, I were; I {{were brought}} {{up to be a}} thief. Every soul as I knowed was a thief, and the best thief was the best thought on. Maybe a kid not long born ought to have knowed better. I dunno, I must ha' been born bad, for it seemed right enough to me. Well, it was in prison and out o' prison—three months here and six months there—till I was sixteen. I {{sometimes}} thinks as if they'd bin half as ready to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to go right as they was to punish me for goin' wrong, I might have took the right turnin' and stuck to it afore this. At sixteen I got seven-year for shop-liftin', and was sent out to Port Phillip. I soon got a ticket and tried service and needlework, but no one wouldn't have me; and I got sick and tired of it all, and began to think o' putting an end to it, when I met a smooth-spoken chap—a gentleman, if you please—as wanted to save me from the danger afore me. Well, wot odds? He was a psalm-singing villain, and he soon left me. No need to tell the rest—to such as you it can't be told. I'm 'most as bad as I can be—as bad as I can be! ...|$|E
