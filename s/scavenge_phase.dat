40|$|In {{order to}} {{separate}} the HC-emissions from two-stroke engines into short-circuit losses and emissions due to incomplete combustion, Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) measurements were performed on the exhaust gases just outside the exhaust ports of two engines of different designs. The {{difference between the two}} engines was the design of the transfer channels. One engine had "finger" transfer channels and one had "cup handle" transfer channels. Apart from that they were similar. The engine with "finger" transfer channels was earlier known to give more short-circuiting losses than the other engine, and that behavior was confirmed by these measurements. Generally, the results show that the emission of hydrocarbons has two peaks, one just after exhaust port opening and one late in the <b>scavenging</b> <b>phase.</b> The spectral information shows differences between the two peaks and it can be concluded that the latter peak is due to short-circuiting and the earlier due to incomplete combustion. The flow outside the exhaust port was measured with Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). These measurements confirm the occurrence of two emission peaks...|$|R

Two field campaigns were carried out during the low and the high water period. The results display that the current Syr Daria River sediments quality is influenced by several phenomena seasonally and locally controlled: carbonate precipitation, absorption by phytoplankton, scavenging by clay mineral, upstream ground leaching during the snow melting, various discharges (drainage canals, urban and industrial waste waters), connection with delta lakes during the flooding period and impact of the geochemical background. The study of the solid – liquid partition coefficients emphasizes the contrasted behaviour of trace elements with respect to different <b>scavenging</b> <b>phases.</b> As a result it appears that in spite of the mitigating action of the dam reservoirs, of the irrigated areas, of the overflow lakes and flood plains, the Aral Sea sediments are not completely preserved from the contamination...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of As release and source(s) of As {{has been investigated}} in {{a small part of}} a watershed in the Murshidabad district of West Bengal. Analyses include major ion and trace element concentrations, as well as O, H and S isotope ratios of groundwater, surface water and a thermal spring. The results indicate that all water samples belong to the Ca-HCO 3 type, except for the thermal spring which is of the Na-HCO 3 type. Shallow and deeper groundwaters have distinct hydrochemical features. High As contents were registered only in the deeper groundwater horizon. Factor analysis and the distribution pattern of major and trace elements indicate that As is present in the aquifer as a <b>scavenged</b> <b>phase</b> by Fe(III) {{and to a lesser extent}} by Mn(IV) phases. The release of As into the groundwater occurs gradually in successive stages, corresponding to the actual redox state in the aquifer. The main stage of As release is related to the bacterial reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) (i. e. to the simultaneous dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxides). Low redox conditions in highly polluted areas are indicated by low SO 4 concentration and high delta(34) S values. During bacterial SO 4 reduction, residual SO 4 in groundwater is depleted in the lighter S isotope (S- 32). However, the cause of the gradual decrease of the redox state in the groundwater is still not well understood. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} investigates {{the details of}} mixture preparation and combustion in a two-stroke, small-scale research engine with a numerical methodology based on large eddy simulation (LES) technique. A major motivation to study such small-scale engines is their potential use in applications requiring portable power sources with high power density. The investigated research engine has a rectangular planform with a thickness very close to quenching limits of typical hydrocarbon fuels. As such, the combustor has a high aspect ratio (defined as the ratio of surface area to volume) that makes it different than the conventional engines which typically have small aspect ratios to avoid intense heat losses from the combustor in the bulk flame propagation period. In most other aspects, this engine involves all the main characteristics of traditional reciprocating engines. A previous experimental work has identified some major design problems and demonstrated the feasibility of cyclic combustion in the high aspect ratio combustor. Because {{of the difficulty of}} carrying out experimental studies in such small devices, resolving all flow structures and completely characterizing the flame propagation have been an enormously challenging task. The numerical methodology developed in this work attempts to complement these previous studies by providing a complete evolution of flow variables. Results of the present study demonstrated strengths of the proposed methodology in revealing physical processes occurring in a typical operation of the high aspect ratio combustor. For example, in the <b>scavenging</b> <b>phase,</b> the dominant flow structure is a tumble vortex that forms due to the high velocity reactant jet (premixed) interacting with the walls of the combustor. LES gives the complete evolution of this flow structure, from its beginning to its eventual decay after the scavenging period is over. In addition, LES is able to predict the interaction between the bulk flow at top dead center (TDC) and the turbulent flame propagation. The success of this depends on the ability of the model in predicting turbulent flow structure including its length and velocity scales. Ph. D.

40|$|Heavy metal mobility, {{bioavailability}} and toxicity depends {{largely on}} the chemical form of metals and ultimately determines potential for environmental pollution. For this reason, determining the chemical form of heavy metals and metalloids, immobilized in sludges by biological mediated sulfate reduction, is important to evaluate their mobility and bioavailability. A modified Tessier sequential extraction procedure (SEP), complemented with acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneous extracted metals (SEM) measurements, were applied to determine the partitioning of five heavy metals (defined as Fe, Ni, Zn and Cu, and the metalloid As) in anoxic solid-phase material (ASM) from an anaerobic, sulfate reducing bioreactor into six operationally defined fractions. These fractions were water soluble, exchangeable, bound to carbonates (acid soluble), bound to Fe-Mn oxides (reducible), bound to organic matter and sulfides (oxidizable) and residual. It {{was found that the}} distribution of Fe, Ni, Zn, Cu and As in ASM was strongly influenced by its association with the above solid fractions. The fraction corresponding to organic matter and sulfides appeared {{to be the most important}} <b>scavenging</b> <b>phases</b> of As, Fe, Ni, Zn and Cu in ASM (59. 8 - 86. 7 %). This result was supported by AVS and SEM (Sigma Zn, Ni and Cu) measurements, which indicated that the heavy metals existed overwhelmingly as sulfides in the organic matter and sulfide fraction. A substantial amount of Fe and Ni at 16. 4 and 20. 1 %, respectively, were also present in the carbonate fraction, while an appreciable portion of As (18. 3 %) and Zn (19. 4 %) was bound to Fe-Mn oxides. A significant amount of heavy metals was also associated with the residual fraction, ranging from 2. 1 % for Zn to 18. 8 % for As. Based on the average total extractable heavy metal (TEHM) values, the concentration of heavy metals in the ASM was in the order of Cu > Ni > Zn > Fe > As. If the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals are assumed to be related to their solubility and chemical forms, and that they decrease with each successive extraction step, then the apparent mobility and bioavailability of these five heavy metals in ASM increase in the order of Cu v As v Ni v Fe v Zn. The SEM/AVS ratio was less than one in eight replicate ASM samples, indicating that the ASM was non-toxic with regards to having a low probability of bioavailable metals in the pore water...|$|R
40|$|Variations in {{molybdenum}} isotopic composition, {{spanning the}} range of similar to 2. 3 parts per thousand {{in the terms of}} Mo- 97 /Mo- 95 ratio, have been measured in sediment cores from three lakes in northern Sweden and north-western Russia. These variations have been produced by both isotopically variable input of Mo into the lakes due to Mo isotopic heterogeneity of bedrock in the drainage basins and fractionation in the lake systems due to temporal variations in limnological conditions. Mo isotope abundances of bedrock in the lake drainage basins have been documented by analysis of Mo isotope ratios of a suite of molybdenite occurrences collected in the studied area and of detrital fractions of the lake sediment cores. The median delta Mo- 97 value of the investigated molybdenites is 0. 26 parts per thousand with standard deviation of 0. 43 parts per thousand (n= 19), whereas the median delta Mo- 97 value of detrital sediment fractions from two lakes is - 0. 40 parts per thousand with standard deviation of 0. 36 parts per thousand (n= 15). The isotopic compositiori of Mo in the sediment cores {{has been found to be}} dependent on redox conditions of the water columns and the dominant type of <b>scavenging</b> <b>phases.</b> Hydrous Fe oxides have been shown to be an efficient scavenger of Mo from porewater under oxic conditions. Oxidative precipitation of Fe(II) in the sediments resulted in co-precipitation of Mo and significant authigenic enrichment at the redox boundary. In spite of a pronounced increase in Mo concentration associated with Fe oxides at the redox boundary the isotopic composition of Mo in this zone varies insignificantly, suggesting little or no isotope fractionation during scavenging of Mo by hydrous Fe oxides. In a lake with anoxic bottom water a chironomid-inferred reconstruction of O- 2 conditions in the bottom water through the Holocene indicates that increased O- 2 concentrations are generally associated with low delta Mo- 97 /Mo- 95 values of the sediments, whereas lowered O- 2 contents of the bottom water are accompanied by relatively high delta Mo- 97 /Mo- 95 values, thus confirming the potential of Mo isotope data to be a proxy for redox conditions of overlying waters. However, it is pointed out that other processes including input of isotopically heterogeneous Mo and Mn cycling in the redox-stratified water column can be a primary cause of variations in Mo isotopic compositions of lake sediments...|$|R

40|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} and torque performance {{are two major}} challenges for highly downsized turbocharged engines. However, the inherent characteristics of the turbocharged SI engine such as negative PMEP, knock sensitivity and poor transient performance significantly limit its maximum potential. Conventional ways of improving the problems above normally concentrate solely on the engine side or turbocharger side leaving the exhaust manifold in between ignored. This paper investigates this neglected area by highlighting a novel means of gas exchange process. Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) is an alternative way of accomplishing the gas exchange process in turbocharged engines. The DEP concept engine features two exhaust valves but with separated function. The blow-down valve acts like a traditional turbocharged exhaust valve to evacuate the first portion of the exhaust gas to the turbine. While the scavenge valve feeding the latter portion of the exhaust gas directly into the low resistant exhaust pipe behaves similarly to valves in a naturally aspirated engine. By combining the characteristics of both turbocharged and naturally aspirated engines, high backpressure between the turbine inlet and the exhaust port is maintained in the blowdown phase while significant reduction of the backpressure could be achieved in the latter displacement phase. This is directly beneficial for pumping work and residual gas <b>scavenging.</b> Combustion <b>phasing</b> & stability and turbocharger efficiency could also benefit from such concept. This simulation study was carried out using a validated 1 D model of a highly downsized SI engine. Two degrees of freedom including the lift and {{the duration of the}} scavenge valve were optimized to achieve minimum BSFC.

Model representations of precipitation scavenging vary greatly in their complexity, and most are divorced from the physics of precipitation formation and transformation. Here, we describe a new large-scale precipitation scavenging algorithm, developed for the UCI chemistry-transport model (UCI-CTM), that represents a step toward a more physical treatment of scavenging through improvements {{in the formulation of}} the removal in sub-gridscale cloudy and ambient environments and their overlap within the column as well as ice phase uptake of soluble species. The UCI algorithm doubles the lifetime of HNO 3  in the upper troposphere relative to a scheme with commonly used fractional cloud cover assumptions and ice uptake determined by Henry's Law and provides better agreement with HNO 3  observations. We find that the process of ice <b>phase</b> <b>scavenging</b> of HNO 3  is a critical component of the tropospheric O 3  budget, but that NOx and O 3  mixing ratios are relatively insensitive to large differences in the removal rate.

An important process within hydrothermal plumes is the oxidation of dissolved iron discharged with vent fluids, leading to the co-precipitation of many other vent-sourced metals, thus, modifying gross hydrothermal fluxes to the deep ocean, and acting as a net sink in the ocean chemical budgets of certain key tracers. Here, we report direct measurements of dissolved Fe(II) oxidation rates from two recently discovered Indian Ocean vent sites that are intermediate between Pacific and Atlantic values, thus demonstrating {{that the rate of}} iron oxidation and formation of <b>scavenging</b> Fe(III) solid <b>phases,</b> in hydrothermal plumes varies systematically along the global deep-ocean “conveyor. ?

40|$|The role of {{particles}} for U isotope transport {{was investigated in}} the Kalix River watershed, a particle-poor, Fe/Mn-rich river in northern Sweden, and in the Baltic Sea estuary. Particles > 0. 45 μm are strongly enriched in U and contain 20 - 50 % of the total riverine uranium budget and < 1 % of the total U in brackish waters (3 - 7 PSU). The particles have high δ 234 U which is close to that of dissolved U in the associated water, indicating that U on particles is dominantly nondetrital and isotopically exchanges rapidly with the ambient dissolved U. Particles at the river mouth are dominated by nondetrital Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides. Uranium and Fe are strongly correlated, clearly demonstrating that secondary Fe-oxyhydroxide is the major carrier of U in river water. There is no evidence for significant association of U with Mn-oxyhydroxide. Apparent U distribution coefficients (K̂Fed) were calculated for U between the authigenic Fe on particles and the solution. These values appear to be relatively constant throughout the year. This suggests an equilibrium between Fe in solution and authigenic Fe-oxyhydroxides on detrital particles.

RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modeling System) was used to simulate cloud structures. A model of below-cloud scavenging was evaluated, as well. The determinations made from the results of the scavenging model are the following: a) aerosol vertical profiles are quite important to rainwater concentrations; b) modeled sulfate in rainwater is a better fit to the observed data values than ammonium and nitrate; c) the obtained sulfate aerosol concentrations samples are similar to ones found in the literature, although the sulfate concentrations in rainwater are much lower than other studies in the literature; d) the in-cloud scavenging process dominates, e) our modeled results, using an input gas vertical profile extracted from the ABLE 2 B experimental data set, present a smaller ratio between gas and aerosol scavenging than found in other studies in the literature, other studies may have had larger rainfall times, which increase the importance of gas <b>phase</b> <b>scavenging.</b> Pages: 63 - 7...|$|R

Secondary minerals, such as iron-oxides, are another important <b>phase</b> <b>scavenging</b> metals in the environment. It has often been suggested that bacterial surfaces favor the precipitation of iron-oxide phases. In this study, we demonstrate {{that this is not}} the case. We have mimicked the processes occurring at an oxic interface, which lead to the formation of iron oxides, by introducing progressively a fixed total amount of Fe 2 + ions at a fixed pH of 6. 5 in an aerobic reactor in the absence and in the presence of increasing concentrations of Bacillus subtilis bacterial cells. Alternatively, increasing amounts of Fe 2 + ions were added to a fixed concentration of Anoxybacillus flavithermus bacterial cells. The kinetics of the reaction were monitored by measuring the rate of addition of the base needed to maintain the pH constant. In another set of experiments, we added Fe 2 + ions at once in anaerobic conditions and oxygenated the suspension afterwards. The rate of oxidation of the Fe(II) was then measured directly using the ferrozine colorimetric method. In both types of experiments, it was clearly observed that the kinetics of oxidation of the Fe(II) are dramatically reduced by the presence of the bacterial cells. This is an important result, as the oxidation state and the speciation of the sorbed Fe impact the immobilization by the bacterial-iron composite suspensions of other metals. For instance, we have observed that a given amount of Fe reduces the Cd sorption ability of the cells, and it does this more effectively when it occurs as a sorbed Fe(II) species as when it is precipitated as adhering iron oxide nanoparticles...|$|R

Concentrations in fogwater were also affected by the physical processes of condensation and evaporation. Light, dissipating fogs routinely showed the highest concentrations. The chemistry of urban fog has been modelled using a hybrid kinetic and equilibrium computer code.

The chemical components are formulated in terms of continuity equations for different chemical species in the aqueous phase within the cloud. Their evolution in this model came from {{not only by the}} processes of advection and turbulence transport, but also the chemical reactions and microphysical transfers. The model includes a method of kinetic uptake limitations. Gases with low solubility H* &lt; 10 3 mol dm- 3 atm- 1 are in Henry's law equilibrium with temperature dependence of Henry's law coefficients. Seven pollutant groups are currently included in the chemistry parameterization scheme: S(IV), S(VI), (H 2 O 2 ), (O 3 ), N(V), (NH 3 ), (CO 2 ). The present model contains explicit treatment of SO 2 and O 3 , a kinetic method of gas uptake as well as an improved microphysical parameterization scheme. The primary objective of this model is to study the impact of the deep convection on the pollutant transport, redistribution and deposition. It is done through chemical reactions, oxidation, scavenging of aerosol particles and transfer via microphysical transitions among water categories. Two base run simulation parameters are used to initialize the model. The first model run is for the 6 July 1995 event, characterized by intensive convective cloud activity and a large amount of precipitation, manifested as a flashflood. The second one is related to transboundary dust transport and sulfate wet deposition. The chemical field initialization is based on the vertical distribution profiles of gases and aerosols for continental non-polluted and continental polluted background. The study has revealed the importance of considering interactions between dynamics, microphysics and cloud chemistry. Deep convection in the first analyzed case generates rapid upward and downward transport of pollutants. It stimulates the impact of scavenging processes and microphysical conversions, pollutant redistribution and wet deposition. We find good agreement between calculated and observed rainfall, pH, sulfate concentration and wet deposition, in the second simulated case. Aerosol particles partially dissolved in precipitation changed their qualitative and quantitative features, acidity and increment of all chemical components. A lot of sensitivity tests of the terms included in the chemistry parameterization scheme indicate that assumption of Henry's law equilibrium leads to a factor 2 to 3 underestimate of a soluble gas in cloud water and 3 to 5 in rainwater, respectively. Our calculations demonstrate that assumption of Henry's law leads to a factor of about 1. 0 to 1. 3 overestimation of the integrated sulfur mass removed by wet deposition. Analysis of the relative contribution of some parameters implies that 20 % - 24 % of total sulfur mass deposited belongs to both nucleation and impact <b>scavenging.</b> Liquid <b>phase</b> oxidation contributed 22 % and 28 % of the total sulfur mass deposited for continental non-polluted and continental polluted background, respectively.

The present studies demonstrates that there is adaptive response mechanisms invoked in the absence of vitamin E. The central component of this adaptive mechanism is coenzyme Q and its recycling factors. In our first study, Long Evans hooded weaning rats were fed a diet without vitamin E and Se for six weeks, leading the animals to be deficient in both nutrients (−E −Se). Deficiency was accompanied by a two-fold increase in redox activities associated with transplasma membrane electron transport, an increase in ascorbate and glutathione was found in the liver tissue, increased microsomal, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and an increase of cytosolic Ca 2 +-independent phospholipase A 2. Liver plasma membranes isolated from these rats were more sensitive to lipid peroxidation, although they contained 40 % greater amounts of ubiquinone than the plasma membranes from rats consuming control diets (+E +Se). The incubation of plasma membranes with NAD(P) H resulted in protection against peroxidation, and this effect was more pronounced in −E −Se membranes. In our second study, Long Evans hooded rats were fed a diet without vitamin E. The oxidative stress induced here led to invocation of a sequence of antioxidant defense mechanisms in the liver of vitamin E-deficient animals. This single nutrient deficiency allowed us to characterize a three-phase adaptive response to oxidative stress induced by vitamin E deficiency. Phase one occurred when tocopherol was depleted from membranes and involved increased concentrations and capacity of primary antioxidants, ascorbate and ubiquinol and their recycling enzymatic machinery. The early changes appear to be sufficient to preserve the balance between ROS and defense mechanisms as the rats continued to grow as well as the control during this time period. Phase two was characterized by the onset of oxidative stress and increased activity of radical <b>scavenging</b> antioxidant systems. <b>Phase</b> three was characterized by accumulating concentrations of the product of oxidative stress damage along with the induction of lipid metabolizing enzyme systems. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVertical {{distributions}} of dissolved major redox parameters, Mo and U {{from the water}} to the sediment were sampled in the salinity gradient of the Gironde estuary. In the water, sulfate and Mo are conservatively transported throughout the salinity gradient. In contrast, U shows a significant removal rate of 85 mu mol m(- 2) a(- 1) related to reductive sequestration of U in the anoxic sediment. Early diagenesis is highly transient and characterized by a three-zone regime related to three density layers functioning at different timescales. Excess of sulfate (up to 1 mM) is observed in the soft mud layer and is assigned to sulfide oxidation by both abiotic Mn- and Fe-oxide reduction and bacterial nitrate reduction. During early diagenesis, Mo and U are released in the sediment porewater from Mn- and Fe-oxides. In not-dredged anoxic sediments, authigenic precipitation of Mo and U with iron sulfides is proposed to explain their removal from solution. In contrast, in dredged sediments, authigenic precipitation of U is inhibited probably owing to the less effective reduction of soluble U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) due to oxidizing transient conditions. Mixing of anoxic sediment porewater with oxygenated water, due to (i) cyclical resuspension of the soft mud layer and (ii) dredging operations in the navigation channel, induces addition of dissolved sulfate (produced from diagenetic sulfide oxidation), Mo and U to the water. This addition is equivalent to 2 % (sulfate), 5. 5 % (Mo) and 0. 5 % (U) of the dissolved fluvial inputs into the estuary for the natural resuspension, and 0. 4 % (Mo), less than 0. 2 % (sulfate, U) for dredge-induced resuspension. Addition of dissolved Mo and U, produced by oxidation of sulfide phases in the dredged sediments redeposited in dynamic environments, are equivalent to 12 % (Mo) and 0. 8 % (U) of their respective fluvial inputs. Additional Mo and U inputs into the water originate from diffusive outflow from muddy sediments and are equivalent to 2 % (Mo) and 0. 3 % (U) of their respective fluvial inputs.

This effect was found to be temperature dependent: at lower temperatures, the nitrate and ammonium mass fractions in the residues were higher. Also, the oxidation state of the organic matter in cloud residues was found to be temperature dependent: the O : C ratio was lower at higher temperatures. A possible explanation for this observation is a more effective uptake and/or higher concentrations of low-oxidized water-soluble volatile organic compounds, possibly of biogenic origin, at higher temperatures. Organic nitrates were observed in cloud residuals {{as well as in the}} out-of-cloud aerosol, but no indication of a preferred partitioning of organic nitrates into the aqueous phase or into the gas phase was detected.

Zinc, cadmium and lead are the main contaminants in the study area, either in the processing residues or in the waters that drain the mine site. Contamination of stream waters extends several km downstream of the mine, till the Mediterranean Sea. The mine tailing (MT) materials are the main REE source, with peak concentrations of 300 mg/kg ΣREE. PAAS-normalized patterns of MT are characterized by light REE (LREE) enrichment with respect to heavy REE (HREE). The waters flowing out of the MT heaps are near-neutral (6. 2 to 7. 0 pH), with Zn-sulfate dominant composition, and a mean concentration of 53 μg/l ΣREE. Drainages from MT and an adit flow in the Naracauli stream headwaters (mean 1. 4 μg/l ΣREE). Concentrations of REE in the Naracauli stream decrease dramatically about 400 m downstream of source. The REE decrease matches Fe and Zn decrease in waters, probably because the REE are sorbed on freshly precipitated solid phases. Sorption processes, and/or co-precipitation with secondary phases, appear to control the REE geochemistry in the studied waters under near-neutral conditions. Also, despite the non-acidic environment, it is worth to observe that small changes in pH seem to affect the mobility of REE at Naracauli. The PAAS-normalized REE patterns in the waters generally reflect the PAAS-normalized REE patterns in the solid materials with which the water interacts, either MT or secondary phases such as Fe-hydroxide and bio-hydrozincite. As it is expected in waters under oxidizing conditions, patterns with negative Ce anomalies are developed due to the poor solubility of Ce+ 4 species, and its consequent <b>scavenging</b> in solid <b>phases.</b> However, there is an exception: Ce shows a poor affinity for the bio-hydrozincite mineral, probably reflecting the role of bacteria in the precipitation of the Naracauli hydrozincite...|$|R
