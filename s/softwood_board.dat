40|$|A dual-scale {{modeling}} {{approach is}} proposed {{to describe the}} coupling of the drier (large-scale) and the porous medium (macroscale) throughout drying. This model is used to investigate the vacuum drying of a <b>softwood</b> <b>board</b> placed in an experimental vacuum chamber that is heated by two infrared (IR) emitters. The large-scale model provides important information for the drying engineer to assess and tune {{the performance of the}} drier. This model allows simulation of the chamber wall and IR emitter temperature evolution, together with changes in the chamber vapor, air, and water mass balances. The comprehensive two-dimensional drying model known as TransPore is used to determine the heat and mass transfer occurring at the macroscale of the board. Finally, four case studies are presented to elucidate the intricate coupling that exists between the chamber technical specifications and the drying behavior of the porous medium. A highlight of the dual-scale model is its ability to predict the condensation on the walls of a poorly insulated vacuum chamber for the case of a weak pump...|$|E
40|$|The {{anisotropy}} of wood complicates {{solution of}} heat and mass transfer problems that require analyses be based on fundamental material properties of the wood structure. Most heat transfer models use average thermal properties across either the radial or tangential direction and do not differentiate the effects of cellular alignment. earlywood/latewood differences, or ring orientation. A model that considers these basic structural characteristics would be more accurate than most models in the literature. which do not consider the anatomical structure of wood. The two-dimensional finite element model descibed here was developed to determine the effective thermal conductivity {{as a function of}} cell alignment and cell porosity by modeling the softwood cell structure in either a pure radial or pure tangential orientation. This paper presents the results predicted from the cellular model, from which a new nonlinear regression equation for radial or tangential effective thermal conductivities is determined as a function of density (porosity). The results will be applied to a two-dimensional <b>softwood</b> <b>board</b> model for transient thermal analysis (Part II). Subsequent papers in this series apply and adapt this model to various lumber orientation and sires and to wood at various moisture contents (Part III and IV...|$|E
40|$|Seasoned <b>softwood</b> <b>board</b> {{exposed to}} {{in-service}} moisture variations {{is subject to}} dimensional changes and distortions. In-service dimensional instability of a board is a critical issue since it causes serious problems in buildings and other engineering structures. This thesis presents research involving the development of numerical models to describe the in-service changes in dimension, at a board scale, for small variations in the moisture content. The models used input data defining {{the properties of the}} microstructural components that make up the cellular structure of the wood resulting in the cells having heterogeneous anisotropic properties. The application of full cyclic constraint to the boundaries of the elements that made up the representative volume element was investigated and used to determine the equivalent homogenised properties. A cellular model was developed to describe the behaviour of the wood as a function of density, microfibril angle, spiral grain angle and moisture content. The resultant finite element board models used a database generated from the cellular model to describe the dimensional changes associated with small in-service changes in moisture content. In conjunction with the development of this model the candidate carried out an experimental programme using a specific supplied pinus radiata log. The determination of the cellular shrinkage/swelling coefficients, using an experimental technique developed for this research, verified the accuracy of the homogenization method and its subsequent application to the cellular model. The results from the sawn boards were compared with the results from the finite element board models...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScFor (Forest and Wood Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Producing {{high quality}} end products, rather than {{focusing}} on volume production, is slowly but surely becoming the main driving force in the wood processing industry of South Africa. Drying defects such as surface checks and discolouration by yellow stain and kiln brown stain are major factors in softwood timber downgrades when selecting furniture grade timber. Previous efforts to control these defects have focused on schedule adaptation, but as the industry is still mainly concerned with volume production, and because of the varying lumber price, longer schedules to control these drying defects have not yet been that attractive for the larger sawmills. In ongoing research in this laboratory, a dip treatment of freshly sawn <b>softwood</b> <b>boards</b> in an aqueous solution containing a surfactant called sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) was used to try to influence the mechanism involved in the development of these stains. Further, complementary research is reported in this study. Firstly, the possibility of using SLS solutions to control surface mould development and bluestain was investigated. Results showed that SLS did control the development of blue stain and mould growth in open-stacked boards for up to three weeks, using concentrations as low as 0. 1 %, and up to two weeks in closed-stacked timber when using concentrations of 0. 2 %. Secondly, it was investigated whether SLS treatment would have a detrimental effect on downstream product quality; in particular, kiln dried boards and glued components for furniture manufacturing. Since SLS influenced fluid water flow during kiln drying, the treatment could have exacerbated the occurrence of surface checking due to altered moisture distribution profiles. Results of this investigation showed that the SLS treatment did not result in increased surface checking. Thirdly, as furniture quality timber treated with SLS would be glued, (and also finished with surface coatings), it was further considered important to determine if SLS treatment influenced adhesion properties of wood surfaces. Based on shear test results, it was established that SLS did not influence the adhesion properties of wood when glued with two most commonly used glues in the furniture industry i. e. polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) and urea formaldehyde (UF) ...|$|R
40|$|Classifying {{logs and}} boards has an {{essential}} economic {{impact on the}} forest products industry. In a modern production chain, quality control and raw material specifications are essential to fulfill production system demands as well as end user demands. The subject of the thesis is automatic grading of wood represented by its appearance {{in various stages of}} decomposition of a tree, i. e. as logs, boards, components or individual surface objects often labelled as defects. The main method used is based on multivariate measurements and data compression by means of principal component analysis (PCA) and prediction modelling with projections to latent structures (PLS). The thesis adresses mainly feature identification and feature extraction of properties that have an impact on automatic grading of sawn <b>softwood</b> <b>boards.</b> The features are modelled by means of their appearance in the multivariate image space obtained by scanning and integrating images utilizing different imaging sensors. The main goals of this thesis are: to introduce multivariate image analysis (MIA) and multivariate image projections to latent structures (MIPLS) combined with experimental design as a research tool for wood feature description and to give a survey of its applications to identify and extract features feasible for classification of softwood surfaces to investigate the use of an imaging spectrograph combined with a smart sensor for real time grading of sawn products to present the necessity of installing human evaluation and system interaction possibilities into automatic wood inspection systems to obtain good performance This thesis contributes to the wood research field by the multivariate approach so far with a limited use in wood technology research with a few outlayers. The main contributions are: the introduction of PLS and MIPLS as soft modelling tools for calibration and prediction modelling of wood features the evaluation of the imaging spectrograph/MIPLS concept to model the spectral behaviour of the interaction between visible light, the wood surface and the sensor the integration of a multisensor, i. e. a combination of sensors such as X-rays, R-waves and CCDs, and how to insert the obtained data into a linear or non linear model utilizing sufficient information from each sensor the recognition of useful information in softwood scanning.

5000|$|In North America, market {{practices}} for dimensional lumber made from hardwoods varies {{significantly from the}} regularized standardized 'dimension lumber' sizes used for sales and specification of <b>softwoods</b> - hardwood <b>boards</b> are often sold totally rough cut, or machine planed only on the two (broader) face sides. When Hardwood Boards are also supplied with planed faces, it is usually both by random widths of a specified thickness (normally matching milling of softwood dimensional lumbers) and somewhat random lengths. But besides those older (traditional and normal) situations, in recent years some product lines have been widened to also market boards in standard stock sizes; these usually retail in big box stores and using only a relatively small set of specified lengths; in all cases hardwoods are sold to the consumer by the board-foot (...) , whereas that measure is not used for softwoods at the retailer (to the cognizance of the buyer).|$|R
40|$|This {{life cycle}} {{analysis}} {{was performed on the}} UBC Geography Building, a 51883 sf wood-frame academic building built in 1924, for the purpose of establishing a materials inventory and environmental impact reference to be applied in the assessment of potential upgrades. It was also completed simultaneously with 12 other academic and residential buildings at UBC for environmental performance comparisons across UBC buildings over time and between different materials, structural types and building functions. The building was modeled with On Center’s On-Screen Takeoff and Athena Sustainable Materials Institute’s Impact Estimator using architectural drawings provided. From this model, a Bill of Materials was determined, showing that the largest quantities of material were gypsum <b>board,</b> <b>softwood</b> plywood, 6 mil polyethylene, cedar wood shiplap, and stucco. The determined summary measures were then compared to the average UBC academic building. It was found that the primary energy consumption, weighted resource use, global warming potential, acidification potential, human health respiratory effects potential, eutrophication potential, and smog potential ranged from 6. 4 %- 30. 0 % of the average building...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges of the forestry sector and the global wood industries is the need to address and overcome declining raw material supplies, to fully utilize available resources, and to take advantage of innovations in wood processing. A growing number of timber producers are facing raw material shortages and some wood processors are now operating below 50 percent of capacity. This problem is expected to worsen in the next several years. A method to produce particleboard from hardwood sawmill residue has been investigated at RMIT University, Australia. This work has proven that a particleboard made in laboratory has acceptable mechanical properties and density profiles in accordance to the Australian Standard. However, this board product required a high resin consumption, and a higher board density, inhibiting ready acceptance by the industry. The Ph. D research project presented here addressed this gap in knowledge and examined ways of optimising the new particleboard product. A feasibility and a cost benefit analysis was done to examine the elements of improvement needed. The research then focussed on examining the potential of optimising the board process parameters by using mixes of softwood and hardwood residue. Four series of experiments were carried out for this investigation. During the first and second series, it was revealed that mixes of hardwood and softwood would not improve board properties as expected. Analysis of the underlying reasons revealed that the observed reduction in strength is a result of over curing of hardwood particles when used in the surface layers. It was found that the acidic property of hardwood accelerates the UF resin curing which lead to uneven degree of curing throughout the board. The best configuration of hardwood and <b>softwood</b> throughout the <b>board</b> was found to be with softwood in the surface and hardwood in the core. After obtaining adequate hardwood/softwood configuration throughout the board, using the theory of experimental design, an experimental study was conducted to examine the effect of other processing parameters on the board properties. A process model was developed to predict board properties as a function of processing variables. A final optimised board which complies with the required properties of the AS/NZS standards and utilising up to 45 % hardwood residue was developed through the research program. Outcomes would lead to a reduction of the demand for custom flaked hardwood used in particleboard by replacing them up to 45 % by saw mill waste...|$|R
