40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{economic}} feasibility of bloom delay by sprinkling as a means of protecting delicious apples from frost. The framework of this study is based on decision making theory under uncertainty. It demonstrates the usefulness of the Bayesian approach to determine optimum action to take in face of uncertain climatic conditions. The economic analysis was conducted for Farmington, Utah, where significant relationships were found between the end of winter rest (end of chill-unit accumulation) and time of full bloom of red delicious apples. A posteriori probabilities for the state of nature were determined using accumulated data of end of winter rest of the apple trees. Applying the Bayesian approach, optimal strategies were determined by use of a posteriori probabilities and knowledge of time of end of winter rest. It was concluded from the analysis that the installation of solid set sprinklers and use of sprinkling to delay bloom is an effective means of frost protection. Sprinkling provides two methods of freeze protection. Bud development can be delayed increasing the hardiness of the bud to colder temperatures. <b>Sprinkling</b> <b>can</b> also be used during periods of freezing temperatures to protect the buds from freezing. It was found that a combination of protection by delay and by sprinkling for freeze protection would result in increased net returns over any other alternative. An important finding of this study is that with the dual protection afforded by sprinkling, extended amounts of delay are not necessary to obtain the desired results...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In India, {{multiple}} micronutrient deficiencies {{continue to}} be a major public health problem, especially for children below three years of age. It is a crucial period for the growth and development of children. There is lack of data from Rajasthan state on the effect of micronutrients supplementation on growth of children below three years of age. Aims & Objectives: To assess the impact of ICDS supplementary food with or without micronutrients sprinkles on weight and height of children aged 6 - 36 months in the Tonk district, Rajasthan state. Materials & Methods: The trial was conducted in the 15 Angan wadi centers, each from Tonk (rural) and Malpura blocks of Tonk District in Rajasthan state. Children from both blocks were considered as experimental and control groups. Experimental (N= 790) and Control groups (N= 540) received ICDS supplementary food for six months with or without micronutrients sprinkles. Anthropometric measurements were taken using standard techniques. Results: At baseline, children with severe underweight, severe stunting and severe wasting in experimental group stood at 19. 2 %, 19. 3 %, 7. 3 %, respectively, which declined to 14. 9 %, 15. 3 % and 6. 3 %, after intervention. Significant difference was observed in the mean weights of post intervention children between experimental and control groups, whereas, {{there was no significant difference}} in mean heights. In experimental group, statistical significant difference was also noted in the mean weights and heights of children between pre and post intervention periods.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate strategies designed to reduce heat stress of cattle. In the first experiment, cattle were sprinkled for 20 min every 1. 5 h between 1000 hours and 1750 hours (WET) versus not sprinkled (DRY). In a second experiment, treatments consisted of: (1) control, no water application; (2) water applied to the pen surfaces between 1000 hours and 1200 hours (AM); and (3) water applied to pen surfaces between 1400 hours and 1600 hours (PM). In both experiments, sprinkling lowered (P< 0. 05) mid-afternoon temperatures. In the first experiment, relative humidity (RH) of WET versus DRY pens differed (P< 0. 05) and averaged 72. 4 and 68. 9 %, respectively. The average temperature-humidity index (THI) in WET pens was 0. 5 units lower (P< 0. 05), than the THI in DRY pens. In the second experiment, RH in sprinkled pens was also greater (P< 0. 05) than RH in control (CON) pens However, THI differed (P< 0. 05) among treatments, being 81. 5, 80. 9, and 80. 3, respectively for CON, AM, and PM.

40|$|There {{has been}} a rapid, {{worldwide}} increase in oilseed rape production {{that has resulted in}} enormous intensification of oilseed rape cultivation, leading to tight rotations. This in turn, has caused an accumulation of pests as well as foliar and soil-borne diseases. Recently, clubroot {{has become one of the}} biggest concerns of oilseed rape growers. Clubroot is caused by the soil-borne protist Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin. The pathogen may be present in groundwater, lakes, and irrigation water used in <b>sprinkling</b> systems.

This paper presents the 2012 results of a study performed along the Polish-Ukrainian border in two provinces: Lublin (Lubelskie Voivodeship) and the Carpathian Foothills (Podkarpackie Voivodeship), in south-east Poland. Monitoring was done in 11 counties, including nine rural and two municipal ones. In total, 40 samples were collected, out of which 36 were collected from fields located in rural areas and four from municipal areas, with two per municipal region. Each sample was collected at 8 - 10 sites per field, using a soil auger. The biotest to detect the presence of P. brassicae was done under greenhouse conditions using seedlings of the susceptible Brassicas: B. rapa ssp. pekinensis and the Polish variety of oilseed rape B. napus cv.
