5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
5|$|Van Dijk {{started her}} career as a speed skater. As a very young child, she had {{performed}} in natural ice skating tours and, at the age of eight, she became a member of a local speed skating club. During the winter months, Van Dijk trained almost every day at the local speed skating rink in Utrecht. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> from when she was aged twelve until she was twenty years old. Van Dijk competed five times in the junior Dutch Allround Championships; she finished in tenth place on two occasions in the all-around competition and in fourth place in the 3000m in 2005.

25|$|From then {{until her}} {{renunciation}} of the Church of Satan in 1990, Zeena appeared in such nationally syndicated programs as The Phil Donahue Show, Nightline with Ted Koppel, Entertainment Tonight, The Late Show, Secrets & Mysteries and the Sally Jesse Raphael Show. The appearances {{were made at}} the behest of the Church of Satan as its spokesperson. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> on behalf of her father Anton LaVey, who was no longer interested in making media appearances, as she stated while being interviewed alongside her husband by televangelist Bob Larson.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time it was noted that Genie took {{pleasure}} in intentionally dropping or destroying small objects, and enjoyed watching someone else do the same to something she had been playing with. Kent wrote that she did the same series of actions several times over and that it appeared to ease some internal tension for her, and therefore thought <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> to gain control of traumatic childhood experiences. She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed was because she could hear some piano music during her childhood. She did not have the same reaction to recordings, and if someone played anything other than classical music she would change the sheet music to a book which she knew had pieces she liked.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, as {{a result}} of her {{research}} into grain rusts while completing her undergraduate and master's degrees at Macdonald College, she was offered a research position at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. She accepted, and from 1922 to 1925 was on faculty as an assistant professor in the Department of Biology, joining her former advisor W.P. Fraser, among which duties was included teaching. During this time, she conducted her doctoral studies at the University of Minnesota, where under the supervision of Elvin C. Stakman she completed her Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in agricultural science in 1922 with the dissertation Studies in wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis tritici). Stakman had also been researching stem rust. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> by spending six months in Minnesota, then six months in Saskatoon.|$|E

25|$|According to widely {{accepted}} local and family tradition, Anna Strong's {{role in the}} ring was to signal Brewster that a message was ready, as he ran regular trips with whaleboats across the Sound {{on a variety of}} smuggling and military missions. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> by hanging a black petticoat on her clothesline at Strong Point in Setauket, which was easily visible by Brewster from a boat in the Sound and by Woodhull from his nearby farm after he began to operate almost exclusively from home. She would add a number of handkerchiefs for one of six coves where Brewster would bring his boat and Woodhull would meet him. Historian Richard Welch writes that the tradition of the clothesline signal is unverifiable, but it is known that the British suspected a woman of disloyal activities at Setauket who fit Anna's profile.|$|E
25|$|Catherine did {{initiate}} {{some changes}} to serfdom, though. If a noble {{did not live}} up to his side of the deal, then the serfs could file complaints against him by following the proper channels of law. Catherine gave them this new right, but in exchange they could no longer appeal directly to her. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> because {{she did not want to}} be bothered by the peasantry, but did not want to give them reason to revolt, either. In this act, though, she unintentionally gave the serfs a legitimate bureaucratic status they had lacked before. Some serfs were able to use their new status to their advantage. For example, serfs could apply to be freed if they were under illegal ownership, and non-nobles were not allowed to own serfs. Some serfs did apply for freedom and were, surprisingly, successful. In addition, some governors listened to the complaints of serfs and punished nobles, but this was by no means all-inclusive.|$|E
25|$|The support later {{given to}} a revival of sadir as Bharatnatyam by the Theosophical Society was {{largely due to the}} efforts of Rukmini Devi Arundale, an eminent theosophist, and E. Krishna Iyer. Arundale, trained in ballet, sought to reappropriate the devadasi dance traditions and bring them into a context which could be {{perceived}} as respectable. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> by changing the dance repertoire to exclude pieces perceived as erotic in their description of a deity. She also systematized the dance in a way that incorporated the extension and use of space associated with dance traditions such as ballet. The product of this transformation was Bharatnatyam, which she then began to teach professionally at a school she established in Madras called Kalakshetra. Bharatnatyam is commonly propagated as a very ancient dance tradition associated with the Natyasastra. However, in reality, Bharatnatyam as it is performed and known today is a product of Arundale's endeavour to remove the devadasi dance tradition from the perceived immoral context of the devadasi community and bring it into the upper caste performance milieu.|$|E

25|$|After some time, Artemis {{returned}} to Themyscira to aid her Amazon sisters in the uneasy living conditions {{they continued to}} work in due to lingering animosities between the two tribes. Civil war eventually broke out {{between the two groups}} of Amazons, leaving Artemis to take up the title of her tribe's chief warrior, or Shim'Tar. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> in the hopes of ending the war and to guide both tribes to peaceful negotiations. As Shim'Tar, Artemis battled Queen Hippolyta, who was acting as the newest Wonder Woman. During their battle, Artemis reminded Hippolyta that the Themyscirian queen was not given the armor of Wonder Woman out of honor, but rather as a punishment for causing the death of not only Artemis, but of her daughter Diana as well. Ultimately coming to her senses, Hippolyta finally forgave the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall for their previous transgressions, and joined her daughter Diana on the battlefield. Together Queen Hippolyta and Princess Diana renounced their crowns, leaving the island without a structured government in the hopes of ending the needless slaughter brought on by the war. They were successful, and Artemis and the Themyscirian General Philippus were later voted to be co-rulers of the island. Philippus was given the title of Chancellor and Archon Eponymous, whereas Artemis was given the title of Polemarch. It is explained that Archon Eponymous equates to the Civic Office of a Presidential title, whereas the position of Polemarch translates to War Leader, similar to the position of Commander-In-Chief.|$|E

500|$|Aaliyah, who {{maintained}} a perfect 4.0 {{grade point average}} when graduating from Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: [...] "I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important {{to have something to}} fall back on." [...] <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> in her own life, as she planned to [...] "fall back on" [...] another part of the entertainment industry.
