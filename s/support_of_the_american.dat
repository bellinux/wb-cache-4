25|$|From {{the end of}} the 17th century, British attacks led to the French {{settlers}} {{abandoning the}} islands, and the British took possession from 1713 to 1763.

25|$|In 2012, Linda Atiyeh {{purchased}} the 16,400-square-foot building located at 26-28 York Street {{with plans to}} relocate and expand Gallery 30. This historic building began life as Walter’s Theater; {{at the turn of}} the 20th Century entrepreneur John F. Walters, who had had great success with a small “moving picture business” on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg, decided “to erect a larger theater, complete with stage on York Street.” Walter’s Theater regularly hosted picture shows, community theater events, singers and traveling vaudeville acts. The theater created a stir in 1910 when it featured a “real burlesque show” called “Monte Carlo Girls” live on its stage. The graduation ceremony for Gettysburg High School’s class of 1917 was also held at Walter’s Theater, with those in attendance taking special notice of the patriotic decorations hung throughout the auditorium in <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> troops in World War I.

After a brief refit in Melbourne, Quiberon resumed operations with the Eastern Fleet in August. In October, she took part in a series of fleet bombardments of the Japanese-held Nicobar Islands. In mid December, Quiberon was reassigned to Australian waters as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. During early 1945, the destroyer was attached to the British Pacific Fleet.

25|$|In {{the hope}} of {{securing}} international recognition, Seán T.

When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the Irish Republic, to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success. One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions. He met the young Harvard-educated leader from Puerto Rico, Pedro Albizu Campos, and forged a lasting and useful alliance with him.|$|E
