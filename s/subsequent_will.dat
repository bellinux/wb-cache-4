But, as you have been told repeatedly, the proving of that will amounts to nothing if a subsequent one be forthcoming. The great question is this; Does a <b>subsequent</b> <b>will</b> exist?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Real worth. Supposing the gold, or {{whatever}} else the currency expressly promises, to be required from the issuer, for all his notes; and that the call cannot be met in full. Then the actual worth of the document (whatever its credit power) would be, and its actual worth at any moment is to be defined as being, what {{the division of the}} assets of the issuer, and his <b>subsequent</b> <b>will</b> work, would produce for it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{testator}} should {{declare that}} he or she revokes all previous wills and codicils. Otherwise, a <b>subsequent</b> <b>will</b> revokes earlier wills and codicils only {{to the extent to which}} they are inconsistent. However, if a <b>subsequent</b> <b>will</b> is completely inconsistent with an earlier one, the earlier will is considered completely revoked by implication.|$|E
50|$|Robinson {{produced}} an earlier will, leaving her the whole estate outright.

5000|$|Whitney {{offered as}} {{witnesses}} two of Clark's close confidants. First, Harriet Harper Smythe, the nurse who cared for Gaines as an infant, testified about {{the contents of}} the 1813 will, which Clark signed only a month before his death. [...] Clark's friend Colonel Joseph Bellechasse also confirmed the existence of the 1813 will and recalled how Clark had confessed that Gaines was his legitimate daughter and heir. The defense's answer was similar to the arguments presented in the prior suit and would continue {{to be used in the}} suits that followed: Clark and Carrière were never legally married; Clark had no legitimate children; the 1811 will was the only will Clark made; and if there was a <b>subsequent</b> <b>will,</b> Clark had gotten rid of it himself.|$|E

50|$|The {{jackpots}} start around 500,000 {{points and}} increase by 2,000 for any target the balls {{hit on the}} playfield. The jackpot also increases by the same amount each time a ball passes {{over one of the}} lane sensors. The first shot players go for is either the Basket (for a higher jackpot) or the Ramp (for a regular jackpot). If the player successfully shoots only the Basket (not the Ramp) before the allotted time on the shot clock expires, all <b>subsequent</b> jackpots <b>will</b> be doubled, and the shot clock resets to its original time. If the player can shoot the Basket or the Ramp before the time expires a second time, the 3 <b>subsequent</b> jackpots <b>will</b> be tripled from the regular value, and the shot clock resets. If the player shoots the Basket or the Ramp before the clock runs out for a third time, the 3 <b>subsequent</b> jackpots <b>will</b> be quadrupled from the regular value. This can only be done if the three subsequent shots are not achieved within the time frame.|$|R
