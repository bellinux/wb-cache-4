50|$|Rodents' incisors grow {{continuously}} {{throughout their}} lives, {{a process known}} as aradicular. Unlike humans whose ameloblasts die after tooth development, rodents continually produce enamel and must wear down their teeth by gnawing on various materials. These teeth are used for cutting wood, biting through the skin of fruit, or for defense. The teeth have enamel on the outside and exposed dentin on the inside, so they <b>self-sharpen</b> during gnawing.

50|$|The bond has {{the task}} of holding the {{individual}} grains together until they become dull. Type and quantity of the binder used affects both the hardness and the abrasive properties of the working wheels. The outbreak of the abrasive grain is called <b>self-sharpening.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to staballoys in kinetic penetrator munition is tungsten, {{but it is}} more expensive, more difficult to machine and is not pyrophoric, so the munition lacks the incendiary effect enhancing its impact.

40|$|Nanosized PTFE-based {{core-shell}} particles can {{be prepared}} by emulsifier-free seed emulsion polymerization technique starting from spherical or rod-like PTFE seeds of different size. The shell can be constituted by the relatively high Tg polystyrene and polymethylmethacrylate {{as well as by}} low Tg polyacrylic copolymers. Peculiar thermal behavior of the PTFE component is observed due to the high degree of PTFE compartmentalization. A very precise control over the particle size can be exerted by properly adjusting the ratio between the monomers and the PTFE seed. In addition, the particle size distribution <b>self-sharpens</b> as the ratio monomer/PTFE increases. Samples with uniformity ratios suited to build 2 D and 3 D colloidal crystals are easily prepared. In particular, 2 D colloidal crystal of spheres leads to very small 2 D nanostructuration, useful for the preparation of masks with a combination of nanosphere lithography and reactive ion etching. 3 D colloidal crystals were also obtained featuring excellent opal quality, which is a direct consequence of the monodispersity of colloids used for their growth...|$|R

50|$|Carnassials are paired {{upper and}} lower teeth (either molars or premolars and molars) {{modified}} {{in such a way}} as to allow enlarged and often <b>self-sharpening</b> edges to pass by each other in a shearing manner. The modification arose separately in several groups of carnivorous mammals. Different pairs of teeth were involved in the separate modifications. In modern Carnivora, the carnassials are the modified fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar. These teeth are also referred to as sectorial teeth. Humans lack carnassial teeth.|$|E
5000|$|Pentaceratops, {{like all}} ceratopsians, was an herbivore. During the Cretaceous, {{flowering}} plants were [...] "geographically limited on the landscape", {{and so it}} is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the branches which then were shredded, leaves, needles and all, by the tooth batteries, providing a <b>self-sharpening</b> continuous cutting edge in both upper and lower jaws. Ultimately the plant material was digested by the large gut.|$|E

50|$|Ordinary {{shock waves}} are stable, {{that is the}} speeds of {{characteristic}} behind the shock are {{greater than that of}} the shock itself, which is greater than the characteristics in front of the shock. The characteristic speed is the speed of small, travelling perturbations. These conditions are necessary for a shock wave to remain and not decay. If the peak of a wave moves faster than at its base, then the wave front becomes <b>self-sharpening</b> and eventually becomes a nearly discontinuous shock, a sharp wave front which remains so when it travels.|$|E
50|$|The K2's primary {{anti-tank}} munition is an indigenously developed improved tungsten APFSDS {{kinetic energy}} penetrator, which offers significantly greater penetration {{than the current}} generation of tungsten rounds through better heat treatment of the tungsten alloy and the deformation-free <b>self-sharpening</b> that the penetrator undergoes as it penetrates the armour of its target. For attacking unhardened targets, the K2 can use a multi-purpose HEAT chemical energy round, similar to the U.S. M830A1 HEAT MP-T, providing good offensive capabilities against personnel, unarmored and lightly armored vehicles on the ground as well as low-flying helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were more}} than sixty spoon shaped teeth in the jaws of Yunnanosaurus, and were unique among early sauropodomorphs in that its teeth were <b>self-sharpening</b> because they [...] "wore against each other as the animal fed." [...] Scientists {{consider}} these teeth to be advanced compared to other early sauropodomorphs, as they share features with the sauropods. However, scientists do not consider Yunnanosaurus to be especially close to the sauropods in phylogeny because the remaining portions of the animals body are distinctly [...] "prosauropod" [...] in design. This critical difference implies that the similarity in dentition between Yunnanosaurus and sauropods might {{be an example of}} convergent evolution.|$|E
50|$|Armor-piercing {{rifle and}} pistol {{cartridges}} are usually {{built around a}} penetrator of hardened steel, tungsten, or tungsten carbide, and such cartridges are often called 'hard-core bullets'. Aircraft and tank rounds sometimes use a core of depleted uranium. The penetrator is a pointed mass of high-density material {{that is designed to}} retain its shape and carry the maximum possible amount of energy as deeply as possible into the target. Depleted-uranium penetrators have the advantage of being pyrophoric and <b>self-sharpening</b> on impact, resulting in intense heat and energy focused on a minimal area of the target's armor. Some rounds also use explosive or incendiary tips to aid in the penetration of thicker armor. High Explosive Incendiary/Armor Piercing Ammunition combines a tungsten carbide penetrator with an incendiary and explosive tip.|$|E
50|$|Large calibre APFSDS {{projectiles}} {{are usually}} fired from smooth-bore (unrifled) barrels, though {{they can be}} and often are fired from rifled guns. This is especially true when fired from small to medium calibre weapon systems. APFSDS projectiles are usually made from high-density metal alloys, such as tungsten heavy alloys (WHA) or depleted uranium (DU); maraging steel was used for some early Soviet projectiles. DU alloys are cheaper and have better penetration than others, as they are denser and <b>self-sharpening.</b> Uranium is also pyrophoric and may become opportunistically incendiary, especially as the round shears past the armor exposing non-oxidized metal, but both the metal's fragments and dust contaminate the battlefield with toxic hazards. The less toxic WHAs are preferred in most countries except the USA, and Russia.|$|E
50|$|Depleted uranium {{is favored}} for the {{penetrator}} {{because it is}} <b>self-sharpening</b> and flammable. On impact with a hard target, such as an armored vehicle, {{the nose of the}} rod fractures {{in such a way that}} it remains sharp. The impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to ignite. When a DU penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle, it catches fire, often igniting ammunition and fuel, killing the crew and possibly causing the vehicle to explode. DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120 mm or 105 mm cannons employed on the M1 Abrams tank. The Russian military has used DU ammunition in tank main gun ammunition since the late 1970s, mostly for the 115 mm guns in the T-62 tank and the 125 mm guns in the T-64, T-72, T-80, and T-90 tanks.|$|E
50|$|The two-man turret on the K21 is {{armed with}} an S&T Dynamics K40 40 mm cannon capable of firing APFSDS, high-explosive, smoke and {{multipurpose}} munitions, and a 7.62 mm machine gun. This {{is combined with}} an advanced fire-control system and gun stabilizer usually found on third-generation main battle tanks that makes the K21, together with the German Puma, able to move and engage the targets with high degree of accuracy at the same time. The ammunition for the autocannon is stored under the turret. The 40 mm cannon can fire up to 300 rounds per minute, with a projectile velocity of up to 1,005 m/s. The improved APFSDS rounds fired from {{it is able to}} penetrate up to 160-220 mm of armor, slightly higher than other APFSDS rounds, due to the <b>self-sharpening</b> process as the round penetrates the armour.|$|E

50|$|Some common {{attributing}} {{factors to}} wheel {{can be caused}} by grain fracture, which can be advantages, is the results of a portion of each of the individual grains on the wheel surface breaking apart and leaving the remaining grain bonded to the wheel. The fractured grain is left with newly exposed sharp edges which attribute the <b>self-sharpening</b> characteristic of grinding wheels and cutting tools in general. Attritious wear or progressive wear which is typically undesirable leads to the grains dulling by developing flat spots and rounded edges on the wheel which can deteriorate the wheels ability to remove material. Flat spots also can lead to excessive heat generation with the added surface contact which and in turn enable Bond fractures or the brittle fracture of the adhesive bonds between the grains. The removal of these worn grains from the adhesive bonds restores the wheels cutting ability once more. Grinding wheels can also be characterized by the grains increased capacity to fracture according to a level of higher value of friability. Different bonding materials are used depending on the intended use of the grinding wheel. The bonding material is classified by its individual strength called its wheel grade.|$|E

This sword can slice cleanly through a falling handkerchief, is <b>self-sharpening,</b> {{and at the same}} time sharper and more {{bendable}} that any steel for the next 2000 years. Wootz steel (from the Tamil ukku/urukku) was used to make the legendary Damascus steel blades. These blades were more highly prized than wealth and gemstones across the world, and the steel was only manufactured in India. Yet, by the 18th century, the technique was lost for ever. This is the story of the greatest weapons ever made, one that held primacy over the world for close to 2000 years, was developed and manufactured in our land, but has been forgotten, and lost. Perhaps in some small Tamilian village, there is a blacksmith from out of time, still forging wootz steel unbeknownst to the world. Anything is possible in India.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{its small}} size, Hypsilophodon fed on low-growing vegetation, {{in view of}} the pointed snout most likely preferring high quality plant material, such as young shoots and roots, in the manner of modern deer. The {{structure}} of its skull, with the teeth set far back into the jaw, strongly suggests that it had cheeks, an advanced feature that would have facilitated the chewing of food. There were twenty-three to twenty-seven maxillary and dentary teeth with vertical ridges in the animal's upper and lower jaws which, {{due to the fact that}} the tooth row of the lower jaw, its teeth curving outwards, fitted within that of the upper jaw, with its teeth curving inwards, appear to have been <b>self-sharpening,</b> the occlusion wearing down the teeth and providing for a simple chewing mechanism. As in almost all dinosaurs and certainly all the ornithischians, the teeth were continuously replaced in an alternate arrangement, with the two replacement waves moving from the back to the front of the jaw. The Z(ahnreihen)-spacing, the average distance in tooth position between teeth of the same eruption stage, was rather low with Hyspilophodon, about 2,3. Such a dentition would have allowed to process relatively tough plants. Early paleontologists modelled the body of this small, bipedal, herbivorous dinosaur in various ways. In 1882 Hulke suggested that Hypsilophodon was quadrupedal but also, in view of its grasping hand, able to climb rocks and trees in order to seek shelter. In 1912 this line of thought was further pursued by Austrian paleontologist Othenio Abel. Concluding that the first toe of the foot could function as an opposable hallux, Abel stated that Hypsilophodon was a fully arboreal animal and even that an arboreal lifestyle was primitive for the dinosaurs as a whole. Though this hypothesis was doubted by Nopcsa, it was adopted by the Danish researcher Gerhard Heilmann who in 1916 proposed that a quadrupedal Hypsilophodon lived like the modern tree-kangaroo Dendrolagus. In 1926 Heilmann had again changed his mind, denying that the first toe was opposable because the first metatarsal was firmly connected to the second, but in 1927 Abel refused to accept this. In this he was in 1936 supported by Swinton who claimed that even a forward pointing first metatarsal might carry a movable toe. As Swinton was a very influential populariser of dinosaurs, this remained the accepted view for over three decades, most books typically illustrating Hypsilophodon sitting on a tree branch. However, Peter M. Galton in 1969 performed a more accurate analysis of the musculo-skeletal structure, showing that the body posture was horizontal. In 1971 Galton in detail refuted Abel's arguments, showing that the first toe had been incorrectly reconstructed and that neither the curvature of the claws, nor the level of mobility of the shoulder girdle or the tail could be seen as adaptations for climbing, concluding that Hypsilophodon was a bipedal running form. This convinced the paleontological community that Hypsilophodon remained firmly on the ground.|$|E
