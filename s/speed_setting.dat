5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the film was extremely negative. The acting, story, and characters attracted the most criticism {{as well as the}} film's setting on a slow-moving cruise ship, which was much less thrilling than <b>Speed</b> <b>setting</b> on a fast-moving bus. The film was also a financial disappointment, earning $164 million worldwide against a budget of $110 million. It was nominated for eight Golden Raspberry Awards, and won the award for Worst Re-Make or Sequel.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came {{for the company to}} develop a new broiler, it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style broiler was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin during the summer of 1999.|$|E
5|$|Nick flees at high <b>speed,</b> <b>setting</b> off {{a traffic}} camera. The trio meet {{to discuss their}} {{reservations}} about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film Snow Falling on Cedars. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him {{to get rid of}} the witness.|$|E

25|$|Another {{common use}} of a ballast {{resistor}} in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low <b>speed</b> <b>setting.</b> A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|E
25|$|Some recordings, such as {{books for}} the blind, were pressed at rpm. Prestige Records {{released}} jazz records in this format in the late 1950s; for example, two of their Miles Davis albums were paired together in this format. Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance {{of the system and}} weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the rpm records. Subsequently, the rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16rpm <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> produced as late as the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|Powered turret {{traverse}} {{was provided}} by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6º/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19º/second — the same as with the Tiger I — [...] with the high <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36º/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually turn the turret at one-half a degree per 360º turn.|$|E
500|$|The ships' {{armament}} was rounded out by twelve torpedo tubes; {{they were}} mounted in four triple launchers on the ships' main deck.

500|$|The Leslie {{speaker is}} a {{combined}} amplifier and loudspeaker that projects the signal from an electric or electronic instrument and modifies the sound by rotating the loudspeakers. It is most {{commonly associated with}} the Hammond organ, though it was later used for the guitar and other instruments. A typical Leslie speaker contains an amplifier, a treble horn and a bass speaker—though specific components depend upon the model. A musician controls the Leslie speaker by either an external switch or pedal that alternates between a slow and fast <b>speed</b> <b>setting,</b> known as [...] "chorale" [...] and [...] "tremolo".|$|E

Objectives: The {{aim of this}} work is a comparison between top world teams and a Czech national team in a <b>speed</b> of <b>set,</b> frequency of set to the volleyball zone's IV and II and in a success of an attack. Methods: The observe complex, which we compared is made by four top world volleyball teams (Brazil, Italy, USA and Russia) and by a Czech national team. We analyzed five matches by each team. In the results {{we can find out}} teams up to top 30 by ranking of FIVB. As an information source to how they play in <b>speed</b> of <b>set,</b> we used these teams. To get results we used indirect watching method by using a program Dartfish. To get results of a speed we needed a distance between two players (setter and attacker) which we get from the table of zones we created and time we timed by mentioned program. Results: The results are summarized in a clearly tables. The comparison of a <b>speed</b> <b>set</b> is divided from each zone of a court (table of zone which we made) into the volleyball zone IV and II. We find out that the <b>speed</b> of <b>set</b> from particular zones into the zone IV and II is not varied.

500|$|The game {{features}} bullet hell gameplay elements, {{providing the}} player {{with a small}} hit box and swarms of particles to evade. Most of the bullets come in patternless waves {{with the exception of}} bosses which feature more structured patterns. The player may choose from three different ships each with a different <b>speed</b> <b>setting,</b> and may also choose from three different weapons: spread gun, homing laser, and bubble cannon. Each weapon behaves differently, so the player must utilize different strategies with them. The player is also equipped with a sword and shield. The sword and main weapon can be used to destroy the enemies and some bullets, and can also deflect items. This deflection mechanic allows the player to [...] "juggle" [...] items and power-ups until they are desired. When not firing, a shield is automatically deployed which can deflect some bullets. A combo bar, which determines the score multiplier, can be increased by either using the shield to harvest energy from bullets or enemies, or using the ABSNET shield, a weapon which eliminates all minor enemies and bullets on the screen. In order to use the ABSNET shield, the player must fill a gauge by gathering blue items which drop from destroyed enemies.|$|E

They sent back missives representing {{that they were}} far within the enemies' frontier, and it was dangerous either to pause or turn back. They had likewise received pressing entreaties from the besieged to hasten their <b>speed,</b> <b>setting</b> forth their great sufferings and their hourly peril of being overwhelmed by the enemy.|$|E
50|$|The rate {{at which}} pattern data is played is defined by a <b>speed</b> <b>setting.</b> Each row in the pattern data lasts one {{vertical}} blanking (or 0.02 seconds) times the current <b>speed</b> <b>setting.</b> The <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> varied from 1 to 255.In later versions of the format, the vertical blanking was replaced with an adjustable time period staying in the range 0.078 seconds. The old <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> command was replaced with a new one {{that was used to}} change both the old <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> and the new adjustable time period. Unfortunately, some of the old functionality was broken, because the new <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> command had an identical code value to the old command. Values in the range 31 were interpreted as the old speed settings, but other values were regarded as modifications to the adjustable time period. Hence, values in the range 255 used in some old songs broke in new versions of the player.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem is}} the maximum <b>speed</b> <b>set</b> to 140 km/h. Though there are tracks with a design speed of up to 160 km/h, they cannot be used up to full speed because ATB-EG (ATB Eerste Generatie or ATB First Generation) does not allow this.|$|R
