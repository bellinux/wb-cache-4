Although there is some evidence of Roman visitation, the first fortification of the site was the construction of a Norman motte. It has been called King Alfred's Fort, however there is no proof of use by Alfred the Great. A medieval church was built on the hill in the 15th century. The current ruined church on top of the hill was built in 1793. The land and ruin were donated to the National Trust in 1946 as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|The royal seat of Rendlesham, {{specified}} by Bede, seals the evident {{importance of the}} Deben estuary headwaters as a centre of royal power, demonstrated for an earlier period by the royal cemetery of Sutton Hoo. Rendlesham, {{a short distance from}} Iken, the site of Botolph's monastery, <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> strategic point between the rivers Deben and Alde at the headwaters of the Butley estuary, which intersects the peninsula between the two major rivers. The dedication of Rendlesham's church to St Gregory suggests its early, perhaps primary connection with the royal dwelling mentioned by Bede. If the Dommoc bishopric was at Walton, as Rochester claimed in the thirteenth century, then this was also immediately within the sphere of Rendlesham. Archaeologists have revealed that the quay of Gipeswic (now modern Ipswich), at a ford of the River Orwell estuary, was then growing in importance as a centre of seaborne trade to the continent, under direct royal patronage.|$|E

Under the combined effect of a prudent fiscal policy and sizeable privatization receipts, the total debt stock had shrunk by 20 percentage points, and now <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> little over half of GDP.

500|$|The {{first of}} Crane's panels {{depicted}} the Union Street fire. It is an idealised image depicting Ayres as the rescued {{rather than the}} rescuer, blending religious imagery with traditional 19th-century symbols of British heroism, and bears no relationship to actual events. [...] Ayres, in a long and flowing pure white gown, <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> first floor window, surrounded in flames and holding a small child.

Although in reality Ayres had been {{at a much higher}} level of the building and the heat of the burning oil and gunpowder had made it impossible for the fire brigade to approach the building, by depicting Ayres with the fireman and sailor, widely seen as symbols of British heroism and British strength, Crane's picture further enhanced her growing reputation as a heroic figure. Crane's picture in the Red Cross Hall was itself mentioned in , a border ballad by National Trust founder Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley published in his 1896 Ballads of Brave Deeds, for which George Frederic Watts wrote the preface.|$|E
