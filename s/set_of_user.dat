25|$|Under Unix, every running {{program has}} an {{associated}} user id, which normally {{corresponds to the}} user that started the process. This id largely dictates the actions permitted to the program. No outside process can change the user id of a running program. A Hurd process, on the other hand, runs under a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> ids, which can contain multiple ids, one, or none. A sufficiently privileged process can add and remove ids to another process. For example, there is a password server that will hand out ids {{in return for a}} correct login password.|$|E
25|$|OpenID {{is a way}} to use {{a single}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> {{credentials}} to access multiple sites, while OAuth facilitates the authorization of one site to access and use information related to the user's account on another site. Although OAuth is not an authentication protocol, it can be used as part of one. The following drawing highlights the differences between using OpenID vs. OAuth for authentication. Note that with OpenID, the process starts with the application asking the user for their identity (typically an OpenID URI), whereas in the case of OAuth, the application directly requests a limited access OAuth Token (valet key) to access the APIs (enter the house) on user's behalf. If the user can grant that access, the application can retrieve the unique identifier for establishing the profile (identity) using the APIs.|$|E
500|$|Other {{promising}} {{methods of}} structural alignment are local structural alignment methods. These provide comparison of pre-selected parts of proteins (e.g. binding sites, user-defined structural motifs) [...] against binding sites or whole-protein structural databases. The MultiBind and MAPPIS servers [...] allow {{the identification of}} common spatial arrangements of physicochemical properties such as H-bond donor, acceptor, aliphatic, aromatic or hydrophobic in a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> provided protein binding sites defined by interactions with small molecules (MultiBind) or {{in a set of}} user-provided protein–protein interfaces (MAPPIS). Others provide comparison of entire protein structures [...] against a number of user submitted structures or against a large database of protein structures in reasonable time (ProBiS). Unlike global alignment approaches, local structural alignment approaches are suited to detection of locally conserved patterns of functional groups, which often appear in binding sites and have significant involvement in ligand binding. As an example, comparing G-Losa, a local structure alignment tool, with TM-align, a global structure alignment based method. While G-Losa predicts drug-like ligands’ positions in single-chain protein targets more precisely than TM-align, the overall success rate of TM-align is better.|$|E
