5|$|Important <b>sexual</b> <b>health</b> {{issues for}} women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and <b>sexual</b> <b>health</b> needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and <b>sexual</b> <b>health,</b> increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E

The paper is a critical review of the concepts of adolescent <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> and its implication for human capital development. It reviews the conceptual framework of Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on factors that promote adolescent sexual and reproductive health; and constructs a framework that presents mechanisms through which socioeconomic development is achieved through improved human capital development.

However, twenty years after the ICPD <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> and rights remain largely neglected in development initiatives. There are vast inconsistencies between knowledge, policy and practice in ensuring <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> and rights, which is primarily due to a lack of understanding of the social and structural contexts that inhibit <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> and rights.

In addition to improved <b>health,</b> <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> services contribute to economic growth, societal and gender equity, and democratic governance. To better appreciate the substantial returns on <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> investments, policymakers need both a fuller accounting of these broad benefits than has been available to date and more complete information about costs. <b>Sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> services encompass three main areas: contraceptive services, maternal health services and services related to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS, and other gynecologic and urologic problems.

40|$|Worldwide, <b>sexual</b> {{reproductive}} <b>health</b> {{issues are}} topic {{of interest in}} the field of international development. <b>Sexual</b> reproductive <b>health</b> {{is an important part of}} general health and a central aspect of overall human development. Especially during adolescence and adulthood <b>sexual</b> reproductive <b>health</b> issues prevail and are of special importance for women particularly during their reproductive years. Failure to properly cope with <b>sexual</b> reproductive <b>health</b> problems at any stage in life might cause health and developmental problems later in life. The highest attainable level of <b>sexual</b> reproductive <b>health</b> is not only a human right, but also a prerequisite for social and economic development as humans are the driving forces of development. <b>Sexual</b> reproductive <b>health</b> is not solely based on absence of diseases or infirmity, but also deals with reproductive processes at all stages of life and must be understood in the context of relationships too. Involvement and empowerment of young women in the development and implementation of programs and services is needed. Thus far focus has been on the quantity rather than quality i. e. availability of goods rather than capability and opportunity to make well informed decisions. Little account of the social and cultural realities that young women encounter regarding their reproductive lives and decision making is taken. Different actors from public and private sector and civil society examine on local, district, national and international level whether any interventions in this area are needed to improve the situation for girls and women worldwide. This qualitative study is focused on the <b>sexual</b> reproductive <b>health</b> status and education of adolescent girls in Tanzania and how this is influenced by economic, social and cultural factors. Through questionnaires and in-depth interviews with adolescent girls (whether enrolled in school or dropped out), parents, teachers and health care professionals the situation for adolescent girls in Magu, Tanzania is well identified. The results of this study show that there’s much room for improvement. Girls are not capable of managing their <b>sexual</b> reproductive <b>health</b> properly and with dignity.

For this paper, we define <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> and rights education as including not only its biomedical aspects but also an understanding of its history, values and politics, grounded in gender politics and social justice, addressing sexuality, and placed within a broader context of health systems and global health. Using a case study approach with an opportunistically selected sample of schools of public health within our regional contexts, we examine the status of <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> and rights education {{and some of the}} drivers and obstacles to the development and delivery of <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> and rights curricula.

40|$|Background: Numbers {{of young}} people with perinatally {{acquired}} HIV is growing significantly. With antiretroviral drugs, children who get infected at birth with HIV {{have an opportunity to}} graduate into adolescence and adulthood. This achievement notwithstanding, new challenges have emerged in their care and support needs. The most dynamic being, their <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> needs and rights (SRHR). Objectives: This paper aimed at establishing the gaps at policy, program and health systems level as far as addressing <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> needs {{of young people}} who have lived with HIV since infancy is concerned. Methods: This paper is based on a desk review of existing literature on <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> needs and rights of young positives. Results: The results indicate young positives are sexually active and are engaging in risky sexual encounters. Yet, existing policies, programs and services are inadequate in responding to their <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> needs and rights. Conclusion: Against these findings, it is important, that policies specifically targeting this subgroup are formulated {{and to make sure that}} such policies result in programs and services that are youth friendly.

25|$|It is {{commonly}} perceived that once women {{near the end}} of their reproductive years and enter menopause that this equates to the end of her sexual life. However, especially since women today are living one third or more of their lives in a postmenopausal state, maintaining, if not improving, their quality of life, of which their sexuality can be a key determinant, is of importance. A recent study of sexual activities among women aged 40–69 revealed that 75% of women are sexually active at this age; this indicates that the <b>sexual</b> <b>health</b> and satisfaction of menopausal women are an aspect of <b>sexual</b> <b>health</b> and quality of life that is worthy of attention by health care professionals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Approximately 80 % of HIV {{cases are}} {{transmitted}} sexually and a further 10 % perinatally or during breastfeeding. Hence, the health sector has looked to <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> programmes for leadership and guidance in providing information and counselling {{to prevent these}} forms of transmission, and more recently to undertake some aspects of treatment. This paper reviews and assesses the contributions made to date by <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> services to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, mainly by services for family planning, sexually transmitted infections and antenatal and delivery care. It also describes other <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> problems experienced by HIV-positive women, such {{as the need for}} abortion services, infertility services and cervical cancer screening and treatment. This paper shows that <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> programmes can make an important contribution to HIV prevention and treatment, and that STI control is important both for <b>sexual</b> and reproductive <b>health</b> and HIV/AIDS control.
