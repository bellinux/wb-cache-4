5000|$|At {{its most}} basic, {{state-dependent}} memory {{is the product}} of the strengthening of a particular <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathway</b> in the brain. [...] A neural synapse is the space between brain cells, or neurons, that allows chemical signals to be passed from one neuron to another. Chemicals called neurotransmitters leave one cell, travel across the synapse, and are taken in by the next neuron through a neurotransmitter receptor. This creates a connection between the two neurons called a neural pathway. Memory relies on the strengthening of these neural pathways, associating one neuron with another. When we learn something, new pathways are made between neurons in the brain which then communicate through chemical signals. If these cells have a history of sending out certain signals under specific chemical conditions within the brain, they are then primed to work most effectively under similar circumstances. State-dependent memory happens when a new neural connection is made while the brain is in a specific chemical state - for instance, a child with ADHD learns their multiplication tables while on stimulant medication. Because their brain created these new connections related to multiplication tables while the brain was chemically affected by the stimulant medication, their neurons will be primed in the future to remember these facts best when the same levels of medication are present in the brain.|$|E

But given this informa-tion, the question remains how neurons integrate or dis-criminate between distinct inputs impinging at spatially segregated locations on their dendrites. Here, we investi-gated how and under which circumstances <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways</b> targeting distinct regions in the dendrites can interact. We followed an analytical approach, starting with a Volterra expansion of the generalized cable equation. In this expansion, the second order kernel is the lowest-order kernel that is sensitive to correlations between spatially segregated input locations. It, thus, provides insight in the spatial extent of local dendritic computa-tion. Our approach {{is similar to that}} of Kistler and Gerstner [3]. For fairly general dendritic geometries and distributions of HH-type ion channels, we show that the second-order Volterra kernel can be computed from the first-order kernel, known for linear systems as the Green’s function [1, 4]. We implemented and tested our analytical results, using morphologically detailed neuron models. Thus, we have obtained a tool for analyzing dis-tance scales of spatial correlations in detailed neuron models. Using our method, we can identify input regions that collaborate (correlate) to produce an output. Using the recently described <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways,</b> we elaborate on the dendritic regions where interaction can occur and show how these interactions are shaped by ion channel distribution and dendritic geometry.

Despite certain cytoarchitectural specializations and deviations from the general blueprint, the principal organization of the neocortex is relatively uniform. It is not known, however, to what extent stereotypic <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways</b> resemble each other between cortical areas, and how far they might reflect possible functional uniformity or specialization. Here, we show that frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition (FDDI) is a generic circuit motif that is present in all neocortical areas we investigated (primary somatosensory, auditory and motor cortex, secondary visual cortex and medial prefrontal cortex of the developing rat). We did find, however, area-specific differences in occurrence and kinetics of FDDI and the short-term dynamics of monosynaptic connections between pyramidal cells (PCs). Connectivity between PCs, both monosynaptic and via FDDI, is higher in primary cortices. The long-term effectiveness of FDDI {{is likely to be}} limited by an activity-dependent attenuation of the PC–interneuron synaptic transmission.

Different patterns of stimulation can elicit different changes in the efficiency on excitatory synaptic transmission. Here, we examined the synaptic changes in the amygdala of adult mice produced by low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 15 min, LFS). We first compared the synaptic changes induced by LFS in three different <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways</b> of amygdala: cortical–lateral amygdala, thalamic–lateral amygdala, and lateral–basolateral amygdala pathways. We find that the plastic changes induced by LFS are different between <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways.</b> Low-frequency stimulation selectively elicits a slow onset and protein synthesis-dependent late-phase LTP in the cortical–lateral amygdala pathway, but not in the thalamic–lateral or lateral–basolateral pathways. We next analyzed LTP induced by LFS in the cortical–lateral amygdala pathway and found that three PKA-coupling neurotransmitter receptors are involved: 5 -HT 4, Dopamine D 1, and β-adrenergic receptors. Antagonists of these receptors block the LFS L-LTP, but the effects of agonists of these receptors are clearly different. These results indicate that the threshold for the induction of LFS L-LTP is different among these pathways and that the maintenance of LFS L-LTP requires a cross-talk among multiple neurotransmitters...|$|R
40|$|Most {{neuronal}} networks, even in {{the absence}} of external stimuli, produce spontaneous bursts of spikes separated by periods of reduced activity. The origin and functional role of these neuronal events are still unclear. The present work shows that the spontaneous activity of two very different networks, intact leech ganglia and dissociated cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, share several features. Indeed, in both networks: i) the inter-spike intervals distribution of the spontaneous firing of single neurons is either regular or periodic or bursting, with the fraction of bursting neurons depending on the network activity; ii) bursts of spontaneous spikes have the same broad distributions of size and duration; iii) the degree of correlated activity increases with the bin width, and the power spectrum of the network firing rate has a 1 /f behavior at low frequencies, indicating the existence of long-range temporal correlations; iv) the activity of excitatory <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways</b> mediated by NMDA receptors is necessary for the onset of the long-range correlations and for the presence of large bursts; v) blockage of inhibitory <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways</b> mediated by GABA(A) receptors causes instead an increase in the correlation among neurons and leads to a burst distribution composed only of very small and very large bursts.

40|$|SummaryOscillations in neural {{activity}} are a prominent feature of many brain states. Individual hippocampal neurons exhibit intrinsic membrane potential oscillations and intrinsic resonance in the theta frequency range. We {{found that the}} subthreshold resonance frequency of CA 1 pyramidal neurons was location dependent, varying more than 3 -fold between the soma and the distal dendrites. Furthermore, activity- and NMDA-receptor-dependent long-term plasticity increased this resonance frequency through changes in h channel properties. The increase in resonance frequency and an associated reduction in excitability were nearly identical in the soma and the first 300 μm of the apical dendrites. These spatially widespread changes accompanying long-term synaptic potentiation also reduced the neuron's ability to elicit spikes evoked through a nonpotentiated <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathway.</b> Our {{results suggest that the}} frequency response of these neurons depends on the dendritic location of their inputs and that activity can regulate their response dynamics within an oscillating neural network...|$|E

The up-regulation of synaptic strength is mediated by the activity-dependent modulation by β-adrenergic transmission.

40|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS) is {{the most}} common monogenetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. The disorder is characterized by altered synaptic plasticity in the brain. Synaptic plasticity is tightly regulated by a complex balance of different <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways.</b> In FXS, various <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways</b> are disrupted, including the excitatory metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5) and the inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways. Targeting each of these pathways individually, has demonstrated beneficial effects in animal models, but not in patients with FXS. This lack of translation might be due to oversimplification of the disease mechanisms when targeting only one affected pathway, in spite of the complexity of the many pathways implicated in FXS. In this report we outline the hypothesis that targeting more than one pathway simultaneously, a combination therapy, might improve treatment effects in FXS. In addition, we present a glance of the first results of chronic combination therapy on social behavior in Fmr 1 KO mice. In contrast to what we expected, targeting both the mGluR 5 and the GABAergic pathways simultaneously did not result in a synergistic effect, but in a slight worsening of the social behavior phenotype. This does implicate that both pathways are interconnected and important for social behavior. Our results underline the tremendous fine-tuning that is needed to reach the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the synapse in relation to social behavior.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Two {{groups of}} interneurons, Tr 1 and DRI, have been {{identified}} in the escape swim circuit of the marine mollusc Tritonia diomedea that have important roles in behavioral initiation. DRI functions as a command neuron, receiving direct excitatory input from the afferent neurons, and in turn directly exciting the DSI neurons of the central pattern generator. DRI fires throughout the swim motor program, and activity in DRI is both necessary and sufficient for sensory input to elicit the swim motor program. Tr 1 is an excitatory interneuron that fires briefly in response to sensory input and then remains silent during the motor program. Tr 1 excites DRI with an excitatory connection that has fast and slow components and thus appears to have a role in converting brief afferent neuron activity to long-lasting firing in downstream circuit elements. These neurons complete the description of a continuous <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathway</b> from afferent to flexion neurons in the Tritonia swim circuit.

Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics {{analyses were conducted to}} evaluate treatment effects on the glutamatergic <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathway</b> of the parasite, which is closely related to chemoreception and neurotransmission. After drug treatment with DM or AZA, stochastic mRNA expression patterns of glutamatergic synapse pathway components were observed.

Furthermore, the delousing drugs drove complex rearrangements in the distribution of mapped reads for specific metabotropic glutamate receptor domains. This study introduces a novel methodological approach that produces high-quality results from transcriptomic data. Using this approach, DM and AZA were found to alter the expression of numerous mRNAs tightly linked to the glutamatergic signaling pathway.

Since neuroligin 3 (NLGN 3), a cell adhesion molecule at the neuronal synapse, was first identified as a risk gene for ASD, several additional variants in NLGN 3 and NLGN 4 were found in ASD patients. Moreover, synaptopathies are now known to cause several neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. In humans, NLGNs consist of five family members, and neuroligin 1 (NLGN 1) is a major component forming a complex on excitatory glutamatergic synapses. However, the significance of NLGN 1 in neuropsychiatric disorders remains unknown. Here, we systematically examine five missense variants of NLGN 1 that were detected in ASD patients, and show molecular and cellular alterations caused by these variants. We show that a novel NLGN 1 Pro 89 Leu (P 89 L) missense variant found in two ASD siblings leads to changes in cellular localization, protein degradation, and to the impairment of spine formation. Furthermore, we generated the knock-in P 89 L mice, and we show that the P 89 L heterozygote mice display abnormal social behavior, a core feature of ASD.

In addition to its rewarding properties, nicotine also affects many cognitive and emotional processes that involve several brain regions, including hippocampus and amygdala. Long-term changes in synaptic strength in these brain regions after drug exposure may be importantly correlated with behavioral changes induced by nicotine. Here, we study the effect of chronic oral administration of nicotine on the long-term synaptic potentiation in the amygdala, a key structure for emotional memory. We find that oral administration of nicotine for 7 d produces a significant enhancement of LTP in the amygdala. This facilitation is pathway specific: Nicotine selectively facilitates LTP in the cortical-lateral amygdala pathway, but not the thalamic-lateral and the lateral-basolateral <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathway.</b> The synaptic facilitation induced by a 7 -d exposure to nicotine is long-lasting, it persists for 72 h after cessation of nicotine but decays 8 d after its cessation. In contrast, a shorter exposure of nicotine (24 h) induces only a short-lasting facilitation of synaptic plasticity that dissipates 24 and 72 h after cessation of nicotine. The facilitation of LTP in the amygdala after exposure to nicotine is mediated by removal of GABAergic inhibition, is dependent on the activation NMDA receptors, and can be prevented by blocking either α 7 or β 2 nACh receptors. Our results indicate that chronic exposure to nicotine can promote the induction of long-lasting modifications of synapses in a specific pathway in the amygdala.

These results are compatible with the hypothesis that cortical lesions interact with <b>synaptic</b> <b>pathways</b> related to cognitive functions such as visual target detection, and verbal processing...|$|R
