25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps {{behind her and}} turns to see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at anything beyond Yahmose — she was looking <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Scally {{stated that}} {{he was sitting in}} Alley Pond Park on Winchester Boulevard, in the borough of Queens, at dusk with a female friend when a yellow Volkswagen Beetle {{approached}} his car door to door and only three inches apart from his vehicle, which did not have its engine running. Scally kept an air gun under his seat and, as the VW approached his car, the VW driver was met with the gun pointed <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> At first, he appeared to be a light-skinned black male, but he also appeared to be wearing a stocking over his face. The driver of the VW quickly started his car and gunned it in reverse out of the parking lot. Scally chased the car to a point in Glen Oaks, Queens, where the driver jumped out and ran. He did not want to leave his female passenger to give chase, so he telephoned the Son of Sam Hot Line. Detective Richard Carroll from the Son of Sam Task Force (and Scally's former baseball coach) later told Scally that he had indeed seen the Son of Sam. Glen Oaks was later revealed to be the home of Berkowitz's sister and was close {{to the site of the}} Donna DiMaise and Joanne LoMino shootings.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneers, {{playing with}} the goal of keeping the Kansas City Chiefs’ Wing-T offense on the bench as much as possible, held them to little more than half of their regular rushing average. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers’ offense had their most {{productive}} day ever, setting a team record with three fourth-quarter touchdowns. Jimmy DuBose ran for two touchdowns and Louis Carter for one, and Doug Williams threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Morris Owens. Kansas City was held to a pair of Jan Stenerud field goals for most of the game. A fourth-quarter Tony Adams pass was ruled a touchdown, although replays showed that receiver Henry Marshall failed to keep both of his feet inbounds. Richard Wood was given much of the credit for stifling the Chiefs’ league-leading rushing attack. Wood correctly expected that Chiefs offensive coordinator Tom Pagna would run the offense <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> as he did when Wood played at USC and Pagna coached at Notre Dame. Pagna assumed incorrectly that the undersized Wood would be overpowered, but Wood instead responded by making 12 tackles. This was the Buccaneers’ third consecutive road win, and came one day after the Kansas City Royals were eliminated from the American League pennant race.|$|E
60|$|Lucy, {{standing}} very <b>straight,</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a snap in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's that?" [...] cried Slagg, {{suddenly}} pointing his gun <b>straight</b> upwards <b>at</b> two {{brilliant black}} eyes which were gazing <b>straight</b> down <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Holding {{the disputed}} object, {{which he had}} put on his nippers to glance at, he presently, without speaking, looked over these aids <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> Nanda, who looked as <b>straight</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "It was I who wrote Mr. Van's name." [...] The girl's eyes were on Mr. Longdon, but her words as for the company. [...] "I brought the book here from Buckingham Crescent and left it by {{accident}} in the other room." ...|$|R
2500|$|At 9:10 AM Lieutenant Colonel John C. Meyer of 487th Fighter Squadron (352 FG) was {{preparing}} for takeoff in [...] "Petie III" [...] P-51 Mustang with 11 others. As he lifted off he noticed flak bursts over Ophoven and one Fw 190 heading <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> piloted by Gefreiter Böhm intent on strafing a C-47 Skytrain transport. Meyer had not retracted his landing gear when he fired at the Fw 190 which cartwheeled and exploded next to the C-47. Despite the attack other P-51s {{were able to take}} off and JG 11 soon lost eight pilots. Obergefreiter Karlheinz Sistenich, Feldwebel Harald Scharz, Feldwebel Herbert Kraschinski, Oberleutnant August Engel all died, while Feldwebel Karl Miller was severely burnt after crash landing. There was [...] one casualty among Allied ground crew. The U.S. flak crews held fire for fear of hitting a friendly aircraft and Allied pilots were cautious of firing at low flying 109s to avoid strafing the base. Flak crews hit one chasing P-51 which had to land damaged.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Thorpe-Satchell looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a {{faint smile}} {{at the corners of}} her lips.|$|E
60|$|When he {{said that}} Bo was looking <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> but she seemed not to have heard.|$|E
60|$|Toward dawn she stirred, and, {{slipping}} stiffly {{from his}} position, he moved {{her so that}} her back, which was still wet, faced the fire. He built up the fire again, and sat brooding beside her, dozing and starting awake, till morning. Then his head bobbed, and he was dimly awake again, to find her sitting up <b>straight,</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in amazement.|$|R
6000|$|... "This lawn," [...] said Beverly-Jones, [...] "we {{laid down}} the first year we were here." [...] I {{answered}} nothing. He looked me right in the face {{as he said it}} and I looked <b>straight</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> but I saw no reason to challenge his statement. [...] "The geraniums along the border," [...] he went on, [...] "are rather an experiment. They're Dutch." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} he was still, gazing <b>straight</b> before <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the horses, his face hard and angry. He sighed, looked at Saxon, and smiled.|$|R
60|$|She {{held her}} head higher, still looking <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Then quite seriously, “I don’t {{like to be}} watched,” she returned.|$|E
60|$|He jerked himself about, {{after this}} compliment, {{in such an}} {{intolerable}} manner, that my aunt, who had sat looking <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> lost all patience.|$|E
60|$|She {{had succeeded}} in rousing him for the moment: and again she looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> for it was thus she remembered him a year ago.|$|E
60|$|Then {{once more}} I knew. Raising my eyes, I looked <b>straight</b> across <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> scowling there beneath his stunted thorn in a drift of flowers like fool's parsley. He was making signs, too, with his hands. I watched him pensively, in secret amusement. Then swifter than Daphne into her laurel, instantaneously he vanished, and I {{became aware that}} its black eyes were staring out from the long face of the {{motionless}} figure beside me, as might an owl's into an aviary.|$|R
60|$|Arrayed in her Sunday {{best she}} left the house half an hour later. A glance over her {{shoulder}} revealed her husband huddled up in {{a chair in the}} dirty kitchen, gazing <b>straight</b> before <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the empty grate.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes now, {{when he sat}} looking <b>straight</b> before <b>him</b> <b>at</b> {{the cold}} grey walls of his prison, he seemed to see that strange dual {{personality}} mocking him with all the witchlike elusiveness which had mystified and tortured him from the first.|$|R
60|$|A big bay steer, {{lifting his}} head, {{suddenly}} started {{to leave the}} herd. Mose spurred his horse <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a yell, and turned him back.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl did}} not answer, only stared {{in the same}} viscous, heavy fashion, <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> as he stood recoiled, as if for safety, against the next table.|$|E
6000|$|I looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "I {{know very}} little of you except {{that there is a}} warrant out for your arrest, and I am not {{addicted}} to taking advice from strangers." ...|$|E
60|$|But Asad did not respond. He {{sat there}} in a gloomy abstraction, staring <b>straight</b> before <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> last he sighed wearily. He was just, {{and he had a}} conscience, as odd a thing as it was awkward in a corsair Basha.|$|R
60|$|On Monday Miss Stokes {{turned up}} as usual, striding beside her team. Her 'whoa!' was {{resonant}} and challenging, {{she looked up}} at the truck as her steeds came to a standstill. Joe had turned aside, and had his face averted from her. She glanced him over--save for his slender succulent tenderness she would have despised him. She sized him up in a steady look. Then she turned to Albert, who was looking down at her and smiling in his mischievous turn. She knew his aspects by now. She looked <b>straight</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> though her eyes were hot. He saluted her.|$|R
60|$|The abject Bunsby looked {{neither to}} the right nor to the left, nor at his bride, nor at his friend, but <b>straight</b> before <b>him</b> <b>at</b> nothing. The Captain putting out his hand, Bunsby put out his; but, in answer to the Captain's greeting, spake no word.|$|R
6000|$|... “And I {{ask myself}} {{whether you have}} any heart.” She was looking <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and he gratified her with the usual cold white flash of his even teeth before he answered.|$|E
60|$|The door opened. The cuckoo {{came out}} fast, <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Larry was looking down, his brow {{wrinkled}} in thought. He glanced up, and the cuckoo caught him {{squarely in the}} eye.|$|E
60|$|The Abbot {{tried to}} make for the wood, but ere he could gain it, the knights had turned, and one rode <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{throwing}} away a broken lance, and drawing his sword.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary--!" [...] he exclaimed. But {{her head}} was turned away, {{and he could not}} say what he wished to say. [...] "Mary, you're splendid," [...] he concluded. She faced him as he spoke, and gave him her hand. She had {{suffered}} and relinquished, she had seen her future turned from one of infinite promise to one of barrenness, and yet, somehow, over what she scarcely knew, and with what results she could hardly foretell, she had conquered. With Ralph's eyes upon her, smiling <b>straight</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him</b> serenely and proudly, she knew, for the first time, that she had conquered. She let him kiss her hand.|$|R
60|$|Tess's excitable {{heart beat}} against his {{by way of}} reply; and there they stood upon the red-brick floor of the entry, the sun {{slanting}} in by the window upon his back, as he held her tightly to his breast; upon her inclining face, upon the blue veins of her temple, upon her naked arm, and her neck, and {{into the depths of}} her hair. Having been lying down in her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat. At first she would not look <b>straight</b> up <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> but her eyes soon lifted, and his plumbed the deepness of the ever-varying pupils, with their radiating fibrils of blue, and black, and gray, and violet, while she regarded <b>him</b> as Eve <b>at</b> her second waking might have regarded Adam.|$|R
2500|$|The teams {{came in for}} {{the lunch}} interval, with Alletson 47 not out. He asked his captain for {{advice on how to}} play after the resumption. On being told [...] "I don't think it matters what you do", Alletson replied, [...] "Then I'm not half going to give Killick [...] some stick." [...] Alletson was known for being a [...] "blocker", but after lunch he {{attacked}} the Sussex bowling, particularly Killick's. In a spell of sustained hitting, Alletson broke the world record for runs scored off a single over by hitting Killick for 34, one of his shots smashing the pavilion clock and another [...] "destroying" [...] the pavilion bar. Team-mates later revealed that as the innings developed Killick was frightened to bowl to Alletson in case he clouted the ball <b>straight</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Alletson was eventually out having scored a career-best 189.|$|R
60|$|He looked once {{back at the}} child; then round {{again at}} Hereward: and, making up his mind to take the largest morsel first, made <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a growl {{which there was no}} mistaking.|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{he did so}} a great {{humming sound}} filled the whole castle, so sweet and musical that it made him tremble to listen. Then {{suddenly}} the figure opened its eyes and looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{she sat with}} hands before her, gazing <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with eyes that slowly lost their outward look. Her eyelids fell, she began to whiten and to droop, and her hands twitched and trembled.|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox just glared <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for a minute, {{he was so}} mad. Then he sprang <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> Johnny Chuck.|$|R
2500|$|Lobb {{was a tall}} gangling right-arm fast-medium bowler and a No 11 batsman. His fielding was {{the subject}} of amusement: [...] "He changed course a dozen times while the ball trickled <b>straight</b> to <b>him</b> <b>at</b> long-leg," [...] wrote Somerset's historian, David Foot. His batting {{reflected}} the fact that, in Foot's words, [...] "he turned ungainliness into an art form" [...] and he was also a poor judge of a run. In Lobb's obituary in Wisden in 2001, the story of a run-out at Chesterfield is told by Lobb himself: [...] "I once got run out by deep mid-on, who overtook me as I unwisely strolled to the other end".|$|R
60|$|The young lady, {{who also}} saw it all, flushed up red, {{then in the}} instant of passing looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> our hero, and bowed and smiled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a most sweet and gracious affability, then the next moment {{recovering}} herself, as though mightily frightened at what she had done.|$|R
