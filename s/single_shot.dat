The real President {{addresses}} the nation at a White House ceremony where Roadblock, Lady Jaye, Flint, Jinx, and Snake Eyes are commemorated as heroes. Colton presents Roadblock with an M1911 pistol that belonged to General George S. Patton, to use when he finally finds Cobra Commander and to avenge Duke and the other Joes.

With the Sounder's slow season start and midseason turmoil, the team's turnaround from {{bottom of the}} league to eventual champions {{is considered one of}} the most dramatic comebacks in MLS history.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E
5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this is a considerable advance when compared with Hepworth's own How it Feels to be Run Over (1900), which contains a <b>single</b> <b>shot.</b> This not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal {{than they would have}} in reality.|$|E
50|$|Faunthorpe {{was also}} an {{accomplished}} athlete. With the British team at the 1924 Summer Olympics he finished fourth in the team 100 metre running deer, <b>single</b> <b>shots</b> competition and 21st in the individual 100 metre running deer, <b>single</b> <b>shots</b> event.|$|R

5|$|Under {{fire and}} with the wind too calm for sailing, Barlow ran out oars to try and pull his brig away from the French batteries. The {{diminutive}} size of his vessel made it a difficult target and he was soon {{able to take advantage}} of a fresh breeze to withdraw from the crossfire. A <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> struck the brig, smashing into one of the 4-pounder cannon on deck and breaking it into three pieces, although none of the crew were wounded by the strike.|$|E
5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Poland began on 1 September 1939, and {{marked the beginning}} of World War II in Europe. Philipp's unit was tasked with bomber escort and ground attack as well as combat air patrol missions. He was credited with his first aerial victory on 5 September 1939 without firing a <b>single</b> <b>shot.</b> Philipp maneuvered himself into a favorable attack position and aimed carefully. Just {{as he was about to}} open fire, the enemy pilot bailed out. Nevertheless, he was given credit for the destruction of the aircraft and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, which was presented to him on 10 October 1939. He lost his wingman during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force) in late November 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{second day}} of the tournament began with the Maryland Terrapins facing the seventh-seeded Notre Dame Fighting Irish at home in South Bend, Indiana. The Fighting Irish entered the game in {{possession}} of a perfect 15–0 record, but still considered an unknown variable due to their schedule. The magazine Inside Lacrosse called the Terrapins a talented team that had underachieved during the regular season. The first-ranked Notre Dame defense frustrated Maryland, but the Terps still managed to gain a 6–1 lead in the third quarter. Maryland's defense effectively shut-down Notre Dame and the leading Irish scorer Ryan Hoff was unable to make a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> on goal. Maryland was the only unseeded team to advance to the quarterfinals.|$|E

5|$|Walsh was {{employed}} with the FBI until 1942 when, as a Reserve Marine Lieutenant, {{he took a}} leave to serve with the United States Marine Corps during World War II. After he left, Hoover refused to allow any more active agents {{to be members of}} any military reserve. He fought in the Pacific Theater, specifically on Okinawa and in North China. In one incident, he and his comrades were pinned down by a sniper, whom Walsh was able to kill from 90 yards away with a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> to the torso from a M1911 pistol. He earned the rank of Colonel and returned to the FBI for two years from 1946–1947. In total, during his tenure with the agency, he killed between 11 and 17 suspects.|$|E
5|$|A {{month before}} his capture, U.S. {{authorities}} had been passing down information to {{their counterparts in}} Mexico that Treviño Morales was making frequent visits to the Nuevo Laredo border area to see his newborn baby. They got this intelligence from wiretaps, conversations, and informants' tips. Treviño Morales was apprehended by the Mexican Marines in Anáhuac, Nuevo León, near the border of Tamaulipas state, at around 3:45 a.m. on 15 July 2013 without a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> fired. The truck he was traveling in was intercepted on the road by a Black Hawk helicopter from the Navy; when the Marines got off the helicopter and tried to apprehend him, the capo attempted to escape by running through some bushes but was later caught. He was in possession of US$2 million ($25,316,100 MXN) in cash, eight weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition; two other men were arrested with him and taken into custody. Rumors of Treviño Morales's arrest and a mugshot of him in custody began to circulate through Twitter and other social media outlets around noon that day, but the Mexican government did not confirm the arrest, nor did the U.S. authorities receive a formal confirmation until hours later.|$|E
5|$|Although Niémen {{was very}} badly damaged, Amethyst was almost {{uncontrollable}} and despite Seymour's best efforts, {{he was unable}} to close with Niémen to ensure her surrender. Dupotet meanwhile was overseeing hasty repairs in the hope of getting away before Amethyst could recover. At 03:45, however, a new ship emerged from the darkness, soon revealed to be the British frigate HMS Arethusa. Arethusa was deployed as part of the force blockading the ports of Northern Spain and her commander, Captain Robert Mends, was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding the French-held port of Lekeitio. Mends immediately pulled alongside Niémen and Dupotet fired a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> each at Amethyst and Arethusa. The shot at Amethyst missed its target, but the one at Arethusa struck the ship and threw up splinters. Mends was struck on the forehead and badly wounded, the only man to be hit. Both Amethyst and Arethusa then opened fire, Niémen surrendering immediately.|$|E

5|$|General George S. Patton {{himself had}} a gunfight {{when he was}} a young second {{lieutenant}} chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916. Patton and 10 enlisted men had been sent to San Miguelito Ranch to look for Villa, who had recently raided the city of Columbus, New Mexico. Patton positioned his men by the south gate and was making his way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa's men came into the ranch on horseback. Patton drew his obsolete single-action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men. The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a <b>single</b> <b>shot.</b> After his troops took down the remaining outlaw, Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring car and drove the bodies back to his commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the {{political}} establishment in South Vietnam was still in turmoil. Following the coup that ousted Ngô Đình Diệm, the military situation quickly worsened as the Viet Cong gained significant ground in the countryside because the Military Revolutionary Council which governed South Vietnam, lacked direction {{both in terms of}} policy and planning. Furthermore, General Dương Văn Minh, as the Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Council, and his civilian Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ favoured a political resolution instead of using military force, which brought them into conflict with the United States over the best strategy to end the Communist threat in South Vietnam. As a result, both men became increasingly unpopular among the military generals who held real political power in Saigon. On January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh successfully ousted Dương Văn Minh from the Military Revolutionary Council without firing a <b>single</b> <b>shot.</b> For much of the year, Khánh spent most of his efforts on consolidating political power, instead of fighting the Viet Cong.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August, the {{fighting}} continued {{along the front}} of the Australian position and on both flanks. Starting as a probing attack around dawn, there was a brief breakthrough in the afternoon, but the Japanese gains were negated by a swift counter-attack. The Japanese commander – realising that the Australians had brought up reinforcements – decided to commit his reserves to the battle. The slowness with which the 1/144th attacked caused Horii concern, and a company from the 3/144th was sent to re-invigorate its attack. The remainder was ordered to proceed to the west to attempt to outflank the main defensive position around Isurava. As the 1/144th enveloped {{the front of the}} Australian position, the 3/144th attempted an attack from the west, but it became lost. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Horii decided to commit the 2/41st, under Major Mitsuo Koiwai, with the aim of conducting a wide arc to the west and emerging on the track to the south of Alola. They too eventually became lost, and in fact did not regain contact with the main Japanese force until after the battle, without firing a <b>single</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

5|$|While {{the video}} was filmed as a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> {{on at least}} three {{different}} occasions, they planned on using post-editing to slow down or speed up {{certain parts of the}} take to keep it in time with the final soundtrack. There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine. Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and Adam Sadowsky, president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version. There was also a second cut which can be noticed by watching a piano against a wall as the camera passed behind some rods; the piano can be seen apparently warping in shape and position.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{continued}} {{to employ a}} leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> and then {{put his hands on}} his hips to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. Bradman reached tea on 78, and 55 minutes after the resumption of play, he cover drove Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests. The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate, and it was one of Bradman's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After Bradman had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen.|$|E
5|$|Battle {{losses of}} horses were {{approximately}} 25percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease and exhaustion {{accounted for the}} remainder and the Germans specifically targeted horses with gunfire. The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the initial stock numbers, mainly due to infection from the tsetse fly. On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the Crimean War, 120 percent in the Boer War and 10 percent in peacetime. During some periods of the war, 1,000horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Some horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, drowned in ankle-deep mud, too tired to lift their heads high enough to breathe. Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 Battle of Verdun between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> from a French naval gun. By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the Clydesdale horses, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over {{the course of the}} war, Britain lost over 484,000horses, one horse for every two men. A small number of these, 210, were killed by poison gas.|$|E
