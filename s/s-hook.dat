5000|$|The {{key point}} in the final game came when Wapnick, holding a blank, played [...] instead of [...] (of which he was unsure). Nyman then bingoed with [...] setting up an <b>S-hook</b> on the O column. Unable to play a bingo ending in S because of his STUM play, Wapnick instead played GROANERs when he could have blocked the O column with ORANGiER. Sure enough, Nyman drew an S and played [...] for 91 points then coasted to an easy win {{to become the first}} non-North American to win the world championship.|$|E
5000|$|Manual tile {{tracking}} {{can take}} away game time {{that would otherwise}} be used for finding words and making decisions about where to play them. Inaccurate tile tracking can lead to mistakes, such as setting up a spot for the player's 'S' when the opponent also has an 'S', or failing to block a winning play from the opponent. John Holgate, five-time winner of the Australian Championship recalls winning a game in the 1993 World Championship because his opponent inadvertently crossed off two ‘S’s with one stroke and failed to block the last <b>S-hook.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Rokkitball was a team-based game {{similar to}} {{basketball}} or soccer with futuristic weaponry. The game launched on InstantAction.com in April 2008 with support {{for up to}} eight players. Players move around an arena and use a magnetic beam to grab a ball and shoot it into holes in the wall to score points. Smaller, higher holes are worth more points than the lower, larger ones. Players have {{a limited amount of}} energy, which is needed to sprint and to use the [...] "magno-beam" [...] that holds the ball. Energy constantly regenerates when not being used. Players can shoot rockets in order to propel the ball, make enemy players lose all their energy, or knock the ball out of an enemy’s grip. There were four arenas for Rokkitball: Gauntlet, Cathedral, <b>S-Hook,</b> and Canyon. It is currently unknown what the future of Rokkitball is.|$|E

40|$|Suppose that s, t ∈ N are {{relatively}} prime positive integers. In {{the study of}} block inclusions between s- and t-blocks of partitions [4] we introduced an (s, t) -abacus to study relations between s- and t-cores of partitions. This is because the cores determine the blocks. Before we state our main result let us mention that the basic facts about partitions, hooks and blocks of partitions {{may be found in}} [3], Chapter 2 or [5], Chapter 1. You may get to the s-core λ (s) of a partition λ by removing a series of <b>s-hooks</b> (hooks of length s) until all <b>s-hooks</b> are removed. The s-core is independent of the order in which the <b>s-hooks</b> are removed. A partition has by definition s-weight w, if you need to remove exactly w <b>s-hooks</b> to get to its s-core. It also equals the number of hooks in the partition of length divisible by s ([3], 2. 7. 40). Thus a partition is an s-core if and only if it has s-weight 0. Two partitions of n are said {{to be in the same}} s-block if they have the same s-core. This definition is of course inspired by the theorem which is still referred to as the Nakayama conjecture. See [3], 6. 2. 21. Th...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The wetting {{ability of}} a foam {{solution}} {{is a measure of}} its ability to wet and penetrate woodland fuels, such as charred wood, scorched duff, as well as weathered building materials. This test appears to be more sensitive than surface tension or it measures slightly different characteristics and can frequently differentiate between products with the same or similar surface tension.

40|$|Seven {{types of}} {{breakaway}} snares were evaluated for breaking strength and variability using a universal testing machine. Maximum tension before breakage for individual snares ranged from 142 to 486 pounds. Sheet metal locks which ripped out, and <b>S-hooks</b> which straightened, provided the least variable results. Coyotes (Canis latrans), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), domestic calves and lambs were tested {{to determine the}} tension loads they applied to snares. Differences in tension loads among coyotes and nontarget species should allow {{for the development of}} snares that will consistently hold coyotes and release most larger nontarget animals...|$|R
