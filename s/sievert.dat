5|$|In the {{interests}} of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the curie (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides; the becquerel, <b>sievert</b> and gray were adopted in later years. Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.|$|E

25|$|On 26 and 27 March 2012 {{the inside}} of the {{containment}} vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with a 20 meter long endoscope. With this a dosi-meter was brought into the vessel to measure the radiation levels inside. At the bottom of the primary containment structure, 60 centimeters of water was found, instead of the 3 meters expected at that place. The radiation level measured was 72.9 <b>Sievert</b> per hour. Because of this, the endoscope could only function a few hours at this place. For reactors number 1 and 3, no endoscopic survey was planned at that time, because the actual radiation levels at these places were too high for humans.|$|E

25|$|Acoustics is by {{no means}} the only subject which finds use for {{weighting}} curves however, and they are widely used in deriving measures of effect for sun exposure, gamma radiation exposure, and many other things. In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its 'strength'. The <b>sievert</b> is a unit of weighted radiation dose for ionising radiation, which supersedes the older unit the REM (roentgen equivalent man).|$|E
25|$|Total {{recorded}} doses {{to individual}} workers in Chernobyl recovery operations {{during the period}} through 1990 ranged from less than 10 millisieverts (less than 1 rem) to more than 1 <b>sievert</b> (100 rems), due primarily to external radiation. The average dose is estimated to have been 120 millisieverts (12 rem) and 85% of the recorded doses were between 20 and 500 millisieverts (2 to 50 rems). There are large uncertainties in these individual doses; estimates {{of the size of}} the uncertainty range from 50% to a factor of five and dose records for military personnel are thought to be biased toward high values. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) estimates the total collective dose to the total of about 530,000 recovery operations workers as about 60,000 person-sieverts (6,000,000 person-rem).|$|E
25|$|Formerly, {{units of}} {{measurement}} were the curie (Ci), being 3.7E10 Bq, and also 1.0 grams of Radium (Ra-226); the rad (radiation absorbed dose), now replaced by the gray; and the rem (Röntgen equivalent man), now replaced with the <b>sievert.</b> The rad and rem are essentially equivalent for almost all nuclear medicine procedures, and only alpha radiation will produce a higher Rem or Sv value, due to its much higher Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). Alpha emitters are nowadays rarely used in nuclear medicine, but were used extensively {{before the advent of}} nuclear reactor and accelerator produced radionuclides. The concepts involved in radiation exposure to humans are covered by the field of Health Physics; the development and practice of safe and effective nuclear medicinal techniques is a key focus of Medical Physics.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} principle of radiosurgery {{is that of}} selective ionization of tissue, by means of high-energy beams of radiation. Ionization is the production of ions and free radicals which are usually deleterious to the cells. These ions and radicals, which may be formed from {{the water in the}} cell or biological materials, can produce irreparable damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in the cell's death. Thus, biological inactivation is carried out in a volume of tissue to be treated, with a precise destructive effect. The radiation dose is usually measured in grays (one gray (Gy) is the absorption of one joule of energy per kilogram of mass). A unit that attempts to take into account both the different organs that are irradiated and the type of radiation is the <b>sievert,</b> a unit that describes both the amount of energy deposited and the biological effectiveness.|$|E

2500|$|The {{absorbed dose}} and dose {{equivalent}} from {{galactic cosmic rays}} and solar energetic particles on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured. These measurements are necessary for human missions {{to the surface of}} Mars, to provide microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, and to determine how long potential organic biosignatures can be preserved. [...] This study estimates that a few meters drill is necessary to access possible biomolecules. [...] The actual absorbed dose measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is 76 mGy/yr at the surface. [...] Based on these measurements, for a round trip Mars surface mission with 180 days (each way) cruise, and 500 days on the Martian surface for this current solar cycle, an astronaut would be exposed to a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 <b>sievert.</b> Exposure to 1 <b>sievert</b> is associated with a 5 percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current lifetime limit for increased risk for its astronauts operating in low-Earth orbit is 3 percent. Maximum shielding from galactic cosmic rays can be obtained with about 3 meters of Martian soil.|$|E

Ionizing radiation causes deletions in chromosomes. If a developing organism such as an unborn child is irradiated, it is possible a birth defect may be induced, but it is unlikely this defect will be in a gamete or a gamete-forming cell. The incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is small, as in most mammals, because of natural cellular-repair mechanisms, many just now coming to light. These mechanisms range from DNA, mRNA and protein repair, to internal lysosomic digestion of defective proteins, and even induced cell suicide—apoptosis ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{radiation}} readout: counts or radiation dose. The counts display is the simplest and is the number of ionizing events displayed either as a count rate, commonly [...] "counts per second", or as a total over a set time period (an integrated total). The counts readout is normally used when alpha or beta particles are being detected. More complex to achieve is a display of radiation dose rate, displayed in a unit such as the <b>sievert</b> which is normally used for measuring gamma or X-ray dose rates. A G-M tube can detect the presence of radiation, but not its energy which influences the radiation's ionising effect. Consequently, instruments measuring dose rate require the use of an energy compensated G-M tube, so that the dose displayed relates to the counts detected. The electronics will apply known factors to make this conversion, which is specific to each instrument and is determined by design and calibration.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{description}} of diffusion {{growth of a}} gas bubble after its nucleation in supersaturated liquid solution is presented. We study the influence of Laplace pressure on the bubble growth. We consider two different solubility laws: Henry’s law, which is fulfilled for the systems where no gas molecules dissociation takes place and <b>Sievert’s</b> law, which is fulfilled for the systems where gas molecules completely dissociate in the solvent into two parts. We show {{that the difference between}} Henry’s and <b>Sievert’s</b> laws for chemical equilibrium conditions causes the dif-ference in bubble growth dynamics. Assuming that diffusion flux of dissolved gas molecules to the bubble is steady we obtain dif-ferential equations on bubble radius for both solubility laws. For the case of homogeneous nucleation of a bubble, which takes place at a significant pressure drop bubble dynamics equations for Henry’s and <b>Sievert’s</b> laws are solved analytically. For both solubility laws three characteristic stages of bubble growth are marked out. Intervals of bubble size change and time intervals of these stages are found. We also obtain conditions of diffusion flux steadiness corresponding to consecutive stages. The fulfill-ment of these conditions is discussed for the case of nucleation of water vapor bubbles in magmatic melts. For <b>Sievert’s</b> law the an-alytical treatment of the problem of bubble dissolution in a pure solvent is also presented. ∗Address all correspondence to this author...|$|R
60|$|My {{companion}} on {{this trip}} was a Norwegian named Nielsen. On most of my trips to lonely and wild places I have been fortunate as to comrades or guides. The circumstances of my meeting Nielsen were so singular that I think they will serve as an interesting introduction. Some years ago I received a letter, brief, clear and well-written, in which the writer stated {{that he had been}} a wanderer over the world, a sailor before the mast, and was now a prospector for gold. He had taken four trips alone down into the desert of Sonora, and in many other places of the southwest, and knew the prospecting game. Somewhere he had run across my story Desert Gold in which I told about a lost gold mine. And the point of his letter was that if I could give him some idea as to where the lost gold mine was located he would go find it and give me half. His name was <b>Sievert</b> Nielsen. I wrote him that to my regret the lost gold mine existed only in my imagination, but if he would come to Avalon to see me perhaps we might both profit by such a meeting. To my surprise he came. He was a man of about thirty-five, of magnificent physique, weighing about one hundred and ninety, and he was so enormously broad across the shoulders that he did not look his five feet ten. He had a wonderful head, huge, round, solid, like a cannon-ball. And his bronzed face, his regular features, square firm jaw, and clear gray eyes, fearless and direct, were singularly attractive to me. Well educated, with a strange calm poise, and a cool courtesy, not common in Americans, he evidently was a man of good family, by his own choice a rolling stone and adventurer.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} measures of radiation dose, including absorbed dose (D) measured in grays (Gy), Equivalent dose (H) measured in <b>sieverts</b> (Sv), Effective dose (E) (also measured in <b>sieverts)</b> and Kerma (K) measured in grays, along with dose area product (DAP) and dose length product (DLP). Each measure is often simply described as ‘dose’, which can lead to confusion. Non-SI units are still used, particularly in the USA, where dose is often reported in rads and dose equivalent in rems. By definition, 1 Gy = 100 rad and 1 Sv = 100 rem.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of the quantity of hydrogen absorbed by a potential hydrogen storage material is crucial to progress in the field. The most common techniques for measuring hydrogen uptake from the gas phase by a solid host, the <b>Sieverts</b> technique and gravimetry, both become susceptible to systematic errors as {{the density of the}} host material decreases. We focus here on the <b>Sieverts</b> technique, which in a poorly designed apparatus may produce errors 100 % in the quantity of absorbed hydrogen owing to a realistic 25 % error in the density of a light-atom sample. Using hydrogen absorption isotherms measured for low-density materials, including carbon nanotubes, potassium-intercalated graphite and lithium nitride, we show that designing the <b>Sieverts</b> apparatus with carefully chosen volumes greatly lessens the impact of uncertainty in the sample density. Rules-of-thumb for the volumes in the apparatus and the volume occupied by the sample itself, and a figure of merit for the sensitivity of the system to changes in the hydrogen content of the sample, are introduced.
