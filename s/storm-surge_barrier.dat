5|$|A {{prophylactic}} method introduced {{after the}} North Sea Flood of 1953 is {{the construction of}} dams and <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barriers</b> (flood barriers). They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge. Major storm surge barriers are the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which {{are part of the}} Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.|$|R
5000|$|Larger barrier systems protect {{more than}} a dozen major cities, {{including}} the Thames Barrier protecting London; the Delta Works protecting Rotterdam; the MOSE Project protecting Venice; and the Saint Petersburg Dam protecting St. Petersburg, Russia. New storm-surge barriers on Lake Borgne and [...] Lake Pontchartrain are part of the protection for New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. London’s famous regional surge barrier is typically deployed up to 12 times per year, protecting the heart of the bustling city from flood devastation. The Greater London Authority is currently studying proposals to strengthen the Thames Barrier to withstand future severe storms and rising sea level, as well as planning ambitious, even larger systems further down the River Thames. The barrier most similar to the proposed New York barrier is the one in St. Petersburg. Historically, the storm surges from the Gulf of Finland had caused over 300 floods in the city, several of which had a massively devastating effect. The barrier's first use to hold back Baltic Sea from flooding into Neva Bay took place November 28, 2011, just months after it was completed, and limited sea water rise to below flood level. The new <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> prevented the 309th flood {{in the history of the}} city and saved some 1.3 billion roubles of possible damages.|$|E

The data were used to test the model of Sheldon et al. (1977). The observed standing stock ratios of zooplankton to phytoplankton agree with the model predictions in 1983, and are slightly higher during the period 1984 - 1987. In 1988, the model predictions are very different from the observed values, because of important changes in the zooplankton species abundance occurring in this year...|$|E

But the City asked Dr. Jeroen Aerts, a professor of water and climate risk with the VU University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, {{and an expert on}} water risk management, to compare {{the costs and benefits of}} a regional barrier system with those of smaller-scale changes like building levees around sewage treatment plants, raising subway stations entrances, constructing local <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barriers,</b> and flood-proofing or raising buildings according to the FEMA-run National Flood Insurance Program standards.|$|R
50|$|Similar, albeit more modestly-sized, {{but still}} highly {{effective}} <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barriers</b> {{have been in}} operation {{for nearly half a}} century in three New England communities — the Stamford Hurricane Protection Barrier in Stamford, Conn.; the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier in Providence, R.I.; and the New Bedford Harbor Hurricane Barrier in New Bedford, Mass. Hours before Hurricane Sandy struck Stamford, the city's 17-foot-high movable barrier was closed to withstand a greater-than-eleven-foot storm surge which struck western Long Island Sound (even higher than the 9.5-foot harbor surge measured at The Battery in New York City), devastating every waterfront community on the northwestern coast of the sound — except Stamford.|$|R
40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{south-west}} of The Netherlands from flooding, the Eastern-Scheldt <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> was constructed, {{has to be}} inspected and, when necessary, repaired. Therefore, one is interested in obtaining optimal rates of inspection for which the expected maintenance cost are minimal and the barrier is safe. For optimisation purposes, a maintenance model has been developed {{for part of the}} sea-bed protection of the Eastern-Scheldt barrier, namely the block mats. This model enables optimal inspection decisions to be determined {{on the basis of the}} uncertainties in the process of occurrence of scour holes and, given that a scour hole has occurred, of the process of current-induced scour erosion. The stochastic processes of scour-hole initiation and scour-hole development have been regarded as a Poisson process and a gamma process, respectively.

40|$|A {{large-scale}} {{coastal engineering}} project aimed at protecting the Delta area (SW Netherlands) from flooding {{was completed in}} 1987. The Oosterschelde Estuary has been partially closed by a <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> which, in combination with dams on the northern and eastern boundaries, has modified the tidal characteristics of the estuary. Water exchange with the North Sea, tidal current velocities and fieshwater discharges have been reduced. Both light attenuation and nutrient loads have decreased. A preliminary evaluation is presented {{of the impact of}} the completed engineering works on the ecosystem. Several habitats are changing. Salt-marsh and tidal-flat erosion has increased, silt is being deposited in subtidal areas and bird numbers have decreased. The yields of mussels cultivated in the western part of the estuary has decreased and mussel conditlonhas deteriorated. Macrozoobenthos biomass and the diversity of fish species do not appear to have been directly affected by the engineering works...|$|E
40|$|Grazing {{activity}} {{by the dominant}} zooplankton species in the Oosterschelde (SW Netherlands) was studied {{as part of an}} ecological survey accompanying the construction of a <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> at the mouth of this tidal inlet. At station WEST, situated at the mouth, potential grazing pressure by the zooplankton amounted to 6 % d - 1 of the phytoplankton standing stock and 18 % of the primary production. At station EAST, in the inland part, 16 % of the phytoplankton standing stock and 11 % of the primary production was potentially consumed daily. Because the dominant zooplankton species in the inland part (Acartia spp. and cirriped nauplii) tended to feed more on small particles than the dominant species in the seaward part (Temora longicornis and Centropages hamatus), the potential grazing pressure on small phytoplankton (< 20 µm Spherical Equivalent Diameter) was 3 times higher at station EAST than at station WEST. Ecological consequences of this difference are discussed in relation to developments to be expected in the post-barrier situation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{history of}} {{littoral}} zone {{research in the}} Neva estuary, the largest estuary in the Baltic Sea, is described. Environmental problems, including effects of eutrophication and introductions of alien species, are discussed. A brief outline of future research is provided. Key words: Gulf of Finland, Neva estuary, littoral zone, eutrophication, alien species, history of research. The Neva estuary is the largest estuary in the Baltic Sea, located in the eastern Gulf of Finland. It has sustained a heavy impact from human activities, including discharges of treated and untreated wastewaters from point sources in St. Petersburg and intensive ship traffic. The Neva estuary consists of three main parts: Neva Bay (surface area 400 km 2), and {{the inner and outer}} estuaries (total surface area of the last two parts about 3200 km 2) (Pitkänen, 1991). Since the early 1980 s freshwater Neva Bay has been separated from the brackish lower reaches of the estuary by a <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier,</b> which is still under construction (Fig. 1). The coastal zone of the estuary is intensively exploited for recreatio...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{succession}} of the phytoplankton was followed weekly {{in the eastern}} and western parts of the Oosterschelde Estuary, before (1982 - 1983) and during (1984 - 1986) {{the construction of the}} <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier.</b> Construction of the barrier seriously influenced the hydrodynamics of the estuary. In the eastern part, decreased current velocities led to the emergence of a vertical salinity gradient, to an increasing sedimentation of suspended matter and to a rise in transparency during a prolonged period of the year. The relationship between species composition and biomass {{on the one hand and}} environmental variables on the other hand was analysed in a Canonical Correspondence Analysis, for both compartments separately. The analysis revealed that the phytoplankton assemblage more and more obtained a summer character, extending its growth season both earlier and later in the year. The transition of spring to summer phytoplankton assemblages proceeded parallel to the main light-turbidity gradient. The factor light did not only explain the seasonal pattern, but also the long-term trend from pre-barrier to barrier period...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the impact of the}} construction of the <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> and secondary dams on macrobenthos of the tidal flats in the Oosterschelde (SW Netherlands), changes in distribution, density and biomass of five common species (Spio martinensis, Hydrobia ulvae, Arenicola marina, Scoloplos armiger and Bathyporeia sp) were analysed. Data on macrobenthos were collected from 1979 to 1989 on five different tidal flats. Changes in sediment texture and hydrodynamic factors during the construction and after the completion of the coastal engineering project were taken into account. Three severe winters in a row caused more disturbance in the population of the main predator of S. armiger than did the hydrodynamical changes. A temporary prolongation of the emersion time (in 1986 and 1987) caused a temporary decrease in juvenile A. marina. But afterwards they still occupy the same 'nursery grounds'. Increased wave action on the edges of the flats probably created new niches for Bathyporeia sp. and Spio martinensis, replacing other benthic species. It is not yet clear what has caused the decline of H. ulvae in many places in the Oosterschelde estuary. Parasitic infestation is one of the possibilities...|$|E
40|$|Frequency of {{occurrence}} of fish species was monitored on a fortnightly basis in four fykes and a weir in the Oosterschelde estuary from 1979 through 1988. This {{was done in}} order to record changes in the fish fauna that may have occurred {{as a response to}} the construction of a <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> in the mouth of the Oosterschelde (1984 - 1986) and the concomitant building of compartmentalization dams in the landward part. These compartmentalization dams reduced the freshwater inflow into the system. Principal component analysis using the annual averages in frequency {{of occurrence}} suggests a slight shift occurred in the fish community separating a cluster of years 1979 - 1984 from the cluster 1985 - 1988. Many of the changes in individual species could be attributed to fluctuations in yearclass strength or were part of changes occurring on a wider geographical scale. The only impact of the construction works seems to be the decrease in a number of anadromous fish. Fish traps seem to be useful as a monitoring tool for a number of species. The value of the data collected could be improved if catch size and length-frequency data are recorded...|$|E
40|$|The Eastern Scheldt ebb-tidal delta {{morphology}} {{has been}} adapting {{for the past}} 25 years {{in response to the}} construction of the Eastern Scheldt <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> in 1986. As a result of the barrier, there has been a decrease in tidal amplitudes, volumes, and average flow velocities, and there is hardly any sediment exchange through the barrier. Bathymetrical measurements of the ebb-tidal delta show multiple effects: (1) an overall decrease in sediment volume, (2) a decrease in morphological activity, (3) sedimentation in most channels, (4) northward reorientation of channels and shoals, and (5) an increase in wave-driven features. Some channels are showing stronger erosion since 1986. This, and the reorientation of other channels could be related to changes in the interaction between crossshore and alongshore tide. Most of the erosion is located in shallower, wave-dominated regions, indicating that waves have become relatively stronger. The steady erosive trend, combined with the decline of morphological activity, points toward a system dominated by relatively small and mostly negative bed-level changes. This system is still far from any kind of equilibrium, and is steadfastly adapting itself to the new hydraulic forcing regime, even though sediment transport capaci ies have decrease...|$|E
40|$|Rijkswaterstaat) is {{responsible}} for the construction, operation and maintenance {{of a large number of}} infrastructures. The inventory mainly consists of bridges, tunnels, storm-surge barriers, sluices and highway-signal systems. Rijkswaterstaat spends € 40 to € 50 Million per year on maintenance of coatings. The total amount of steel surface that has to be maintained is about 6 Million square metres. The maintenance costs are mainly determined by environmental costs. The trend of the last fifteen years is that the price per square metre is increasing, whereas the durability of coating is decreasing. In this paper, we present the way Rijkswaterstaat deals with the maintenance of protective paint systems on steel structures. The maintenance strategy used in the Netherlands is based on functional requirements, which have been specified in technical regulations. The maintenance of paints on steel will be considered with emphasis on the use of the Lifetime-Extending Maintenance (LEM) model. The LEM model determines the cost-optimal combination of the interval of lifetime extension and the interval of preventive replacement.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> {{in the mouth of}} the Oosterscheide caused important hydrodynamical and morphological changes that could influence the macrobenthic populations. This paper is one in a series of five all dealing with the effects of the <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> on macrozoobenthos and analyses the spatial and temporal distribution of macrozoobenthos in the Oosterschelde and its relationship with some environmental parameters, based on two large scale sampling campaigns, one before and one after the completion of the barrier. The sediment of the sampling stations was fine, well sorted sand, with an average mud content of about 2. 5 %. Only in the Krabbenkreek the sediment was coarser in 1989. The tidal elevation of the sampling sites decreased significantly in 1989. The density of macrozoobenthos was significantly lower, the biomass higher in 1989. The density was dominated by deposit feeders, the biomass by filter feeders. The difference in biomass between both years was mainly due to a substantial increase of the biomass of filter feeders in 1989. The number of species per station was significantly smaller in 1989 than in 1985. Between 1985 and 1989, frequency of occurrence decreased in 34 versus 13 which increased, density increased in 13 species and decreased in 34 species, biomass increased in 18 species and decreased in 29 species. Based on TWINSPAN several clusters of stations, each with a different faunal composition, were identified. These clusters did not form distinct zones on the tidal flats but were dispersed widely. The relationship between density and biomass of different trophic groups and the mud content of the sediment and the depth was analysed. This relationship sometimes differed clearly between years. The correlation coefficient of a multiple regression between density and biomass of individual species and environmental factors, although significant in most cases, was very low, indicating that only a small proportion of the species variability was explained. The relationship between benthos and environmental factors was further analysed by canonical correlation analysis and multivariate discriminant analysis that gave different results for the 1985 and 1989 data. This is probably due to the broad tolerance of the species to the range of the environmental variables found in our study area. From a TWINSPAN of the density data of 1985 and 1989 together we could conclude that, although the environmental parameters in a group of stations, showing a large faunal similarity in one year, did not change, the faunal composition did. This indicates that faunal changes are not necessarily linked to changes in the measured environmental parameters. In the discussion the different factors affecting macrobenthic populations are situated and it is suggested that the macrobenthic populations are probably more towards the nonequilibrium end of the continuum between nonequilibrium and equilibrium communities as defined by Wiens (1984). Although the impact of the {{construction of}} the barrier on the macrobenthic community seems at present to be rather small {{this does not mean that}} on the long-term there will be no effect...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{the mobile}} epifauna of the Oosterschelde estuary, {{collected}} by beam trawl, were compiled from several studies. Multivariate statistical techniques {{brought out the}} fact that the Oosterschelde, when compared with neighbouring areas, has a characteristic epibenthic fauna. Diversity as measured by Hill's diversity numbers N through N +infinite, is higher for the Oosterschelde (N 1 = 4. 5) than for the Voordelta (N 1 = 3. 5) and the Westerschelde (N 1 = 2. 2). Four epifaunal communities can be distinguished within the Oosterschelde, the two most seaward communities being the richest. Annual production is estimated at about 6 gADW m - 2 yr - 1, annual consumption is estimated at over 25 g ADW m - 2 yr - 1. These results are highly dependent on the assumptions. Over 85 % of the epibenthic production and consumption in the Oosterschelde is accounted for by only six species: starfish Asterias rubens, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, bib Trisopterus luscus, brown shrimp Crangon crangon, shore crab Carcinus maenas and dab Limanda limanda. In spite of its abundance, the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus contributes little to the production. From the available data it is difficult {{to assess the impact of}} the construction of the <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> and the compartmentalization dams on the epibenthic fauna. The increase in flatfish in the Hammen area is probably linked to the decrease in current velocities in that area. On the other hand the increase in flatfish in the Hammen area is probably linked to the decrease in current velocities in that area. On the other hand the increase in the gadoids bib and whiting Merlangius merlangus is predominantly due to the stronger year classes in the post-barrier time period. Lower nutrient inputs through the Northern branch, in combination with the increase of the gadoids, may have caused the decline of the brown shrimp in the Oosterschelde. A decrease has also been observed in the sand eel Ammodytes tobianus and the hooknose Agonus cataphractus...|$|E
40|$|Meiofauna composition, abundance, biomass, {{distribution}} and diversity were investigated for 31 stations in summer. The sampling covered the whole Oosterschelde and {{comparisons between the}} subtidal - intertidal and between the western-central - eastern compartment were made. Meiofauna had a community density ranging between 200 and 17 500 ind 10 CM- 2, corresponding to a dry weight of 0. 2 and 8. 4 gm- 2. Abundance ranged between 130 and 17 200 ind 10 CM- 2 for nematodes and between 10 and 1600 ind 10 cm- 2 for copepods. Dry weight biomass of these taxa was between 0. 5 - 7. 0 gm- 2 and 0. 008 - 0. 3 gm- 2 for nematodes and copepods respectively. The meiofauna was strongly dominated by the nematodes (36 - 99 %), who's abundance, biomass and diversity were significantly higher intertidally than subtidally and significantly higher {{in the eastern part}} than in the western part. High numbers were positively correlated with the percentage silt and negatively with the median grain size of the sand fraction. The abundance and diversity of the copepods were highest in the subtidal, but their biomass showed an inverse trend being highest on the tidal flats. The taxa diversity of the meiofauna community and species diversity of both the nematodes and the copepods were higher in subtidal stations than on tidal flats. In the subtidal, the meiofauna and copepod diversity decreased from west to east, whereas nematode diversity increased. The vertical profile clearly reflected the sediment characteristics and could be explained by local hydrodynamic conditions. Seasonal variation was pronounced for the different taxa with peak abundance in spring, summer or autumn and minimum abundance in winter. Changes in tidal amplitude and current velocity enhanced by the <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> will alter the meiofauna community structure. As a result meiofauna will become more important in terms of density and biomass, mainly due to increasing numbers of nematodes, increasing bioturbation, nutrient mineralisation and sustaining bacterial growth. A general decrease in meiofauna diversity is predicted. The number of copepods is expected to decrease and interstitial species will be replaced by epibenthic species, the latter being more important in terms of biomass and as food for the epibenthic macrofauna and fishes...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{data on the}} macrozoobenthos of 8 permanent {{stations in}} the Oosterschelde, during 1983 - 89. Data on abiotic characteristics of the different stations are included. Based on the 11 biomass-dominant species, {{the situation in the}} period before the construction of the <b>storm-surge</b> <b>barrier</b> (1983 - 84) is described. The Cockle (Cerastoderma edule) was dominant in biomass, comprising 21 - 83 % of the total biomass per station (21 - 83 %), except for the high and muddy station 27. The Mudsnail (Hydrobia ulvae dominated in density (48 - 99 %). Total biomass is nearly completely divided over two trophic groups: filter feeders and deposit feeders. A multivariate analysis distinguished two categories of stations, sandy and muddy ones. The former are characterised by Nephtvs hombergii and Lanice conchilega and a dominance of C. edule the latter include Mya arenaria and Scrobicularia plana and very high numbers of H. ulvae Seasonal variation is important over the whole study period and more obvious in deposit feeders than in filter feeders. No overall positive or negative trend in total biomass and biomasses of trophic groups was found. At species level however, some effects of the engineering works can be demonstrated. In 1983 - 84 H. ulvae was numerically dominant in 6 out of 8 stations with more than 10 % of total biomass, while in 1989 this was only true for 3 stations. Scoloplos armiger became as important in relative density as H. ulvae. This polychaete have probably benefited from the decrease of its predator, the frost-sensitive Nephtvs hombergji, a situation which has maintained after the three successive severe winters 1984 - 85, 1985 - 86 and 1986 - 87. Considering not only the 11 biomass-dominating species, effects of the engineering works become more clearly. Tha~ marioni, a species known trom organically enriched, muddy sediments, drastically declined at the sandy stations. Species, characteristic tor dynamic, sandy places like Spio filicornis, Bathyporeia en Urothoe poseidonis increased. This corresponds with the tact that the Roggenplaat and Galgenplaat have lost some of their fine sediment, while wave-action has increased. On the stations with finer sediments, there are no obvious changes except for station 27. which is situated high in the intertidal area. Here, a conspicuous synchronity was found between the increase of opportunistic species/taxa and the decrease in inundation time and temporal silt- enrichment during 1985 - 87. These organisms (Corophium sp., Oligochaeta sp. and Capitella capitata) are characteristic for organically enriched areas and although in terms of biomass unimportant, they seem to be valuable indicators to demonstrate change-effect relationships...|$|E
