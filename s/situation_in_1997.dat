40|$|This publication, {{through its}} focus on maize {{production}} in drought stressed areas of developing countries, explores economic, research, and policy issues related to maize agriculture in marginal areas {{of the developing world}} generally. Key questions in the debate over agriculture in marginal vs. favorable production areas are reviewed with a focus on maize. Questions include whether maize production is expanding into marginal areas, if production from such areas is necessary to meet future demand, and {{what is the relationship between}} marginal production environments and poverty. Different research resource allocations (leading to technological change) are modeled to compare gains and losses to producers and consumers in marginal, favorable, and urban areas of a country. A thorough overview of technical constraints and responses for maize production in drought-stressed environments is also presented. The authors conclude that agricultural research for marginal and, particularly, for drought-stressed areas will continue to be justified on the basis of meeting future demand requirements. Evidence that the marginality of agricultural land is related to poverty is decidedly mixed because of a range of factors outside the realm of agroclimatic conditions. To better determine efficient research allocations, considerably more study in this neglected area will be required. Such research should incorporate data from case studies, and more accurate definition of marginal areas provided by data from geographic information systems, crop modeling, and refined economic measures. The publication concludes with a brief overview of the world maize <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>1997</b> / 98, followed by selected statistics on production, consumption, and trade for all regions of the world.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{boundary layer}} and land surface processes {{play a crucial}} role and affect large-scale phenomena such as monsoons. A comprehensive soil–vegetation parameterization scheme has been developed to understand the complex interaction of the transfer processes, such as heat and moisture within the atmospheric surface layer and the active land layer. In this scheme, attention is given to the accurate representation of soil heat and moisture by considering all three states of water and their phase transitions. This scheme is incorporated in a one-dimensional multilevel boundary layer model for accurate representation of energy exchange processes to study the boundary layer characteristics. Numerical experiments are carried out with this model using special datasets obtained from the Land Surface Processes Experiment (LASPEX- 97) at Anand (22. 48 N, 72. 68 E), a semiarid region of the state of Gujarat in northwest India. For this study, a dry simulation <b>in</b> February <b>1997</b> and a wet <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> July <b>1997</b> are considered. The model-simulated temporal variation of the fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and net radiation and soil temperatures are compared with the available observations.

40|$|Cement is a {{vital and}} {{commonly}} used construction material that requires large amounts of resources and causes significant environmental impact. However, {{there are many different}} types of cement products, roughly ranging from traditional products with a rather linear production to more synergistic alternatives where byproducts are utilized to a large extent. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies indicate the synergistic products are favorable from an environmental perspective. This article has two main aims, where the first is to carry out a LCA and compare three different cement products, involving both linear and synergistic ones to further explore this issue. This has been done from cradle to gate, focusing on climate impact, where the case is a cement production cluster consisting of three plants in Germany. The second aim is to develop and test a simplified LCA model for this production cluster, with the intention to be able to assess additional production alternatives based on the information of a few parameters. The more comprehensive LCA showed that cement products with a high share of byproducts, in this case granulated blast furnace slag from the steel industry, had the best climate performance. The difference between the best (CEM III/B) and worst (CEM I) cement product, regarding global warming potential, was about 66 %. A simplified LCA model was developed and the research team could apply it to compare the present production with the <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>1997</b> and also with possible future production systems. This simplified LCA model was based on 6 key performance indicators, instead of more than 50 parameters, which was the case for the comprehensive LCA model. For example, the simplified model showed that the CO 2 emission related to a virtual average product of the production cluster was reduced about 49 % in the period from 1997 to 2009...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 743 single-lesion {{isolates}} of Phytophthora infestans {{were collected in}} summer 2003 from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Most of the isolates were tested for mating type, and subsets were tested for sensitivity to fungicides and virulence. The ge- netic variation was examined from 200 isolates by SSR microsatellites. Aggressiveness properties, infection efficacy, latency period, lesion growth and spore production was stud- ied from 25 isolates from each four Nordic country. 	 Approximately 60 percent of the isolates were A 1 mating type in each country. Both mating types were present in 40 % of the fields where more than one isolate was tested indicat- ing strong potential for sexual reproduction. The proportion of metalaxyl resistant isolates dropped to under 15 % from the 60 % observed in the early 1990 s in Norway and Finland. A possible reason for the reduction is lowered selection pressure due to decreased use of metalaxyl. Propamocarb-HCl sensitivity remained unchanged in the Nordic countries {{when compared to the}} <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>1997</b> 2000 in Finland. Four isolates collected from Finland and Sweden were able to sporulate in the presence of this fungicide at a concentration of 1000 mg L- 1. 	 In Norway and Finland the frequencies of virulence factors and pathotypes remained nearly unchanged since the 1990 s, but the mean number of virulence factors per isolate increased from 5. 6 to 6. 3. In Denmark and Sweden virulence factors 2 and especially 6 were more common than in Norway and Finland. In addition, in the Swedish population the frequencies of pathotypes were quite even while in other countries pathotype 1. 3. 4. 7. 10. 11 was clearly the most prevalent one. 	 Genetic variation in the Nordic blight population as indicated by 9 SSR markers was con- siderable. 192 isolates out of 200 gave results for seven or more markers. 181 different genotypes were found. Two genotypes occurred twice, two genotypes occurred three times and one genotype was present in six isolates. The differences in aggressiveness between four countries were generally small or inconsistent between the two test cultivars Bintje and Matilda. On the contrary the variation within the countries was substantial. An esti- mated mean length of latent period varied between 80 and 140 - 180 hours, sporulation ca-pacity between 0 and 400 - 1300 sporangia mm- 2 and lesion growth rate nearly zero to 5 - 8 mm day- 1. The frequency of infectious sporangia remained below 1 % in all labs except in Norway preventing making a clear conclusion. High variation in results between the test laboratories emphasizes the need of caution when comparing results obtained by different research groups. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E
