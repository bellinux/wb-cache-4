50|$|Line {{dancing is}} practiced and learned in country-western dance bars, social clubs, dance clubs and ballrooms. It is {{sometimes}} combined on dance programs with {{other forms of}} country-western dance, such as two-step, western promenade dances, and as well as western-style variants of the waltz, polka and <b>swing.</b> <b>Line</b> dances have accompanied many popular music styles since the early 1970s including pop, swing, rock and roll, disco, Latin (salsa suelta), rhythm and blues and jazz.|$|E
5000|$|Held in {{spring-loaded}} pouches in {{the back}} of his costume, Dick carried a pair of eskrima clubs made from an unbreakable polymer that were wielded as both offensive and defensive weapons. Some depictions display these tools with the mechanism to shoot a grappling hook attached to a <b>swing</b> <b>line,</b> while, in other instances, they can act as [...] "line guns" [...] similar to the ones Batman uses. The clubs could also be thrown with such skill by Grayson (and possibly due to their design) that they would ricochet off walls and objects to hit multiple targets, then return to his hands. These clubs also have the capability to be linked together as well as grow in size to make a staff, as depicted in many series, such as Teen Titans Young Justice (Robin uses these weapons).|$|E
50|$|Before {{his death}} in April 2009, Manning had been {{planning}} to celebrate his 95th birthday in May 2009 in New York City at a special Lindy Hop dance event over Memorial Day weekend. The event, {{commonly referred to as}} Frankie Fest or Frankie 95, proceeded without him but in his memory and gathered dancers and instructors from around the world. In anticipation of the event, dance groups from all over the globe posted more than 160 videos to YouTube of local performances of the Shim Sham (a <b>swing</b> <b>line</b> dance long associated with Manning) as well as many videos of a Savoy-style routine choreographed especially for the Frankie 95 celebration by noted swing dancer and Lindy instructor Peter Strom. On Sunday of Frankie 95, attendees attempted to set three Guinness world records in Central Park, including one for the greatest number of people dancing the Shim Sham simultaneously in one place.|$|E

5000|$|Multi-Cube: It is a {{peripheral}} device for Mister Miracle's Mother Box. The cube {{was designed by}} Mister Miracle to use the transmutation power of the Mother Box to create a number of preset mechanisms in its interior. All of these functions are much easier to perform than improvised transmutation. They can be activated in stressful situations. The cube is small enough to be hidden {{in the palm of}} the hand. The multi-cube is not sentient but is still capable of interpreting complex commands and recording data. The multi-cube can fly under its own power and follow the mental commands of Mister Miracle. The cube can use the transmuting power of the Mother Box to create several hundred feet of <b>swing</b> <b>line.</b> Besides the cable, the cube can produce a smoke screen or fire suppression foam. The simplest use of the cube is to generate light effects. The cube can create lifelike holograms, a blinding flash or a laser capable of cutting through a steel cable or handcuff links. In hologram mode the cube can record extended scenes or make a complete holographic recording. It can then manipulate the playback to simulate the subject in motion. The cube can emit a powerful sonic beam that can spring locks or shatter a brick wall. The sound blast can stun an unprotected human.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Highway and {{pavement}} design {{plays an important}} role in the DPR projects. The satisfactory performance of the pavement will result in higher savings in terms of vehicle operating costs and travel time, which has a bearing on the overall economic feasibility of the project. A thorough analysis of the existing pavement is greatly required at this point of time, as an excessive amount of vehicle loads is passing through the project site and it is unknown whether or not the road pavement might sustain its structural integrity. The critical line of equal costs on the plane of CBR versus msa is also identified. This is a <b>swing</b> <b>line</b> which delineates the economic feasibility of two types of pavements. It has been found that the pressure vs settlement curve; pressure vs nodal stress curve; pressure vs element stress curve are linear for small pressure range and then it become nonlinear. More nonlinearity is seen at higher pressure. Hence material nonlinearity must be considered while analysing and designing flexible pavements. This total work includes collection of data analysis various flexible and rigid {{pavement design}}s and their estimation procedure are very much useful to engineer who deals with highways...|$|E
50|$|In January the oiler {{conducted}} two <b>line</b> <b>swings,</b> {{with only}} a two-day turnaround at Subic Bay, before steaming into Singapore on 25 January 1972.

After a port visit to Hong Kong Caliente returned to Subic and the dull but essential logistical support missions.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} five {{big band}} arrangements written {{during a period}} of two semesters from 1998 - 1999. I will provide an overview and performance considerations for each arrangement. Each arrangement uses common conventions such as unison lines, octave doubling, four and five part voicings, found in closed, semi-open, and open position. Approach techniques include diatonic, dominant, diminished, chromatic, and parallel. Choice was based primarily on two considerations: desired texture and the best voice leading options identified to provide each part with a <b>swinging</b> <b>line</b> and maintain melodic integrity. Other conventions applied include chord substitution, upper structure triads, and altered and diminished scales to provide harmonic contrast and color. Each arrangement supplied new challenges and the tunes selected provided the arranger with a diverse experience of styles. The inherent qualities of the melody and harmonic progression of each piece were the primary considerations for selection...|$|R
