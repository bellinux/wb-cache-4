40|$|Radiation {{detectors}} {{are used}} in nuclear security {{in an attempt to}} intercept illicit trafficking of radioactive or nuclear materials. In this field, several types of detectors are used to detect the presence of a source, to measure the exposure rate to men, to locate and to identify it. To test the performance of such detectors, many exposures with a radioactive source are required (typically 60), and the exposures need to be repeated with sources with different gamma-energies, and with neutron-emitting sources. For some tests, combinations of sources are used. IRMM and ITU jointly designed and built an instrument, named "NIR" that can expose a radioactive source for a defined amount of time. The instrument consists of a <b>source</b> <b>holder,</b> mounted on an electrically controlled cylinder. The cylinder pushes the <b>source</b> <b>holder</b> out of a radiation shield, and retracts the holder after the exposure time has elapsed. Unique about this instrument {{is the fact that it}} does not contain a fixed source. Instead, the user can choose any source available and mount it in the <b>source</b> <b>holder.</b> The motion of the <b>source</b> <b>holder</b> is very precisely controlled using a servo motor. It will always come to the same position, following the same motion profile. The instrument can be controlled from a distance using software running on a computer, thereby reducing exposure to operators, as compared to manually executed exposures. The instrument allows to test of several radiation detectors at the same time. The high speed of operation and precision results in a reduced total test time and an increased confidence in the test result. This document is the user manual of the instrument NIR, it contains the original instructions for transport, installation and operation. JRC. D. 5 -Nuclear physic...|$|E

40|$|JRC-Geel is {{a partner}} in the EMRP project named MetroDecom, Metrology for {{decommissioning}} nuclear facilities. The project focusses on the different aspects of metrology applied in the field of decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The commitments of the Radionuclide Metrology Sector of JRC-Geel (RN) were to conduct part of the work to be carried out in WP 5 Development of reference materials and standard sources. In Task 1 reference materials and standard sources for segregation of materials and for free release measurements needed to be produced and characterised. From a standard solution a mother dilution was made to obtain a solution with an activity concentration of around 100 Bq per 20 μL. The solution was dispensed in the cavity of 1120 metallic <b>source</b> <b>holders</b> making use of a precision pattern dispenser. After evaporation of the liquid, the cavity of the CMI <b>source</b> <b>holders</b> was mechanically closed. Before and during the source preparation, check sources in the shape of aluminium pills were produced in order to monitor the stability of the activity concentration of the mother solution. The activity of all the sources was determined by gamma-ray spectroscopic measurements using a NaI-well detector. Some outliers were identified and 1100 sources with certified activity content were selected and made available for further use in Work Package 2 of the project. On the basis of the activity calculations it can be stated that sources were successfully prepared according to the specifications and will be used as calibration standards for the calibration of a free release measurement facility to measure radioactive waste. They can also be used as calibration standard for the calibration of waste segregation facilities. One of the deliverables in the task was to develop a reference material for the calibration of a free release facility and testing facility for segregation of waste. The sources are in the form of 1100 steel and 1100 plastic balls with point sources of 152 Eu and 60 Co inside. The task of RN was to produce and standardise the 1100 60 Co point sources in a form of metal holders containing around 100 Bq of 60 Co each. These metallic <b>source</b> <b>holders</b> can be inserted in metallic or plastic balls in order to simulate contaminated waste. The sources were successfully produced using an precision pattern dispenser, and standardised by measuring them in the 20. 3 X 20. 3 cm NaI-well detector. The standardised sources together with the certificate stating their activities were made available for further use in the project. JRC.

The SDD is well suited for measuring low-energy x rays and electrons emitted from thin radioactive sources with low self-absorption. The attainable energy resolution is better than 0. 5 keV for electrons of 30 keV. It {{has been used to}} measure the conversion electron spectra of three plutonium isotopes, i. e. 238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu, as well as 241 Am (being a decay product of 241 Pu).

A 250 micro c source, deposited on a 2. 54 micron thick aluminized mylar, is sandwiched between two (2. 54 cm x 2. 54 cm x 0. 0127 cm) tungsten pieces.

40|$|Directive 95 / 46 /EC is the Directive {{to protect}} {{personal}} {{data in the}} European Union, this Directive is implemented in national legislation. The interpretation of this Directive is different in the various Member States, this hinders the internal market of the European Union. The research shows the differences in EU Member States {{when it comes to}} considering geographic data as personal data. The used definition is the definition in Directive 95 / 46 /EC on the processing of personal data. Governments {{play an important role in}} the opening of geographic data. Governmental bodies produce a lot of geographic data and with two Directives on the reuse of governmental data, the EU supports the opening up of data by supporting reuse policies. It is an obligation for governments to open up the data necessary for their public task, so the data can be reused. The differences between Member States stem from the differences in interpretations on when geographic data leads to identifiability of a natural person. The research is based on four different EU Member States, The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom. Four key stakeholders (Data <b>source</b> <b>holder,</b> Legislator, Data Protection Authority and, Jurisprudence) are identified and their opinions or judgements on the interpretations of the extent to which geodata should be considered personal data are analysed. The focus of the thesis is on two types of geographic data: Mobile mapping, geographic data collected from a movable object is considered and secondly the INSPIRE themes of topographic maps and building registers are assessed. The research found a variety of interpretations of data protection legislation to geographic data. The variety was found among the different cases (EU and Member States), the different stakeholders and the different types of geographic data. The EU, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom are case-studies in this research. An example of the differences is that in the Netherlands the Data Protection Authority states that panoramic images of streets are considered personal data. In the discussions on the processing of 360 degrees images of houses within the Parliament the legislation does not mention the use of Google Street View and jurisprudence judges that dissemination of these images is possible when certain features are blurred and there is no link to an address. This shows that there are differences between the actors inside the Member States on to which extent geographic data is considered personal data. Another example is the studied topographic datasets. The datasets do not contain personal data, according to the Dutch Data Protection Authority, while the German Data Protection Authority and the Belgian Data Protection Authority judge that topographic maps of a large scale can contain personal data, and have requirements for the processing of topographic maps. The patchwork of differences in data protection legislation can be harmonised by using a traffic light model. This model uses another definition of personal data. It has a focus on the context of processing of the data and categorizes the data from non-identified data to identified sensitive data, in this way access to the data is categorized. This categorization is based on an assessment of the processing of the data. This leads to a more harmonised interpretation of personal data definition...|$|E

40|$|Beta {{contamination}} {{is monitored}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) with portable handheld probes and their associated counters, smear counters, air-breathing continuous air monitors (CAM), personnel contamination monitors (PCM), and {{hand and foot}} monitors (HFM). The response of these monitors was measured using a set of anodized-aluminum beta sources for the five isotopes: Carbon- 14, Technetium- 99, Cesium- 137, Chlorine- 36 and Strontium/Yttrium- 90. The surface emission rates of the sources are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with a precision of one relative standard deviation equal to 1. 7 %. All measurements were made in reproducible geometry, mostly using aluminum <b>source</b> <b>holders.</b> All counts, significantly above background, were collected to a precision of 1 % or better. The study of the hand-held probes included measurements of six air gaps from 0. 76 to 26. 2 mm. The energy response of the detectors is well-parameterized {{as a function of}} the average beta energy of the isotopes (C 14 = 50 keV, Tc 99 = 85, Cs 137 = 188, C 136 = 246, and Sr/Y 90 = 934). The authors conclude that Chlorine- 36 is a suitable beta emitter for routine calibration. They recommend that a pancake Geiger-Mueller (GM) or gas-proportional counter be used for primarily beta contamination surveys with an air gap not to exceed 6 mm. Energy response varies about 30 % from Tc 99 to Sr/Y 90 for the pancake GM detector. Dual alpha/beta probes have poor to negligible efficiency for low-energy betas.

30|$|Opinion <b>source</b> or <b>holder</b> is {{the person}} or the source who {{presents}} the opinion (Liu 2010). The opinion source is important when authenticating the opinion {{as well as the}} strength, application and classification of the opinion, as the quality and reliability of an opinion is greatly dependent on the source of that opinion. The opinion topic or the target refers to the person, object, feature, event or topic about which the opinion is expressed. To compare or summarize the comments, it is necessary to automatically identify and extract those topics that are discussed in the feedback. To identify topics at the sentence or document level, the system should be able to identify evaluative expressions (Popescu and Etzioni 2005; Hu and Liu 2004). Moreover, some topics are not explicitly presented, but rather, they are predicted from term semantics, also referred to as implicit features. A background study reveals that the process of opinion topic or target extraction involves various natural language processing tasks and techniques such as pre-processing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, noise removal, feature selection and classification.|$|R

5000|$|The {{basic parts}} of a {{spectrophotometer}} are a light <b>source,</b> a <b>holder</b> for the sample, a diffraction grating in a monochromator or a prism to separate the different wavelengths of light, and a detector. The radiation source is often a Tungsten filament (300-2500 nm), a deuterium arc lamp, which is continuous over the ultraviolet region (190-400 nm), Xenon arc lamp, which is continuous from 160-2,000 nm; or more recently, light emitting diodes (LED) for the visible wavelengths. The detector is typically a photomultiplier tube, a photodiode, a photodiode array or a charge-coupled device (CCD). Single photodiode detectors and photomultiplier tubes are used with scanning monochromators, which filter the light so that only light of a single wavelength reaches the detector at one time. The scanning monochromator moves the diffraction grating to [...] "step-through" [...] each wavelength so that its intensity may be measured {{as a function of}} wavelength. Fixed monochromators are used with CCDs and photodiode arrays. As both of these devices consist of many detectors grouped into one or two dimensional arrays, they are able to collect light of different wavelengths on different pixels or groups of pixels simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|The European Commission Joint Research Centre in Geel (JRC-Geel) is on {{a regular}} basis {{preparing}} radioactive sources. These sources can be used as calibration standards or reference sources in different applications, e. g. proficiency testing of laboratories monitoring radioactivity in the environment organized by JRC-Geel. In order to automate the sample preparation process a precision pattern dispenser was designed to reproducibly dispense radioactive solutions. The set-up should be able to dispense pre-set amounts of stock solution in an automated and reproducible way in predefined positions or patterns. Correct dispensing should be ensured by defining the positions of ampoules or special <b>source</b> <b>holders</b> precisely. The set-up must also be able to dispense pre-set amount of liquid according to designed patterns on air filters having a maximum size of 60 x 60 cm. During all manipulations no evaporation of stock solution can be afforded in order not to compromise its concentration. The liquids to be handled are mainly acidic solutions so all parts must be resistant to the acidic environment. The number of instrument parts that come in contact with the radioactive solution must be kept to a minimum to limit the amount of radioactive waste and should be easily replaceable. The precision pattern dispenser is composed of a commercially available sample handling unit that makes use of syringes to handle the liquid. This unit is coupled to an XYZ-table where e. g. air filters can be fixed on. A custom-made interface (protocol generator software) is used to design dispensing patterns on filters of different sizes and shapes. The combination of the filter and the pattern, called protocol, is sent to the software steering the sampling unit and the XYZ-table. The mass or volume to be dispensed and the position where it has to be dispensed is easily introducible and made visible in the protocol generator. Qualification tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the instrument and to assess the compliance with the requirements. The two most important parameters to be tested were trueness and precision. The maximum values according to the specifications were 2 % for trueness and 1 % for precision. Tests were performed by dispensing water into glass ampoules. All other parameters described above were examined and found to be compliant with the specifications. The results of the tests demonstrate that the precision pattern dispenser can dispense liquid within the required specifications. The instrument can be used to spike air filters with an almost homogenous distribution of activity within a predefined area. The precision pattern dispenser makes it possible to prepare sources for different applications in a fast and accurate way. JRC. G. 2 -Standards for Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguar...|$|R

Additional Keyphrases: inorganic phosphorus and total protein measurements. absorptiometry The Potentiophotometer is a simple instrument, consisting of focused light <b>source,</b> cuvet <b>holder,</b> photo-voltaic cell, constant power source, two potentiometers, and a metering device. The photovoltaic cell and con-stant power source are arranged in series opposition (i. e., with like pole to like pole) so that {{the output of the}} photovoltaic cell is subtracted from the output of the constant power source. The two potentiometers (voltage dividers) appropriately expand the output of the dif-ference between the constant power source and the photovoltaic cell. Because the photovoltaic cell output varies logarithmically and inversely with the concen-tration of the substance being measured, and the power source output is constant, the operation may be ex-pressed as K- log T, where K is a constant and T is transmittance. This constitutes the electrical analog solution to Beer’s law, C 2 - log %T, where C is the concentration of the substance being measured. The potentiometers, when appropriately set, multiply the Beer’s law equation so that it is properly proportioned and C = k(2 - log %T), where the values of k and 2 are determined by the potentiometer settings.

5000|$|There are {{two basic}} types of {{microinjection}} systems. The first is called a constant flow system {{and the second is}} called a pulsed flow system. In a constant flow system, which is relatively simple and inexpensive though clumsy and outdated, a constant flow of a sample is delivered from a micropipette and the amount of the sample which is injected is determined by how long the needle remains in the cell. This system typically requires a regulated pressure <b>source,</b> a capillary <b>holder,</b> and either a coarse or a fine micromanipulator. A pulsed flow system, however, allows for greater control and consistency over the amount of sample injected: the most common arrangement for intracytoplasmic sperm injection includes an Eppendorf [...] "Femtojet" [...] injector coupled with an Eppendorf [...] "InjectMan", though procedures involving other targets usually take advantage of much less expensive equipment of similar capability. Because of its increased control over needle placement and movement and in addition to the increased precision over the volume of substance delivered, the pulsed flow technique usually results in less damage to the receiving cell than the constant flow technique. However, the Eppendorf line, at least, has a complex user interface and its particular system components are usually much more expensive than those necessary to create a constant flow system or than other pulsed flow injection systems.|$|R
40|$|We revisit in L 2 -spaces the autoconvolution {{equation}} x ∗ x = y with solutions {{which are}} real-valued or complex-valued functions x(t) defined on a finite real interval, say t ∈ [0, 1]. Such operator equations of quadratic type occur in physics of spectra, in optics and in stochastics, often {{as part of}} a more complex task. Because of their weak nonlinearity deautoconvolution problems are not seen as difficult and hence little attention is paid to them wrongly. In this paper, we will indicate on the example of autoconvolution a deficit in low order convergence rates for regularized solutions of nonlinear ill-posed operator equations F(x) =y with solutions x† in a Hilbert space setting. So for the real-valued version of the deautoconvolution problem, which is locally ill-posed everywhere, the classical convergence rate theory developed for the Tikhonov regularization of nonlinear ill-posed problems reaches its limits if standard source conditions using the range of F (x†) ∗ fail. On the other hand, convergence rate results based on <b>Hölder</b> <b>source</b> conditions with small Hölder exponent and logarithmic source conditions or on the method of approximate source conditions are not applicable since qualified nonlinearity conditions are required which cannot be shown for the autoconvolution case according to current knowledge. We also discuss the complex-valued version of autoconvolution with full data on [0, 2] and see that ill-posedness must be expected if unbounded amplitude functions are admissible. As a new detail, we present situations of local well-posedness if the domain of the autoconvolution operator is restricted to complex L 2 -functions with a fixed and uniformly bounded modulus function...|$|R
40|$|In England & Wales, {{the number}} of people leaving prison subject to a period of {{supervision}} in the community has almost doubled in the last decade. The significant and consistent upward trend in {{the number of}} people ‘on licence’ has been accompanied by another notable trend: an increasing number of people being recalled to prison for breaching the terms and conditions of their licence. Yet, despite these two important trends, there has been a dearth of research on post-custodial supervision. This thesis explores post-custodial supervision from the perspective of those on licence. In particular, it explores licencees' perceptions of the legitimacy of probation and hostel workers, and considers how these perceptions were shaped. Understanding licencees' perceptions of the legitimacy of power holders is important, since previous research has consistently identified a relationship between people's perceptions of power holder legitimacy and their willingness to comply with rules and cooperate with those in power. Empirical fieldwork was conducted in three Approved Premises in England, including periods of observation and interviews with hostel residents and members of hostel staff. Based on this fieldwork, I identified two fundamental <b>sources</b> of power <b>holder</b> legitimacy: procedure-based and outcome-based legitimacy. Overall, I argue that licencees' perceptions of procedure-based legitimacy were pivotal, since they formed the basis of constructive relationships between licencees and power holders (e. g. probation and hostel workers). In turn, these relationships could play a significant role in helping licencees to reintegrate into their communities, thus contributing to licencees' perceptions of power holder outcome-based legitimacy. The thesis rides on a tide of legitimacy research that has already served to illuminate the fields of policing and other forms of penal sanction. While research to date has primarily utilised quantitative data to explore perceptions of legitimacy, the current research highlights the role that qualitative data can play in this regard. The thesis aims not only to increase our understanding of a neglected area of penology, but also to contribute to the development of theories of legitimacy. ...|$|R
