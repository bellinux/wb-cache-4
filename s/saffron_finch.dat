50|$|The orange-fronted yellow finch (Sicalis columbiana) is {{a species}} of South American bird in the family Thraupidae. It has a highly disjunct {{distribution}} with S. c. columbiana found in Colombia and Venezuela, S. c. goeldii along the Amazon River in Brazil, and S. c. goeldii in east-central Brazil. It is found in semi-open areas, typically near water and sometimes near humans. The male closely resembles the <b>saffron</b> <b>finch,</b> but it is smaller, has a more contrasting orange front, and dusky lores. The female is overall olive-gray with whitish underparts, and yellow to the wings and tail.|$|E
40|$|Visual and {{auditory}} cues {{play an important}} role in promoting behavioral synchronization. Captive <b>saffron</b> <b>finches</b> (Sicalis flaveola, Passeriformes, Emberizidae) confronted with a steady size of food patch, fly to the ground more often and remain longer on it when bird density is higher. The observed effect, independently of being triggered by sensory cues resulting from more birds, may be a consequence of the increased competitiveness required by the situation. In this paper we have tested this hypothesis. We held birds in a steady group size and describe their decision to join a group at the ground at successive intervals, when variable food patch size was offered. We found that the smallest food patch size promoted the largest group size of birds on the ground. Analyses of the time domain showed that when the smallest food patch size was available, decisions to join the group on the ground were made at shorter time intervals. Apparently, birds are capable of adjusting their decisions according to the perceived competitiveness of the situation. Index terms: Decision. Time series. Social facilitation.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{geographic}} {{overlap between}} areas of Atlantic rainforest and human activities allows interactions to occur {{between humans and}} wild and domestic animals. Despite the great importance of the domestic animal-wildlife-human interface that occurs at poultry farms {{in terms of public}} health, economic production and wildlife conservation, there are few studies in Brazil examining the distribution and health of wild birds that interact with poultry farms. From January to December 2010, mist nets were used to capture 166 free-ranging birds that were within close proximity to three poultry farms in Atlantic rainforest remnants in south-eastern Brazil. The species composition was examined, and molecular methods were used to test for avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. The avian communities near the poultry farms were dominated by three synanthropic species, which corresponded to 70 % of all captured individuals: house sparrows Passer domesticus (33 %), <b>saffron</b> <b>finches</b> (Sicalis flaveola) (22 %), and ruddy ground-doves (Columbina talpacoti) (15 %). These predominant bird species were in poor body condition (27 %), were infested with feather mites (43 %), or presented both conditions (23 %). No evidence of infection by avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus or M. gallisepticum was identified in any of the studied birds. Although no evidence of the studied pathogens was, our findings demonstrate that differences in the environmental characteristics and biosecurity practices influence the wild bird community near poultry farms, which in turn may affect the health status of these synanthropic birds and strengthen their role in the transmission of pathogens...|$|R
50|$|Typically nesting in cavities, the <b>saffron</b> <b>finch</b> {{makes use}} of sites such as {{abandoned}} rufous hornero (Furnarius rufus) nests, bamboo branches and under house roofs - this species is tolerant of human proximity, appearing at suburban areas and frequenting bird tables. They have a pleasant but repetitious song which, combined with their appearance, has led to them being kept as caged birds in many areas. Males are polygamous, mating with two females during the nesting season, and territorial, {{which has led to}} the species being used for blood sporting with two males put in a cage in order to fight.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the islands}} bird species are found within this zone, {{including}} many species only endemic to the Azores, such as chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs moreletti), the western Azores goldcrest (Regulus regulus azoricus), and the <b>saffron</b> <b>finch</b> (Serinus canaria), {{in addition to the}} local common buzzard (Buteo buteo rothschildi). The caldera is one of the better locations to explore and observe the natural vegetation of the Portuguese islands, marked by laurissilva forests and humid climates. A pedestrian trail to the caldera floor, permits a three-and-a-half-hour journey at a medium-to-high level of difficulty, while encountering a botanical diversity that has been little influenced by human imprints.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>saffron</b> <b>finch</b> [...] (Sicalis flaveola) is a tanager from South America that {{is common}} in open and semi-open areas in {{lowlands}} outside the Amazon Basin. They have a wide distribution in Colombia, northern Venezuela (where it is called [...] "canario de tejado" [...] or [...] "roof canary"), western Ecuador, western Peru, eastern and southern Brazil (where it is called [...] "canário da terra" [...] or [...] "native canary"), Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, northern Argentina, and Trinidad and Tobago. It has also been introduced to Hawaii, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Although commonly regarded as a canary, it {{is not related to}} the Atlantic canary. Formerly, it was placed in the Emberizidae but it is close to the seedeaters. The male is bright yellow with an orange crown which distinguishes it from most other yellow finches (the exception being the orange-fronted yellow finch). The females are more confusing and are usually just a slightly duller version of the male, but in the southern subspecies S. f. pelzelni they are olive-brown with heavy dark streaks.|$|E
40|$|Several {{animals of}} the Atlantic Forest depend on natural {{cavities}} for reproduction, shelter or feeding. Some {{aspects of their}} ecology can be examined {{with the use of}} nesting boxes. This study was developed with 48 nesting boxes confectioned with “Tetra Pak” package. Four areas of the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil, in four different successional stages, were sampled from August 2001 to August 2003. We aimed to verify: 1) the occupation of nesting boxes by small vertebrates, 2) the preference of the species for nesting boxes fixed at 2 or 4 m above the ground and for the position of the entrance hole (frontal or lateral), and 3) the viability of use of these nesting boxes in field research. Four species were found in the boxes: a tree frog (Hyla sp., one occupation), a green lizard (Enyalius iheringi, one occupation), the <b>saffron</b> <b>finch</b> (Sicalis flaveola, twenty-three occupations), and the wooly tailed mouse opossum (Micoureus paraguayanus, five occupations). Most occupations occurred in areas of early successional stages. There were no preferences for the height and position of the entrance hole. The nesting boxes proved to be relatively durable and useful in field research on small cavity-dependent vertebrates...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was performed aiming {{to describe the}} origin {{and the distribution of}} the celiac artery in 30 Saffron finches (Sicalis flaveola), through the completion of their circulatory system with an aqueous solution of colored latex, followed by fixation in formol for later dissection of the collateral branches. The celiac artery originated from the descending branch of the aorta, representing its first visceral branch, and was directed to the right antimere of the coelomic cavity. After issuance of the proventricular dorsal artery and the splenic artery, the celiac bifurcated in left and right branches: In all observed finches the left branch originated the proventricular ventral artery, from its left side, and the gastroduodenal and ventral gastric arteries from its right side, in order to continue as the left gastric artery characterizing it as a terminal branch; from its right side, the right branch issued, as first collateral, the right hepatic artery in all observed birds, to originate, from its opposite side, the right gastric and ileal, immediately continuing as pancreaticoduodenal, its terminal branch. From this study, we concluded that the <b>Saffron</b> <b>finch</b> follows the same pattern regarding the origin and distribution of the celiac artery proposed for birds of the genus Gallus, Anas, Columba, Crax, Mitu, and Amazona.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of Cryptosporidium species and genotypes in birds kept in captivity in Brazil. A total of 966 samples from 18 families of birds was collected and stored in 5 % potassium dichromate solution at 4 degrees C until processing. Oocysts were purified in Sheather sugar solution following extraction of genomic DNA. Molecular analyses were performed using nested-PCR for amplification of fragments of the 18 S subunit of rRNA gene and of the actin gene. Amplification of Cryptosporidium DNA fragments was obtained in 47 (4. 86 %) samples. Sequencing of amplified fragments and phylogenetic analyses allowed the identification of Cryptosporidium baileyi in a black vulture (Coragyps atratus), a domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) and a <b>saffron</b> <b>finch</b> (Sicalis flaveola); Cryptosporidium galli in canaries (Serinus canaria), a cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) and lesser seed-finches (Oryzoborus angolensis); Cryptosporidium meleagridis in a domestic chicken (G. g. domesticus); Cryptosporidium parvum in a cockatiel (N. hollandicus); Cryptosporidium avian genotype I in a canary (S. canaria) and an Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus); Cryptosporidium avian genotype II in ostriches (Struthio camelus) and Cryptosporidium avian genotype III in a cockatiel (N. hollandicurs) and a peach-faced lovebird (Agapornis roseicolis).

40|$|SUMMARY: Circovirus are viral {{agents that}} cause disease in avian species. The main {{clinical}} {{symptoms of the}} disease are immunosuppression and, in young birds feather disorders. In neonates, the disease is known as "black spot " and characterized by abdo-minal enlargement, hepatobiliar congestion and failure to thrive. Also, it was observed in adult infected birds with other symptoms and clinical signs, such as enteritis, sinusitis, rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchopneumonia, myocarditis, nephritis, splenitis, dyspnea, anorexia, depression leading to high mortality. In April 2008, 317 <b>saffron</b> <b>finch</b> were apprehended during an illegal commercialization and were forwarded to the Wild Animals Recovery Center of the Tiete Ecological Park. Subsequently, 101 (31. 66 %) died and 20 of these were selected {{and sent to the}} Laboratory of Electron Microscopy, Biological Institute of São Paulo, Brazil to investigate possible etiological agents. After necropsy of these animals fragments of lung, liver and small intestine were processed using negative staining and resin embedding techniques. On the transmission electron microscopy, the negative staining technique allowed observation in 20 (100 %) samples of liver suspension, a great number of particles with morphology similar to the circovirus, spherical, non-enveloped, isometric, characterized as "complete " and "empty ", measuring between 17 and 20 nm in diameter. By the resin embedding technique, oval or rounded viral intracytoplasmatic inclusion bodies, containing viral particles disposed in paracrystalline arrays or loose arrangements were observed in ultrathin sections on the 20 (100 %) samples of liver suspension. This is the first report on the presence of circovirus i...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{wild and}} {{domestic}} birds, cryptosporidiosis is {{often associated with}} infections by Cryptosporidium galli, Cryptosporidium baileyi and Cryptosporidium meleagridis. In addition to these species, a number of avian Cryptosporidium species yet to be fully characterized are commonly found among exotic and wild avian isolates. The present study aimed to detect and identify samples of Cryptosporidium spp. from free-living wild birds, in order to contribute to the knowledge of the variability of this parasite in the free-living population of Brazil. Stool samples were collected from 242 birds, with the following proportions of individuals: 50 Emberizidae (20. 7 %), 112 Psittacidae (46. 3 %), 44 Cardinalidae (18. 2 %), 12 Turdidae (5. 0 %), eight Ramphastidae (3. 3 %), seven Icteridae (2. 9 %), three Estrilididae (1. 2 %), two Contigidae (0. 8 %), two Thraupidae (0. 8 %) and two Fringilidae (0. 8 %). Among the 242 fecal samples from wild birds, 16 (6. 6 %) were positive for the presence of oocysts of Cryptosporidium. Molecular characterization of the 16 samples of Cryptosporidium, were performed with phylogenetic reconstructions employing 292 positions of 18 S rDNA. None of the samples of birds was characterized as C. meleagridis. C. galli was identified in one rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris), five green-winged saltators (Saltator similis), one slate-coloured seedeater (Sporophila schistacea), one goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) and three saffron finches (Sicalis flaveola). One goldfinch isolate, one buffy-fronted seedeater (Sporophila frontalis), one red-cowled cardinal (Paroaria dominicana) and one other <b>saffron</b> <b>finch</b> (S. flaveola) were identified as C. baileyi. Avian genotype II was found in an isolate from a white-eyed parakeet (Aratinga leucophthalma). Clinical symptoms of cryptosporidiosis in birds have already been described and the number of wild birds which were shedding parasites was high. Therefore, further epidemiological research and disease surveillance of birds in the wild is warranted...|$|E
