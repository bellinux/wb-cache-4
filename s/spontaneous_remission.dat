25|$|When untreated, the {{prognosis}} for ORS is generally poor.

The most significant risk is suicide.|$|E

25|$|Many {{cases of}} ITP {{can be left}} untreated, and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>remission</b> (especially in children) is not uncommon. However, counts of under 50,000 are usually {{monitored}} with regular blood tests, and those with counts of under 10,000 are usually treated, as the risk of serious spontaneous bleeding is high with such a low platelet count. Any patient experiencing severe bleeding symptoms is also usually treated. The threshold for treating ITP has decreased since the 1990s; hematologists recognize that patients rarely spontaneously bleed with platelet counts greater than 10,000, although there are documented exceptions to this observation.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{previously}} assumed that placebo response rates {{in patients with}} chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are unusually high, [...] "at least 30% to 50%", because of the subjective reporting of symptoms and the fluctuating nature of the condition. According to a meta-analysis and contrary to conventional wisdom, the pooled response rate {{in the placebo group}} was 19.6%, even lower than in some other medical conditions. The authors offer possible explanations for this result: CFS is widely understood to be difficult to treat, which could reduce expectations of improvement. In context of evidence showing placebos do not have powerful clinical effects when compared to no treatment, a low rate of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>remission</b> in CFS could contribute to reduced improvement rates in the placebo group. Intervention type also contributed to the heterogeneity of the response. Low patient and provider expectations regarding psychological treatment may explain particularly low placebo responses to psychiatric treatments.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To seek {{clinical}} features that reliably distinguish psychogenic tremor (PT) from essential tremor (ET). BACKGROUND: PT is often manifested by shaking characterized by variable amplitude and frequency, distractibility, suggestibility, and entrainment. The {{sensitivity and specificity}} of these findings in differentiating PT and ET have not been systematically examined. METHODS: Patient information was obtained with {{special attention to the}} mode of onset of tremor, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>remissions,</b> family history, and employment history. A “blinded ” rater evaluated video segments of subjects assessed in a standardized protocol for tremor at rest, while holding an anti-gravity posture, during activity, and for evidence of distractibility, suggestibility, or entrainment. RESULTS: A total of 45 subjects with ET or PT were enrolled in this study: 33 met clinical criteria for ET {{with a mean age of}} 56. 8 ± 17. 0 years and 12 met clinical criteria for PT with a mean age of 42. 5 ± 11. 0 years. PT subjects were significantly more likely to relay a history of sudden onset (p= 0. 03), <b>spontaneous</b> <b>remissions</b> (p= 0. 03), and shorter duration of tremor (p= 0. 001). Family history of tremor was significantly more common in the ET group (p= 0. 001). A moderate-to-marked degree of distraction with alternate finger tapping (p= 0. 01) and mental concentration on serial 7 s (p= 0. 01) was more common in PT. Furthermore, suggestibility with a tuning fork (p= 0. 04) and exacerbation with hyperventilation (p= 0. 06) seemed predictive of PT. Entrainment was not different in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A history of tremor with sudden onset and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>remissions</b> along with distractibility and suggestibility on examination are good predictors of PT and help differentiate it from ET...|$|R
50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is {{a matter}} of debate. There are ongoing investigations to determine whether LCH is a reactive (non-cancerous) or neoplastic (cancerous) process. Arguments supporting the reactive nature of LCH include the occurrence of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>remissions,</b> the extensive secretion of multiple cytokines by dendritic cells and bystander-cells (a phenomenon known as cytokine storm) in the lesional tissue, favorable prognosis and relatively good survival rate in patients without organ dysfunction or risk organ involvement.|$|R

40|$|In {{pediatric}} acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML), cytogenetic abnormalities are strong indicators of prognosis. Some recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, such as t(8; 16) (p 11;p 13), are so rare that collaborative studies are required to define their prognostic impact. We collected the clinical characteristics, morphology, and immunophenotypes of 62 pediatric AML patients with t(8; 16) (p 11;p 13) from 18 countries participating in the International Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (I-BFM) AML study group. We used the AML-BFM cohort diagnosed from 1995 - 2005 (n = 543) as a reference cohort. Median age of the pediatric t(8; 16) (p 11;p 13) AML patients was significantly lower (1. 2 years). The majority (97 %) had M 4 -M 5 French-American-British type, {{significantly different from the}} reference cohort. Erythrophagocytosis (70 %), leukemia cutis (58 %), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (39 %) occurred frequently. Strikingly, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>remissions</b> occurred in 7 neonates with t(8; 16) (p 11;p 13), of whom 3 remain in continuous remission. The 5 -year overall survival of patients diagnosed after 1993 was 59 %, similar to the reference cohort (P =. 14). Gene expression profiles of t(8; 16) (p 11;p 13) pediatric AML cases clustered close to, but distinct from, MLL-rearranged AML. Highly expressed genes included HOXA 11, HOXA 10, RET, PERP, and GGA 2. In conclusion, pediatric t(8; 16) (p 11;p 13) AML is a rare entity defined by a unique gene expression signature and distinct clinical features in whom <b>spontaneous</b> <b>remissions</b> occur in a subset of neonatal cases...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>spontaneous</b> <b>remissions</b> may rarely {{occur in}} B-cell chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (B-CLL), T cells do generally not develop a clinically significant response against B-CLL cells. Because this T-cell anergy against B-CLL cells {{may be caused by}} the inability of B-CLL cells to present tumor-antigens efficiently, we examined the possibility of upregulat-ing critical costimulatory (B 7 - 1 and B 7 - 2) and adhesion molecules (ICAM- 1 and LFA- 3) on B-CLL cells to improve antigen presentation. The stimulation of B-CLL cells via CD 40 by culture on CD 40 L expressing feeder cells induced a strong upregulation of costimulatory and adhesion molecules and turned the B-CLL cells into efficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs). CD 40 -activated B-CLL (CD 40 -CLL) cells stimulated the proliferation of both CD 41 and CD 81 T cells. Interestingly, stimulation of allogeneic versus autologous T cells resulte...|$|R
