40|$|No single energy {{resource}} can sustainably meet the energy demands of any country. Integrating all exploitable energy sources {{is a viable}} way of achieving <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> energy <b>supply</b> for Nigeria. Hence, the paper focuses {{on the role of}} energy mix in sustainable development of Nigeria. Secondary data was analyzed using linear regression (Ordinary Least Square) estimation procedure to measure the impact of existing energy mix (crude oil, coal and electricity) on sustainable development of Nigeria. Granger causality test was also used to ascertain whether growth in per capita energy consumption influenced growth in per capita carbon emissions in Nigeria. Empirical results indicate that existing energy mix has not significantly influenced sustainable development given that electricity generation is inadequate and coal is no longer in use. Results also show that per capita increase in oil consumption resulted in per capita increase in carbon emission and global warming. Exploitable energy sources were however identified in anticipation that an integrated energy plan with emphasis on renewable energy sources for off-grid areas would promote <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> energy <b>supply</b> and sustainable development...|$|R

It is in a way that in one period there has been a considerable increase in housing price and in another period reduction of prices or relatively high and comprehensive stability has been dominant on the housing price and thus considerable changes have been appeared in the housing sector and finally in the whole economy. the main research question is proposed in this way: what is the effect of financial debts on price <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> the <b>supply</b> of housing? <b>In</b> this study, therefore, was to investigate the effects of financial debts on stability or instability of prices <b>in</b> the <b>supply</b> of housing.

40|$|The {{level of}} food {{security}} in Africa is mainly dependent on climate, poverty, national security, infrastructure {{and efficiency of}} production. Efforts at improving food security have been aimed at providing food aid {{which has been a}} disincentive to commercial producers and detracted from, the real need for their development. Aid in the form of cash to the destitute will be a far great incentive to local development, production and consequently food security. The role of commercial producers in food security has been underplayed and will contribute the major input to the three dimensions of food security, namely food supply at national and local levels, <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>supply</b> and providing physical and economic access to food. Efforts by government who have social objectives have been ineffective at bringing subsistence farmers into commercial production. Only a few subsistence farmers want to commercialise and this will only be brought about through companies with commercial objectives. These companies will identify those with the necessary entrepreneurial spirit and assist them to settle on land with effective supports systems. The initial pilot projects indicate that with correct selection procedures based particularly on entrepreneurial spirit these emerging commercial farmers can compete extremely well with established commercial farmers. The efforts by the FAO in appreciating the realities of aid and its effect in Africa and consequently changing direction back towards rehabilitation and development is acknowledged. ...|$|R

40|$|Background This is {{the first}} {{in-depth}} study of the illicit human organ trade in the Philippines. The question for analytical investigation is why the underground organ commerce thrives, despite meager support and compensation for commercial donors (or vendors). Methods Quantitative survey results were obtained from a probability sample of living Filipino kidney vendors (P 0. 95; a 0. 05). The kidney trade was studied because it has {{the highest level of}} demand among all tradeable human organs in the Philippines and globally. Results The study finds that deflated vendor compensation, lower than global kidney purchase prices, and relative <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> kidney <b>supply</b> obtain from a combination of the socio-economic characteristics of Filipino vendors and the asymmetric information available to them. The high degree of ambiguity and continuity between legitimate organ donations and underground buy-and-sell operations poses major challenges to effective regulation and law enforcement {{on the part of the}} Philippine government. Conclusions Any reform effort will need to effectively address the fine distinction between two different but overlapping organ procurement markets, and brokered trading, with minimal transaction costs, based on asymmetric information.

40|$|Summary Project {{objectives}} This study {{fits into}} a larger research project on logistics collaboration and outsourcing decisions. The final objective of this larger project is to analyze the logistics collaboration decision in more detail to identify thresholds in these decisions. To reach the overall objectives, {{the first step is}} to get a clearer picture on the chemical and logistics service providers industry, sectors of our study, and on logistics collaboration in these sectors. The results of this first phase are presented in this report. Project Approach The study consists of two parts: literature review and five case studies within the chemical industry. The literature covers three topics: logistics collaboration, logistics outsourcing and purchasing of logistics services. The five case studies are used to refine the theoretical findings of the literature review. Conclusions Main observations during the case studies can be summarized as follows: 	Most analyzed collaborative relationships between shippers and logistics service providers in the chemical industry are still focused on operational execution of logistics activities with a short term horizon. Supply management design and control are often retained by the shippers. 	Despite the time and cost intensive character of a logistics service buying process, shippers tendering on a very regular basis. The decision to start a new tender project should more often be based on an integral approach that includes all tender related costs. A lower frequency of tendering could create more <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>supply</b> chains. Beside, it will give both, shippers and LSPs, the possibility to improve the quality of the remaining projects. 	Price is still a dominating decision criterion in selecting a LSP. This is not an issue as long as the comparison of costs is based on an integral approach, and when shippers balance the cost criterion within their total set of criteria for sourcing logistics services. 	At the shippers' side there is an increased awareness of the need of more solid collaboration with logistics service providers. Nevertheless, in many cases this increased awareness does not actually result in the required actions to establish more intensive collaboration. 	Over the last years the logistics service providers industry was characterized by low profit margins, strong fragmentation and price competition. Nowadays, the market for LSPs is changing, because of an increasing demand for logistics services. To benefit from this situation a more pro-active role of the service providers is required in building stronger relationships with their customers. They should pay more attention on mid and long term possibilities in a collaborative relation, in stead of only be focused on running the daily operation...|$|R
40|$|The bullwhip {{effect is}} defined as the {{distortion}} of demand information as one moves upstream <b>in</b> the <b>supply</b> chain, causing severe inefficiencies <b>in</b> the whole <b>supply</b> chain. Although extensive research has been conducted to study the causes of the bullwhip effect and seek mitigation solutions with respect to several demand processes, less attention has been devoted to the impact of seasonal demand <b>in</b> multi‐echelon <b>supply</b> chains. This paper considers a simulation approach to study the effect of demand seasonality on the bullwhip effect and inventory <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> a four‐echelon <b>supply</b> chain that adopts a base stock ordering policy with a moving average method. The results show that high seasonality levels reduce the bullwhip effect ratio, inventory variance ratio, and average fill rate to a great extent; especially when the demand noise is low. In contrast, all the performance measures become less sensitive to the seasonality level when the noise is high. This performance indicates that using the ratios to measure seasonal supply chain dynamics is misleading, and that it is better to directly use the variance (without dividing by the demand variance) as the estimates for the bullwhip effect and inventory performance. The results also show that the supply chain performances are highly sensitive to forecasting and safety stock parameters, regardless of the seasonality level. Furthermore, the impact of information sharing quantification shows that all the performance measures are improved regardless of demand seasonality. With information sharing, the bullwhip effect and inventory variance ratios are consistent with average fill rate results...|$|R

Because the Philippine agriculture is greatly affected by extreme climate events such as El Ni 1 o and La Ni 1 a, this paper highlights the importance of seasonal climate forecast (SCF) information as input to the formulation of various policy decisions of the NFA. Among these important policy decisions are: how much volume of paddy rice to procure from farmers to be able to defend its support price; how much volume of rice to maintain in order to achieve <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> the <b>supply</b> and consumer price; and how much volume of rice, as well as when is the best time, to import to be able to position the optimal level of stocks in time for the lean season. It is also argued in the paper that importation has been playing {{a significant role in the}} rice supply-demand situation of the country since 1990, making it one of the most significant government interventions in the rice sector. Based on historical data assessment, some of the worst events in the past such as the 1995 rice crisis and over-importation during the 1997 - 1998 El Ni 1 o could have been avoided if policy decisions, particularly on the volume and timing of rice importation, were linked to SCF. Indeed, linking crop production and import decisions more systematically with SCF would enhance the usefulness of these forecasts at a more practical level...|$|R
40|$|Studies on the {{stability}} of money demand or money supply functions have received prominent attention in the literature. This {{is due to the}} importance of having stable money demand or money supply functions for economic predictions to ensure long-term economic stability. Although these functions are not the only tools for monetary policy formulation, they {{play an important role in}} the assessment of the effectiveness of monetary policy <b>in</b> an economy. <b>Stability</b> <b>in</b> money <b>supply</b> or money demand is also important to ensure price stability, as one of the key areas that central banks like the Bank of Namibia (BoN) seeks to achieve. The BoN uses exchange rate targeting to achieve economic stability. It is for this reason that exchange rate is used as the key determinant of money demand in this study. The study employs various econometric tests to investigate {{the stability}} of money demand. The objective of the current study is to investigate whether money <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> Namibia is stable using two measures of money demand as adopted by the BoN. These measures are, M 1, which refers to the total currency in the hands of the public, and M 2, which includes currency plus bank deposits. The regression results show that both M 1 and M 2 have stable long-run relationships between income, interest rate, CPI and exchange rate. The R 2 is 0. 95 for M 1 and 0. 93 for M 2 indicating that explanatory variables explain over 90 % of changes in money demand.

40|$|Sudden, {{short-term}} disruptions seriously endangering {{energy security}} can {{be triggered by}} a variety of events ¿ among them attacks by terrorists. This study investigates terrorist attack practices against energy infrastructures and discusses how we may understand them. Our results indicate that attacks against energy infrastructures are comparatively few. Also, we find no strong connection between the ideologies of various terrorist groups and their proclivity to attack. In addition, the highly disproportionate number of attacks in a handful of countries highlights the strong geographic concentration of attacks. To explain these findings, we analyze terrorist targeting incentives including intimidation levels, symbolism, attack feasibility, and concerns for stakeholders. We argue that terrorists in general have comparatively few incentives to attack energy supply infrastructures based on our assessment of these factors. Moreover, higher levels of terrorist incidents in states more prone to internal violent conflict may suggest stronger incentives to attack energy infrastructures. When outlining energy security policies, the low frequency of world wide attacks coupled with the high concentration of attacks in certain unstable countries should be taken in to consideration.

40|$|The {{standard}} {{suite of}} indicators currently used in operational drought monitoring reflects anomalous conditions in several major {{components of the}} hydrologic budget—representing deficits in precipitation, soil moisture content, runoff, surface and groundwater storage, snowpack, and streamflow. In principle, {{it is useful to}} have a diversity of indices because drought can assume many forms (meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socioeconomic), over broad ranges in timescale (weeks to years), and with varied impacts of interest to different stakeholder groups. Farmers, for example, may be principally interested in soil moisture deficits, river forecasters will focus on streamflow fluctuations, and water managers will be concerned with longer-term <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> municipal water <b>supply</b> and reservoir levels. Only recently has actual evapotranspiration (ET) been considered as a primary indicator of drought conditions (e. g., Anderson et al., 2007 b; Labedzki and Kanecka- Geszke, 2009; Li et al., 2005; Mo et al., 2010). ET is a valuable drought indicator because it reflects not only moisture availability but also the rate at which water is being consumed. Because transpiration (T) and carbon uptake by vegetation are tightly coupled through stomatal exchange, ET anomalies are indicative of vegetation health and growing conditions. In addition, the importance of so-called flash droughts is becoming increasingly evident, where hot, dry, and windy atmospheric conditions can lead to unusually rapid soil moisture depletion and, in some cases, devastating crop failure. Such events cannot be easily identified using local precipitation anomalies but should have a detectable ET signature...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to show the new {{approach}} to determining safety technological levels (SLs) in terms of water quality and its chemical stability, as well as issues of water corrosion properties in water distribution systems (WDSs), {{due to the fact}} that water supply pipes are prone to corrosion. In the paper the methodology of determining the risk associated with threat to technical infrastructure was considered. The concept was studied on the basis of real operational data from the water treatment plant. The probability of exceeding the individual parameters for WTPI is slightly larger than for WTPII, which means that this water treatment process may cause lack of chemical <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> the water <b>supply</b> network. Operators should anticipate in the process of designing water distribution system, using proper materials, as to ensure an adequate level of safety from the water source to the water recipient. It should be noted that it is necessary to adjust the material of internal installation of water supply networks to the parameters of the water. At present, there are no correlations between the designing step and water parameters. It was concluded that to protect the water supply infrastructure, which belongs to critical infrastructure, water company should put more emphasis on distribution of stable water that has not potentially corrosion properties.

40|$|Short-term {{perspectives}} {{appear to}} be relevant in formulating adaptation measures to changed climate variability (CCV) {{as a part of}} the European Rural Development Policy (RDP). Indeed, short-run CCV is the variation that farmers would perceive to such an extent that a political demand would be generated for adapting support measures. This study evaluates some relevant agronomic and economic impacts of CCV as modelled in a near future time period at the catchment scale in a rural district in Sardinia (Italy). The effects of CCV are assessed in relation to the availability of irrigation water and the irrigation needs of maize. The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was used to simulate the impact of key climatic variables on the irrigation water requirements and yields of maize. A three-stage discrete stochastic programming model was then applied to simulate management and economic responses to those changes. The overall economic impact of a simulated CCV was found to be primarily caused by reduced <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> the future <b>supply</b> of irrigation water. Adaptations to this instability will most likely lead to a higher level of groundwater extraction and a reduction in the demand for labour. Changed climate variability will most likely reduce the income potential of small-scale farming.

40|$|A {{major reason}} for the {{substantial}} marketisation of human services over the last quarter century has been a belief that greater contestability has {{a positive impact on}} service providers, by enabling new and innovative providers to enter and giving all incumbents more incentive to improve services. Critics dispute this, claiming that the effects are often negative, allowing the entry of profit-maximisers and generating incentives for all providers to cut costs at the expense of good services. This thesis examines these conflicting claims, both theoretically in relation to human services in general, and through an empirical study of one service in one location. The first part of the thesis considers the theoretical implications for the concept of contestability when the product is a human service, and the resulting effects on the structure and operatipn of markets, the type of providers, and the incentives facing providers. A key aim is to assess marketisation on its own terms as far as possible and examine human services industries {{in the same way as}} other industries. An analytical framework grounded in conventional economic theory, but adapted to the reality of human services, is developed to examine con testability in specific markets. This framework is then used for the empirical study of the community aged care industry in New South Wales (NSW). This was a mixed-method study, with data obtained primarily from interviews, document analysis, and analysis of funding data. Both parts of the research show that there is substantial, intrinsic market failure in human services. This creates much scope for poor practice by providers, and requires limits on contestability to maximise the outcomes of services. Notwithstanding this, if implemented in a limited and strategic way, with a small number of providers competing on the basis of quality, then contestability can have positive effects on the capacity of providers to deliver good services. Even though there are tight limits on contestability in the NSW community aged care industry, there has been continuing new entry, vigorous competition, <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> the <b>supply</b> of services, and strong incentives for providers to improve the quality, responsiveness and efficiency of their services...|$|R
