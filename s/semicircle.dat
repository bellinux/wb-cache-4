5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous <b>semicircle</b> since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable <b>semicircle</b> since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous <b>semicircle</b> are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable <b>semicircle</b> are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E

5|$|As the {{fighting}} {{to the west}} proceeded, two divisions of Ewell's Second Corps, marching west toward Cashtown in accordance with Lee's order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity, turned south on the Carlisle and Harrisburg roads toward Gettysburg, while the Union XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) raced north on the Baltimore Pike and Taneytown Road. By early afternoon, the U.S. line ran in a <b>semicircle</b> west, north, and northeast of Gettysburg.|$|E
50|$|The Bankoff {{circle is}} formed from three <b>semicircles</b> that create an arbelos. A circle C1 is then formed tangent {{to each of}} the three <b>semicircles,</b> as an {{instance}} of the problem of Apollonius. Another circle C2 is then created, through three points: the two points of tangency of C1 with the smaller two <b>semicircles,</b> and the point where the two smaller <b>semicircles</b> are tangent to each other. C2 is the Bankoff circle.|$|R

5|$|Convection shifted {{towards the}} eastern <b>semicircle</b> of the circulation, while the still-exposed center became malformed and elongated. On September14, the poorly {{organized}} cyclone crossed southeastern Louisiana, turned towards the north-northeast {{and made a}} second landfall close to the AlabamaMississippi border at 1500UTC that day, still at its peak strength. The storm dissipated rapidly as it proceeded inland, and the remnant low pressure area moved into Georgia and South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Dry air began {{impacting}} Nadine on September17, though outflow {{from the}} storm prevented significant weakening. Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern <b>semicircle,</b> Nadine weakened slightly later that day. Further weakening occurred on the following day, after the burst in deep convection on September17 deteriorated. Later on September18, most of the deep convection dissipated, with the strongest of the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity being located within a band located west and northwest of the center.|$|E
5|$|Hotze's force took {{relatively}} high casualties—1,000men killed, wounded or missing (12.5 percent) of his entire force of 8,000—although his losses were comparable to Ney's 800 killed wounded or missing, from his 7,000-man force (11.5 percent). More importantly, though, Hotze succeeded {{not only in}} pushing the French back from Winterthur, but also in uniting his force with Nauendorf's and Charles'.

5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter <b>semicircle</b> around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian <b>semicircle,</b> driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E
5|$|On April 21, a {{low-pressure}} area {{separated from}} the prevailing westerlies about 600miles (1,100km) southeast of Bermuda, and developed into a subtropical depression at 1200UTC. The system maintained a large comma-shaped cloud pattern around the low-level circulation. Operationally, it was not classified until 27hours later. Isolated from strong steering currents, the depression tracked northwestward at 12mph (19km/h), and intensified into a subtropical storm early on April 22; {{this was the first}} such storm on record in the month. It gradually became better organized, with a large convective band in the eastern <b>semicircle.</b> Reports from a nearby ship indicated peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), with swells of 64.4feet (19.7m).|$|E

5|$|The British {{military}} finally decommissioned the fort's guns in 1906, {{although it}} remained a military establishment. It was {{included on the}} Antiquities List of 1925. The fort saw use again during World War II, when a battery of 3.7-inch heavy anti-aircraft guns was deployed there. The guns were mounted in concrete gun emplacements and deployed in a <b>semicircle</b> {{in and around the}} fort. The fort suffered considerable damage to its ramparts, barracks and chapel as a result of aerial bombing during the war. The fort was eventually decommissioned in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The China Meteorological Administration {{released}} {{a press release}} after the storm and gave four reasons for the extensive damage. First, the storm decelerated after landfall and maintained its identity for 120hours while moving south of due west. Secondly, the storm was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern <b>semicircle.</b> Also, the storm interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and more prone to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Maria {{can be traced}} back to a {{tropical}} wave—an elongated area of low pressure oriented north to south—that moved westward from Nigeria to Senegal on September1. The wave entered the eastern tropical Atlantic early the following day and slowly strengthened. By September6, it had developed a sufficient amount of convection to be designated as Tropical Depression Fourteen, while it was about 700mi (1100km) west-southwest of the southern Cape Verde Islands. By this time, it had also developed well-established outflow within the western <b>semicircle</b> of the low-pressure center. The depression continued to increase in strength, and it was upgraded to a tropical storm six hours after formation, receiving the name Maria.|$|E

40|$|The first {{lithium-ion}} insertion and extraction {{processes of}} a graphite electrode at different potentials were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results revealed that, below {{the potential of}} 0. 65 V during the first lithiation, three <b>semicircles</b> were observed in the Nyquist plots; namely, two <b>semicircles</b> appeared in the middle-frequency region. This new phenomenon has been investigated through the {{detailed analysis of the}} change of kinetic parameters obtained from simulating the experimental EIS data for lithiumion insertion and extraction in graphite as a function of potential. It has been found that the two <b>semicircles</b> in the middle-frequency region were strongly potential-dependent, and they were both attributed to the charge-transfer process. Evidence was presented (supported by model calculation) that the two <b>semicircles</b> observed in the middle-frequency region originated from the nonhomogeneous, multilayered porous microstructure of the graphite electrode, which resulted from a parallel combination of impedance response of the thinner parts and thicker parts of the electrode. major State Basic Research Development Program of China[2009 CB 220102]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities[2010 LKHX 03, 2010 QNB 04, 2010 QNB 05...|$|R

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical depression, the cyclone maintained outer rainbands and fair outflow. It tracked southeastward around the northeastern periphery of an anticyclone over Florida. By August 6, the convection had diminished as outflow became restricted due to northeasterly wind shear; {{with a relatively}} dry environment, most of the convection was confined to the southern <b>semicircle</b> of the depression. Despite the circulation becoming elongated in the southwesterly flow of a southward moving cold front, a Hurricane Hunters flight late on August 6 reported that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cristobal about 315miles (505km) east of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E
