50|$|The {{data for}} pathway {{analysis}} come from High throughput biology. This includes high throughput sequencing data and microarray data. Before pathway analysis can be done, the Omics data should be normalized, and genes should be ranked by differential expression usually {{with help of}} Student's t-test, ANOVA or other statistics. In general, any list of statistical ranked genes can be analyzed by pathway analysis. For example, often the functional activity of proteins can be inferred using network enrichment analysis of genes deferentially expressed in the experiment. Such functional activity scores can then be used for pathway analysis to find pathways responsible for observed differential expression. In case when ranking is not available simply list of genes can be analyzed. Also {{it is possible to}} integrate multiple microarray data sets from different research groups by meta-analysis and cross-platform normalization. By using pathway analysis <b>software,</b> <b>researchers</b> can determine which gene groups such as pathways, cell processes or diseases are enriched with over and under expressed in experimental data genes. They can also infer associated upstream and downstream regulators, proteins, small molecules, drugs, etc. For example, pathway analysis of several independent microarray experiments (meta-analysis) helped to discover potential biomarkers in a single pathway important for fast-to-slow switch fiber type transition in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In other study meta-analysis identified two biomarkers in blood of patients with Parkinson's Disease, which can be useful for monitoring the disease.|$|E

40|$|Context: In recent years, <b>software</b> <b>researchers</b> {{begun to}} benefit from {{qualitative}} synthesis to systematically build knowledge about the impact and preconditions of software technologies. Qualitative synthesis refers to qualitative research methods (as opposed to quantitative) used to bring together empirical evidence in a narrative or systematic review. However, only few of the qualitative syntheses published in software engineering have shown a rigorous approach to qualitative synthesis. Thus, the current qualitative synthesis findings are neither understandable nor trustworthy. Problem: These results indicate <b>software</b> <b>researchers</b> have difficulties in identifying quality issues in qualitative syntheses and in applying existing qualitative synthesis methods. I found three problems that have hindered the use of qualitative synthesis methods in software engineering. First, the lack of consensus on the meaning on quality has impeded the definition of quality criteria and {{the design of a}} quality appraisal instrument. Second, it is unclear to what extent qualitative synthesis methods are suitable for synthesizing evidence in software engineering. Finally, the lack of evidence on the suitability of qualitative synthesis methods has impeded their proper tailoring to software engineering needs and so, their effective use. Objectives: I aimed in this PhD thesis to design a reliable and valid quality appraisal instrument for qualitative synthesis; empirically evaluate the suitability of the most mature qualitative synthesis methods, i. e., meta-ethnography and thematic analysis; and enhance existing guidelines for meta-ethnography and thematic analysis. Contributions: First, I developed an instrument to support <b>software</b> <b>researchers</b> in appraising the quality of qualitative synthesis using psychometric guidelines. I operationalized the notion of quality of qualitative synthesis into four criteria: inter-subject comprehensibility, indication of the research process, trustworthiness, and relevance. Then, I designed and validated the instrument. The results of two empirical studies indicate the instrument has acceptable inter-rater agreement, substantial inter-rater reliability, good criterion validity, and high acceptance. Second, I designed and performed a multiple-case study to characterize the suitability of meta-ethnography and thematic analysis in software engineering. Third, I tailored the current guidelines for performing meta-ethnography and thematic analysis. I specified a prescriptive process; formalize the identification, extraction, and integration of evidence; and formalize the notation used for documenting synthesis findings. Then, I designed and performed interviews to validate the proposed guidelines. The results indicates <b>software</b> <b>researchers</b> perceived the proposed guidelines as understandable, useful, and easy to use...|$|E
