5|$|On 13 April, MTV3 {{organised}} another debate, {{which featured}} the same four party chairpersons {{as the debate}} by the Finnish Broadcasting Company two weeks earlier; Katainen, Kiviniemi, Urpilainen and Soini. The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU-sponsored Portuguese bailout; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it, insisting that the bailout is {{necessary in order to}} assure the stability of the European economy and thus in the interest of Finland. Urpilainen and Soini were against the bailout, with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his stance that the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members. Soini also criticised the governing parties for using scare tactics in the form of threatening Finns with rising unemployment if the bailout fails to pass. On other issues, Katainen, as he had <b>stated</b> <b>earlier,</b> willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age, while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so. Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland's admission to NATO. However, even he said that the admission does not seem possible during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership.|$|E

25|$|Their wire-crossing {{technique}} {{introduces the}} concept of implementing QCA devices capable of performing computation {{as a function of}} synchronization. This implies the ability to modify the device’s function through the clocking system without making any physical changes to the device. Thus, the fabrication problem <b>stated</b> <b>earlier</b> is fully addressed by: a) using only one type of quantum-dot pattern and, b) by the ability to make a universal QCA building block of adequate complexity, which function is determined only by its timing mechanism (i.e., its clocks).|$|E
25|$|Mythological {{themes were}} {{consciously}} employed in literature, beginning with Homer. The resulting work may expressly {{refer to a}} mythological background without itself becoming part of a body of myths (Cupid and Psyche). Medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature. Euhemerism, as <b>stated</b> <b>earlier,</b> refers to the rationalization of myths, putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts. An example {{of this would be}} following a cultural or religious paradigm shift (notably the re-interpretation of pagan mythology following Christianization).|$|E

Provincial forces were thus grouped into two armies, under the Onikoyi and the Okere for the east and west side of the river respectively. Lesser war chiefs were known as Balogun, a title carried on by the soldiers of Oyo's successor state, Ibadan.|$|E

25|$|The law {{was named}} in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), {{who was an}} English {{financier}} during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors. The law had been <b>stated</b> <b>earlier</b> by Nicolaus Copernicus; for this reason, it is occasionally known as the Copernicus Law. It was also stated in the 14thcentury, by Nicole Oresme , in his treatise On the Origin, Nature, Law, and Alterations of Money, and by jurist and historian Al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) in the Mamluk Empire; and noted by Aristophanes in his play The Frogs, which dates from {{around the end of}} the 5thcentury BC.|$|E

Maurice Mathieu's division {{consisted of three}} battalions of the 5th Line, two battalions of the 1st Nassau Regiment, and one battalion each of the 18th Light, 23rd Line, and 56th Line. Colonel Jean-Martin Petit's brigade included four battalions of the 67th Line and one battalion each of the 16th and 81st Line. General of Brigade Simon Lefebvre's brigade had one battalion each of the 8th Light, 37th Line, 60th Line, 2nd Swiss, Würzburg, and Westphalian Infantry Regiments, plus three provisional battalions.|$|E
25|$|As <b>stated</b> <b>earlier,</b> the CO2 {{released}} by soil respiration is a greenhouse gas {{that will continue}} to trap energy and increase the global mean temperature if concentrations continue to rise. As global temperature rises, so will the rate of soil respiration across the globe thereby leading to a higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, again leading to higher global temperatures. This {{is an example of a}} positive feedback loop. It is estimated that a rise in temperature by 2 degrees Celsius will lead to an additional release of 10 Pg carbon per year to the atmosphere from soil respiration. This is a larger amount than current anthropogenic carbon emissions. There also exists a possibility that this increase in temperature will release carbon stored in permanently frozen soils, which are now melting. Climate models have suggested that this positive feedback between soil respiration and temperature will lead to a decrease in soil stored carbon by the middle of this century.|$|E

25|$|Studies on the {{formation}} of <b>early</b> <b>states</b> {{tend to focus on}} processes that create and institutionalize a state in a situation where a state did not exist before. Examples of <b>early</b> <b>states</b> which developed in interaction with other states include the Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations and the Malagasy civilization in Madagascar. Unlike primary <b>state</b> formation, <b>early</b> <b>state</b> formation does not require the creation of the first state in that cultural context or development autonomously, independently from <b>state</b> development nearby. <b>Early</b> <b>state</b> formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.|$|R
500|$|On July 15, new {{financial}} reports were released that revealed that Thompson had raised $445,000 {{during the second}} quarter of 2007 and had $115,000 cash on hand. This showed a slight increase from his first quarter figures, but was still far below his fellow Republican candidates. Among the candidates, he ranked second to last in fundraising, just ahead of Jim Gilmore, who dropped out of the race a day before the financial disclosure. Thompson <b>stated</b> <b>earlier</b> in the month that he was [...] "pleased at the strong growth" [...] in fundraising, and that he was still [...] "able to run a campaign equal to that of the better-funded candidates despite the differences in funding." [...] Additionally, Thompson remained low in nationwide polls, standing at three percent in a July 21 Washington Post-ABC News survey, which actually reflected a two-point increase in support from June.|$|E

Biden <b>stated</b> <b>earlier</b> in his campaign that [...] " [...] truly believe the American public is waiting for leaders to come along who have the experience to say what they will do to restore America's leadership in the world." [...] At times during his campaign he believed his experience would help him win the Democratic nomination, but when Barack Obama's campaign began to surge with the candidate's emphasis on change, Biden shifted his focus from his experience in politics to his ability for action. He stated during a November 2007 debate, [...] "This [...] is not about experience. It's not about change. It's about action.
