[...] where he made the argument [...] "The label [...] has traditionally applied to painters and sculptors... but it’s hard to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> couldn’t also refer to Wiseau or any other thwarted, un-self-aware filmmaker." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennet Allott, in {{defending}} against any possible harsh criticism of [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{argues that the}} poem [...] "is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, {{but it is hard}} to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> should be so neglected, and at least two poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved". Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem [...] "is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, but to me it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD (now part of Mania.com) gave {{positive}} reviews {{to the two}} New Cutey Honey Collections {{released in}} 2000 by ADV; he [...] "was really impressed with the production values of this show" [...] and called it [...] "quite a bit of fun, especially for those looking for fan-service with a bit more intelligence and style {{than some of the}} other offerings out there". [...] Two reviews of Honey on the website Anime Jump greatly diverged: site maintainer Mike Toole rated the series 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "tons of fun, a light, tasty action-comedy that's... spirited and silly and tongue-in-cheek", and praised its character designs as [...] "letter-perfect to Go Nagai's original (quite appealing!) character designs"; Jason Carter praised Calvello's voice work in his review of the 2004 ADV release, but rated it 1.5 out of 5 stars, said that much of Cosplay City [...] "goes back and forth between looking like an ordinary modern metropolis and resembling some sort of Smurf town built of polluted marshmallows", and concluded [...] "The characters are largely annoying, the plot is , the nudity is absurd, the fighting is rarely more than average, and the whole thing is ultimately pointless - as the series' later attempts at developing Honey as a person make all too clear." [...] Sandra Dozier of DVD Verdict was also unimpressed with Honey: [...] "I can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is popular—the glossy animation, the well-endowed chicks, the scant clothing. If that isn't your thing, however, there is very little to draw you to this series." ...|$|E

2500|$|The RCMP {{officers}} {{involved in}} the Dziekański death, Constables Gerry Rundel, Bill Bentley, Kwesi Millington, and supervisor Corporal Benjamin Robinson, have been widely criticized for their handling of the incident. A retired Vancouver Police superintendent commented after viewing the video that Dziekański {{did not appear to}} be making [...] "any threatening gestures" [...] towards the police and he did not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> became a police incident. Particularly contentious is that the RCMP officers made no attempt to defuse or gain control of the situation before resorting to the Taser.|$|E
2500|$|In Sweden, {{the next}} station {{down the line}} was always {{contacted}} by telegraph using the signal [...] "tåg ut" [...] once a train had left the previous station. Although Train 422 {{was supposed to have}} left Åby at 6:44 p.m., it did not leave until 6:54, since it had been late in arriving. Shortly after this, the station in Krokek tried to contact Åby to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> had not received any [...] "tåg ut" [...] from it, but it could not reach Åby Station. At 6:57 Åby Station tried to contact Krokek Station to say that the train had left, but it was as unsuccessful in reaching Krokek Station as Krokek had been in reaching it.|$|E

2500|$|Ex parte Khan is also {{regarded}} as the first case in which an individual relied on a general policy, {{as opposed to a}} specific representation or a policy drawn for a closed class of persons, as the grounds for the expectation of a benefit. While the case mooted the idea of a substantive legitimate expectation, the doctrine was more completely developed in the High Court judgment of R. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries Ltd. (1995). Justice Stephen Sedley attempted to widen the Court's protection of legitimate expectations by including [...] "substantive protection of a substantive legitimate expectation". He rejected the proposition that legitimate expectations are limited to procedural grounds by stating: [...] "It is difficult to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is any less unfair to frustrate a legitimate expectation that something will or will not be done by the decision-maker than it is to frustrate a legitimate expectation that the applicant will be listened to before the decision-maker decides whether to take a particular step." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perone's {{assessment}} of the album's composition indicates a remove from [...] "just about anything else {{that was going on}} in 1966 pop music". Composer Philip Glass observed: [...] "Listening to it today, it is, perhaps, easier to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was one of the defining moments of its time... its willingness to abandon formula in favor of structural innovation, the introduction of classical elements in the arrangements, production concepts in terms of overall sound which were novel at the time-all these elements give Pet Sounds a freshness that, 30 years later, is immediately there for the listener." [...] Strauss writes that with Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys became the first major rock group [...] "to look music trends firmly in the eye and declare that rock really didn't matter. Rock is supposed to be about, you know, fucking, and Brian Wilson was recording a song ('I Know There's an Answer') that was originally entitled 'Get Rid of Your Libido'." [...] Sommer said that the Beach Boys became the first group to make an entire album that departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format: [...] "Of course, others had done it for a song or two, but no one had said, 'This will be a complete album that can not be performed by four or five guys plugged into amps.... Once the Beach Boys let that cat out of the bag, the whole ship of rock sailed to new ports.'" ...|$|E
