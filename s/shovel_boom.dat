40|$|Ground {{excavation}} {{constitutes a}} significant component of production costs in any surface mining operation. The excavation process entails material digging and removal {{in which the}} equipment motion is constrained by the workspace geometry. A major excavation problem is the variability of material properties, resulting in varying mechanical energy input and stress loading of shovel dipper-and-tooth assembly across the working bench. This variability has {{a huge impact on}} the shovel dipper and tooth assembly in hard formations. With this in mind, the primary objectives of the project were to (i) provide the theoretical basis to develop the Intelligent Shovel Excavation (ISE) technology to solve the problems associated with excavation in material formations; (ii) advance knowledge and frontiers in shovel excavation through intelligent navigation; and (iii) submit proposal for the design, development and implementation of the ISE technology for shovel excavation at experimental surface mining sites. The mathematical methods were used to (i) develop shovel's kinematics and dynamics, and (ii) establish the relationship between shovel parameters and the resistive forces from the material formation during excavation process. The ADAMS simulation environment was used to develop the hydraulic and cable shovel virtual prototypes. Two numerical examples are included to test the theoretical hypotheses and the obtained results are discussed. The area of sensor technology was studied. Application of specific wrist-mounted sensors to characterize the material, bucket and frame assembly was determined. Data acquisition, display and control system for shovel loading technology was adopted. The concept of data acquisition and control system was designed and a <b>shovel</b> <b>boom</b> stresses were simulated. A multi-partner collaboration between research organizations, shovel manufacturer, hardware and sensor technology companies, and surface mining companies is proposed to test design features, construct a field ready prototype and perform field testing at the surface mining sites. It is anticipated that 10 % in energy savings including electricity (cable shovel) and fuel (hydraulic shovel) will be achieved by implementation of ISE technology...|$|E
50|$|A backhoe, {{also called}} a rear actor or back actor, {{is a piece}} of {{excavating}} equipment or digger consisting of a digging bucket {{on the end of a}} two-part articulated arm. They are typically mounted on the back of a tractor or front loader, the latter forming a 'backhoe loader' (colloquially known as a JCB in Ireland and UK). The section of the arm closest to the vehicle is known as the boom, and the section which carries the bucket is known as the dipper or dipper-stick, terms derived from steam <b>shovels).</b> The <b>boom</b> is generally attached to the vehicle through a pivot known as the king-post, which allows the arm to pivot left and right, usually through a total of around 180-200 degrees.|$|R
5000|$|Ames {{was born}} in Easton, Massachusetts, the son of Oliver Ames, Sr., a {{blacksmith}} who had built a business of making shovels, the Ames Shovel Shop, and became nicknamed [...] "King of Spades". In his youth, he obtained a public school education and later worked in the family workshops to learn {{each step of the}} manufacturing process. He eventually became a partner in the business, and with his brother Oliver Ames, Jr. he established the firm Oliver Ames & Sons. Driven by the settlement of the Midwest, by the discovery of gold in California and Australia, as well as by railroad construction, the <b>shovel</b> manufacturing business <b>boomed.</b> During the Civil War, the firm prospered with contracts for swords, shovels, and other tools and implements. Ames made a large fortune.|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion {{has been}} a major concern in the United States for over a century. Water erosion {{accounts}} for about two thirds of this erosion. Past researchers have divided the erosion process into rill and interrill erosion components. Rill erosion process can be further divided into scouring, headcutting and side sloughing subprocesses. Headcuts are defined as local areas of intense erosion accompanied by an abrupt elevation change. To more accurately model the rill erosion process, headcutting mechanics were developed to mathematically model the phenomenon;Headcut erosion data were collected on seven soils in six states as part of the USDA Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). Rill plots 9 m long and 0. 5 m wide, were set up on 3 % to 6 % slopes. These plots were formed with cultivator <b>shovels.</b> A rotating <b>boom</b> rainfall simulator was used to simulate rainfall over the erosion plots. After equilibrium runoff was achieved, additional flows of 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 L/min were added to the top of each rill. During each flow addition, wooden stakes were placed adjacent to headcuts that formed in the rill and overhead stereo photographs were taken to determine the location of headcuts. Flow additions were repeated without rainfall. Headcut erosion was measured by calculating the volume of soil voided and multiplying this by the soil bulk density;Five models were developed using the principles of fluid mechanics. Statistical analyses indicated that two models, the total energy model and the vertical force model, were superior over other models tested. The energy model was based on the sum of the energy lost at each headcut. The vertical force model was based on the force in the plunge pool due to the flowing water. Coefficients of determination (r[superscript] 2) using the energy model and the vertical force model were 0. 85 and 0. 84, respectively. Soil properties were correlated to the erodibilities calculated with the two models. Organic carbon had the highest correlation for the energy model erodibilities with a correlation coefficient of - 0. 95. Soil shear angle had the highest correlation for the vertical force model with a correlation coefficient of - 0. 89...|$|R
