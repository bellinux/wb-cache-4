500|$|The song {{performed}} after Lois' {{pregnancy test}} comes back negative {{was written by}} Alec Sulkin and Alex Borstein, and sung by professional Hollywood studio singers. Orchestrations in this song were performed by Walter Murphy, and described by show producer Seth MacFarlane to be [...] "wonderful". The sketch of Peter challenging Lois to a race to Boston was removed from television broadcasting {{in order to save}} time. As Lois is slowly racing Peter to Boston, a Shania Twain song can be heard on the radio; Dan Povenmire states on the DVD commentary that he often gets into trouble for adding pieces of music into an episode when they're so short, yet cost so much. The producers of both Family Guy and the Ice Age series agreed to collaborate in the episode during its reference to <b>Scrat</b> from the Ice Age series.|$|E
500|$|Stewie and Bertram, Stewie says [...] "On my signal, unleash hell." [...] This is a {{reference}} to the opening scene of Gladiator. An Ice Age reference is made when <b>Scrat,</b> a character from the films, attempts to steal Peter's nuts. When Stewie invades Bertram's camp {{at the end of the}} episode Bertram quotes , repeating the line Darth Vader says when he senses Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Death Star. [...] When Peter names his kids, Peter mentions the kids from various shows that are currently airing at Nick at Nite. [...] When Brian mentions this, Peter begins naming Street Fighter characters. [...] Brian again points out this fact, after which Peter names various colors. [...] Sauron, the villain from The Lord of the Rings is shown as the Eye of Sauron in a scene where he is trying to find his lost contact lens. [...] A cutaway scene features Peter in a jail surrounded by inmates who force him to strip, squeeze his boobs together, and sing the chorus from Kelis's 2003 hit “Milkshake.” This is possibly an homage to the scene after the credits in the movie [...] in which Ben Stiller does the same thing in his fatsuit.|$|E

"Ah," [...] said Dolly, with {{soothing}} gravity, [...] "it's {{like the}} night and the morning, and the sleeping and the waking, and {{the rain and the}} harvest--one goes and the other comes, and we know nothing how nor where. We may strive and <b>scrat</b> and fend, but it's little we can do arter all--the big things come and go wi' no striving o' our'n--they do, that they do; and I think you're in the right on it to keep the little un, Master Marner, seeing as it's been sent to you, though there's folks as thinks different. You'll happen be a bit moithered with it while it's so little; but I'll come, and welcome, and see to it for you: I've a bit o' time to spare most days, for when one gets up betimes i' the morning, the clock seems to stan' still tow'rt ten, afore it's time to go about the victual.

6000|$|In these confessions we find {{included}} {{nearly all}} the particulars of the popular belief concerning witchcraft, and see the gradual degradation of the once superb Lucifer to the vulgar scarecrow with horns and tail. [...] "The Prince of Darkness was a gentleman." [...] From him who had not lost all his original brightness, to this dirty fellow who leaves a stench, sometimes of brimstone, behind him, the descent is a long one. For the dispersion of this foul odor Dr. Henry More gives an odd reason. [...] "The Devil also, as in other stories, leaving an ill smell behind him, seems to imply {{the reality of the}} business, those adscititious particles he held together in his visible vehicle being loosened at his vanishing and so offending the nostrils by their floating and diffusing themselves in the open Air." [...] In all the stories vestiges of Paganism are not indistinct. The three principal witch gatherings of the year were held on the days of great pagan festivals, which were afterwards adopted by the Church. Maury supposes the witches' Sabbath to be derived from the rites of Bacchus Sabazius, and accounts in this way for the Devil's taking the shape of a he-goat. But the name was more likely to be given from hatred of the Jews, and the goat may have a much less remote origin. Bodin assumes the identity of the Devil with Pan, and in the popular mythology both of Kelts and Teutons there were certain hairy wood-demons called by the former Dus and by the latter <b>Scrat.</b> Our common names of Deuse and Old Scratch are plainly derived from these, and possibly Old Harry is a corruption of Old Hairy. By Latinization they became Satyrs. Here, at any rate, {{is the source of the}} cloven hoof. The belief in the Devil's appearing to his worshippers as a goat is very old. Possibly the fact that this animal was sacred to Thor, the god of thunder, may explain it. Certain it is that the traditions of Vulcan, Thor, and Wayland[104] converged at last in Satan. Like Vulcan, he was hurled from heaven, and like him he still limps across the stage in Mephistopheles, though without knowing why. In Germany, he has a horse's and not a cloven foot,[105] because the horse was a frequent pagan sacrifice, and therefore associated with devil-worship under the new dispensation. Hence the horror of hippophagism which some French gastronomes are striving to overcome. Everybody who has read [...] "Tom Brown," [...] or Wordsworth's Sonnet on a German stove, remembers the Saxon horse sacred to Woden. The raven was also his peculiar bird, and Grimm is inclined to think this the reason why the witch's familiar appears so often in that shape. It is true that our Old Nick is derived from Nikkar, one of the titles of that divinity, but the association of the Evil One with the raven is older, and most probably owing to the ill-omened character of the bird itself. Already in the apocryphal gospel of the [...] "Infancy," [...] the demoniac Son of the Chief Priest puts on his head one of the swaddling-clothes of Christ which Mary has hung out to dry, and forthwith [...] "the devils began to come out of his mouth and to fly away as crows and serpents." ...|$|E

50|$|Scrat: Spaced Out is a 15-minute {{short film}} that compiles all <b>Scrat's</b> scenes from Ice Age: Collision Course {{with a few}} unique scenes at the end. The short was {{included}} on the film's home media releases.|$|R
50|$|A short musical scene follows (to {{the tune}} of Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty Waltz), with <b>Scrat</b> {{collecting}} acorns as he falls. Eventually <b>Scrat</b> collects and forms a 3-D sphere with the acorns, but then (with <b>Scrat</b> on top of it) it tilts upside down so <b>Scrat</b> and the acorns finally fall to the icy land down below. There is one lone acorn (presumably the one {{he was trying to}} stuff into the tree) left in the atmosphere. <b>Scrat,</b> stuck in the snow, is only able to free his arms before the acorn impacts right between his eyes, as fast as a meteorite. The extreme force results in continental drift, shaping the Earth's continents (probably Pangea) into their present-day form and trapping <b>Scrat</b> on the original spot {{from the center of the}} impact. When <b>Scrat</b> digs out the acorn, he finds it has been charred and thus crumbled into ash. Disappointed and defeated, he turns to the camera, sighs and puts on the remaining acorn cap as a beret.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the events}} of Ice Age: Collision Course, <b>Scrat</b> is heading back to Earth in the saucer. An acorn-shaped ship appears and pulls the acorn, with <b>Scrat</b> holding onto it. In the ship, three alien {{squirrels}} (A.K.A Scratzons) are surprised by finding <b>Scrat,</b> and blast {{him away from the}} acorn. <b>Scrat</b> tries to take it back with a tractor beam in a nearby saucer, but the alien leader pulls it back with another tractor beam. Being pulled to both sides, the nutrogen inside the acorn snaps, creating a massive explosion, which destroys the ship and creates a black hole sucking everything nearby into it. <b>Scrat</b> jumps out of the saucer, knocks the Scratzon alien leader into the black hole while trying to save the acorn, but gets pulled in the hole nonetheless. He emerges in space along with the acorn, only for the black hole appearing again, snatching the acorn and leaving <b>Scrat</b> alone again.|$|E

5000|$|He materializes in {{an arena}} in Ancient Rome. <b>Scrat</b> {{reaches for his}} acorn, but is dragged off when his tail is caught by a passing horse-drawn chariot. <b>Scrat</b> tries to pull his tail off, and begins to enjoy the ride (as he is [...] "laughing" [...] as the chariot pulls him) just as his crotch bashes against a rock. He then finds his acorn just as a fanfare sounds. He thinks it is victory music and {{introduces}} himself to the crowd like a triumphant gladiator, proudly holding up his acorn. Then he hears the growl of a lion coming from the tunnel behind him. He fires the time machine again before the lion can attack him, and lands on an ice field. He is overjoyed, thinking he is home, but he soon sees the ill-fated RMS Titanic appear out of nowhere, heading straight towards him; he was actually in April 14, 1912 A.D. and on the frozen North Atlantic, the time and location of the ship's sinking. <b>Scrat</b> gets pressed into the iceberg that sank the Titanic by the ship's bow, and the time machine zaps <b>Scrat</b> and the acorn as they fall from the iceberg, taking <b>Scrat</b> {{to the time of}} the first Ice Age movie, where he encounters his past self, and the two Scrats fights each other for the acorn (Manny, Sid, Diego, and Roshan are watching the fight going on). The time machine is caught in the fight, and it zaps the acorn out of sight yet again, much to the distress of both past <b>Scrat</b> and future <b>Scrat.</b> Shortly after, future <b>Scrat</b> also gets zapped (after past <b>Scrat</b> angrily kicks the machine).|$|E
50|$|It {{begins with}} <b>Scrat</b> (Chris Wedge) {{returning}} to a huge tree, hollowed out and filled {{to the brim with}} acorns. There is one more empty spot {{in the middle of the}} acorns where <b>Scrat</b> tries to stuff the last acorn he brought with him (he first tries to put it in in the same way he had done in the opening of the first film, but he seems to remember what would happen if he did, so he gently screws it in instead). However it pops back out when his back is turned and after two more tries at getting it in place - both with the acorn popping out again - <b>Scrat</b> gets frustrated and stomps it into place, unwittingly sending all the acorns out of a hole in the tree, and every one along with <b>Scrat</b> is sent sliding down the side of a mountain. The acorns and <b>Scrat</b> go into free fall.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wormhole}} lands <b>Scrat</b> {{in front}} of an enormous oak tree. Overjoyed at the sight of so many acorns, he tosses away his own acorn, which lands on and almost causes the time machine to fire again, but not before <b>Scrat</b> pulverizes it. <b>Scrat</b> attempts to remove the nuts from the tree, but soon discovers that it is only a monument of some sort, with a plaque on it reading [...] "Here Stood the Last Oak Tree". <b>Scrat</b> is in the distant future, where oak trees (and therefore acorns) are extinct. He realizes that the acorn he brought with him is the only real one around. He makes a dash for it, but the time machine somehow fires one final time, transporting the acorn right out of his paws right before the time machine collapses into pieces. Stranded in the acorn-less future, <b>Scrat</b> lets out a scream of frustration, ending the film. The forever-lost acorn ends up floating behind the credits.|$|E

50|$|Set {{after the}} events of Continental Drift, <b>Scrat's</b> pursuit of his elusive acorn catapults him outside of Earth aboard a UFO, where he accidentally sets off a series of cosmic events that {{transform}} and threaten the planet.

5000|$|... 20,000 years later, <b>Scrat,</b> {{frozen in}} ice, ends {{up on the}} shores of a {{tropical}} island. As the ice slowly melts, the acorn is washed away. <b>Scrat</b> then finds a coconut and tries stomp it into the ground, only to mistakenly trigger a volcanic eruption.|$|E

I wanted to create such a character for my movie. Producer Damu suggested that we should have a guy hit with recession. Writer Bhupal said that we should have a drunken character. It was Bhupal who suggested Ramesh for that character. Ramesh worked for Mahatma and Bheemili in the past, but didn’t get any recognition. He is a simple and hardworking boy. His work in Ala Modalaindi is being appreciated well.|$|E
5000|$|A fourth Ice Age short, <b>Scrat's</b> Continental Crack-up, was {{released}} with the film's theatrical release. The short is {{a parody of}} continental drift, and centers on a humorous alternative explanation {{for the creation of}} the continents (rather similar to the ending of the earlier Ice Age short, Gone Nutty, where the continents split up into their modern-day forms). It also hints at the next Ice Age [...] film which {{was released}} in 2012.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the apples}} are {{gathered}} from trees in orchards they are <b>scratted</b> (ground down) {{into what is}} called pomace or pommage. Historically this was done using pressing stones with circular troughs, or by a cider mill. Cider mills were traditionally driven by the hand, water-mill, or horse-power. In modern times, {{they are likely to}} be powered by electricity. The pulp is then transferred to the cider press and built up in layers known as cheeses into a block.|$|R

Apart from Peter, the scene was rendered in 3D (Family Guy is normally drawn in 2D), and <b>Scrat</b> was voiced by Chris Wedge who voices him in the films. The episode originally aired the week before the film opened. Fox aired promotions for the film throughout the evening. During the same evening of this cameo, Sid was hosting the entire FOX line-up, showing up in intermittent times between commercials.|$|E
50|$|In a mid-credits scene, <b>Scrat</b> {{finds his}} acorn, but gets beaten by some doors.|$|E
50|$|In the film's epilogue, <b>Scrat</b> {{discovers the}} island on the map, known as Scratlantis (a parody of Atlantis), but his {{uncontrollable}} urge to hunt acorns in the acorn-rich city inadvertently causes the entire island to sink when he unplugs an acorn drain holder; <b>Scrat</b> is then ejected into a newly created desert landscape, {{through which he}} screams as his tears boil from the heat.|$|E
50|$|Apples are {{collected}} {{from the end of}} September onwards until the middle of November using the kizkia, a tool that resembles a stick with a nail in it. They are then <b>scratted</b> (crushed) into pomace in the matxaka but without cracking the seeds as this would add a bitter taste. The pulp (patsa) is then transferred a press and the must (muztioa) collected (or caught on the ground floor in a vat (tina) in the medieval style sagardotegi), processed and stored in barrels (usually oak or chesnut) in the storage area to mature.|$|R

50|$|The Stadium had a {{main stand}} on the Carr Road side built in 1922 which held 2000 people with {{concrete}} terracing on the lower half and a wooden covered upper area with bench seating. There was another single storey stand with just earth and cinder flooring behind the goals at the park end, which was called the <b>scratting</b> shed, and the team changing rooms were behind the town end goals. Two spectator bankings were situated on each corner - the one nearest Carr Road had a wooden building at the top which was called the 'Alpine Bar'. The highest attendance at the stadium was the 14,143 for the Third Division North match between Nelson and Bradford Park Avenue in April 1926.|$|R
