5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, gay {{relationships}} were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{company began}} as a {{development}} team that created software called Picture This Home in the mid-1990s for Autodesk in San Rafael, California. The program allowed people to virtually preview room decoration projects before any work began. Users could create virtual rooms, change walls and arrange furniture, and create photo-realistic renderings of completed designs. Picture This Home was awarded the Good Housekeeping <b>Seal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Approval.</b> In 1998, the software and its team of 40developers were sold to Broderbund, which was owned by The Learning Company, a subsidiary of Mattel Inc. Broderbund eventually spun Picture This Home off as a company called GoodHome.com in June 1999. The company received $30 million in venture capital from Hearst Interactive Media.|$|E
5|$|An early 1970s Spider-Man story {{led to the}} {{revision}} of the Comics Code. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction {{of the use of}} illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval.</b> Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.|$|E

5|$|Kishi {{specifically}} {{requested that}} sound and music director Satoki Iida {{work on the}} project, who also helped with the proofreading of the script due to Maeda's fixation on the music production. Iida was interviewed in the April 2010 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where it was stated that Maeda and the group Anant-Garde Eyes received Iida's approval to employ a minimalist approach to the background music (BGM) used throughout the anime. Iida admitted that it was uncustomary to use this music genre in anime {{and that he had}} to go through various trials and errors with Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes to get the music right. Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes strove to create individual quality music tracks, while Iida pursued the goal of having music that would be useful as BGM tracks, which caused problems during the creation process. Iida realized that it was important for the music and the visuals to combine together to create a synchronization between the two. Toba first took notice of Angel Beats! character designer and chief animator Katsuzō Hirata during the production of Gurren Lagann (2007) with his skill as an artist and ability to finish work quickly, but thoroughly. It was after Toba saw Hirata's work as chief animator of Strike Witches (2008), however, that he pursued Hirata to join the Angel Beats! staff; Maeda also gave his <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> for Hirata.|$|E

40|$|Crowdfunding {{is a form}} of {{collaborative}} social media. Even though crowdfunding can function without social media, this phenomenon has developed greatly with the advance of social media. The studies in entrepreneurship and finance established connections between startup projects and social ties. However, the impact of social media on crowdfunding is still lightly studied in academic literature. The purpose of this thesis is to define the influence of social media on crowdfunding. In particular, this research studies the connections between social media assets such as the social media followers and the social media <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> and crowdfunding results such as the delivery of the funding target, the fundraising total, and the number of backers. In course of the research, data on the hundred crowdfunding projects on the Kickstarter site were collected. Collected data established a number of statistically relevant connections, including the connection between the social media <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> and the delivery of fundraising target, the connection between the social media <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> and the fundraising total, the connection between the social media <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> and the number of backers, and also the connection between the number of social media followers and the social media <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval.</b> The value <b>of</b> this research is that it explores the underlying mechanism of social media influence on crowdfunding results and helps individuals and businesses involved in crowdfunding projects identify factors of success and predict results for their projects.

40|$|Abstract A {{recent study}} on the {{perceptions}} <b>of</b> professional <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> among television weathercasters provides {{some insight into the}} rarely-studied field of broadcast meteorology. The study provides one perspective (weathercasters), but {{it is also important to}} consider the opinions of clients (viewers) and employers (news directors). While weathercasters appear to have strong feelings about each of the two major <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval,</b> the viewers and news directors tend to place more importance on other factors...|$|R

25|$|The 1860s were {{years of}} assured {{literary}} fame for Gautier. Although he {{was rejected by}} the French Academy three times (1867, 1868, 1869), Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, the most influential critic of the day, set the <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> on the poet by devoting no less than three major articles in 1863 to reviews of Gautier's entire published works. In 1865, Gautier was admitted into the prestigious salon of Princess Mathilde Bonaparte, cousin of Napoleon III and niece to Bonaparte. The Princess offered Gautier a sinecure as her librarian in 1868, a position that gave him access to the court of Napoleon III.|$|E

25|$|Born in Leicester, Stevens {{made his}} debut for his home county of Leicestershire in 1997. He was {{initially}} an opening batsman {{and his first}} century came in his fourth match, two years later against Sussex. This innings earned him a <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> (as well as a painting) from Colin Cowdrey. He remained, however, {{on the fringes of}} the side with Aftab Habib and Ben Smith being preferred in the Leicestershire middle-order. After a strong season in 2002, when he scored 850 runs at an average of 32.69, he was called up to England's Academy squad in Australia and was included in their 30-man squad for the 2003 Cricket World Cup.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, after various {{changes of}} ownership, SodaStream became a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group. In 1998, SodaStream {{was bought by}} Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home carbonation systems supplier. In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's gas cylinder refilling and refurbishment department to Germany. Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries. In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves Béhar to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability.

40|$|The {{present study}} reviews two {{features}} {{that have the}} potential to increase consumer trust in Internet stores: (1) short arguments that explain the meaning <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> and (2) the establishment of portal affiliation. The present study draws on previous research to argue that the effects <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> on consumer trust are limited if consumers are not familiar with the meanings <b>of</b> the <b>seals,</b> and it proposes that short arguments for the seals can enhance their effects. Drawing from theories concerning stimuli generalization and the primacy effect, the present study attempts to explain conflicting results from previous empirical studies into the effects of portal affiliation on consumer trust. It is hypothesized that the effects of portal affiliation are more profound when consumers arrive at an Internet store via a link from a reputable portal site than when consumers visit the Internet store directly without visiting a portal. A laboratory experiment has been designed to test the effects of short arguments for <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> and the effects of portal affiliation...|$|R
