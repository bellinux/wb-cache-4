40|$|This paper applies a bioeconomic {{model in}} order to study {{different}} interactions between a harvested renewable resource and a non-renewable resource without commercial value that is negatively affected by the harvesting activity. This enables the analysis of for instance cold water coral habitats and their importance to commercial fish species. The fish is harvested either {{in a manner that}} does not damage coral, such as <b>stationary</b> <b>gear,</b> or in a destructive fashion, such as bottom trawling. We find that when coral is a preferred or essential habitat, the optimal steady-state fish stock is no longer independent of the habitat level, i. e. optimum optimorum values determine the optimal <b>stationary</b> <b>gear</b> harvest rate and how much habitat should optimally be preserved. Such optimum optimorum values will vary according to the type of habitat-fishery connection, and some bottom trawling may be optimal for some periods of time. Our findings extend upon the underlying assumption of a constant habitat quality of bioeconomic models when destructive fishing methods are involved and a habitat-fishery connection exists...|$|E

This machine was used in such interdependent studies as deter-mination of instantaneous gear tooth engagement loads, minimum film thicknesses, and gear efficiencies. With minimal structural and mechanical modifications, this gear research machine {{can be used for}} studies of surface durability, thermal distribution in gear meshing zones, and effects of variable torques and torsional oscillations on per-formance of gearing. Most of these studies could be conducted simultaneously.

40|$|For {{aerospace}} applications, vapor compression {{heat pump}} {{can be used}} as thermal control system to collect the heat from electronic devices and transport heat to radiator by which heat can be rejected to space. Heat pumps can be used in two cases. The first consists of raising the temperature of heat energy so that the amount of radiator surface required is reduced. The second involves situations where heat cannot be directly rejected by radiators, because the heat sink temperature is higher than that of the heat source. However, the key problem is to make a small and lightweight refrigeration compressor. In order to meet the need for aerospace applications, an innovative miniature hermetic Wankel compressor was proposed and designed in this paper. We fabricated the components such as shell, cylinder, rotor, piston gear, <b>stationary</b> <b>gear,</b> rotor and stator of motor. A compressor prototype was manufactured by integrating these components. The experimental system was built to test the performances of compressor prototype. The effects of condensing temperature, compressor rotation speed and refrigerant charge on the compressor performance were obtained.

40|$|Purpose. During {{operation}} of cold-pilgering mills {{rotation of the}} shafts is carried out by means of pinion gears being in meshing with <b>stationary</b> <b>gear</b> racks, which is accompanied by various tribological defects, that can be avoided during the detailed investigation and justification of selection and evaluation of kinematic and tribological characteristics of the system "pinion - gear rack". Methodology. Runout occurs {{as a consequence of}} increased friction and depends on the material hardness of which pinions and toothed racks are manufactured, their thermal treatment, selection of correct lubrication, insufficient oil purity and its untimely change, gears overload and other factors. To assess the runout of tribological pair cogs "pinion - gear rack" of the cold-pilgering mills we will use a system of differential equations of the first order. Using the solution of this system under the given conditions, it is possible to obtain relations for kinematic and tribological parameters. Findings. Relations for the durability, runout, sliding speed, and length of the line of the tribological pair "pinion - gear rack" contact are obtained. They provide high indicators of runout and durability of the system with minimum weight and overall dimensions of the design, which is an important factor to increase efficiency of cold-pilgering mills. Originality. The analysis of the relations, which was obtained to identify durability, wear, sliding speed, and the length of the line of the tribological pair "pinion - gear rack" contact allows you to choose for cold-pilgering mills special pinions with the design parameters, which optimally satisfy the technological conditions of rolling. Practical value. Analytical determination of the slip velocity for tribological pair makes it possible to adjust the technical process of cold-pilgering mills and to make constructive changes in the system of "pinion - gear rack" in order to increase its wear resistance...|$|E
40|$|Thailand is {{currently}} {{one of the}} ten largest fishing nations in the world. In 1996, fish production reached 3. 7 million t with 90 % of the production coming from the marine fisheries sector and 10 % from inland fisheries. Thai fishing operates in four fishing grounds namely, the Gulf of Thailand, the Andaman Sea, the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal. However {{with the establishment of}} the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in 1977, Thailand lost over 300 000 km 2 of traditional fishing grounds. Gross domestic product (GDP) of Thailand was estimated at 4 598 billion Baht (US$ 181 billion at 1 US$ = 25. 36 Baht) in 1996 with 87. 8 billion Baht (US$ 3. 46 billion) (1. 9 %) coming from the fish industry. In 1997, fishery product exports reached 138 624 million Baht (US$ 4 million at 1 US$ = 31. 18 Baht) or 69 % (200 795 million Baht including fish) of the total agriculture exports and 7. 3 % (1 898 276 million Baht) of total exports. However, the rapid growth of manufacturing and service sectors has diminished the contribution of the fisheries sector to GDP in the recent years. Of the estimated 35. 6 million labor force in Thailand in 1998, 43 % were employed in the agricultural sector including fisheries. The 1995 Census of Marine Fishery showed that the total number of fishery households including fisheries employeesÃ† households in the country was 109 635. No census was conducted for inland fisheries. The fisheries sector also supports a substantial level of employment in industries like fish processing, cold storage, fishmeal, ice making, boat construction and the like. The labor force of these industries was estimated to be at 211 682 in 1995. Fish is the primary source of animal protein for most of ThailandÃ†s population, particularly in the coastal and near-coastal provinces. The average per capita fish consumption is 24 kg annually. Marine capture fisheries can be broadly divided into commercial and small scale sub-sectors. Commercial vessels are those vessels over 10 m in length or 5 GT, that use modern fishing gear and have the capacity to fish offshore for several days. Small scale vessels are usually less than 10 m in length and either employ outboard- or inboard-engines, or are non-motorized and operate in near shore areas. From 1985 to 1995, the number of small scale fishing boats increased by 7. 5 %, while the commercial boats increased by 11 %. One reason for the change has been the creation of a boat-tenure system within the commercial fishing sector, resulting in a {{decrease in the number of}} boats per household. The major fishing gear used by the small scale fishers are gillnets, small push nets, lift nets or other modern small scale gear, set traps, bagnets and other <b>stationary</b> <b>gear</b> in estuaries or protected inshore waters. In the fishing household of Songhkla Province, Southern Thailand, shrimp gillnets, cuttlefish trammel nets, Indo-Pacific mackerel gillnets, other gillnets and Acetes trawl nets are the major fishing gear. The fishers direct their effort towards high value species like shrimp, cuttlefish, pomfret fish and crabs, but they also obtain by-catch low value fish species. The most important determinant of profit for small scale fisheries is the interaction between types of gear and fishing ground. Commercial fishing vessels utilize otter trawls, pair trawls, beam trawls, push nets, purse seines and king mackerel gillnets as the major fishing gear. The analysis of investment, cost, revenue and return on demersal and pelagic fishing operations shows that (a) returns differ markedly among size of fishing boats and types of fishing gear; (b) ability to generate profit is greater in large fishing boats than small due to their higher ability to adjust to both economic (investment) and biological (fishing ground) changes; and (c) among the trawlers, medium and large boats can best adapt to maintain continuous profit, while for push nets, all size of boats show declining net profit. In pelagic fishing operations, purse seiners have been developed to make high profits and yield a higher return than trawlers and gillnet fishing operations. The Schaefer Model was applied to estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and maximum economic yield (MEY) for demersal fish and trash fish in the Gulf of Thailand. Results indicated that the present catch and the corresponding effort of demersal fishing in the Gulf of Thailand surpassed both MEY and MSY. In order to obtain the maximum net benefit in the long run, the present fishing effort of catching demersal fish must be reduced to about 50 % of present levels. This would lead to the rehabilitation of marine resources and minimize the by-catch.

40|$|Geographically {{referenced}} data on humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) {{distribution and}} behaviour {{were collected in}} Richards Bay, South Africa, between 1998 and 2006. Utilization distributions presented a clear pattern {{in the distribution of}} dolphin activities and use of various locations within the study area. The 50 % kernel density estimate (core area) for foraging/feeding (2. 1 km 2) was clustered around the harbour mouth (including the shark net installation). The core areas for resting, socialising and travelling were more widespread ([2. 95 km 2). A mixed effects model indicated that location (longitude and latitude), distance from shore, year and group size are important variables in predicting foraging/feeding behaviour as opposed to other behaviours. The resting core was found {{in the southern part of}} study area and socialising was less clustered. This indicates preferential use of certain areas for specific behaviours. The overlap of foraging/ feeding areas with <b>stationary</b> fishing <b>gear</b> (shark nets) and boat traffic are a major concern due to the risk of humaninduced incidental mortalities. Any future alteration of the coastal area of Richards Bay, particularly development in the harbour, should be considered carefully, as further intrusion into areas critical to humpback dolphins, such as their foraging grounds, will inevitably carry negative implications for this already severely impacted population.

40|$|Bycatch of red {{king crab}} (Paralithodes camtschatica) in <b>stationary</b> fishing <b>gears,</b> q&ally gillnets, is an {{increasing}} problem to the inshore fishermen {{in the northern part}} of Norway (Finnmark county). The results are large bycatches of king crabs together with the crabs’ damages on the gear and catch. In the cod gillnet fisheries, the problem might be solved by using specially made gillnets (“norsel-mounted” nets) where the net itself is floated 0. 5 meters above the seabed. The norsel-mounted nets were compared with standard nets in the Varangerfjord (eastern Finnmark) in the period 17 March - 28 May 1999. The trials showed that norsel nets needed more floats than the standard nets to get the net to stand properly in the sea (to get the norsels stretched out suitably). By using extra float (rings) on the norsel mounted nets the bycatches of king crab were reduced to an acceptable level with an average of 0. 6 crabs/net, compared with 3. 3 crabs/net on standard and 6. 7 crabs/net on nor-se 1 nets without extra float. Norse 1 nets caught only about l/ 3 as many fish as standard nets. The catch results indicated that the gear configuration functioned in order to reduce the bycatch of red king crab. Loss of fish up to 65 % is, however not satisfying. Further work is needed to find a solution that gives a minimal loss of fish.

As a <b>stationary</b> fishing <b>gear</b> which catching principle are blocking of fish migration and the catching process that guidance schooling fish into trapped area causes set net technology implementation required a better {{understanding of}} fishing ground, behaviour of fishing target, and technology of fishing gear. Daily catch composition of set net consist of pelagic fish (8 - 15 species) as dominant catch, demersal fish (3 - 7 species), and others catch (2 - 6 species) with average of 385 kg in total/day. The variety of set net catch are indicated that existing and coming in of fish catch into the trapped net (chamber net) were affected by fish behavior response to the fishing gear performance, schooling fish migration pattern into coastal area, and oceanography factors during the fishing operation. Besides that, oceanography factors such as current direction (west and east), current speed (?? 5 - 20 cm/s), high of sea waves level (?? 100 - 1750 cm), and length of sea waves (?? 200 - 300 cm) significantly affect the geometry performance of fishing gear function on catch capacity in location of set net installation as a fix area of fishing ground.

40|$|The {{internal}} gear box (IGB) of an aeroengine represents a severe challenge in {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD). In the present study, an axisymmetric CFD model was assessed to investigate the complex internal air flow in an aeroengine IGB. All the non-axisymmetric components and geometry features inside the gear box, such as bearings, gears, bolts and slots, {{as well as the}} radial drive system and vent pipes, were simulated using porous media models. Their flow resistance was estimated either by empirical correlations or by preparatory CFD studies and comparison with measurements. To evaluate the CFD technique adopted in the present investigation, a separate bolt windage study was conducted using a similar axisymmtric CFD model with the porous media approach. Good agreement of the bolt windage with other workers' rig test data was observed. The present application of the porous media approach into a complex gear box flow represents a first attempt to use state of art CFD to assist an industrial design. Both maximum take-off (MTO) and ground idle (GI) running conditions were investigated. The complex flow patterns in the gear box were obtained. The results show a similar dimensionless performance of intermediate pressure (IP) and high pressure (HP) gears between the two operating conditions. For the present gear box arrangement under investigation, the CFD results suggest that the airflows induced by the HP gear and HP bearing are higher than their IP counterparts. A comparison with power absorption rig test data for the similar HP crownwheel in isolation shows that an assumption of pressure loss coefficient of 10 for the porous media of bevel gears may be appropriate, as the HP gear torque coefficient obtained in the CFD prediction is equal to 0. 05, very close to its expected value. In addition, the effects of an assumed <b>stationary</b> IP <b>gear</b> and a large seal clearance on the HP gear performance were also investigated. The numerical results show that their impacts are insignificant, probably due to the strong pumping effects of the HP gear. Further discussion on the possible influence of the airflow on the oil motion within the gearbox and assistance to improve the traditional internal airflow models used for bearing chamber sealing analysis was also made. Three dimensional geometry modeling and inclusion of the oil phase are considered feasible. Such further investigations would aid the understanding of the interaction between the induced airflow due to the rotating components and oil motion, and their impact on oil scavenging behaviour and `windage' contribution to heat oil...|$|R

This {{is documented}} by commercial landing data for <b>stationary</b> and mobile <b>gear</b> for all states, Texas to Maine (inclusive) {{for the years}} 1972 to 1988. The decline of the commercial hunting trade {{that began in the}} late 19 th century is outlined to illustrate that despite a difference of 100 years, social, political and biological similarities accompanied the decline of commercial harvest of fin fish and game. The research examines the rise of the recreational fishing paradigm {{and its impact on the}} commercial fisheries vis-a-vis legislation and the organization of interest known as the recreation/conservation complex. The politics of group formation and maintenance are discussed to provide a theoretical framework to understand the motivation and role of the political entrepreneur in the public policy formation and implementation process. Differences in the degree of gentrification of the inshore finfisheries occur because of the dominance of the traditional commercial fisheries in the northeast and the increasing importance of sport fishing in the Gulf of Mexico and mid-Atlantic regions. The rise of recreational paradigm for wildlife occurred before the rise of the recreational paradigm for the fisheries because of differences in their rate of exploitation. The first two hundred years of the exploitation of the inshore fisheries was governed by management regimes that limited entry, capital and effort. Whereas the first two hundred years of the exploitation of the wildlife was governed by open-access and free-taking of resources that were considered common property.
