40|$|The EN 13790 and {{agricultural}} products certification standards stimulated the <b>sprayers</b> inspections in a yearly basis in Portugal. Since 2006 Centro Operativo e Tecnológico Hortofrutícola Nacional (COTHN) inspected almost 3000 <b>sprayers</b> throughout the all country, including field crops <b>sprayers,</b> air assisted <b>sprayers</b> for bush and tree crops {{and a few}} hand held <b>sprayers</b> for greenhouse crops. In 2009 and 2010, Ambi 3 Q and A. CANO began with <b>sprayers</b> inspections {{in the north and}} south of Portugal, respectively. The implementation of the article 8 of the European Directive CE 128 / 09 in all member states is an important step to minimize environmental impacts, protect human health and improve plant protection efficacy. However it is not an easy task due to the characteristics of agriculture and <b>sprayers</b> in use of each country. The actual legislation concerning the construction and inspection of <b>sprayers</b> was published in the last 3 years. According to the article 8 of the European Directive, the Official Service Direcção-Geral de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural (DGADR) of the Agriculture Ministry, developed the Portuguese law Decreto-Lei n. º 86 / 2010 de 15 de Julho, in 2010, to impose that mounted <b>sprayers,</b> trailed <b>sprayers</b> and self-propelled <b>sprayers</b> must be inspected and approved before 26 November, 2016. The <b>sprayers</b> inspections carried out in Portugal should be an important tool to assess the <b>sprayers</b> in use and decide the best action plan to implement the article 8. Despite the <b>sprayers</b> inspections had been done mostly {{as a consequence of the}} European and National market rules, and so, the data collected are a rough sample of the real Portuguese situation, it is possible to observe that only one-third, of the <b>sprayers</b> inspected until now, have less than 5 years old. This means that the majority of the <b>sprayers</b> may not be in accordance with the standards and the article 8 of the European Directive...|$|R

50|$|Air Blast <b>sprayers,</b> {{also known}} as air-assisted or mist <b>sprayers,</b> are often used for tall crops, such as tree fruit, where boom <b>sprayers</b> and aerial {{application}} would be ineffective. These types of <b>sprayers</b> can only be used where overspray—spray drift—is less of a concern, either through the choice of chemical which does not {{have undesirable effects on}} other desirable organisms, or by adequate buffer distance. These can be used for insects, weeds, and other pests to crops, humans, and animals. Air blast <b>sprayers</b> inject liquid into a fast-moving stream of air, breaking down large droplets into smaller particles by introducing a small amount of liquid into a fast-moving stream of air.|$|R
25|$|Lens {{cleaning}} systems come in {{two main}} varieties: a small motor-driven rubber wiper or brush conceptually similar to windshield wipers, or a fixed or telescopic high-pressure <b>sprayer</b> which cleans the lenses with a spray of windshield washer fluid. Most recent lens cleaning systems are of the spray type, because UN regulations do not permit mechanical cleaning systems (wipers) {{to be used with}} plastic-lens headlamps, and most recent headlamps have plastic lenses. Some cars with retractable headlamps, such as the original Mazda MX-5, have a squeegee {{at the front of the}} lamp recess which automatically wipes the lenses as they are raised or lowered, although it does not provide washer fluid.|$|E

40|$|Pesticide <b>sprayers</b> {{from five}} {{state-owned}} agricultural farms {{took part in}} a study that evaluated their knowledge, attitude and practice of pesticide use on farms. Demographic features of the <b>sprayers</b> showed that the majority of them had primary-level education. The duration of work as <b>sprayers</b> on the farms ranged from 1 month to ~ 10 years, with 59 % of them having worked as <b>sprayers</b> for < 5 years. Their knowledge about hazards from pesticides was indicated by the responses they gave to the standard questionnaire. Careful working was considered to be very important by 93 % of them, while only 7 % suggested the use of personal protective devices (PPD). On some of the farms, <b>sprayers</b> were provided with inappropriate/unfit and worn-out PPD; 18 % of the <b>sprayers</b> had unfit goggles and 29 % used worn-out gloves. To minimize risk from pesticide application, 63 % suggested avoiding applications during windy and sunny weather, 32 % suggested the provision and proper use of PPD, while only 3 % of them felt medical check-ups and training were important, and 2 % suggested risks from spraying were best controlled by leaving their job. The hygiene and sanitation practices of the <b>sprayers</b> require much improvement. An attitudinal change is needed, together with the provision of better facilities and infrastructure. We recommend that pesticide safety education be given to the <b>sprayers.</b> In addition, appropriate PPD should be used, with regular maintenance and timely replacement of worn-out parts.

2500|$|In DESI, {{there is}} a {{high-velocity}} pneumatically assisted electrospray jet that is continually directed towards the probe surface. The jet forms a micrometer-size thin solvent film on the sample {{where it can be}} desorbed. The sample can be dislodged by the incoming spray jet allowing for particles to come off in an ejection cone of analyte containing secondary ion droplets. A lot of study is still going into looking at the working principals of DESI but there are still some things known. The erosion diameter of the spray spot formed by DESI is known to be directly tied to the spatial resolution. Both the chemical composition and the texture of the surface will also affect the ionization process. The nebulizing gas used most commonly is N2 set at a typical pressure of 160 psi. The solvent is a combination of methanol and water, sometimes paired with 0.5% acetic acid and at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The surface can be mounted it two different ways, one way consists of a surface holder that can carry 1 x 5cm large disposable surface slides that lie on a stainless steel surface. The steel surface has a voltage applied to provide an appropriate surface potential. The surface potential that can be applied is the same at which the <b>sprayer</b> can be set at. The second surface is made with an aluminum block that has a built in heater, this allows for temperature control with temperatures up to 300°C with newer stages having built in CCD’s and light sources. Their spectra are that similar to ESI. They feature multiply charged ions alkali metal adducts and non covalent complexes that originate from the condensed phase of the sample/solvent interaction. DESI [...] is revealed to have a more gentle ionization condition that leads to a more pronounced tendency for metal adduct formation and a lower specific charging of secondary droplets.|$|E
40|$|Drift {{is one of}} {{the main}} paths of plant {{protection}} products to non-target organisms. In Germany great efforts are made to reduce drift. Therefore <b>sprayers</b> are tested concerning their drift reducing ability in relation to the German basic drift values which have been determined on the basis of more than 180 drift trials with conventional <b>sprayers.</b> A classification system with classes of at least 50 %, 75 % and 90 % drift reduction has been introduced. <b>Sprayers</b> which meet the requirements of the German guideline are listed in the list of drift reducing <b>sprayers.</b> Nearly all of the <b>sprayers</b> are equipped with air injection nozzles to produce larger droplets. In orchards and hops further measures like shields on fan outlets, green detectors or tunnels are necessary to achieve the respective drift classes. Newer trials show that a drift reduction of 99 % in orchards is possible...|$|R

40|$|In Belgium, the {{inspection}} of <b>sprayers</b> is performed by official and mobile teams ruled by two inspection authorities. The management of {{the inspection}} {{is done by the}} Federal Ministry for Consumer Protection, Public Health and the Environment (FAVV). In the Flemish region the inspection is delegated to the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO). In Belgium, the mandatory inspection of <b>sprayers</b> was started up in 1996 and the 6 th inspection cycle (2011 - 2012 - 2013) is currently running. In the past decade the number of <b>sprayers</b> equipped with a spray rate controller, increased significantly. In the first inspection cycle (1996 - 1997 - 1998), only 4. 58 % of the <b>sprayers</b> were equipped with a spray rate controller in Flanders. In the fifth inspection cycle (2008 - 2009 - 2010), this percentage increased significantly to 20. 37 %.
