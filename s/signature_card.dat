However, they became bitter rivals after Jack stole Yusei's Stardust Dragon, Duel Runner and left for New Domino City. As a former {{resident}} of the Satellite, he must hide his past from the rest of society. Jack is defeated by Yusei in the championship round of the Fortune Cup. He starts off as very arrogant and cruel, but his conscience is revived thanks to Carly Carmine, who heals his wounded heart and teaches him to [...] "let the real Jack Atlas live", and become a good person. Jack is also revealed to be in love with Carly. His <b>signature</b> <b>card</b> is also a Synchro monster, Red Dragon Archfiend (Red Demon's Dragon in the Japanese version) which, when granted the power of the Signers, can be upgraded to Majestic Red Dragon. He later achieves Burning Soul, an ability which can summon out Red Nova Dragon. He plays a [...] "Power" [...] Deck, focusing on quickly summoning powerful monster to obliterate his opponent's defenses. Jack is one of the six Signers, and carries the Crimson Dragon's Wings. Mina, Carly, and the waitress Stephanie are all attracted to Jack. Jack continues to compete in Duel Circuits around the world {{at the end of the}} series in hopes to become the top Turbo Duelist in the world. Jack is the second most powerful Duelist/Turbo Duelist in the series of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, second only to Yusei.|$|E

40|$|As {{electronic}} voting enters {{the stage of}} real-world implementations, digital <b>signature</b> <b>cards</b> emerge as a basic infrastructure element for e-voting. The paper focuses on three main functions of such cards: (i) Authentication and (as National ID Card also) identification, (ii) as a storage media and (iii) as a secure processing environment. These properties enable protocols for secure e-voting, which guarantees the General Voting Principles. However, the diffusion of digital <b>signature</b> <b>cards</b> is still relatively low and in many cases, electronic vote casting has to be implemented without such cards. The paper reports on a test election conducted in Austria in May 2003 using a protocol designed for digital <b>signature</b> <b>cards,</b> which was adapted to a case, where such cards are not (yet) available. The necessary adaptations clearly show the importance of digital <b>signature</b> <b>cards</b> for secure e-voting...|$|R

50|$|Withdrawals {{normally}} {{required the}} account holder {{to visit the}} branch where the account was held, where a credit slip or withdrawal slip would be prepared and signed. If the account holder was not known to the teller, the signature on the slip and the authorities would be checked against the <b>signature</b> <b>card</b> at the branch, before money was paid out. In the 1980s, banks adopted the black light signature system for passbooks, which enabled withdrawals to be made from passbooks at a branch {{other than the one}} where an account was opened, unless prior arrangements were made to transfer the <b>signature</b> <b>card</b> to the other branch. Under this system, the passbook's owner would sign {{in the back of the}} passbook in an invisible ink and the signing authorities would also be noted. At the paying branch, the signature on the withdrawal slip would be checked against the signature in the book, which required a special ultraviolet reader to read. Nowadays, customer verification is more likely to be by PIN and commonly from an automated teller machine.|$|E

Additional personal information could also be added at the will of the card holder. Such information may have included next of kin, organ donor status or drug allergies and also, according to Joe Hockey the former responsible government minister, shopping lists and perhaps MP3s. This extra information was to be secured with the user's PIN, so only those who needed it had access to it.|$|E
40|$|A {{protocol}} has everlasting security if it {{is secure}} against adversaries that are computationally unlimited after the protocol execution. This models {{the fact that we}} cannot predict which cryptographicschemes will be broken, say, several decades after the protocol execution. In classical cryptography, everlasting security is difficult to achieve: even using trusted setup like common reference strings or signature cards, many tasks such as secure communication and oblivious transfer cannot be achieved with everlasting security. An analogous result in the quantum setting excludes protocols based on common reference strings, but not protocols using a <b>signature</b> <b>card.</b> We define a variant of the Universal Composability framework, everlasting quantum-UC, and show that in this model, we can implement secure communication and general multi-party computation using signature cards as truste...|$|E

40|$|When {{a person}} opens an account with a hank, seldom it is {{realised}} that a contract has been entered into {{between him and}} the bank. The normal steps to be taken to open an account are simple and short. In fact all that is required to be done by the prospective customer, at least {{in the case of a}} deposit account, is just to put his signature or thumb-print on the specimen <b>signature</b> <b>card.</b> The rest of the work will be done by the bank. However, out of this apparently simple act will come into existence a debtor-creditor contractual relationship which, in its turn, establishes the duties of both parties (i. e the bank and the customer).

40|$|Design of secure {{systems can}} often be {{expressed}} as ensuring that some property is maintained at every step of a distributed computation among mutually-untrusting parties. Special cases include integrity of programs running on untrusted platforms, various forms of confidentiality and side-channel resilience, and domain-specific invariants. We propose a new approach, proof-carrying data (PCD), which circumnavigates the threat of faults and leakage by reasoning about properties of the output data, independently of the preceding computation. In PCD, the system designer prescribes the desired properties of the computation’s outputs. Corresponding proofs are attached to every message flowing through the system, and are mutually verified by the system’s components. Each such proof attests that the message’s data {{and all of its}} history comply with the specified properties. We construct a general protocol compiler that generates, propagates and verifies such proofs of compliance, while preserving the dynamics and efficiency of the original computation. Our main technical tool is the cryptographic construction of short non-interactive arguments (computationally-sound proofs) for statements whose truth depends on “hearsay evidence”: previous arguments about other statements. To this end, we attain a particularly strong proof of knowledge. We realize the above, under standard cryptographic assumptions, in a model where the prover has blackbox access to some simple functionality — essentially, a <b>signature</b> <b>card...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 1999 the {{directive}} 1999 / 93 /EC of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council was enacted, providing a legal framework for a common introduc-tion of electronic signatures in Europe. So far the signature market has failed miserably. Mobile electronic signatures could be a potential and promising way to increase the market acceptance of electronic signatures. In this contribution we used an infrastructure for qualified mobile electronic signatures proposed in [Ross 2004] {{as the basis of}} our assumptions. This infrastructure does not require the mobile operator to act as a certificate service provider (CSP). Instead the user can freely choose a CSP and add the signature functionality along with the required certificates later on demand. The mobile operator would act as the card issuer and would only profit from traffic caused by signature applications. However, mobile operators will only enter the signature market if they expect a profit in return. Therefore, {{we take a look at}} the economic feasibility of mobile qualified electronic signatures from the viewpoint of a mobile operator (MO) and try to predict the return on investment. Also, the CSP will only accept this infrastructure, by giving up the control over the <b>signature</b> <b>card,</b> if profits can be expected. Therefore, we examine potential revenue sources for CSPs, using new business models proposed in [LiRo 2005] that have the potential to be far more successful than the current ones. Our prediction shows that mobile quali-fied electronic signatures can be quite profitable for both parties. ...|$|E
