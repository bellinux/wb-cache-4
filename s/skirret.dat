In the midst of {{receipts}} for [...] "Rabbits, and Chickens mumbled, Pickled Samphire, <b>Skirret</b> Pye, Baked Tansy," [...] and other forgotten delicacies, there were directions for the preparation of several lotions {{for the preservation of}} beauty. One of these was so charming that I interrupted my husband to read it aloud. [...] "Just what I wanted!" [...] he exclaimed; and the receipt for the [...] "Lily of the Valley Water" [...] was instantly incorporated into Kidnapped.|$|E

5000|$|Sium sisarum, {{commonly}} known as <b>skirret,</b> is a perennial plant of the family Apiaceae sometimes grown as a root vegetable. The English name <b>skirret</b> {{is derived from the}} Middle English 'skirwhit' or 'skirwort', meaning 'white root'. In Scotland it is known as crummock. Its Danish name sukkerrod, Dutch name suikerwortel [...] and German name [...] "Zuckerwurzel" [...] translate as 'sugar root'.|$|E

50|$|Take <b>skirrets,</b> {{parsnips}} and apples, and parboil them. Make {{a batter}} of flour and eggs. Cast ale, saffron and salt into it. Wet {{them in the}} batter and fry them in oil or in grease. Pour on almond milk and serve it forth.|$|R
50|$|Take your <b>skirrets</b> {{and boil}} them, skin them, then cut them to lengths {{about two or}} three inches. Wash them with yolks of eggs and season with salt, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg. Put to them some {{chestnuts}} boiled and blanched and some yolks of hard-boiled eggs split, and lay over some sliced lemon. Put over butter and close it in a raised coffin.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Skirret</b> (gerla) {{is hot and}} dry. Eaten in moderation, it is {{not very}} helpful or harmful. If someone should {{eat a lot of}} it, its heat and dryness would stir up fevers in him and harm his intestines. A person whose face has weak skin, which easily splits, should pound <b>skirret</b> in a mortar and add oil. When he goes to bed at night, he should rub it on his face, {{continuing}} until he is healed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skirret</b> has {{a cluster}} of bright white, sweetish, {{somewhat}} aromatic roots, each approximately 15-20 cm in length. These are used as a vegetable {{in the same manner}} as the common salsify, black salsify and the parsnip.|$|E
50|$|Perennial {{vegetables}} {{are an integral}} part of many cultural diets around the world, particularly in tropical agriculture. Perennial vegetables fell out of favor in most of Europe, and other western influenced cultures, once industrial agriculture gained a foothold. Some of the older temperate varieties include: seakale, <b>skirret,</b> sorrel, and Good King Henry.|$|E
50|$|Boil {{your biggest}} <b>skirrets</b> and blanch and season them with cinnamon, nutmeg, {{and a very}} little ginger and sugar. Your pye being ready lay in your skirrets; season also the marrow {{of three or four}} bones with cinnamon, sugar, a little salt and grated bread. Lay the marrow in your pye and the yolks of hard eggs, a handful of {{chestnuts}} boiled and blanched, and some candied orange-peel in slices. Lay butter on the top and lid your pye. Let your caudle be white wine and sugar, thicken it with the yolks of eggs, and when the pye is baked pour it in and serve it hot. Scrape sugar on it.|$|R
50|$|Take {{the largest}} <b>skirrets</b> {{you can get}} & parboyle them & peel them & season them with cinnimon & powder sugar & {{put them in a}} dish with a good deal of fresh butter & some sliced citron & candid orange peel & candid eringoroot, 3 spoonfulls of rose water, 4 of white wine, some Jerusalem hartichokes boyled & sliced. Make it with cold butter paste. When it coms out of the oven, have ready a caudle made of half a pint of sack, some sugar & nutmeg & the yolks of 4 eggs & a print of butter poured on it very hot & the lid laid on it again.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots are}} scrubbed, cut into lengths, boiled, and served like {{parsnips}} or carrots. <b>Skirret</b> roots can be stewed, baked, roasted, fried in batter as fritter, or creamed, and also be grated and used raw in salads. A woody core {{may be present}} in some roots, though {{this seems to be}} variable in different plants. If present, it should be removed before cooking because it is difficult to remove after.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skirret</b> grows about 1 m {{high and}} is very {{resistant}} to cold, as well as pests and diseases. It can be grown from seeds, but may also be started from root divisions. The roots are best eaten when the plant is dormant during the winter, as in the spring, the roots become woody and covered with small hairs. Lack of moisture can also make the root more fibrous. The plant prefers sandy and moist soil.|$|E
50|$|Vegetables {{included}} onions, chives, cabbage, celery, {{wild garlic}} and leeks. Fathen (Chenopodium album) {{a form of}} wild lentil, is often found on pre Norman archaeological sites and {{appears to have been}} {{an important part of the}} diet, as it still is in Northern India. <b>Skirret</b> (Sium sisaram) in Irish cearrachán, appears to have been grown as a root vegetable, this is no longer used. Watercress, sorrel, parsley and nettles were picked wild and eaten raw or added to broth.|$|E

5000|$|McMahon's most {{enduring}} contribution was his Calendar, {{the most comprehensive}} gardening book published in the United States {{in the first half}} of the nineteenth century. It finished in its eleventh edition in 1857. It was modeled on a traditional English formula, of month-by-month instructions on planting, pruning, and soil preparation for the [...] "Kitchen Garden, Fruit Garden, Orchard, Vineyard, Nursery, Pleasure Ground, Flower Garden, Green House, Hot house and Forcing Frames". In some particulars, McMahon followed his English models so closely that J. C. Loudon suggested in 1826 that the derivative character of the Calendar was such that [...] "We cannot gather from the work any thing as to the extent of American practice in these particulars." [...] Ann Leighton notes the absence of Indian corn among the [...] "Seeds of Esculent Vegetables" [...] in 1806, though he lists old-fashioned favorites like coriander, corn-salad, orach, rampion, rocambole and <b>skirret.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} {{peoples in the}} north of Europe in Late Antiquity, the Picts were farmers living in small communities. Cattle and horses were an obvious sign of wealth and prestige, sheep and pigs were kept in large numbers, and place names suggest that {{transhumance}} was common. Animals were small by later standards, although horses from Britain were imported into Ireland as breed-stock to enlarge native horses. From Irish sources it appears that the élite engaged in competitive cattle-breeding for size, and this may have been the case in Pictland also. Carvings show hunting with dogs, and also, unlike in Ireland, with falcons. Cereal crops included wheat, barley, oats and rye. Vegetables included kale, cabbage, onions and leeks, peas and beans and turnips, and some types no longer common, such as <b>skirret.</b> Plants such as wild garlic, nettles and watercress may have been gathered in the wild. The pastoral economy meant that hides and leather were readily available. Wool was the main source of fibres for clothing, and flax was also common, although it is not clear if they grew it for fibres, for oil, or as a foodstuff. Fish, shellfish, seals, and whales were exploited along coasts and rivers. The importance of domesticated animals suggests that meat and milk products were {{a major part of the}} diet of ordinary people, while the élite would have eaten a diet rich in meat from farming and hunting.|$|E
