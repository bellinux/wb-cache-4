40|$|<b>Socio-economic</b> and {{environmental}} <b>drivers</b> are important determinants urban plant richness patterns. The scale at which these patterns are observed in different regions, however, {{has not been}} explored. In arid regions, where forests are not native, {{the majority of the}} urban forest is planted, and trees are presumably chosen for specific attributes. Here, we investigate the role of spatial scales and the relative importance of environmental versus <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers</b> in determining the community structure of southern California’s urban forest. Second, we assess the usefulness of ecosystem service-based traits for understanding patterns of urban biodiversity, compared with species composition data. Third, we test whether resident preferences for specific tree attributes are important for understanding patterns of species composition and diversity. We studied tree communities in 37 neighborhoods in three southern California counties (Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside). The urban forest in southern California is very diverse with 114 species. Using multiple regression analyses we found <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers</b> were generally more important than environmental and the strength of the relationship between urban forest community structure and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers</b> depended on whether we were analyzing within or across counties. There was greater tree richness in wealthier neighborhoods compared with less affluent neighborhoods across all counties and Orange County, but not in Los Angeles or Riverside counties alone. We also found a greater proportion of residential shade trees in hotter neighborhoods than in cooler neighborhoods, which corresponds with survey results of residents’ preferences for tree attributes. Ultimately our study demonstrates that the species richness and functional traits of urban tree communities are influenced by managers’ and residents’ preferences and perceptions of urban tree traits...|$|R

40|$|Most {{hydrological}} {{studies do}} {{not account for}} the socio-economic influences on eco-hydrological processes. However, socio-economic developments often change the water balance substantially and are highly relevant in understanding changes in hydrological responses. In this study a multi-disciplinary approach was used to study the cascading impacts of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers</b> of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on the eco-hydrological regime of the Lake Naivasha Basin. The basin has recently experienced substantial LULC changes exacerbated by <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers.</b> The simplified cascade models provided insights for an improved understanding of the socio-ecohydrological system. Results show that the upstream population has transformed LULC such that runoff during the period 1986 – 2010 was 32 % higher than during the period 1961 – 1985. Cut-flower export volumes and downstream population growth explain 71 % of the water abstracted from Lake Naivasha. The influence of upstream population on LULC and upstream hydrological processes explained 59 % and 30 % of the variance in lake storage volumes and sediment yield respectively. The downstream LULC changes had significant impact on large wild herbivore mammal species on the fringe zone of the lake. This study shows that, in cases where observed socio-economic developments are substantial, the use of a cascade-modeling approach, that couple socio-economic factors to eco-hydrological processes, can greatly improve our understanding of the eco-hydrological processes of a catchment...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} decades and centuries, European {{mountain}} landscapes have experienced substantial transformations. Natural and anthropogenic LULC changes (land use and land cover changes), especially agro-pastoral activities, have directed influenced the spatial organization and composition of European mountain landscapes. For the past 60 years, natural reforestation has been occurring due {{to a decline in}} both agricultural production activities and rural population. Stakeholders, to better anticipate future changes, need spatially and temporally explicit models to identiy areas at risk of land change and possible abandonment. This paper presents an integrated approach combining forecasting scenarios and a LULC changes simulation model to assess where LULC changes may occur in the Pyrenees Mountains, based on historical LULC trands and a range of future <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers.</b> The proposed methodology considers local specificities of Pyrenan valleys, sub-regional climate and topographical properties, and regional economic policies. Results indicate that some regions are projected to face strong abandonment, regardless of scenario conditions. Overall, high rates of change are associated with administrative regions where land productivity is highly dependent on <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers</b> and climatic and environmental conditions limit intensive (agricultural and/or pastoral) production and profitability. The combination of the results for the four scenarios allows assessements of where encroachment (e. g. colonization by shrublands) and reforestation are the most probable. This assessment intends to provide insight into the potential future development of the Pyrenees to help identify areas that are the most sensitive to change and to guide decision makers to help their management decisions...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the three}} pillars of CA {{is the use of}} crop {{residues}} (CR) for mulching. However, in smallholder farming systems that combine crop production and livestock husbandry (mixed systems), CR are usually an essential source of feed, restricting their availability for mulching. Additionally in these systems, CR fulfil other functions such as providing fuel and additional income through sale. Smallholder production in mixed systems supports the livelihoods of almost two thirds of the global population, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (Herrero et al., 2010). The integration between crops and animals not only enhances agricultural production, but also improves household food intake and income and provides a buffer against climate risks (Thornton, 2010). The need to cover their own food requirements and household expenses pushes smallholder farmers to favour practices with positive returns in the short term, which may affect the sustainability of the systems in the long term. Farmers‘ decisions are influenced by biophysical and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers</b> including climate, population dynamics, market access and other institutional mechanisms. The focus of this paper is on the trade-offs of CR use in a range of smallholder mixed systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA). The objective of this paper is threefold: (i) to describe the different CR farmer uses in these mixed systems; (ii) to understand what biophysical and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers</b> explain differences in CR allocation; and (iii) to include these findings in the broader discussion on long term sustainability issues in mixed systems and constraints for CA practices adoption...|$|R

40|$|The {{socio-economic}} {{factors are}} of key importance during {{all phases of}} wildfire management that include prevention, suppression and restoration. However, modeling these factors, at the proper spatial and temporal scale to understand fire regimes is still challenging. This study analyses <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers</b> of wildfire occurrence in central Spain. This site represents {{a good example of}} how human activities play a key role over wildfires in the European Mediterranean basin. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and machine learning Maximum Entropy models (Maxent) predicted wildfire occurrence in the 1980 s and also in the 2000 s to identify changes between each period in the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>drivers</b> affecting wildfire occurrence. GLM base their estimation on wildfire presence-absence observations whereas Maxent on wildfire presence-only. According to indicators like sensitivity or commission error Maxent outperformed GLM in both periods. It achieved a sensitivity of 38. 9 % and a commission error of 43. 9 % for the 1980 s, and 67. 3 % and 17. 9 % for the 2000 s. Instead, GLM obtained 23. 33, 64. 97, 9. 41 and 18. 34 %, respectively. However GLM performed steadier than Maxent in terms of the overall fit. Both models explained wildfires from predictors such as population density and Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), but differed in their relative contribution. As a result of the urban sprawl and an abandonment of rural areas, predictors like WUI and distance to roads increased their contribution to both models in the 2000 s, whereas Forest-Grassland Interface (FGI) influence decreased. This study demonstrates that human component can be modelled with a spatio-temporal dimension to integrate it into wildfire risk assessment.
