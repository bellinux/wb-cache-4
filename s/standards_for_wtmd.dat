40|$|This study {{proposes a}} novel Web-based text mining (WTM) {{framework}} on the grid, which firstly applies the grid technology to text mining system {{for improving the}} performance of WTM. The WTM system is to implement a high performance text mining process on the grid, and provide users with a high efficiency text mining and knowledge discovery services. We focus our discussion on the formulation of this framework <b>for</b> <b>WTM</b> system on the grid. In this study, firstly, a general framework of grid-based WTM is proposed, then a main process about WTM on the grid is described, and subsequently {{the implementation of the}} proposed grid-based WTM framework model is given. Finally, some conclusions are given...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{original}} neighborhood mechanism <b>for</b> <b>WTM</b> self-organizing Kohonen map implemented in CMOS 0. 18 μm process. Proposed mechanism is an asynchronous circuit {{and does not}} require controlling clock generator. Propagation of an enable signal from a winning neuron to neurons that belong to the winner’s neighborhood is very fast. For example radius (R) of the neighborhood equal to 15, total time that is required to start adaptation of all neighboring neurons is below 10 ns. This makes the proposed WTM network in practice {{as fast as the}} WTA Kohonen network. When compared to <b>WTM</b> networks implemented, <b>for</b> example in C++, the proposed solution can be even several hundreds times faster and consume much less power. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1989 Lisa joined Workers' Theatre Movement (WTM) (president Ewan MacColl), and ran {{the company}} with its founder, actor Tam Dean Burn from 1989-91. She wrote and {{directed}} short plays/raps around {{issues such as the}} Poll Tax, Irish self-determination, unemployment, International Women’s Day, May Day, the first Gulf War. These were performed by the group at demos, on the street, in job centres or wherever a political intervention might be made. WTM also ran the Internationale Cabaret in Camden. <b>For</b> <b>WTM</b> Lisa directed a revival of Waiting for Lefty at the Old Red Lion in 1990 with Ed Bishop in the lead role. She also directed the Bobby Sands Trilogy in 1991 at the Tramway, Glasgow, performed by Tam Dean Burn, despite calls for the ‘IRA play’ to be banned. [...] In 1991, during the first Gulf War, whilst running a non-stop picket outside the American Embassy, Tam and Lisa set up Artists against the War, working with a diverse group of artists to create art action on the streets against the war. In 2001 they revived this idea after the bombing of Afghanistan.|$|R

40|$|This project aims {{to explore}} the Chinese {{national}} environment’s influences on Chinese WTM companies, evaluate the leading Chinese WTM companies’ competitiveness under the industrial change and assess the future implication <b>for</b> the global <b>WTM</b> companies. As a result, it will give readers {{an understanding of the}} Chinese WTM industry’s rapid growth and its future implications. Based on PESTLE factors, the national environment has created opportunities <b>for</b> <b>WTM</b> companies: “one belt one road” policy, increasing social consciousness of air pollution, smart grid system’s launch and new transmission line in 2011, offshore feed in tariff introduction in 2014, RPS certificate trading. Threat also exists as: inefficient grid integration, onshore feed in tariff reduction, wind projects are highly state controlled, wind resources potential varies differently across the geographical areas. suppliers of key turbine components lost bargaining power as WTM companies integrated backward, buyers’ price sensitivity of standard onshore wind turbine models increase, wind power is still easily substituted by hydropower, high entry barriers with more industry standards have been set, competition on onshore installation intensified, while offshore market remains oligopoly. This indicates lower profitability in onshore wind turbines manufacturing and relatively high profitability in offshore wind turbines manufacturing, at the same time, WTM companies have gained capabilities to integrate in the supply chain. The leading Chinese WTM companies Goldwind, Guodian Unite Power, Mingyang and Envision improved product performance under the threat of inefficient grid connection, and their technological breakthrough in wind control will reduce the cost of electricity and help them govern the profitability. They have also captured the opportunity to develop foreign market and offshore market at different levels. Goldwind and Guodian United Power has competitive advantages in better access to distribution channel, Envision has competitive advantage in software development, and Guodian United Power is competitive in advanced turbine models. And because of the inimitability of these key capabilities in a short-term by the other companies, these competitive advantages might sustain...|$|R

40|$|With {{support from}} the Chinese government, the Chinese wind power {{generation}} industry is experiencing rapid development. The quick growth of the wind power generation industry has promoted {{the development of the}} Chinese wind turbine manufacturing industry. Similarly, the quantity and the productivity of the local Chinese Wind Turbine Manufacturers (WTMs) have also undergone a quick and significant expansion. This is resulting in an increase in competition amongst the WTMs in China. Being relatively new, this creates a fertile environment <b>for</b> local Chinese <b>WTMs</b> that is ripe for study and analysis. Based on the niche theory of industrial ecosystem and enterprise, this paper investigates the Chinese wind turbine manufacturing industry, and proposes a wind turbine manufacturing industry ecosystem model and a WTMs’ ecological niche evaluation index system (WENEIS). Use is made of a catastrophe theory model evaluation method to evaluate the ecological niche status of the 6 main local Chinese WTMs selected and a spider diagram is established to compare the status of the different enterprises’ ecological niche. The proposed WENEIS aids WTMs in finding the competitive advantage and disadvantage factors for their development, as well as providing a valuable reference <b>for</b> the <b>WTMs</b> to improve their business environment and to formulate their competitive strategy in the future. ...|$|R
