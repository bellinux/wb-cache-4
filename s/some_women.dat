5|$|In <b>some</b> <b>women,</b> {{ovulation}} {{features a}} characteristic pain called mittelschmerz (German term meaning middle pain). The sudden change in hormones {{at the time}} of ovulation sometimes also causes light mid-cycle blood flow.|$|E
5|$|After the war, <b>some</b> <b>women</b> who {{had been}} {{especially}} active in supporting the war {{on the home front}} turned their organizational skills to other concerns, especially prohibition and woman suffrage. In 1874, for example, Zerelda Wallace, the wife of former Indiana governor David Wallace and stepmother of General Lew Wallace, became a founder of the Indiana chapter of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and served as its first president.|$|E
5|$|Although female life {{expectancy}} in Byzantium {{was lower than}} that of men, due to death in childbirth, wars and the fact that men married younger, female widowhood was still fairly common. Still, <b>some</b> <b>women</b> were able to circumvent societal strictures and work as traders, artisans, abbots, entertainers, and scholars.|$|E

5|$|Common {{problems}} {{women experience}} post-SCI are pain with intercourse and difficulty achieving orgasm. Around half {{of women with}} SCI are able to reach orgasm, usually when their genitals are stimulated. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> report the sensation of orgasm {{to be the same}} as before the injury, and others say the sensation is reduced.|$|E
5|$|During the war <b>some</b> <b>women</b> took on {{the added}} {{responsibility}} of running family farms and businesses. Hoosier women {{also contributed to the}} war effort as nurses and volunteers in charitable organizations, most commonly the local Ladies' Aid Societies. In January 1863 Governor Morton and the Indiana Sanitary Commission began recruiting women to work as nurses in military hospitals and on ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{occupation}} for women was weaving {{clothes for the}} family, sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women. Other women helped on their brothers' farms or became singers, dancers, sorceresses, respected medical physicians, and successful merchants who could afford their own silk clothes. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> formed spinning collectives, aggregating the resources of several different families.|$|E

5|$|Women of {{high status}} lived in {{seclusion}} at court and, through strategic marriages, {{were used to}} gain political power for their families. Despite their seclusion, <b>some</b> <b>women</b> wielded considerable influence, often achieved through competitive salons, dependent {{on the quality of}} those attending. Ichijō's mother and Michinaga's sister, Senshi, had an influential salon, and Michinaga probably wanted Shōshi to surround herself with skilled women such as Murasaki to build a rival salon.|$|E
5|$|Women with Lynch {{syndrome}} {{should begin}} to have annual biopsy screening {{at the age of}} 35. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> with Lynch syndrome elect to have a prophylactic hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy to greatly reduce the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.|$|E
5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their husbands and brothers. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to sell in the market. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Britain {{suffered}} severe {{shortages of}} raw materials. While consideration {{was given to}} reopening the closed mines, this was not deemed viable and instead the few remaining mines increased their production. As many male workers were away on military service, <b>some</b> <b>women</b> were briefly employed in tin-picking at Geevor, and in ore-dressing at the Great Rock iron mine on Dartmoor, {{during and after the}} war until around 1952. Other than a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 ended the policy of recruiting only men for underground work in the few surviving mines, the Geevor pickers were the last female manual labourers in the Cornish mining industry.|$|E
5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Joe and Quagmire drag Cleveland {{to a bar}} {{to get him to}} meet <b>some</b> <b>women,</b> as he's {{still reeling}} from him and Loretta getting a divorce. It doesn’t work so well, so when The Bachelorette comes to Quahog, Peter takes Cleveland to {{audition}} for the show. Cleveland gets nervous at the audition and in an effort to calm him, Peter removes Cleveland’s clothes and then his own. The producers see this and Brian apologizes for what happened with Peter and Cleveland--Brian begins to explain how Cleveland and his wife recently divorced and how Cleveland's confused about what he really wants in a relationship.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>women</b> {{were able}} {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberty of}} being {{employed}} in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed <b>some</b> <b>women</b> to style themselves tzu-shu nii (never to marry) {{and live in}} communes with other women. Other Chinese called them sou-hei (self-combers) for adopting hairstyles of married women. These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the communist government for being a relic of feudal China. In contemporary Chinese society, tongzhi (same goal or spirit) is the term {{used to refer to}} homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the front wall. For <b>some</b> <b>women,</b> stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation. The G-spot area {{has been described as}} needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because of the particular angle of penetration required.|$|E

50|$|However, if {{the major}} premise ("every {{person has a}} woman that is their mother") {{is assumed to be}} true, then it is valid to {{conclude}} that there is <b>some</b> <b>woman</b> who is any given person's mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Beckendorff's aunt; what an idea! As if he {{ever had}} an aunt! Men of his calibre make {{themselves}} out of mud. They have no relations. Well, never mind; there was some story, I am sure, about <b>some</b> <b>woman</b> or other. Depend upon it that this girl is the child of that woman, whether she be aunt, niece, or daughter. I shall go and tell every one that I know the whole business; this girl {{is the daughter of}} <b>some</b> <b>woman</b> or other." [...] So saying, away walked the young Count of Eberstein, to disseminate in all directions the important conclusion to which his logical head had allowed him to arrive.|$|R
5|$|The massive {{influx of}} prospectors drove the {{formation}} of boom towns along the routes of the stampede, with Dawson City in the Klondike the largest. The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared {{just as soon as}} they came. Most stampeders were men but women also travelled to the region, typically as the wife of a prospector. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men and women who were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E
5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for work outside the home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused <b>some</b> <b>women</b> to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman invasion, the {{position}} of women in society changed. The rights and roles of women became more sharply defined, in part {{as a result of}} the development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; <b>some</b> <b>women</b> benefited from this, while others lost out. The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the 12th century, clarifying the right of free women to own property, but this did not necessarily prevent women from being forcibly remarried against their wishes. The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour. As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with ploughing and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and dairy production becoming dominated by women.|$|E
6000|$|Nor {{is there}} any escape in the {{supposition}} that <b>some</b> <b>woman</b> existed before Eve, after the fashion of the Lilith of the rabbis; since Suarez qualifies that notion, along with some other Judaic imaginations, as simply [...] "damnabilis."[1] ...|$|R
