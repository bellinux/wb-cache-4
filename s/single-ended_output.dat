5000|$|<b>Single-ended</b> <b>output</b> stages have an {{asymmetrical}} transfer function, {{meaning that}} even-order harmonics in the created distortion tend to not cancel out (as {{they do in}} push-pull output stages). For tubes, or FETs, most distortion is second-order harmonics, from the square law transfer characteristic, which to some produces a [...] "warmer" [...] and more pleasant sound.|$|E
50|$|If the {{differential}} output is not desired, then only one output {{can be used}} (taken from {{just one of the}} collectors (or anodes or drains), disregarding the other output; this configuration is referred to as <b>single-ended</b> <b>output.</b> The gain is half that of the stage with differential output. To avoid sacrificing gain, a differential to single-ended converter can be utilized. This is often implemented as a current mirror (Figure 3, below).|$|E
5000|$|An {{operational}} amplifier (often op-amp or opamp) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a <b>single-ended</b> <b>output.</b> In this configuration, an op-amp produces an output potential (relative to circuit ground) that is typically {{hundreds of thousands}} of times larger than the potential difference between its input terminals.Operational amplifiers had their origins in analog computers, where they were used to perform mathematical operations in many linear, non-linear and frequency-dependent circuits.|$|E
40|$|Op amps {{are very}} high gain {{amplifiers}} with differential inputs and <b>single-ended</b> <b>outputs.</b> They are often used in high precision analog circuits, so {{it is important to}} measure their performance accurately. But in open-loop measurements their high open-loop gain, which may be as great as 107 or more, makes it very hard to avoid errors from very small voltages at the amplifier input due to pickup, stray currents, or the Seebeck (thermocouple) effect. The measurement process can be greatly simplified by using a servo loop to force a null at the amplifier input, thus allowing the amplifier under test to essentially measure its own errors. Figure 1 shows a versatile circuit that employs this principle, employing an auxiliary op amp as an integrator to establish a stable loop with very high dc open-loop gain. The switches facilitate performance of the various tests described in the simplified illustrations that follow. Figure 1. Basic op amp measurement circuit.

The plate voltage limit is 750 volts and the screen grid limited to 300 volts. Because of the 300 volt screen grid voltage limit, the 807 cannot be triode connected for high power applications. Failure to observe this precaution will cause screen grid failure. Less commonly a single 807 was used in a pure class-A, <b>single-ended</b> audio <b>output</b> stage delivering about 10 watts.|$|R
50|$|The {{final stage}} of amplification, after preamplifiers, is the output stage, where the highest demands are placed on the {{transistors}} or tubes. For this reason, the design choices made around the output device (for <b>single-ended</b> <b>output</b> stages, such as in single-ended triode amplifiers) or devices (for push-pull output stages), such as the Class of operation of the output devices is often taken as {{the description of the}} whole power amplifier. For example, a Class B amplifier will probably have just the high power output devices operating cut off for half of each cycle, while the other devices (such as differential amplifier, voltage amplifier and possibly even driver transistors) operate in Class A. In a transformerless output stage, the devices are essentially in series with the power supply and output load (such as a loudspeaker), possibly via some large capacitor and/or small resistances.|$|E
50|$|A Single Ended Push-Pull (SEPP, SRPP or mu-follower) output stage, {{originally}} {{called the}} Series-Balanced amplifier (US patent 2,310,342, Feb 1943). {{is similar to}} a totem-pole arrangement for transistors in that two devices are in series between the power supply rails, but the input drive goes only to one of the devices, the bottom one of the pair; hence the (seemingly contradictory) Single-Ended description. The output is taken from the cathode of the top (not directly driven) device, which acts part way between a constant current source and a cathode follower but receiving some drive from the plate (anode) circuit of the bottom device. The drive to each tube therefore might not be equal, but the circuit tends to keep the current through the bottom device somewhat constant throughout the signal, increasing the power gain and reducing distortion compared with a true single-tube <b>single-ended</b> <b>output</b> stage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quiescent}} current {{has to be}} constant to ensure constant collector voltages at common mode. This requirement is not so important {{in the case of}} a differential output since the two collector voltages will vary simultaneously but their difference (the output voltage) will not vary. But {{in the case of a}} <b>single-ended</b> <b>output,</b> it is extremely important to keep a constant current since the output collector voltage will vary. Thus the higher the resistance of the current source , the lower (better) is the common mode gain [...] The constant current needed can be produced by connecting an element (resistor) with very high resistance between the shared emitter node and the supply rail (negative for NPN and positive for PNP transistors) but this will require high supply voltage. That is why, in more sophisticated designs, an element with high differential (dynamic) resistance approximating a constant current source/sink is substituted for the “long tail” (Figure 3). It is usually implemented by a current mirror because of its high compliance voltage (small voltage drop across the output transistor).|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} metrics {{of how well}} a current mirror will perform {{as part of a}} larger circuit. The first measure is the static error, the difference between the input and output currents expressed as a fraction of the input current. Minimizing this difference is critical in such applications of a current mirror as the differential to <b>single-ended</b> <b>output</b> signal conversion in a differential amplifier stage because this difference controls the common mode and power supply rejection ratios. The second measure is the output impedance of the current source or equivalently its inverse, the output conductance. This impedance affects stage gain when a current source is used as an active load and affects common mode gain when the source provides the tail current of a differential pair. The last metric is the pair of minimum voltages from the common terminal, usually a power rail connection, to the input and output terminals that are required for proper operation of the circuit. These voltages affect the headroom to the power supply rails that is available for the circuitry in which the current mirror is embedded.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores {{approaches}} for scaling the output power of rare-earth ion doped fibre lasers and amplifiers, fibre {{amplified spontaneous emission}} sources, and solid state laser oscillators. Scaling output power from laser sources has been a topic of interest ever since the first laser was demonstrated. The development of new geometries and novel techniques for reducing effects that limit the maximum output power are particularly important. Three {{approaches for}} power scaling are demonstrated here. The first is an all fibre geometry for producing predominately single-ended operation. By exploiting the high available gain in rare-earth-ion doped fibres, predominately <b>single-ended</b> laser <b>output</b> can be achieved in a high loss cavity with feedback at one end considerably lower than the other. This was demonstrated with an Yb doped fibre laser using a low loss end termination scheme to produce 29 W and 2 W in the forward and backward directions, respectively, for launched pump power of 48 W. This corresponds to a slope efficiency for the forward direction of 77 %. The single-ended scheme was also applied to a Tm-doped fibre ASE system, producing a maximum output of 11 W for 43 W of launched pump, with an emission bandwidth of 36 nm centred at 1958 nm. Secondly, a Tm-doped fibre distributed feedback laser with 875 mW of single frequency utput at 1943 nm was used in a master oscillator power amplifier configuration. Using three amplifier stages, the output was scaled to 100 W of output with a final polarisation extinction ratio of > 94 % and a beam propagation factor ofM 2 < 1. 25. The last laser architecture was a cryogenically cooled Ho:YAGlaser in-band pumped by a diode pumped Tm-doped fibre laser. After determining the absorption bandwidth {{as a function of}} temperature at the desired pump wavelength of 1932 nm in Ho:YAG, the fibre laser was constructed to have an emission line-width of < 0. 2 nm to achieve efficient overlap with the absorption peak. This fibre laser was used to pump two different Ho:YAG laser configurations. The first was a free-running laser based on a simple two-mirror cavity design, which showed a factor of 1. 7 increase in the laser slope efficiency and a factor of 10 decrease in threshold pump power when the crystal temperature was reduced from 300 K to 77 K. The second cavity condition discussed was for low quantum defect operation, which was demonstrated at 1970 nm corresponding to a quantum defect of just 2 %.
