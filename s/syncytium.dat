5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external <b>syncytium</b> absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|Multinucleated cells contain {{multiple}} nuclei. Most acantharean {{species of}} protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other {{examples include the}} intestinal parasites in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes and <b>syncytium,</b> become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near {{the periphery of the}} cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to {{contract}} easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These contractile cells are connected by intercalated discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of action potential from the pacemaker cells. The intercalated discs allow the cells to act as a <b>syncytium</b> and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The pacemaker cells make up 1% of cells and form the conduction system of the heart. They are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons. Cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity, the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a fixed rate – spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart.|$|E
25|$|After {{fertilization}} of the oocyte, {{the early}} embryo (or syncytial embryo) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By {{the end of}} the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the <b>syncytium.</b> Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the <b>syncytium</b> into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, gastrulation starts.|$|E
25|$|Embryogenesis in Drosophila {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied, as its small size, short generation time, and large brood size makes it ideal for genetic studies. It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a <b>syncytium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes {{are linked}} by gap junctions, {{creating}} an electrically coupled (functional) <b>syncytium.</b> Because of this ability of astrocytes {{to communicate with}} their neighbors, changes in the activity of one astrocyte can have repercussions on the activities of others that are quite distant from the original astrocyte.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it is the}} F protein (one of many {{membrane}} fusion proteins) that, when {{triggered by}} local dehydration and a conformation change in the bound HN protein, actively inserts into the cellular membrane, which causes the envelope and the membrane to merge, followed shortly by virion entry. When the HN and F protein are manufactured by the cell and expressed on the surface, the same process may occur between adjacent cells, causing extensive membrane fusion and resulting {{in the formation of}} a <b>syncytium.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rhythmic {{electrical}} depolarization {{waves that}} trigger myocardial contraction is myogenic, {{which means that}} they begin in the heart muscle spontaneously and are then responsible for transmitting signals from cell to cell. Myocytes that were obtained in the primitive heart tube, start beating as they connect together by their walls in a <b>syncytium.</b> Myocytes initiate rhythmic electrical activity, before the fusion of the endocardial tubes. The heartbeat begins in the region of the pacemaker which has a spontaneous depolarization time faster than the rest of myocardium.|$|E
25|$|These orthoreoviruses {{were first}} {{isolated}} in 1987 from a moribund python (Python regius) {{and was found}} to cause high levels of <b>syncytium</b> formation but did not cause hemagglutination in human red blood cells (RBCs). In reptiles the virus has been found widely but is not necessarily associated with any specific disease. The virus {{has been found to}} have 2 ORFs encoding for p14, a cell fusion protein and σC. RRVs belong to the fusogenic subgroup and has only recently been classified as a distinct subgroup of orthoreoviruses.|$|E
25|$|The {{epidermis}} {{is either}} a <b>syncytium</b> or a single layer of cells, and is covered by a thick collagenous cuticle. The cuticle is often of complex structure, and may {{have two or three}} distinct layers. Underneath the epidermis lies a layer of longitudinal muscle cells. The relatively rigid cuticle works with the muscles to create a hydroskeleton as nematodes lack circumferential muscles. Projections run from the inner surface of muscle cells towards the nerve cords; this is a unique arrangement in the animal kingdom, in which nerve cells normally extend fibres into the muscles rather than vice versa.|$|E
25|$|An {{influx of}} Ca2+ ions into astrocytes is the {{essential}} change that ultimately generates calcium waves. Because this influx is directly caused {{by an increase in}} blood flow to the brain, calcium waves are said {{to be a kind of}} hemodynamic response function. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration can propagate outwards through this functional <b>syncytium.</b> Mechanisms of calcium wave propagation include diffusion of calcium ions and IP3 through gap junctions and extracellular ATP signalling. Calcium elevations are the primary known axis of activation in astrocytes, and are necessary and sufficient for some types of astrocytic glutamate release.|$|E
25|$|During {{pregnancy}} in viviparous mammals (all mammals except Monotremes), endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are activated {{and produced}} in high quantities during the implantation of the embryo. They are currently known to possess immunosuppressive properties, suggesting {{a role in}} protecting the embryo from its mother's immune system. Also, viral fusion proteins cause {{the formation of the}} placental <b>syncytium</b> to limit exchange of migratory cells between the developing embryo and the body of the mother (something an epithelium can't do sufficiently, as certain blood cells specialize to insert themselves between adjacent epithelial cells). The immunodepressive action was the initial normal behavior of the virus, similar to HIV. The fusion proteins were a way to spread the infection to other cells by simply merging them with the infected one (HIV does this too). It is believed that the ancestors of modern viviparous mammals evolved after an infection by this virus, enabling the fetus to survive the immune system of the mother.|$|E
25|$|During {{pregnancy}} in viviparous mammals, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are activated {{and produced}} in high quantities during the implantation of the embryo. On one hand, they are hypothesized {{to act as}} immunosuppressors, perhaps protecting the embryo from the immune system of the mother; {{on the other hand}} viral fusion proteins cause the formation of the placental <b>syncytium</b> in order to limit the exchange of migratory cells between the developing embryo and the body of the mother, where an epithelium will not be adequate because certain blood cells are specialized to be able to insert themselves between adjacent epithelial cells. The ERV is an endogenized form of what was once an infectious retrovirus. The immunodepressive action was important for the infection of the original virus. The fusion proteins may have been a way to spread the infection to other cells by simply merging them with the infected one. It is believed that the ancestors of modern viviparous mammals evolved after an infection of an ancestor with this virus, perhaps improving the ability of the fetus to survive the immune system of the mother.|$|E
500|$|It used to {{be claimed}} that glass sponges could live on {{nutrients}} dissolved in sea water and were very averse to silt. However a study in 2007 {{found no evidence of}} this and concluded that they extract bacteria and other micro-organisms from water very efficiently (about 79%) and process suspended sediment grains to extract such prey. Collar bodies digest food and distribute it wrapped in vesicles that are transported by dynein [...] "motor" [...] molecules along bundles of microtubules that run throughout the <b>syncytium.</b>|$|E
500|$|Some {{types of}} cells {{have a single}} nucleus and {{membrane}} each, but are connected to other single-nucleus cells and to the main <b>syncytium</b> by [...] "bridges" [...] made of cytoplasm. The sclerocytes that build spicules have multiple nuclei, and in glass sponge larvae they are connected to other tissues by cytoplasm bridges; such connections between sclerocytes have not so far been found in adults, but this may simply reflect the difficulty of investigating such small-scale features. The bridges are controlled by [...] "plugged junctions" [...] that apparently permit some substances to pass while blocking others.|$|E
500|$|Glass sponges {{present a}} {{distinctive}} variation on this basic plan. Their spicules, {{which are made}} of silica, form a scaffolding-like framework between whose rods the living tissue is suspended like a cobweb that contains most of the cell types. This tissue is a <b>syncytium</b> {{that in some ways}} behaves like many cells that share a single external membrane, and in others like a single cell with multiple nuclei. The mesohyl is absent or minimal. The syncytium's cytoplasm, the soupy fluid that fills the interiors of cells, is organized into [...] "rivers" [...] that transport nuclei, organelles ("organs" [...] within cells) and other substances. Instead of choanocytes, they have further syncytia, known as choanosyncytia, which form bell-shaped chambers where water enters via perforations. The insides of these chambers are lined with [...] "collar bodies", each consisting of a collar and flagellum but without a nucleus of its own. The motion of the flagella sucks water through passages in the [...] "cobweb" [...] and expels it via the open ends of the bell-shaped chambers.|$|E
500|$|Adult sponges lack neurons or {{any other}} kind of nervous tissue. However most species have the ability to perform {{movements}} that are coordinated all over their bodies, mainly contractions of the pinacocytes, squeezing the water channels and thus expelling excess sediment and other substances that may cause blockages. Some species can contract the osculum independently {{of the rest of the}} body. Sponges may also contract in order to reduce the area that is vulnerable to attack by predators. In cases where two sponges are fused, for example if there is a large but still unseparated bud, these contraction waves slowly become coordinated in both of the [...] "Siamese twins". The coordinating mechanism is unknown, but may involve chemicals similar to neurotransmitters. However glass sponges rapidly transmit electrical impulses through all parts of the <b>syncytium,</b> and use this to halt the motion of their flagella if the incoming water contains toxins or excessive sediment. Myocytes are thought to be responsible for closing the osculum and for transmitting signals between different parts of the body.|$|E
2500|$|... {{make the}} {{interface}} between the placenta and uterus into a <b>syncytium,</b> i.e. {{a thin layer of}} cells with a shared external membrane. This allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products, but prevents the passage of blood and other cells that would cause the mother's immune system to attack the fetus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>syncytium</b> {{of cardiac}} muscle is {{important}} because it allows rapid coordinated contraction of muscles along their entire length. Action potentials propagate along the surface of the muscle fiber from the point of synaptic contact, through intercalated discs. Although a <b>syncytium,</b> cardiac muscle differs because the cells are not long and multinucleated. Cardiac tissue is therefore described as a functional <b>syncytium,</b> as opposed to the true <b>syncytium</b> of skeletal muscle.|$|E
50|$|The cardiac <b>syncytium</b> is {{a network}} of cardiomyocytes {{connected}} to each other by intercalated discs that enable the rapid transmission of electrical impulses through the network, enabling the <b>syncytium</b> {{to act in a}} coordinated contraction of the myocardium. There is an atrial <b>syncytium</b> and a ventricular <b>syncytium</b> that are connected by cardiac connection fibres. Electrical resistance through intercalated discs is very low, thus allowing free diffusion of ions. The ease of ion movement along cardiac muscle fibers axes is such that action potentials are able to travel from one cardiac muscle cell to the next, facing only slight resistance. Each <b>syncytium</b> obeys the all or none law.|$|E
50|$|The {{body surface}} of the acanthocephala is peculiar. Externally, the skin has a thin {{tegument}} covering the epidermis, which consists of a <b>syncytium</b> with no cell walls. The <b>syncytium</b> is traversed {{by a series of}} branching tubules containing fluid and is controlled by a few wandering, amoeboid nuclei. Inside the <b>syncytium</b> is an irregular layer of circular muscle fibres, and within this again some rather scattered longitudinal fibres; there is no endothelium. In their micro-structure the muscular fibres resemble those of nematodes.|$|E
50|$|This {{type of a}} {{specification}} is {{a hybrid}} of the autonomous and conditional that occurs in insects. This method involves the action of morphogen gradients within the <b>syncytium.</b> As there are no cell boundaries in the <b>syncytium,</b> these morphogens can influence nuclei in a concentration-dependent manner.|$|E
5000|$|The panglial <b>syncytium</b> {{is a large}} {{network of}} {{interconnected}} glial cells, which are extensively linked by gap junctions. The panglial <b>syncytium</b> spreads through central nervous system where it provides metabolic and osmotic support, as well as ionic regulation of myelinated axons in white matter tracts. The three types of macroglial cells within network of panglial <b>syncytium</b> are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymocytes. Originally {{it was believed that}} there was homologous gap junction between oligodendrocytes. It was later found through untrastructural analysis that gap junctions do not directly link adjacent oligodendrocytes, rather it gap junctions with adjacent astrocytes, providing secondary pathway to nearby oligodendrocytes. With direct gap junction between myelin sheaths to surrounding astrocytes, excess potassium and osmotic water directly enters astrocyte <b>syncytium,</b> where it downstream to astrocyte endfeet at capillaries and the glia limitans.|$|E
5000|$|A coenocyte (from Greek: κοινός (koinós) = [...] "common" [...] + κύτος (kýtos) = [...] "box, i.e. cell") is a multinucleate cell {{which can}} result from {{multiple}} nuclear divisions without their accompanying cytokinesis, {{in contrast to a}} <b>syncytium,</b> which results from cellular aggregation followed by dissolution of the cell membranes inside the mass. The word <b>syncytium</b> in animal embryology is used to refer to the coenocytic blastoderm of invertebrates.|$|E
5000|$|Floating villi float {{freely in}} the intervillous space. They exhibit a bi-layered {{epithelium}} consisting of cytotrophoblasts with overlaying <b>syncytium</b> (syncytiotrophoblast).|$|E
50|$|Another (correct and well-established) use of {{the word}} <b>syncytium</b> is found in {{embryogenesis}} to refer to the coenocytic blastoderm embryos of invertebrates, such as Drosophila melanogaster.|$|E
50|$|The CCN is a {{sedentary}} endoparasitic nematode, establishing feeding {{sites in}} the roots of host plants near the vascular tissue. Like other cyst nematodes, CCN feeds from a specialized feeding site known as a <b>syncytium.</b> This feeding site is formed by the deterioration of cell walls of adjoining plant cells in response to elicitors delivered through the nematode’s stylet. This cell wall deterioration leads {{to the formation of}} a single multi-nucleated feeding cell. Through the diversion of nutrients to the <b>syncytium,</b> CCN can stunt corn plant growth and reduce yield.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, the viral {{families}} {{that can cause}} <b>syncytium</b> are enveloped because viral envelope proteins {{on the surface of}} the host cell are needed to fuse with other cells. [...] But, certain members of the Reoviridae family are notable exceptions due to a unique set of proteins known as fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins. [...] Reovirus induced <b>syncytium</b> formation is not found in humans, but is found in a number of other species and is caused by fusogenic orthoreoviruses. These fusogenic orthoreoviruses include reptilian orthoreovirus, avian orthoreovirus, Nelson Bay orthoreovirus, and baboon orthoreovirus.|$|E
50|$|Smooth {{muscle is}} an {{involuntary}} non-striated muscle. It {{is divided into}} two subgroups; the single-unit (unitary) and multiunit smooth muscle. Within single-unit cells, the whole bundle or sheet contracts as a <b>syncytium.</b>|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} stimulates the {{formation}} of a non-mitotic multinucleate <b>syncytium</b> from proliferative cytotrophoblasts during trophoblast differentiation. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. by RefSeq, Nov 2013.|$|E
50|$|Ventricular systole is the {{contraction}} of the ventricular <b>syncytium</b> of cardiac muscle {{cells of the}} left and right ventricles, following electrical stimulation. This conduction takes place via the gap junctions of the connecting intercalated discs.|$|E
5000|$|A plasmodial {{slime mold}} is {{enclosed}} {{within a single}} membrane without walls and is one large cell. This [...] "supercell" [...] (a <b>syncytium)</b> is essentially a bag of cytoplasm containing thousands of individual nuclei. See heterokaryosis.|$|E

50|$|A <b>syncytium</b> is {{the normal}} cell {{structure}} for many fungi. Most fungi of Basidiomycota {{exist as a}} dikaryon in which thread-like cells of the mycelium are partially partitioned into segments each containing two differing nuclei, called a heterokaryon.|$|E
5000|$|Membrane fusion: The {{adjacent}} cells' membranes fuse {{together and}} produce a mass called <b>syncytium,</b> in which the cytoplasm contains more than one nucleus and appears as a giant cell. These cells have a short lifespan compared to other cells.|$|E
