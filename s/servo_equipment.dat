In this paper, {{new type}} {{electro-hydraulic}} <b>servo</b> <b>equipment</b> is given for testing the working feature on pumping unit. It {{is the key}} to get the real simulation of motion and loading of pumping unit. The equipment in paper can be used to repeat all kind of the real force and motion on pumping unit. In order to get better simulation results, the algorithm for self-adaptation control with Kalman filter, which is used for error-free estimate of motion state in order to obtain high accuracy, is applied to solve powerful motion error surplus force in passive loading system. All algorithms can be used in computer. Last, the test results of pumping unit loading are given. By actual use, the results show that self-adaptation control model with Kalman filter are used for decreasing error by motion of loading system is feasible and the control model can automatically regulate coefficients of regulator...|$|E
40|$|Two airplanes, an ~ 6 ~- 3 and an F- 86 A, each {{fitted with}} <b>servo</b> <b>equipment</b> for varying in flight the lateral and {{directional}} {{stability and handling}} characteristics, have been flown by test pilots of the aircraft industry and the NACA to simulate the predicted dynamic behavior of six prototype airplanes. During these simulation programs, flight experience was obtained with lateral oscillatory characteristics representative of those predicted for each prototype and with other unusual characteristics asso-ciated with certain specific designs. In cases where unusual character-istics were predicted, or where use of auxiliary damping devices was con-templated, the company test pilots gained familiarity with the trends in lateral behavior involved {{and were able to}} define ranges of acceptable characteristics which could be used as design criteria. The methods of simulation and the types and ranges of variables considered are presented and the results of the individual programs are discussed. In addition, trends in pilot opinions of the lateral oscilla-tory characteristics are discussed in relation to current flying-qualities specifications...|$|E

The two-dimensional infrared measurement rotary table equipment can capture the target according to the guidance information, and then the <b>servo</b> tracking <b>equipment</b> can achieve precise tracking and measurement of the target through reasonable tracking means, and obtain the gray level of the surface source gray body (or {{the infrared}} image gray level) and transmit it to the data acquisition and transmission equipment.|$|R
40|$|This Report gives a {{detailed}} account of the development of a machine for reproducing aircraft motions on a flight simulator cockpit. The four freedoms of the machine are actuated by hydraulic <b>servos.</b> The <b>equipment</b> is part of the piloted flight simulator facility used for research and development studies in the Aerodynamics Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Bedford. The information presented concerns the engineering design and servo drive considerations involved. A description is given of the control and safety procedures used when operating the machine within the simulator facility. The limitations of the performance achieved are discussed both with a view to finding ways to improve the existing machine, and to point out those particular aspects of design which need careful attention and uncompromisin...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic {{hypothermia}} {{has been}} shown to reduce death and disability at 18 months of age in babies with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and improve neuro- developmental outcomes in survivors. We wanted to survey the current provision for this service across the UK to identify availability and usage of differ-ent modalities of cooling and their pros and cons. A survey ques-tionnaire was sent via e-mail to 79 clinicians based in established cooling centres participating in TOBY register in UK and Ireland in March 2012. 50 clinicians completed the survey. Most clinicians reported using it for up to 2 babies a month (72 %), some were using it for 2 – 5 babies per month (24 %) and a very small minority were using it for> 5 babies per month (4 %). This would reflect the usage in most NICUs across the UK and would be helpful for resource planning. There is a trend towards adoption of <b>servo</b> controlled cooling <b>equipment</b> with time. Up to 70 % respondents reported using non <b>servo</b> controlled <b>equipment</b> in the past but only 22 % reported using it presently. It is encouraging to see that this new treatment had already been offered in many cooling centres in UK with emerging evi-dence from large randomised international studies before the NICE guidelines recommended it as a standard of care. Almost all clinicians would prefer to use the servo-controlled method due to user friendliness for nursing staff, safety and efficacy...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the bond behavior between glulam and GFRP rods using the near-surface mounted (NSM) strengthening technique, an experimental program {{was carried out}} by means of direct pullout tests. In this experimental program three variables were analyzed: the GFRP type (2 types), the GFRP location/groove size (2 types) and the bond length (Lb= 30 mm, 60 mm, 120 mm and 180 mm). The instrumentation includes the loaded and free end slips, as well as the pullout force. Thirty seven specimens were tested under displacement control using a <b>servo</b> controlled <b>equipment.</b> In this work the tests are described, and the obtained results are presented and discussed.

50|$|When {{owned by}} GEC {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, many (if not the vast majority) of Lincoln {{engineering}} firms did not survive difficult financial conditions. This included Clayton Dewandre, (who made vacuum and air-pressure brake <b>servos</b> and associated <b>equipment</b> for commercial vehicles). W.H.Dorman had been bought by English Electric in 1961 and took over an old R & H factory on Beevor Street. Dormans would be bought by Perkins in 1993, then closed in 1995.|$|R
50|$|Servo motors sailboats are {{generally}} used {{to allow people}} with mobility problems to enjoy the freedom and independence of sailing by themselves, sailing solo, something that many don’t achieve in any other aspect of their lives. On two-person boats like the SKUD 18, the helmsperson may be a severely disabled sailor (SDS) so needs servo assisted steering, while the crew would generally control the sheets. But it is achievable {{to have a full}} servo system so that the SDS helmsperson can adjust sheets and other controls like the cunningham and outhaul as well. Access Sailing Systems <b>servo</b> assist <b>equipment</b> can easily be converted for manual use by disengaging the steering winch clutch and winding out all but a few inches of sheet and then hauling in the sheets by hand. On the SKUD 18, sheets are double ended and can be readily adjusted in either mode.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{precision}} of temperature control achieved in clinical practice during therapeutic hypothermia in neonates {{has not been}} described. METHODS: The hourly rectal temperature recordings from 17 infants treated with servo controlled and an equal number treated with manually adjusted cooling equipment were examined. The target rectal temperature for all infants is 33. 5 degrees C for 72 h. RESULTS: During 6 to 72 h after start of cooling, the mean (95 % CI, variance) of the averaged rectal temperatures was 33. 6 degrees C (95 % CI 33. 4 degrees C to 33. 8 degrees C, 0. 1 degrees C) in the manually adjusted group and 33. 4 degrees C (95 % CI 33. 3 degrees C to 33. 5 degrees C, 0. 04 degrees C) in the servo controlled group (means, p= 0. 08; equality of variance, p= 0. 03). The variance was also significantly different between infant groups during 1 to 5 h after start of cooling, p= 0. 01, but not during rewarming. CONCLUSION: The rectal temperature can be maintained close to the target temperature with either manually adjusted or <b>servo</b> controlled <b>equipment,</b> but there is less temperature variability with the servo controlled system in use in the UK...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes the {{combination}} of two data-driven techniques, namely virtual reference feedback tuning (VRFT) and model-Free Control (MFC) {{in terms of the}} VRFT of MFC algorithms dedicated to servo systems. VRFT ensures the automatic optimal computation of the parameters of three MFC algorithms represented by intelligent proportional (iP), intelligent proportional-integral (iPI), and intelligent proportional-integral-derivative (iPID) controllers. The combination of MFC and VRFT leads to a novel mixed MFC-VRFT approach. The approach is validated by experimental results related to the angular speed control of modular <b>servo</b> system laboratory <b>equipment.</b> The performance of the control systems with the MFC algorithms (iP, iPI, and iPID controllers) tuned by the mixed MFC-VRFT approach is compared with that of control systems with MFC algorithms tuned by a metaheuristics gravitational search algorithm (GSA) optimizer, and of control systems with I, PI and PID controllers optimally tuned by VRFT and GSA in the same optimization problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} {{electric}} and electronic products is increasing rapidly. To provide power supply, the Indian power sector faces {{the crisis of}} bridging {{the gap between the}} demand and supply of power. The unstable power supply so produced has led to loss in industrial equipments. To combat the problems of power fluctuations, industries depend on servo voltage stabilizers to stabilize the power supply connected to their expensive machineries. The article focuses on the electrical hazards, consequences of electrical hazards, symptoms of electrical hazards, analysis of the situation in industries, types of stabilizers, servo voltage stabilizers, applications, advantages, history of servo voltage stabilizers and market potential. With the increasing growth of the consumer electronic/electrical products, the need for servo stabilizers is rising rapidly. Even in the future years the servo voltage stabilizers will continue to be an essential product used in industries.

40|$|This study {{represents}} Genetic Algorithm optimization of PID parameters gain {{in model}} reference robust control system structure for desired position of incremental servomotor. Experiments had been took out via Lab-Volt 8063 Digital <b>Servo</b> system <b>equipment</b> at <b>Servo</b> Control Laboratory. The key issue for PID controllers is the accurate and efficient tuning of parameters. The plant repeatedly {{has a problem}} in achieving the desire position control and system performance have an oscillatory response and gives a slightly steady state error. This problem among other is affected by existing the nonlinearities component in the system, the system communication noise, and not optimize PID parameter. The existing PID controller tuning {{with the help of}} the offline Genetic Algorithms approach comprises of automatically obtaining the best possible outcome for the three parameters gain (Kp, Ki, Kd) for improving the steady state characteristics and performance indices. Their step responses are then compared with a tuned conventional Ziegler-Nichols based PID controller. This paper explores the well established methodologies of the literature to realize the workability and applicability of Genetic Algorithms for process control applications. At last, a comparative study done between ZN-PID experiment and GA-PID experiment shows that the GA optimal controller is highly effective and outperforms the PID controller in achieving an enhancing the output transient response with improvement percentage of rise time is 91. 83 %, settling time is 89. 36 % and maximum overshoot is 82. 24 %. The robust and automatic gains parameter calculator; GA based PID technique also proven to be time savers as they are much faster to be conducted than ZN method which is basically based on trial-and-error in getting the best PID values before the system can be narrowed down in getting the closest to the optimized value...|$|R
5000|$|Numerous {{nonferrous}} alloys, cast irons, powder-metallurgy and plastics {{are used}} in the manufacture of gears. However, steels are most commonly used because of their high strength-to-weight ratio and low cost. Plastic is commonly used where cost or weight is a concern. A properly designed plastic gear can replace steel in many cases because it has many desirable properties, including dirt tolerance, low speed meshing, the ability to [...] "skip" [...] quite well and the ability to be made with materials that don't need additional lubrication. Manufacturers have used plastic gears to reduce costs in consumer items including copy machines, optical storage devices, cheap dynamos, consumer audio <b>equipment,</b> <b>servo</b> motors, and printers.Another advantage of the use of plastics, formerly (such as in the 1980s), was the reduction of repair costs for certain expensive machines. In cases of severe jamming (as of the paper in a printer), the plastic gear teeth would be torn free of their substrate, allowing the drive mechanism to then spin freely (instead of damaging itself by straining against the jam). This use of [...] "sacrificial" [...] gear teeth avoided destroying the much more expensive motor and related parts. This method has been superseded, in more recent designs, by the use of clutches and torque- or current-limited motors.|$|R
