[...] An additional function of the PSU is to support the coordination of special events that take place in, and around the Pentagon Reservation. The PSU serves as the single point of contact for PPD on all ceremonies in honor of visiting dignitaries hosted by the Office of Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Various protocol offices such as the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Office of Defense Foreign Affairs utilize PSU officers to assist their organization and ensure their events operate as smoothly as possible.|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, the Pickering–Mullen Accountability Review Board {{report on}} the Benghazi matter was released. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It explicitly criticized the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs: [...] "Systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department ... resulted in a special mission <b>security</b> <b>posture</b> that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate {{to deal with the}} attack that took place." [...] Four State Department officials were removed from their posts as a consequence, including Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric J. Boswell (who resigned completely), a deputy assistant secretary for embassy security, Charlene R. Lamb, and a deputy assistant secretary for North Africa, Raymond Maxwell. The report did not criticize more senior officials in the department; Pickering said: [...] "We fixed it at the assistant secretary level, which is, in our view, the appropriate place to look, where the decision-making in fact takes place, where, if you like, the rubber hits the road." [...] Clinton said in a letter to Congress that she accepted the conclusions of the Pickering–Mullen report, and a State Department task force was formed to implement some sixty action items recommended by the report. On December 20, the Deputy Secretary of State, William J. Burns, and the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, Thomas R. Nides, testified in her place before two Congressional committees, and said that many of the report's recommendations would be in place before year-end. Clinton planned to testify herself in January.|$|E

40|$|The {{attack surface}} concept {{provides}} a means of discussing the susceptibility of software to as-yet-unknown attacks. A system’s attack surface encompasses the methods the system makes available to an attacker, and the system resources {{which can be used}} to further an attack. A measurement {{of the size of the}} attack surface could be used to compare the security of multiple systems which perform the same function. The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) has been in existence for over a decade. Relative to HTTP or SMTP, IMAP is a niche protocol, but IMAP servers are widely deployed nonetheless. There are three popular open source UNIX IMAP servers – UW-IMAP, Cyrus, and Courier-IMAP – and there has not been a formal security comparison between them. In this paper, I use attack surfaces to compare the relative security risks posed by these three products. I undertake this evaluation in service of two complementary goals: to provide an honest examination of the <b>security</b> <b>postures</b> and risks of the three servers, and to advance the study of attack surfaces by performing an automated attack surface measurement using a methodology based on counting entry and exit points in the code...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Firewalls are devices or {{programs}} {{that control the}} flow of network traffic between hosts or networks that employ differing <b>security</b> <b>postures.</b> While firewalls are often discussed {{in the context of}} Internet connectivity, they may also have applicability in various other network environments. At one time, most firewalls were deployed at the network perimeters. This provided some measure of protection for internal hosts, but it could not recognize all instances and forms of attacks, and attacks sent from one internal host to another often do not pass through network firewalls. Because of these and other factors network designers now often include firewall functionality at places other than the network perimeter to provide an additional layer of network security. Due to the increasing threat of network attacks, firewalls have become important integrated elements not only in the enterprise networks but also in small-size and home networks. Firewalls have been the frontier defense for secure networks against attacks and unauthorized traffic by filtering out unnecessary network traffic coming into or going from the secured network. In this paper, we represent an effective policy anomaly management framework for firewalls, adopting a rule-based segmentation technique to identify policy anomalies and derive effective anomaly resolutions...|$|R

40|$|Many {{critical}} infrastructure sectors have been investigating cyber security issues {{for several years}} especially {{with the help of}} two primary government programs. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National SCADA Test Bed and the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Control Systems Security Program have both implemented activities aimed at securing the industrial control systems that operate the North American electric grid along with several other {{critical infrastructure}} sectors (ICS). These programs have spent the last seven years working with industry including asset owners, educational institutions, standards and regulating bodies, and control system vendors. The programs common mission is to provide outreach, identification of cyber vulnerabilities to ICS and mitigation strategies to enhance <b>security</b> <b>postures.</b> The success of these programs indicates that a similar approach can be successfully translated into other sectors including nuclear operations, safeguards, and security. The industry regulating bodies have included cyber security requirements and in some cases, have incorporated sets of standards with penalties for non-compliance such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection standards. These DOE and DHS programs that address security improvements by both suppliers and end users provide an excellent model for nuclear facility personnel concerned with safeguards and security cyber vulnerabilities and countermeasures. It is not a stretch to imagine complete surreptitious collapse of protection against the removal of nuclear material or even initiation of a criticality event as witnessed at Three Mile Island or Chernobyl in a nuclear ICS inadequately protected against the cyber threat...|$|R
40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT REQUEST OF AUTHOR. ] In recent years, most {{scientific}} research in both academia and industry {{has become increasingly}} data-driven. According to market estimates, spending related to supporting scientific data-intensive research {{is expected to increase}} to $ 5. 8 billion by 2018. Particularly for data-intensive scientific fields such as bioscience, or particle physics within academic environments, data storage/processing facilities, expert collaborators and specialized computing resources do not always reside within campus boundaries. With the growing trend of large collaborative partnerships involving researchers, expensive scientific instruments and high performance computing centers, experiments and simulations produce peta-bytes of data viz., Big Data, that is likely to be shared and analyzed by scientists in multi-disciplinary areas. Federated multi-cloud resource allocation for data-intensive application workflows is generally performed based on performance or quality of service (i. e., QSpecs) considerations. At the same time, end-to-end security requirements of these workflows across multiple domains are considered as an afterthought due to lack of standardized formalization methods. Consequently, diverse/heterogenous domain resource and security policies cause inter-conflicts between application's security and performance requirements that lead to sub-optimal resource allocations, especially when multiple such applications contend for limited resources. In this thesis, a joint performance and security-driven federated resource allocation scheme for data-intensive scientific applications is presented. In order to aid joint resource brokering among multi-cloud domains with diverse/heterogenous <b>security</b> <b>postures,</b> the definition and characterization of a data-intensive application's security specifications (i. e., SSpecs) is required. Next, an alignment technique inspired by Portunes Algebra to homogenize the various domain resource policies (i. e., RSpecs) along an application's workflow lifecycle stages is presented. Using such formalization and alignment, a near optimal cost-aware joint QSpecs-SSpecs-driven, RSpecs-compliant resource allocation algorithm for multi-cloud computing resource domain/location selection as well as network path selection, is proposed. We implement our security formalization, alignment, and allocation scheme as a framework, viz., "OnTimeURB" and validate it in a multi-cloud environment with exemplar data-intensive application workflows involving distributed computing and remote instrumentation use cases with different performance and security requirements...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 ’s, intense and {{vigorous}} debate surrounded {{the impact of}} minority communities on Australia’s mainstream society. The rise of far-right populism took the stage with {{the introduction to the}} political landscape of Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party, whilst John Howard’s Liberal-National Coalition Government took the fore on debate over immigration issues corresponding with an influx of irregular arrivals. In 2001, following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States of America and subsequent attacks on western targets globally, many of these issues continued to be debated through the <b>security</b> <b>posturing</b> that followed. In recent years, much effort has been afforded to countering the threat of terrorism from home grown assailants. The Government has introduced stringent legislative responses whilst researchers have studied social movements and trends within Australian communities, particularly with respect to minorities. In 2008, the Scanlon Foundation, in association with Monash University and various government entities, released its findings into its survey approach to mapping social cohesion in Australia. It identified a number of spheres of exploration which it believed were essential to measuring cohesiveness of Australian communities generally including, economic, political and socio-cultural factors (Markus and Dharmalingam, 2008). This doctoral project report will explore the political sphere as identified in the Mapping Social Cohesion project and apply it to identified minority ethnic communities. The Scanlon Foundation project identified political participation as {{one of a number of}} true indicators of social cohesion. This project acknowledges that democracy in Australia is represented predominantly by two political entities representing a vast majority of constituents under a compulsory voting regime. This essay will identify the levels of political activism achieved by minority ethnic communities and access to democratic participation within the Australian political structure. It will define a ten year period from 1999 to 2009, identifying trends and issues within minority communities that have proactively and reactively promoted engagement in achieving a political voice, framed within a mainstream-dominated political system. It will research social movements and other influential factors over that period to enrich existing knowledge in relation to political participation rates across Australian communities...|$|R

40|$|Mass-market mobile {{security}} threats have increased recently {{due to the}} growth of mobile technologies and the popularity of mobile devices. Accordingly, techniques have been introduced for identifying, classifying, and defending against mobile threats utilizing static, dynamic, on-device, off-device, and hybrid approaches. In this paper, we contribute to the mobile <b>security</b> defense <b>posture</b> by introducing Andro-profiler, a hybrid behavior based analysis and classification system for mobile malware. Andro-profiler classifies malware by exploiting the behavior profiling extracted from the integrated system logs including system calls, which are implicitly equivalent to distinct behavior characteristics. Andro-profiler executes a malicious application on an emulator in order to generate the integrated system logs, and creates human-readable behavior profiles by analyzing the integrated system logs. By comparing the behavior profile of malicious application with representative behavior profile for each malware family, Andro-profiler detects and classifies it into malware families. The experiment results demonstrate that Andro-profiler is scalable, performs well in detecting and classifying malware with accuracy greater than 98 %, outperforms the existing state-of-the-art work, and is capable of identifying zero-day mobile malware samples.
