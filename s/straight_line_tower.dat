50|$|Each {{structure}} must {{be designed}} for the loads imposed on it by the conductors. The weight of the conductor must be supported, as well as dynamic loads due to wind and ice accumulation, and effects of vibration. Where conductors are in a <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> <b>towers</b> need only resist the weight since {{the tension in the}} conductors approximately balances with no resultant force on the structure. Flexible conductors supported at their ends approximate the form of a catenary, and much of the analysis for construction of transmission lines relies on the properties of this form.|$|R

Dynamic {{analysis}} {{models of}} two adjacent transmission towers, two adjacent corner towers and the correspond single-tower are established, its dynamic characteristics are analyzed and compared. The results showed that: Dynamic characteristics of two adjacent transmission towers are close, but the towers {{connected with the}} corner tower changes much. Compared with the single-tower, its dynamic characteristics have changed regardless of corner <b>tower</b> or <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> transmission <b>towers.</b> It is also shown that suspended cables not only have mass effects, but have coupled stiffness effects applied to towers on transverse direction and longitudinal direction.
