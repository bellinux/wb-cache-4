The Quarrymen booked a recording session on 12 July 1958. They recorded straight to disc, as tape {{would have been an}} extra expense. The sound was recorded live by a single microphone in the centre of the room, and Lennon suggested that Hanton put a scarf over the snare drum to lower the volume. They first recorded Buddy Holly's [...] "That'll Be the Day", followed by a McCartney original (credited as McCartney/Harrison). Both featured Lennon on lead vocals. When the recording was finished, Phillips handed the group a fragile 78rpm record, which was passed around the band for one week each, or lent out to friends. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. The recordings would later be issued on the Beatles' rarities album Anthology 1.|$|E

After the acquisition, TuneCore and Believe used their newly increased leverage in negotiations with digital services including Spotify and Tidal to improve their services for their artists. Also in 2015, TuneCore expanded its presence in the UK and Australia announcing dedicated websites including localized currency and content for each region. It also introduced its YouTube <b>Sound</b> <b>Recording</b> <b>service</b> to collect revenue for artists when their sound recordings are used anywhere on YouTube. In September 2015, Tunecore stepped up its live event offerings, throwing LA's independent music community its first ever Indie Artist Forum, which focused on educating and fostering collaboration amongst aspiring professional musicians while engaging on a dialog around {{the ins and outs of}} the current landscape of the independent music business.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter of 2015, TuneCore saw {{sustained}} growth, with independent artists earning over $142 million through TuneCore including $36.8 million from digital streams and downloads. During this time, TuneCore also expanded its presence in the United States, opening offices in Austin and Atlanta, and internationally, launching two new international sites in Australia and the UK featuring localized currencies and experiences. TuneCore also added Saavn, Nmusic and Zvooq—services targeting emerging markets—as partners through which artists could distribute and monetize their music. TuneCore also enjoyed notable growth in new customers in the Latin American market and the African market. TuneCore’s YouTube <b>Sound</b> <b>Recording</b> Collection <b>Service</b> was also a key driver for increasing 2015 yearly revenue. In May 2016, TuneCore acquired artist social media management startup JustGo and re-branded it as TuneCore Social. Later in the year, it expanded its presence and launched its services in France.|$|R
