5|$|The Phantom entered {{service with}} both the Fleet Air Arm and the RAF in 1969. In the Royal Navy it had a <b>secondary</b> <b>strike</b> role in {{addition}} to its primary use for fleet air defence, while in the RAF it was soon replaced in the strike role by other aircraft designed specifically for strike and close air support. By the mid-1970s it had become the UK's principal interceptor, a role in which it continued until the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} was re-raised in 1948 as the RAAF's bomber operational conversion unit. It has primarily {{served in}} this capacity since that time, {{though it has}} also maintained a <b>secondary</b> <b>strike</b> capability and was also tasked with reconnaissance duties between 1979 and 1993. No.6 Squadron is currently based at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and has been most recently equipped with Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft between January 2011 and December 2016. The squadron was re-equipped with Boeing EA-18G Growlers in 2017.|$|E
5|$|No.6 Squadron's first F-111Cs {{arrived at}} Amberley on 1 June 1973, and the unit flew its first sorties with the {{aircraft}} on the 13th of the month. The squadron's main role remained {{that of an}} operational conversion unit, though it had a <b>secondary</b> <b>strike</b> role. From August 1979, No.6 Squadron gained a photo reconnaissance role when it was issued with four aircraft which had been modified into RF-111Cs. These four aircraft were concentrated the squadron's Reconnaissance Flight, which included photo analysts as well as specialised aircrew. Training was conducted in Australia and nearby countries, and the RF-111Cs occasionally deployed to the United States {{to take part in}} exercises held there. In June 1982 No.6 Squadron was expanded to include a Survey Flight, which undertook photo survey flights in co-operation with the Army's Royal Australian Survey Corps using a leased Learjet. The flight conducted surveys of south-eastern Australia, northern Australia, Fiji and parts of Indonesia and Malaysia until it was disbanded on 15 May 1987.|$|E

25|$|So why hadn't {{employers}} been {{violating the}} Wagner Act all along? Well, at first, in the 1930s and 1940s, they tried, {{and they got}} riots in the streets: mass picketing, <b>secondary</b> <b>strikes,</b> etc. But after Taft-Hartley, unions couldn't retaliate like this, or they would end up with penalty fines and jail sentences.|$|R
50|$|Industrial action, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} collective action, generally refers to employees acting together {{to force the}} hand of the employer, but employers, too, for the purposes of industrial action, employers may act individually or collectively with other employers to lock out employees. Industrial action for employees can take the form of <b>strikes,</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>strikes,</b> pickets and protest action, while employers have recourse to lock-outs.|$|R
500|$|In 1964, 140 new-build Phantoms {{were ordered}} for the Fleet Air Arm {{to serve as}} the Royal Navy's primary fleet air defence aircraft, with a <b>secondary</b> <b>strike</b> capability. These were {{procured}} to replace the Sea Vixen then in service in the role, with the intention that they operate from the decks of four brand new or modernised aircraft carriers. At the time, the Royal Navy's carrier force consisted of five fleet or light fleet carriers of differing sizes and ages. Of the five in service, only [...] and , each displacing approximately 50,000 tons, were big enough to accommodate the Phantom in sufficient numbers, so plans were put in place to rebuild the two ships to enable the operation of the aircraft. However, for political reasons, the refitting of Eagle was cancelled so 892 Sqn was the only operational one formed, and operated these Phantom F4K's from March 1969 to December 1978, from HMS Ark Royal only.|$|E
2500|$|Navy {{officials}} {{expressed concern}} that the original requirements of the UCLASS program had been degraded, as the original concept called for a stealthy, carrier-based, long-range unmanned combat aerial system (UCAS) with a large payload that could be refueled in-flight, but the altered version called for a UCAS that was modestly stealthy and emphasised intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions over lightly contested airspace, with a light <b>secondary</b> <b>strike</b> mission and no air refueling requirement, promoting affordability over survivability and endurance; the revised requirements were written to fill a gap in persistent, sea-based ISR. [...] Stealth requirements were sharply reduced to lower costs, and original payload requirements calling for weapons bays to carry as many as 24 GBU-39 SDB 250 lb bombs, totaling a 6,000 lb of weapons, were reduced for a total payload of [...] and only [...] of weapons. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) modified requirements during an 18 December 2012 meeting and did not consider them to be [...] "relaxed," [...] but rather changed to consider [...] "within the broader unmanned aircraft portfolio and included an assessment of the platform's performance, capability, survivability, and basing," [...] shifting to increase some performance areas and decrease others to get a mix. JROC was reported to have changed the requirements in order to produce a replacement for the current drones used for Disposition Matrix missions that would not require host nation basing or permission, changing focus from a UAV capable of striking defended targets to keep costs down and maintain unmanned counterterrorism missions as a U.S. military option. [...] Flying missions from sea-based carriers would have fewer restrictions than operating inside foreign countries, and irregular warfare missions will continue in the future to warrant further attention.|$|E
2500|$|The labor {{peace was}} short-lived. Four unions {{refused to do}} work on the Post Office {{conveyor}} belt system in mid-November, and the dispute over elevators spread to the Labor/ICC building in February 1934 (delaying the building's opening indefinitely). On February 14, 1934, 225 carpenters engaged in a jurisdictional strike against the cement finishers' union at the Labor/ICC building over the installation of tile flooring. The dispute was elevated to AFL President William Green, Green awarded the job to the cement finishers on March 17. But just three weeks later, the plasterers' union led a jurisdictional strike against the stonecutters' union at the Labor/ICC building because the stonecutters were installing acoustical marble columns. Contractors, angry at the repeated inter-union squabbles, announced they would no longer employ reduced-hour shifts or give pay raises. The carpenters' union called for a general strike of all unions at the Labor/ICC building on May 25, a strike which spread to the city's ice cream plants. That <b>secondary</b> <b>strike</b> ended June 4. But the general construction strike began to spread to other federal projects throughout the city, leading to {{an increasing number of}} calls for the strike to be settled by arbitration. As the work stoppage spread, the carpenters' union's contract with the construction companies expired on May 30. The employers declared on June 12 that they would no longer adhere to any closed shop agreements with the carpenters, and instead would impose the open shop and employ any carpenter (union or non-union) in order to finish the work on existing construction projects. The construction unions declared they would pull every worker off every job if non-union construction laborers were hired, and the D.C Metropolitan Police Department made preparations to patrol streets and job sites to prevent any violence from erupting. Non-union workers were hired, and the carpenters' union struck all job sites throughout the city amidst fears that the carpenters might strike all federal construction projects nationwide. Three union members were injured on June 13 as picketers clashed with security guards hired by the employers. But the strike did not spread to the other unions, and the Washington Building and Construction Trades Council and D.C. Commissioner George E. Allen attempted to mediate an end to the strike. The carpenters rejected the arbitration attempt, and bands of roving picketers moving among construction sites led to traffic tie-ups, frightened citizens, and rumors of violence. The [...] "open shop strike" [...] ended on June 20, 1934, when the carpenters agreed to a new contract providing for a five-day, 40-hour work week and $1.25 an hour in pay. But no agreement was made regarding the open shop. The plasterers' union ended their strike in June 1934, and went to local district court to resolve the jurisdictional dispute.|$|E

5000|$|May 13, 1947: Taft-Harley Labour Act passed. [...] The Act {{was created}} by Robert Taft and Fred Hartley. The Taft-Hartley Act was enabled to replace the Wagner Act of 1935.

50|$|The CPNZ {{also lost}} its {{influence}} in the country's trade unions during the late 1920s and early 1930s owing to its rigid support for unpopular <b>secondary</b> <b>strikes</b> in solidarity with workers in other countries. This was epitomized by a 1929 call for a miners' strike in sympathy with mine and timber workers in Australia, which annihilated party influence among the miners of the South Island's West Coast and 1931 efforts to blackball a Japanese ship, which led to discord and alienation from the party in the Seamen's Union.|$|R

50|$|Kh-20 was {{initially}} intended for retaliation strikes against major {{targets in the}} United States. However, arming a Tu-95 with Kh-20 took 22 hours and the first-generation nuclear warheads were difficult to store which made them unsuitable for first-response weapons. Therefore, Kh-20 was relegated to <b>secondary</b> <b>strikes</b> against targets surviving the initial attack and against aircraft carrier groups. Arming time was eventually reduced to 4 hours and reliability was improved. The weakest link of the Kh-20 remained its guidance system and good accuracy required manual guidance which was vulnerable to jamming.|$|R

50|$|An {{individual}} employee cannot {{engage in}} a strike. More than one person must be involved {{in order for the}} action to constitute a strike. The action must be carried out by people acting together who are or have been employed by the same employer or by different employers (as {{in the case of an}} industry-wide strike). The action is thus directed at the employer or employers. If, for example, employees refuse to work because they have a demand against a union, that will not amount to strike action.

50|$|Unionized {{workers are}} {{sometimes}} required {{to cross the}} picket lines established by other unions due to their organizations having signed contracts which include no-strike clauses.

The international leadership of the IWW decisively refused to sign the pledge, which meant that all subsidiary unions, including the MMWIU (then the largest industrial union in the IWW) would face the serious threat of raiding from AFL and CIO unions. However, other unions, such as UE and Mine-Mill (the latter a former IWW affiliate), whose leadership did sign the pledge, would face raiding after their expulsion from the CIO, making the pledge questionable insurance at best.|$|R
