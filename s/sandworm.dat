5|$|A Beetlejuice themed fun {{pack for}} the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions was {{released}} on September 12, 2017. The pack includes a Beetlejuice minifigure and constructable Saturn's <b>Sandworm,</b> and adds a Beetlejuice-themed open-world area and battle arena to the game. Beetlejuice also features prominently in an episode of Teen Titans Go! included {{as part of the}} game.|$|E
25|$|Getting rid of Sandworms is possible, but tricky. First, {{they can}} only be fought from rocks. The <b>Sandworm</b> lures the attacking units into a great desert, and then turns against them, so chasing them down is futile. Apart from that, Sandworms are {{extremely}} resilient for most types of weapons, and immune to Deviator and spice mounds. It requires a combined fire of several heavy vehicles to make a <b>Sandworm</b> go away. Units and base defensive turrets will automatically fire at the <b>Sandworm</b> when it moves within range (except the Atreides in the early version of Dune II). Eventually, after the <b>Sandworm</b> has eaten enough vehicles, or its energy is drained to yellow, it will disappear and never emerge again. The radar marks them as a pulsating white dot.|$|E
25|$|A <b>sandworm</b> is {{a fictional}} {{creature}} {{that appears in}} the Dune novels written by Frank Herbert.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sandworms</b> {{make up a}} {{large part}} of the live sea-bait industry. To fulfill the needs of this industry, some <b>sandworms</b> are commercially grown. [...] "Sandworming", or the {{harvesting}} of <b>sandworms</b> from mudflats, employs over 1,000 people in Maine. , the population of <b>sandworms</b> had diminished greatly over the preceding few years due in large part to overharvesting before the worms are able to reproduce by spawning.|$|R
25|$|While <b>sandworms</b> {{are capable}} of eating humans, the latter do contain a level of water beyond the {{preferred}} tolerances of the worms. They routinely devour melange-harvesting equipment — mistaking the mechanical rhythm for prey — but they only seem to derive actual nutrition from sand plankton and smaller <b>sandworms.</b> <b>Sandworms</b> will not attack sandtrout.|$|R
5000|$|To {{escape the}} notice of the <b>sandworms,</b> a {{traveller}} in the desert must learn to [...] "walk without rhythm", because <b>sandworms</b> mistake rhythmic vibrations in the sand for prey (ie smaller <b>sandworms).</b> This element comes from Frank Herbert's experiences as a hunter and fisherman. He knew how to mask his presence from prey by techniques such as approaching from downwind and treading lightly.|$|R
25|$|Gradually {{over the}} next 3,500 years, Leto not only survives, but also is {{transformed}} into a hybrid of human and giant <b>sandworm.</b> By the time of God Emperor of Dune, he has exterminated all other sandworms, and his own transformation has modified his component sandtrout. When Leto allows himself to be assassinated, the sandtrout release themselves to begin the <b>sandworm</b> lifecycle anew; subsequent offspring are tougher and more adaptable than their predecessors, allowing them to ultimately be more easily settled on other worlds, thus ensuring the survival of the <b>sandworm</b> species. Each one, according to Leto, carries in it a tiny pearl of his consciousness, trapped forever in an unending prescient dream.|$|E
25|$|Most {{characters}} {{accept the}} sandworms as an inevitable {{aspect of life}} on Arrakis because melange is a byproduct of their life cycle. In the plot Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, sandworms provide the danger and mystery of terra incognita, and the transformational experience that the protagonist Paul Atreides must go through to triumph over his enemies. Herbert believed great power and knowledge must come at some sort of price, and so Paul must risk being devoured by a <b>sandworm</b> and then madness after consuming <b>sandworm</b> extract (the Water of Life).|$|E
25|$|The Guild {{forces in}} the game can also deploy a unit called the Maker, an {{infantry}} unit somewhat resembling both a Navigator and a small <b>sandworm,</b> armed with an electrical weapon.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in <b>Sandworms</b> of Dune, some <b>sandworms</b> are {{revealed}} to be alive and well, having sensed the upper crust would be destroyed, and therefore burrowed even deeper, escaping the blast.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sandworms</b> are colossal {{worm-like}} {{creatures that}} {{live on the}} hot desert planet Arrakis. Arrakis is the only known source in the Universe of the spice melange, a drug highly prized for its medicinal and psychotropic properties. Melange deposits {{are found in the}} sand seas of Arrakis, where the <b>sandworms</b> live and hunt. <b>Sandworms</b> will attack anyone who attempts to extract melange from the sand, and some are large enough to swallow harvesting vehicles whole. Most people accept <b>sandworms</b> as an inevitable hazard of melange harvesting, because they are nigh-indestructible and melange is in fact a byproduct of their life cycle. The natives of Arrakis (the Fremen) regard them as sacred.|$|R
25|$|The Encyclopedia also {{explains}} {{that one of}} the few forms to survive were tiny worms of the phylum Protochordata. One of these forms was Shaihuludata, a genus of anaerobic burrowing worm that was the basal species from which the giant sandworms (Geonemotodium arraknis or Shaihuludata gigantica) evolved. Rather than <b>sandworm</b> creating desert, it was desert that created <b>sandworm.</b> The mass extinction of all of its predators and competitors for food allowed the animal, in a manner somewhat analogous to the evolution of unique faunal forms on isolated Terran islands, to take the evolutionary path that would not only re-oxygenate the Arrakeen atmosphere, but also create the spice melange with all of its immense consequences for humanity.|$|E
25|$|During {{the rush}} for spice to aid with the {{retrovirus}} epidemic, many prospectors come to Arrakis. The novel follows {{the struggle between}} Ishmael, who wishes to follow strict Zensunni tradition, and his stepson El’hiim, who wants {{to profit from the}} off-worlders. Unable to sway El’hiim, Ishmael challenges him to a <b>sandworm</b> duel and loses. Though defeated, many of the Zensunnis choose to leave the community and follow Ishmael as Free Men of Arrakis.|$|E
25|$|The Fremen {{manage to}} develop a unique {{relationship}} with the sandworms. They learn to avoid most worm attacks by mimicking the motions of desert animals and moving with the natural sounds of the desert, rather than the rhythmic vibration patterns that attract worms. However, they also develop a device known as a thumper with {{the express purpose of}} generating a rhythmic vibration to attract a <b>sandworm</b> (see worm charming). This can be used either as a diversion, or to summon a worm for the Fremen to ride.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>sandworms</b> in Dune were {{inspired}} by the dragons of European mythology that guard some sort of treasure. Favorites of Herbert included the dragon in Beowulf which guarded a hoard of gold, and the dragon which guarded the Golden Fleece from Jason. Like these dragons, the <b>sandworms</b> of Arrakis [...] "guard" [...] the melange deposits and are a perpetual hazard for {{those who wish to}} harvest this treasure. In the novels, the <b>sandworms</b> are occasionally referred to as [...] "dragons of the desert".|$|R
2500|$|Herbert {{notes in}} Dune that {{microscopic}} creatures called sand plankton feed upon traces of melange scattered by <b>sandworms</b> on the Arrakeen sands. The sand plankton are {{food for the}} giant <b>sandworms,</b> but also grow and burrow to become what the Fremen call Little Makers, [...] "the half-plant-half-animal deep-sand vector of the Arrakis sandworm".|$|R

25|$|In Heretics of Dune, the Honored Matres destroy Arrakis and the Tleilaxu, {{in part to}} {{eliminate}} spice production and thus irrevocably damage the Old Empire. However, they are thwarted by the Bene Gesserit, who escape with a single <b>sandworm.</b> Mimicking the devolvement of the God Emperor Leto II, they submerge the worm in spice-rich water, causing it to fission into its component sandtrout. The Bene Gesserit soon use the sandtrout to terraform their own planet Chapterhouse into another Dune, and send countless others out into space to colonize other planets.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Children of Dune, Alia Atreides (and then Leto II and Ghanima) realize that the {{ecological}} transformation of Arrakis is altering the <b>sandworm</b> cycle, which would eventually result {{in the end of}} all spice production. This at first seems a future to be avoided, but Leto II later uses this eventuality as part of his Golden Path to ultimately save humanity. Once he himself begins the transformation into a human/sandworm hybrid, he eradicates all desert on Arrakis except for a small area he makes his base of operations, and destroys all of the sandworms save one—himself.|$|E
25|$|Odrade then confronts Sheeana, {{discovering}} that Duncan and Sheeana have been allied together for some time. Sheeana does not reveal {{that they have}} been considering the option of reawakening Teg's memory through Imprinting, nor does Odrade discover that Sheeana has the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Odrade continues molding Scytale, with Sheeana showing him a baby <b>sandworm,</b> the Bene Gesserit's own long term supply of spice, and destroying Scytale's main bargaining card. Finally, Teg is awakened by Sheeana using imprinting techniques. Odrade appoints him again as Bashar of the military forces of the Sisterhood for the assault on the Honored Matres.|$|E
5000|$|Desert Of Despair: A vast sea of {{sand and}} death riddled with {{quicksand}} and hungry <b>sandworms,</b> and the caverns that reside underneath. With the grueling heat and deadly foes, this desert will test any hero's survival skills to their limit. Facing locusts, scorpion rats, <b>sandworms,</b> living statues and reanimated skeletons, the only thing not in short supply... is danger.|$|R

25|$|Over {{the next}} 1500 years, Arrakis (now called Rakis) is {{returned}} to a desert by the thriving <b>sandworm</b> cycle. Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Taraza becomes aware in Heretics of Dune that humanity is being limited by the prescient dream of Leto, and controlled by him through his worm remnants. She engineers the destruction of Rakis by the Honored Matres to free humanity, leaving one remaining worm to start the cycle anew. Taraza is killed; her successor Darwi Odrade takes the worm to Chapterhouse. She submerges it in a spice bath to generate sandtrout, {{with the goal of}} populating Chapterhouse, and later other planets, with new worms and infinite potential for gathering spice.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the value}} of melange, {{attempts}} have been made to transplant production onto other planets. However, placing either adult sandworms (often smuggled with funds going to the Fremen) or sandtrout into existing deserts always met with failure. The large salt flats of Arrakis indicate that it was not always a desert, but once had oceans. As spice production relies on the existence of a complete <b>sandworm</b> cycle, transplanting adult worms prevents the spice cycle from beginning anew with sandtrout, and transplanting sandtrout alone into existing desert denies them the necessary water to begin the cycle. Thus, placing sandtrout on a water-rich planet would allow them to start the complete spice cycle, at the cost of turning the planet into a desert, another Dune.|$|E
25|$|On the no-ship, {{an attempt}} by rebel Bene Gesserits to murder the Leto II ghola is foiled by the child himself, {{seemingly}} able to change into a <b>sandworm</b> at will. The Paul ghola wants to remember his past; {{with the help of}} the Chani ghola, he steals and consumes an overdose of spice. This fails to awaken his past memories, but instead he has a vision in which he has been stabbed by another, evil Paul Atreides. After being discovered by the Bene Gesserit, he concludes that it is prescience. Sheanna’s own visions bring a warning from the legendary Reverend Mother Ramallo of Arrakis about the use of the gholas. She stops the ghola program from continuing until she can make sense of it all.|$|E

2500|$|Wensicia's plot {{to assassinate}} the Atreides heirs fails, but {{provides}} Leto {{an opportunity to}} fake his own death and buy time to overcome Alia. Alia's madness reaches its peak as Baron Harkonnen's grip on her consciousness strengthens and a civil war brews with the rebel Fremen. Leto returns from the deep desert, having used sandtrout [...] the larval form of Arrakis' <b>sandworms</b> [...] to acquire the superhuman speed, strength, and invulnerability of the <b>sandworms</b> themselves.|$|R

500|$|While away seeing Juno Delia {{discovers the}} {{handbook}} and reads it. Although Adam and Barbara remain invisible to Charles and Delia, Lydia {{can see the}} ghost couple and befriends them. Against Juno's advice, the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse, Juno's former assistant and now freelance [...] "bio-exorcist" [...] ghost, to scare away the Deetzes. At first, they are unaware that [...] "Betelgeuse" [...] is pronounced [...] "Beetlejuice", {{which is why they}} have such difficulty pronouncing his name and thereby summoning him. However, Betelgeuse quickly offends the Maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor; and they reconsider hiring him, though too late to stop him from wreaking havoc on the Deetzes. The small town's charm and the supernatural events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot, but Maxie wants proof of the ghosts. Using the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, Otho conducts what he thinks is a séance and summons Adam and Barbara, but they begin to decay and die, as Otho had unwittingly performed an exorcism instead. Horrified, Lydia begrudgingly summons Betelgeuse for help; but he agrees to help her only on the condition that she marry him, enabling him to freely cause chaos in the mortal world. Betelgeuse saves the Maitlands and disposes of Maxie, his wife, and Otho, then prepares a wedding before a ghastly minister. The Maitlands intervene before the ceremony is completed, with Barbara riding a <b>sandworm</b> through the house to devour Betelgeuse.|$|E
2500|$|In Heretics of Dune, {{all life}} on Arrakis is {{destroyed}} (and {{the entire surface}} of the planet slagged into oblivion) by the Honored Matres in a failed attempt to eliminate the latest Duncan Idaho ghola. The Bene Gesserit escape with a single <b>sandworm,</b> and drown it to revert the worm back into sandtrout. In [...] the Bene Gesserit use these sandtrout to begin a new <b>sandworm</b> cycle on their homeworld of Chapterhouse, which is terraformed into desert for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|John Schoenherr {{provided}} the earliest artwork for the Dune series, including the illustrations {{in the initial}} pulp magazine serial and {{the cover of the}} first hardcover edition. Frank Herbert was very pleased with Schoenherr's art,Excerpt from Dune Genesis, an essay by Frank Herbert in Omni Magazine (July 1980) and remarked that he was [...] "the only man who has ever visited Dune". [...] Schoenherr gave the <b>sandworm</b> three triangular lobes that form the lips of its mouth. [...] This design was referenced for the <b>sandworm</b> puppets that appeared in the 1984 movie adaptation of Dune.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>Sandworms</b> of Dune, Brian Herbert and Anderson's 2007 {{conclusion}} {{to the original}} series, the Spacing Guild is manipulated into replacing its Navigators with Ixian navigation devices and cutting off the Navigators' supply of melange. Sure to die should they be without the spice, a group of Navigators commissions Waff, an imperfectly awakened Tleilaxu ghola, to create [...] "advanced" [...] <b>sandworms</b> able to produce the melange they so desperately require. He accomplishes this by altering the DNA of the sandtrout stage and creating an aquatic form of the worms, which are then released into the oceans of Buzzell. Adapting to their new environment, these seaworms quickly flourish, eventually producing a highly concentrated form of spice, dubbed [...] "ultraspice". Meanwhile, <b>sandworms</b> are revealed to have survived the devastation of Rakis after all, by burrowing deep under the surface.|$|R
