40|$|The {{inner surface}} of {{ferritic}} steel reactor pressure vessels (RPV) is clad with strip welded {{austenitic stainless steel}} primarily to increase the long-term corrosion resistance of the ferritic vessel. The <b>strip</b> <b>welding</b> process used in the cladding operation induces significant residual stresses in the clad layer and in the RPV steel substrate, arising both from the thermal cycle and from the very different thermal and mechanical properties of the austenitic clad layer and the ferritic RPV steel. This work measures residual stresses using the deep hole drilling (DHD) and neutron diffraction (ND) techniques and compares residual stress data obtained by the two methods in a stainless clad coupon of A 533 B Class 2 steel. The results give confidence that both techniques are capable of assessing the trends in residual stresses, and their magnitudes. Significant differences are that the ND data shows greater values of the tensile stress peaks (∼ 100 MPa) than the DHD data but has a higher systematic error associated with it. The stress peaks are sharper with the ND technique and also differ in spatial position by around 1 mm compared with the DHD technique. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccording to all {{design codes}} (ASME, RCC-M, KTA, JARC, PNAEG,…) {{austenitic}} cladding on inner surface of RPVs is usually taken {{only as a}} protection against corrosion. Its tensile properties {{as well as its}} existence is not taken into account in design of the RPVs, i. e. in the determination of their dimensions as well as during stress analysis and comparison with allowable stresses/stress intensities. Austenitic cladding due to its manufacturing history – mostly by <b>strip</b> <b>welding</b> without subsequent austenitization – has not very high toughness that can be important in evaluation of some regimes like during emergency cooling when “PTS – pressurized thermal shock” is present. Existence of cladding, its properties, defectness and system of in-service NDT inspection determine the type, size and shape of so-called “postulated defect” in evaluation of RPV resistance against non-ductile failure. According to some codes (e. g. IAEA VERLIFE etc.) fracture properties {{must be taken into account}} in these calculations. Unfortunately, each of cladding layers has different properties and their fracture properties are changing during operation – some embrittlement can be found as a result of neutron irradiation. This paper will describe problems connected with the effect of cladding on RPV resistance against non-ductile failure during regimes of PTS type and also gives some examples and criteria for their evaluation...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research program has been to improve the rate-of-penetration in deep hostile environments by improving the life cycle and performance of coiled-tubing, {{an important component of}} a deep well drilling system for oil and gas exploration. The current process of the manufacture long tubular steel products consists of shaping the tube from flat <b>strip,</b> <b>welding</b> the seam and sections into lengths that can be miles long, and coiling onto reels. However, the welds, that are a weak point, now limit the performance of the coil tubing. This is not only from a toughness standpoint but also from a corrosion standpoint. By utilizing the latest developments in the sintering of materials with microwave energy and powder metal extrusion technology for the manufacture of seamless coiled tubing and other tubular products, these problems can be eliminated. The project is therefore to develop a continuous microwave process to sinter continuously steel tubulars and butt-join them using microwave/induction process. The program started about three years ago and now we {{are in the middle of}} Phase II. In Phase I (which ended in February 2005) a feasibility study of the extrusion process of steel powder and continuously sinter the extruded tubing was conducted. The research program has been based on the development of microwave technology to process tubular specimens of powder metals, especially steels. The existing microwave systems at the Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) and Dennis Tool Company (DTC) were suitably modified to process tubular small specimens. The precursor powder metals were either extruded or cold isostatically pressed (CIP) to form tubular specimens. After conducting an extensive and systematic investigation of extrusion process for producing long tubes, it was determined that there were several difficulties in adopting extrusion process and it cannot be economically used for producing thousands of feet long green tubing. Therefore, in the Phase II the approach was modified to the microwave sintering combined with Cold Isostatic Press (CIP) and joining (by induction or microwave). This process can be developed into a semi-continuous sintering process if the CIP can produce parts fast enough to match the microwave sintering rates. This report summarizes the progress made to-date in this new approach. The final steel composition matching with the Quality tubing's QT- 16 Cr 80 was short listed and used for all experiments. Bonding experiments using 4 different braze powders were conducted and the process optimized to obtain high degree of bonding strength. For fabrication of green tubulars a large CIP unit was acquired and tested. This equipment is located at the Dennis Tool facility in Houston. Microwave sintering experiments for continuous processing of the CIPed tubes are under progress in order to identify the optimum conditions. There have been some reproducibility problems and we are at present working to resolve these problems...|$|E

25|$|Geocells (also {{known as}} Cellular Confinement Systems) are {{three-dimensional}} honeycombed cellular structures that form a confinement system when infilled with compacted soil. Extruded from polymeric materials into <b>strips</b> <b>welded</b> together ultrasonically in series, the strips are expanded {{to form the}} stiff (and typically textured and perforated) walls of a flexible 3D cellular mattress. Infilled with soil, a new composite entity is created from the cell-soil interactions. The cellular confinement reduces the lateral movement of soil particles, thereby maintaining compaction and forms a stiffened mattress that distributes loads over a wider area. Traditionally used in slope protection and earth retention applications, geocells made from advanced polymers are being increasingly adopted for long-term road and rail load support. Much larger geocells are also made from stiff geotextiles sewn into similar, but larger, unit cells that are used for protection bunkers and walls.|$|R

40|$|A {{strengthening}} {{technique for}} the wooden floors of historical buildings aimed to increase both flexural and in-plane stiffness is herein proposed. The technique, which is highly reversible and little invasive, consists in placing steel plates above the existing boarding and in connecting {{them to the}} wooden beams by means of steel dowels. Finally, a system of diagonal steel <b>strips</b> <b>welded</b> to perimetric steel profiles anchored to the walls, stiffens the floor in its plane in order to guarantee an effective seismic behaviour. In the paper the results of experimental investigations on {{the connection between the}} steel plates and the wooden beams and the outcomes of load tests on existing floors before and after the strengthening intervention are presented. A numerical model for the strengthened floors has also been developed by using the experimental outcomes. Numerical analyses on both strengthened beams and a whole ancient masonry building with wooden floors have been carried out. The results achieved show the effectiveness of the proposed strengthening technique regarding the improvement of the out-of-plane floor stiffness and the load bearing capacity as well as the enhancement of the seismic performance of the analyzed ancient masonry building whose floors have been strengthened.

Since then, this inspection technique and the testing equipment have seen steady further development. Therefore, optimization of the entire testing system, including qualification based on the 1995 results, was conducted. The eddy current testing system {{was designed as a}} ten-channel test system with sensors having separate transmitter and receiver coils. The first qualification of the testing technique and sensors was performed using a single-channel system; a second qualification was then carried out using the new testing electronics. The sensor design allows for a simultaneous detection of surface and subsurface flaws. This assumes that testing is performed simultaneously using four frequencies. Data analysis and evaluation are performed using a digital multi-frequency regression analysis technique. The detection limits determined using this technique led to the definition of the following recording limits for testing in which the required signal-to-noise ratio of 6 dB was reliably observed.

Although ssLAVW has pronounced advantages over conventional suturing, drawbacks include low welding strength and extensive thermal damage. Aim: To determine optimal ssLAVW parameters for maximum welding strength and minimal thermal damage. Methods: Substudy 1 compared breaking strength (BS) of aortic <b>strips</b> <b>welded</b> with electrospun poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffold, 670 -nm laser, 50 -s single-spot continuous lasing (SSCL), and semi-solid solder (48 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) / 0. 5 % methylene blue (MB) / 3 % hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC)). Substudy 2 compared the semi-solid solder to 48 % BSA/ 0. 5 % MB/ 0. 38 % genipin and 48 % BSA/ 0. 5 % MB/ 3 % HPMC/ 0. 38 % genipin solder. Substudy 3 compared SSCL to single-spot pulsed lasing (SSPL). Results: PCL-ssLAVW yielded an acute BS of 248. 0 ± 54. 0 N/cm 2 and remained stable up to 7 d of hydration. PLGA-ssLAVW obtained higher acute BS (408. 6 ± 78. 8 N/cm 2) but revealed structural defects and a BS of 109. 4 ± 42. 6 N/cm 2 after 14 d of hydration. The addition of HPMC and genipin improved the 14 -d BS of PLGA-ssLAVW (223. 9 ± 19. 1 N/cm 2). Thermal damage was reduced with SSPL compared with SSCL. Conclusions: PCL-ssLAVW yielded lower but more stable welds than PLGA-ssLAVW. The addition of HPMC and genipin to the solder increased the post-hydration BS of PLGA-ssLAVW. SSPL regimen reduced thermal damage. PLGA-ssLAVW using 48 % BSA/ 0. 5 % MB/ 3 % HPMC/ 0. 38 % genipin solder and SSPL constitutes the most optimal welding modality. Relevance for patients: Surgical patients requiring vascular anastomoses may benefit from the advantages that ssLAVW potentially offers over conventional (gold standard) sutures. These include no needle trauma and remnant suture materials in the patient, reduction of foreign body reaction, immediate liquid-tight sealing, {{and the possibility of}} a faster and easier procedure for minimally invasive and endoscopic anastomotic techniques...|$|R

Study Design/Materials and Methods: Solder <b>strips</b> were <b>welded</b> onto rectangular sections of sheep small intestine using a diode laser. The laser delivered in continuous mode a power of 170 [*]±[*] 10 mW at λ[*]=[*] 808 nm, through a multimode optical fiber (core size[*]=[*] 200 μm) to achieve a dose of 10. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 5 J/mg.

The solder was composed of 62 % bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0. 38 % genipin, 0. 25 % indocyanin green dye (IG), and water. Tissue welding was also performed with a BSA solder without genipin, as a control group. The repaired tissue was tested for tensile strength by a calibrated tensiometer. Murine fibroblasts were also cultured in extracted media from heat-denatured genipin solder to assess cell growth inhibition in a 48 hours period.

High resolution techniques are required to characterize such small individual precipitates to be able to examine their actual effect on the corrosion resistance of stainless steels.   In this work, magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) were used to investigate the magnetic properties and the Volta potential difference of precipitated phases. The magnetic domain distribution was used to distinguish between ferrite (ferromagnetic), austenite (paramagnetic), and sigma phase (non-magnetic). The Volta potential differences reflect the relative nobility of the phases and thus their tendency to corrode. The MFM and SKPFM techniques are shown to achieve a high lateral resolution of at least 100 nm. This means that small particles or precipitated phases can be characterized separately from the surrounding matrix.   Two grades of duplex stainless steels, the standard 2205 and the super duplex 2507, and an electroslag <b>strip</b> <b>weld</b> with a multi-phase microstructure were investigated using a combination of local probing techniques. The duplex stainless steels underwent various heat treatments to precipitate a sufficient amount of secondary phases. Scanning electron microscopy in backscattered electron mode and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy yielded information on the phase distribution and chemical composition of individual phases. Detailed marking of the surfaces was used so that exactly the same areas could be investigated with the MFM and SKPFM techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also employed to characterize the chemical composition of depleted phase boundaries.     The general observation is that, austenite exhibited a higher Volta potential compared with ferrite, most likely due to a higher nickel content in the austenite phase. When sigma phase was present, it showed an intermediate Volta potential between the austenite and ferrite phases. This indicates that austenite is, in general, more noble than sigma phase, and that ferrite is the most active phase. However, austenite showed a lower Volta potential than sigma phase when a long-term isothermal heat treatment at 800 °C was used. This is attributed to the depletion of alloying elements in the austenite phase {{as a result of the}} formation of chromium nitrides and sigma phase. Synergistic interactions between chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen may contribute to the effect on the Volta potential, since such small changes of these elements result in reversed Volta potentials of the austenite and sigma phase.   Results from SKPFM and TEM analyses are in concordance and indicate local drops in Volta potential at the phase boundaries due to the depletion of alloying elements caused by sigma phase formation. Immersion tests in acidic mixtures also confirmed that these depleted regions are more susceptible to selective corrosion.   Precipitated chromium nitrides showed a higher Volta potential compared with the other phases. This indicates that any deterioration in the corrosion resistance is unlikely caused by the nitride particles themselves, but rather by the alloying element depleted regions surrounding the nitride particles. The size of nitride particles affected the measured Volta potential, and the measured Volta potentials of small particles are tended to be concealed by the surrounding matrix. When the size of nitride particles is below the resolution limit of the SKPFM technique, the Volta potential differences of these particles relative to the matrix could not be detected.   Volta potential measured in air with the SKPFM technique correlated better to the tendency to active dissolution than to pitting corrosion in acidic mixtures. The magnetic force showed a certain influence on the electrostatic force, thus Volta potential measurements are recommended to be performed with a non-magnetic tip. Although many factors may affect the measured Volta potential, the SKFPM technique combined with other local probing techniques is a promising approach to evaluate corrosion tendency of precipitated phases in multi-phase alloys. With optimal conditions, the detectable size was down to approximately 100 nm. QC 2010051...|$|R
40|$|A fuel element, {{consisting}} of a cluster of stainlesssteel-clad sodium- bonded, U - 10 wt. % Mo fuel rods, has been proposed for the first core loading in the Hallam Nuclear Power Facility. Analytical data on density, soundness, chemical composition, dimensions, and surface finish were obtained from more than 100 heats of fuel slugs which were vacuum cast in graphite molds. The quality levels obtained were satisfactory, and casting was {{proven to be a}} feasible fabrication method for U - 10 wt. % Mo fuel slugs. Extrusion and liquid pouring were both investigated as methods of handling sodium to bond fuel rods. The extrusion technique was shown to be impractical because of difficulty in supplying a sufficient volume of sodium to fill the rod. Satisfactory bonding was obtained using the liquid technique. Two full-scale fuelelement mock-ups were fabricated. Each element contained 19 fuel rods located by spacers made from spot <b>welded</b> <b>strips</b> and enclosed in a process tube. Assembly problems encountered in the first mock-up were corrected by modifying the fuel-rod spacers. Methods were developed for safe handling of the fuel rods and other long (15 ft) components. The second mock-up demonstrated that the fuel element was suitable for fabrication and assembly. Physical testing was performed on fuel-rod end closures, cladding support springs, the variable-orifice thermocouple, and the fuel-rod spacers. The end closures and support springs were shown to have adequate strength. The thermocouple functioned well at temperatures and flexure conditions stimulating reactor operation. A minimum material thickness was determined for the fuel-rod spacers. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Limit loads {{are widely}} studied and several limit load {{solutions}} are proposed to some typical geometry of weldments. However, {{there are no}} limit load solutions exist for the single edge crack weldments in tension (SEC(T)), {{which is also a}} typical geometry in fracture analysis. The mis-matching limit load for thick plate with SEC(T) are investigated and the special limit load solutions are proposed based on the available mis-matching limit load solutions and systematic finite element analyses. The real weld configurations are simplified as a <b>strip,</b> and different <b>weld</b> strength mis-matching ratio M, crack depth/width ratio a/W and weld width 2 H are in consideration. As a result, it is found that there exists excellent agreement between the limit load solutions and the FE results for almost all the mis-matching ration M, a/W and ligament-to-weld width ratio (W-a) /H. Moreover, useful recommendations are given for evaluating the limit loads of the EBW structure with SEC(T). For the EBW joints with SEC(T), the mis-matching limit loads can be obtained assuming that the components are wholly made of base metal, when M changing from 1. 6 to 0. 6. When M decreasing to 0. 4, the mis-matching limit loads can be obtained assuming that the components are wholly made of base metal only for large value of (W-a) /H. The recommendations may be useful for evaluating the limit loads of the EBW structures with SEC(T). The engineering simplifications are given for assessing the limit loads of electron beam welded structure with SEC(T). © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
