40|$|Three {{hydrogen}} electrode-supported, large-scale solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) {{with different}} composite air electrodes, namely LSM-YSZ, LSC-GDC, and LSCF-GDC (LSM, LSC, and LSCF cells, respectively), were compared for performance and degradation {{in the same}} three cell stack with an H 2 O/H- 2 ratio of 90 / 10. The initial SOEC performance increased in the following order: LSM, LSCF, and LSC. The three cells were operated at a constant current density of 0. 50 A cm(- 2) for 640 h during hydrogen production at 750 degrees C. After the operation, the 10 cm x 10 cm large-scale single cell was divided equally into four subparts from the two diagonal parts with the <b>steam</b> <b>or</b> <b>air</b> inlet area and <b>steam</b> <b>or</b> <b>air</b> outlet area for post-mortem analysis. Delamination mainly occurred in the steam and air inlet areas of the LSM and LSC cells, with more severe delamination in the steam inlet area than that in the air inlet area. Agglomeration of Ni in the Ni-YSZ hydrogen electrode was observed in the LSM and LSCF cells, whereas honeycomb Ni was observed in the steam and air inlet areas of the LSC cell.

40|$|In this study, using {{wood chips}} and {{polyethylene}} (PE) as fuels, {{the effects of}} air and/or steam as reagents on the tar reforming were clarified quantitatively with a simulated gasifier/reformer apparatus of a two-staged gasification process. The results show that when only <b>steam</b> <b>or</b> <b>air</b> was supplied into the reformer, the tar residual rate (defined as {{the ratio of the}} tar amount in the reformed gas to the tar amount in the pyrolysis gas) and the carbon particulate concentration in both reformed gases produced from pyrolysis gases of wood chips and PE decreased with the increase of the steam ratio (H(2) O/C, 0 - 1. 0) <b>or</b> the <b>air</b> ratio (ER, 0 - 0. 30). Supplying steam into the reformer to suppress carbon particulate formation for PE pyrolysis gas is more effective than for wood chips pyrolysis gas. Comparing with the results of steam only reforming, the effect of air supply on reduction of the tar residual rate was more significant, while that on suppression of carbon particulate formation was smaller.

40|$|In case of {{a severe}} {{accident}} in a nuclear reactor, the revaporisation of fission products (FPs) can have a major effect on the late phase release source term. An experimental revaporisation facility was built in JRC-ITU to study this phenomenon with sample of FP deposits originating from the upper vertical line of the Phébus FP experimental reactor [1]. The PHEBUS reactor core was equipped with a test loop which allowed investigating fuel rod bundle degradation and melting behaviour. Such tests promoted the release of fission products, particularly 137 Cs, and their transport/deposition through the primary circuit of the loop. The revaporisation facility consists of a compact high temperature furnace in which the deposit samples can be heated up to 1273 K under controlled atmosphere conditions simulating the late phase of a severe accident. The revaporisation behaviour of the 137 Cs deposited on the sample is scrutinized {{by means of an}} on-line gamma spectroscopy system. In the current experimental campaign, three samples from the Phébus FPT 3 experiment were investigated and first heated up by 10 K/min to 573 K in a nitrogen atmosphere. In a second step, each sample was analysed with a specific carrier gas (i. e. hydrogen, <b>steam</b> <b>or</b> <b>air)</b> and heated further by 2 K/min to 1273 K. For the last experiment in air, measures were also adopted to collect samples of the FPs after revaporisation and their subsequent recondensation as aerosols for further analysis via Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Revaporisation results deduced from the on-line measurement showed very similar behaviour in terms of starting temperature and kinetics for either <b>steam</b> <b>or</b> <b>air.</b> This indicates that the variation in oxygen potential between steam and air does not affect so much the reaction kinetics (and the active Cs species is not changed). The experiment with hydrogen showed a far higher starting temperature and slower kinetics. This suggests that in a nuclear accident FPs under reducing conditions would form deposits up to rather high temperatures; the deposits may be remobilized at lower temperatures under oxidising conditions.
