5|$|On December 27, 1880, Wyatt {{testified that}} White's <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> accidental. Brocius {{expressed}} regret, {{saying he had}} not intended to shoot White. Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Curly Bill's single-action revolver was defective, allowing it to be discharged at half-cock. A statement from White before he died was introduced stating that the <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> accidental. The judge ruled that the <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> accidental and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained intensely angry about how Wyatt had pistol-whipped him and became an enemy to the Earps. Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone.|$|E
5|$|A Union soldier named Robinson {{was shot}} in July or August 1864 near Raven Creek, a {{tributary}} of Fishing Creek. That <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> originally blamed on the political group known as the Knights of the Golden Circle, though it was eventually proven that the group had disbanded in 1863.|$|E
5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E
50|$|The IPSC Handgun World <b>Shoot</b> <b>is</b> {{the highest}} level handgun match within the International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) which {{consists}} of several days and at least 30 separate courses of fire. The Handgun World <b>Shoots</b> <b>are</b> held every third year on a rotational cycle with the other IPSC disciplines, meaning that since the last Shotgun World <b>Shoot</b> <b>was</b> held in 2015 and the following Rifle World <b>Shoot</b> <b>was</b> planned to be held during 2016, then the next Handgun World <b>Shoot</b> will <b>be</b> held in 2017.|$|R
5000|$|In Nagaland (India), bamboo <b>shoots</b> <b>are</b> both {{cooked and}} eaten as a fresh food item or {{fermented}} {{for a variety}} of culinary uses. Fermented bamboo <b>shoot</b> <b>is</b> commonly known as bas tenga. Cooking pork with a generous portion of fermented bamboo <b>shoot</b> <b>is</b> very popular in Naga cuisine.|$|R

5|$|In an {{interview}} in April 2013, Rita Demirchyan, the widow of Karen Demirchyan, suggested that the <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> commanded from outside of Armenia {{and that it was}} not an attempt of a coup, but rather an assassination.|$|E
5|$|On May 31, 1968, Solanas went to writer Paul Krassner {{to ask him}} for $50, {{which he}} loaned to her. Krassner later speculated that Solanas could have used {{the money to buy}} the gun she used to shoot Andy Warhol as the <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> only three days later.|$|E

5|$|After filming {{two songs}} in the districts of Krabi and Pattaya in Bangkok, the film's unit {{returned}} to Hyderabad on 2 December 2011 for completing patch work. The film's <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> wrapped up on 10 December 2011 in 74 working days as expected.

5|$|Development of Qwak! {{began in}} 1974, {{finishing}} in November. It {{was presented at}} the November 1974 Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition for release that month. The game was not commercially successful; according to Ralph H. Baer, it sold approximately 250 units. A two-player clone game by U.S. Billiards, Duck <b>Shooting,</b> <b>was</b> produced around the same time, and Qwak! has been noted as a possible inspiration for the 1984 Nintendo Entertainment System light gun game Duck Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Filming of {{the second}} series was {{scheduled}} in two blocks: the first—directed by Andrew Grieve—ran from 2 July to 11 August and the second—directed by Edward Hall—from 20 August to 29 September. <b>Shooting</b> <b>was</b> again based in Swaffham.

5000|$|In Korean, {{the young}} <b>shoot</b> <b>is</b> called dureup (...) , {{and the plant}} is called dureupnamu( [...] , [...] "dureup tree"). The young <b>shoots</b> <b>are</b> {{harvested}} during a month, from early April to early May, when they are soft and fragrant.

40|$|Reduction of net {{photosynthetic}} rate (P_n) {{independent of the}} stomatal conductance (g_s) of detached Cryptomeria japonica <b>shoots</b> <b>was</b> recognized and compared with reduction of P_n, due to water stress. An assimilation chamber method {{was used to measure}} of changes in P_n and g_s, of detached Cryptomeria japonica shoots. C, japonica <b>shoots</b> <b>were</b> used and underwent the following treatments: (1) one <b>shoot</b> <b>was</b> not after being place in the chamber and exposed to water stress. (2) three <b>shoots</b> <b>were</b> girdled in order to inhibit photosynthate translocation. (3) three <b>shoots</b> <b>were</b> girdled, and apexes were removed in order to reduce consumption of photosynthate. The following observations were made; in (1) P_n cleclined with g_s, due to the water stress treatment: in (2) the effects of the <b>shoot</b> girdling treatment <b>were</b> not remarkable: in (3) P_n, and g_s, were stable after the removal of the apexes. After girdling, P_n declined drastically, but g_s were not affected by the dirdling. In this study, a relationship was suggested between sink demand and the control mechanism of photosynthesis. 樹木の切枝を用いてガス交換の計測をおこなう際，測定値に及ぼす切断の影響を知ることは，その測定値を個体の成長モデルなどに活用する上で重要である．従来，切枝に関する問題としては，水ストレスによる光合成速度の低下がおもに議論されてきたが，水分条件が十分な状態においても光合成速度が低下する現象をみとめた．そこで本研究では，その原因として同化産物の転流阻害を仮定し，この現象の再現を試みた．同時に水ストレスによって生じる光合成速度と気孔コンダクタンスの低下と比較した．断水による水ストレス，環状剥皮，環状剥皮および成長点除去の各処理を施したスギの光合成と気孔コンダクタンスの動きを同化箱法で計測した．その結果，（ 1 ）水ストレス処理では，気孔コンダクタンスと光合成速度は同調して低下した．（ 2 ）環状剥皮処理では気孔コンダクタンスと光合成速度に低下は認められなかった．（ 3 ）環状剥皮および成長点除去処理では気孔コンダクタンスは変化せず，光合成速度のみが急激に低下した．以上のように同化産物の転流阻害を目的とした処理において，水ストレスで生じた光合成速度と気孔コンダクタンスの変化とは異なる光合成速度のみの低下が生じた．このことは光合成速度と気孔コンダクタンスの制御に水ストレスとは異なる機構が存在することを示唆している...|$|R
5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find {{anything}} suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing made it look like all <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> done in the same area.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, the BBC {{reported}} that a film about the recording of London Calling {{was in the early}} stages of production.

Alison Owen and Paul Trijbits had been chosen as the producers.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007, Fox Atomic {{had plans}} to film Jennifer's Body before a {{possible}} writer's strike. When the Writers Guild of America strike began, <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> then moved to March 7, 2008, in Burnaby, British Columbia, specifically at Robert Burnaby Park near Cariboo Hill Secondary School. Some of the scenes, particularly those situated in a school setting, were filmed in local Vancouver-area schools such as Vancouver Technical Secondary School, Langley Secondary School and University Hill Secondary School.|$|E

30|$|The shoots induced from <b>shoot</b> apexes <b>were</b> cultured on MSBM {{supplemented}} with two auxins, NAA (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0  mg/L− 1) or IBA (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0  mg/L− 1), 3 % sucrose and 0.3 % gelrite.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} first nationally {{telecast}} bulletin about the <b>shooting</b> <b>was</b> made by Kathleen Sullivan {{as part of a}} standard newscast on Cable News Network; Sullivan reported that Lennon had been shot but his condition was not known {{at the time of the}} bulletin. NBC-TV momentarily broke into its East Coast feed of The Best of Carson for its bulletin of Lennon's death before returning in the middle of a comedy piece being performed by Johnny Carson.|$|E
5|$|It {{was later}} {{decided that the}} film would begin after the {{conclusion}} of the eighth and final season. It was to be set and shot on-location in Europe.

40|$|The {{productivity}} of Dendrocalamus asper (giant bamboo) {{in response to}} different fertiliser and mulch applications and to harvesting intensity was assessed {{over a period of}} 6 years. Edible bamboo <b>shoot</b> production <b>was</b> increased by fertiliser and mulch treatments; more <b>shoots</b> <b>were</b> also produced from clumps with higher numbers of 1 - and 2 -year-old culms.
