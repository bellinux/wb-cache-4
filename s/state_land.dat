40|$|Sustainable {{development}} of the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka requires <b>lands</b> importantly <b>State</b> <b>lands,</b> and participation of people in {{development of}} the Provinces. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution has been enacted to devolve, inter alia, powers relating to lands to the Provincial Councils in Sri Lanka, and enable the people at provincial level to participate in {{development of the}} Provinces. The provisions relating to powers of the Provincial Councils over <b>State</b> <b>lands</b> are ambiguous in nature. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has given different interpretation at different time to the words and phrases relating to powers of Provincial Councils over <b>State</b> <b>lands.</b> The different interpretations given by the Supreme Court has created judicial inconsistency relating to {{the powers of the}} Provincial Councils. Solaimuthu Rasu Case is the latest case relating to powers of the Provincial Councils over <b>State</b> <b>lands.</b> In this case, the Supreme Court has held that the Provincial Councils have legislative power with regard to administration, control and utilization of <b>State</b> <b>lands</b> that have been given to the Provincial Councils by the Government. It means that the ownership of the <b>State</b> <b>lands</b> is not vested with the Provincial Councils. The Supreme Court has also held that the President has powers to alienate <b>State</b> <b>lands</b> including the lands given to the Provincial Councils to any citizen or organization. Therefore, the Provincial Councils have very limited powers over <b>State</b> <b>lands.</b> These limited powers over <b>State</b> <b>lands</b> restraint the Northern and Eastern Provincial Councils and the people in the Provinces to promote sustainable development in the Provinces...|$|R

5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site was inappropriate for acquisition. Although the appellant had argued that a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site {{would have resulted in}} a plot of <b>state</b> <b>land</b> that was highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did not relate to proper land use planning.|$|E
5|$|The next {{important}} case came in 1935 {{when the}} state's top court ruled in State v. De Jonge, 152 Or. 315, 51 P.2d 674 (1935) that the 14th Amendment did not protect Communist Party organizers from prosecution under Oregon’s criminal syndicate law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn this decision in DeJonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937). Another important case came in 1960 as the Oregon court ruled against the United States government in <b>State</b> <b>Land</b> Board v. United States, 222 Or. 40, 352 P.2d 539 (1960). In that case {{the court ruled}} that state estate laws trumped a federal statute concerning the property of U.S. Veterans who died at Veterans Administration hospitals without a valid will. The U.S. Supreme Court then overturned the Oregon Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643 (1961).|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on <b>state</b> <b>land.</b> The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E

5|$|Left undone, however, was {{extending}} the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar of the <b>state</b> <b>land</b> office. Cognizant {{that the old}} law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E
5|$|The US-based United Fruit Company (UFC) {{was one of}} {{many foreign}} {{companies}} that acquired large tracts of both <b>state</b> <b>land</b> and indigenous land. Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who was president of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, permitted limited unionization in rural Guatemala, but also made further concessions to the UFC. In 1922, the Communist Party of Guatemala was created, and became a significant influence among urban laborers; however, it had little reach among the rural and Indian populations. In 1929, the Great Depression led to the collapse of the economy and a rise in unemployment, leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Fearing the possibility of a revolution, the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico y Castañeda, who had built a reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.|$|E
5|$|A Democratic-Republican, Garrard {{opposed the}} Alien and Sedition Acts and favored {{passage of the}} Kentucky Resolutions. He lobbied for public education, militia and prison reforms, {{business}} subsidies, and legislation favorable to the state's large debtor class. In 1798, the state's first governor's mansion was constructed, and Garrard became its first resident. Due {{in part to the}} confusion resulting from the 1795 election, he favored calling a constitutional convention in 1799. Because of his anti-slavery views, he was not chosen as a delegate to the convention. Under the resulting constitution, the governor was popularly elected and was forbidden from succeeding himself in office, although Garrard was personally exempted from this provision and was re-elected in 1799. During his second term, he applauded Thomas Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana from France as a means of dealing with the closure of the port at New Orleans to U.S. goods. Late in his term, his Secretary of State, Harry Toulmin, persuaded him to adopt some doctrines of Unitarianism, and he was expelled from the Baptist church, ending his ministry. He also clashed with the legislature over the appointment of a registrar for the <b>state</b> <b>land</b> office, leaving him embittered and unwilling to continue in politics after the conclusion of his term. He retired to his estate, Mount Lebanon, and engaged in agricultural and commercial pursuits until his death on January 19, 1822. Garrard County, Kentucky, created during his first term, was named in his honor.|$|E
