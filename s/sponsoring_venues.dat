The event, which also featured two other groups, the Angel Brains and I Barrittas, caused considerable controversy in the Catholic Church, as it was in the process of modernizing its liturgy in the wake of Vatican II. [...] The Mass was overwhelmingly successful in attracting a young audience, but the response of the Vatican hierarchy was unexpectedly negative and swift. [...] The band members of the Bumpers and the other groups were excommunicated, though the edict would later be rescinded. [...] A proposed tour, which included a performance at Albert Hall, was cancelled, when all of the <b>sponsors</b> and <b>venues</b> pulled out simultaneously. [...] The Ariel company, which had recorded the Mass went bankrupt, and the Bumpers, like the other bands were unable to get gigs even in small Italian towns. [...] The exhibition was released on the Ariel LP, La Messa Dei Giovani (The Mass of the Young), became a cult favorite over the years, and was recently re-issued on Roman Records. [...] In 1966, the Bumpers released several singles featuring songs excerpted from the mass, including [...] "I believe (I believe)" [...] b/w [...] "Sanctus (Holy)" [...] and [...] "Marion" [...] backed with the protopunk [...] "Cupidation".|$|R
50|$|LUMS {{is based}} on a league format, which ensures that each team competes against every other at least once. The fact that no teams are knocked out until the Grand Final differentiates it from other mooting competitions, and is {{intended}} to maximise the educational benefit of the competition - both in terms of advocacy and career development. Rounds are hosted by the participating universities, certain of the competition <b>sponsors</b> and legal <b>venues</b> such as the Royal Courts of Justice and Crown Courts around London. The multiple moots which make up each round are always held on the same evening in the same place, enabling the competitors {{to get to know each}} other throughout the year and furthermore to find out more about the legal profession by meeting the barristers and solicitors who judged them in an informal context. At the end of the league rounds, the top two teams based on points go on to the Grand Final, meaning that the team coming top of the league does not always win the overall competition.|$|R

The viewers were able to cast their votes via telephone, SMS text voting and the show's Facebook application. Votes cast via the telephone and SMS text voting made up 60% of the total votes, while the remaining 40% was determined by the number of votes received from the show's Facebook application.|$|R

5000|$|After {{their success}} was noted by George N. Beach, he offered them a ten month {{contract}} in New York City {{to perform at}} the Crystal Palace Exhibition. When the troupe actually arrived in New York, however, Beach would no longer honor the contract. Without a <b>sponsor</b> or a <b>venue</b> they were soon left destitute, without the funds needed to return to California. In an attempt to raise money, they performed at Niblo's Garden for 0.50 per ticket, {{but at the time}} New York had essentially no Chinese people living there who would properly appreciate the performance. After a lukewarm reception (one critic compared the traditional Cantonese music to [...] "the sound of distressed cats" [...] fused with [...] "ungreased cart wheels", and opined that perhaps the singers were in communion with Satan), the show closed after only one week open, leaving the troupe unable to even pay its hotel bill and having had to pawn their costumes for money. According to Su Zheng's research, some were able to find employ in a workhouse on Roosevelt Island, one attempted suicide, and the rest wandered forlornly through the streets, selling cigars and fabrics. Zheng states that what became of them after that, {{and whether or not they}} were ever able to return to California or China, is a mystery.|$|R
