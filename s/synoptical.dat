5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having {{the burden of}} his professorial and garden duties, by the late 1870s the burden of {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on <b>Synoptical</b> Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just to look at him through his window.|$|E

60|$|The {{foregoing}} is a <b>synoptical</b> {{statement of}} the evidence, together with the judge-advocate-general's conclusions. The disaster, when it came, {{was a surprise to}} all. It was very well known to Generals Shenck and Milroy for some time before, that General Halleck thought the division was in great danger of a surprise at Winchester; that it was of no service commensurate with the risk it incurred, and that it ought to be withdrawn; but, although he more than once advised its withdrawal, he never positively ordered it. General Schenck, on the contrary, believed the service of the force at Winchester was worth the hazard, and so did not positively order its withdrawal until it was so late that the enemy cut the wire and prevented the order reaching General Milroy.|$|E
60|$|It is not {{necessary}} the reader should load his memory with details of all these preliminary things; on the contrary, {{it is necessary that}} he keep his memory clear for the far more important things that lie ahead of these, and entertain these in a summary way, as a kind of foreground to what is coming. Perhaps the following Fractions of Note, which put matters in something of Chronological or <b>Synoptical</b> form, will suffice him, or more than suffice. He is to understand that the grand tug of War, this Year, gradually turns out not to be hereabouts, nor with Daun and his adjacencies at all, but with the Russians, who arrive from the opposite Northern quarter; and that all else will prove to be merely prefatory and nugatory in comparison.|$|E
60|$|This latter {{idea had}} reft her {{suddenly}} {{at the age}} of seventeen from the educational care of an English gentlewoman warranted to fit her for marriage with any prince in Europe, and thrust her for the mornings and a moiety of the afternoons of {{the better part of a}} year, after a swift but competent training, into a shirt waist and an office down town. She had been entrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of Mr. Grammont, because he feared his own people wouldn't train her hard. She had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours, and at the end of the day, she mentioned casually, a large automobile with two menservants and a trustworthy secretary used to pick her out from the torrent of undistinguished workers that poured out of the <b>Synoptical</b> Building. This masculinization idea had also sent her on a commission of enquiry into Mexico. There apparently she had really done responsible work.|$|E
6000|$|Jan. 9, 1868.—I hope I have {{followed}} you correctly, says Newman: [...] your main proposition seems to be, that whereas both Jew and [...] Gentile {{had his own}} notion of an heroic humanity, and neither of [...] them a true notion, the one being political, the other even [...] immoral, the first step necessary for bringing {{in the idea of}} an [...] Emmanuel into the world, was to form the human mould into which it [...] ’might drop,’ and thus to supplant both the Judaic and the heathen [...] misconception by the exhibition of the true idea. Next, passing [...] from antecedent probabilities to history, the order of succession [...] of the <b>synoptical</b> and the fourth gospels does in fact fulfil this [...] reasonable anticipation. This seems to me a very great view, and [...] I look forward eagerly to what you have still to say in [...] illustration of it. The only objection which I see can be made to [...] it is, that it is a clever controversial expedient after the event [...] for accounting for a startling fact. This is an objection not [...] peculiar to it, but to all explanations of the kind. Still, the [...] question remains—whether {{it is a fact that}} the sacred writers [...] recognise, however indirectly, the wise economy which you assert, [...] or whether it is only an hypothesis? ...|$|E
6000|$|Dorothea quietly {{persisted in}} spite of remonstrance and persuasion. So {{by the end of}} June the {{shutters}} were all opened at Lowick Manor, and the morning gazed calmly into the library, shining on the rows of note-books as it shines on the weary waste planted with huge stones, the mute memorial of a forgotten faith; and the evening laden with roses entered silently into the blue-green boudoir where Dorothea chose oftenest to sit. At first she walked into every room, questioning the eighteen months of her married life, and carrying on her thoughts as if they were a speech to be heard by her husband. Then, she lingered in the library and could not be at rest till she had carefully ranged all the note-books as she imagined that he would wish to see them, in orderly sequence. The pity which had been the restraining compelling motive in her life with him still clung about his image, even while she remonstrated with him in indignant thought and told him that he was unjust. One little act of hers may perhaps be smiled at as superstitious. The <b>Synoptical</b> Tabulation for the use of Mrs. Casaubon, she carefully enclosed and sealed, writing within the envelope, [...] "I could not use it. Do you not see now that I could not submit my soul to yours, by working hopelessly at what I have no belief in--Dorothea?" [...] Then she deposited the paper in her own desk.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was thus}} quite {{in order that}} I should pore longest, there at my fondest corner, over the Barnum announcements--my present {{inability}} to be superficial about which has given in fact the measure of my contemporary care. These announcements {{must have been in}} their way marvels of attractive composition, the placard bristling from top to toe with its analytic [...] "synopsis of scenery and incidents"; the <b>synoptical</b> view cast its net of fine meshes and the very word savoured of incantation. It is odd {{at the same time that}} when I question memory as to the living hours themselves, those of the stuffed and dim little hall of audience, smelling of peppermint and orange-peel, where the curtain rose on our gasping but rewarded patience, two performances only stand out for me, though these in the highest relief. Love, or the Countess and the Serf, by J. Sheridan Knowles--I see that still as the blazonry of one of them, just as I see Miss Emily Mestayer, large, red in the face, coifed in a tangle of small, fine, damp-looking short curls and clad in a light-blue garment edged with swans-down, shout at the top of her lungs that a [...] "pur-r-r-se of gold" [...] would be the fair guerdon of the minion who should start on the spot to do her bidding at some desperate crisis that I forget. I forget Huon the serf, whom I yet recall immensely admiring for his nobleness; I forget everyone but Miss Mestayer, who gave form to my conception of the tragic actress at her highest. She had a hooked nose, a great play of nostril, a vast protuberance of bosom and always the [...] "crop" [...] of close moist ringlets; I say always, for I was to see her often again, during a much later phase, the mid-most years of that Boston Museum which aimed at so vastly higher a distinction than the exploded lecture-room had really done, though in an age that snickered even abnormally low it still lacked the courage to call itself a theatre. She must have been in comedy, which I believe she also usefully and fearlessly practised, rather unimaginable; but there was no one like her in the Boston time for cursing queens and eagle-beaked mothers; the Shakespeare of the Booths and other such would have been unproducible without her; she had a rusty, rasping, heaving and tossing [...] "authority" [...] of which the bitterness is still in my ears. I am revisited by an outer glimpse of her in that after age when she had come, comparatively speaking, into her own--the sight of her, accidentally incurred, one tremendously hot summer night, as she slowly moved from her lodgings or wherever, in the high Bowdoin Street region, down to the not distant theatre from which even the temperature had given her no reprieve; and well remember how, the queer light of my young impression playing up again in her path, she struck me as the very image of mere sore histrionic habit and use, a worn and weary, a battered even though almost sordidly smoothed, thing of the theatre, very much as an old infinitely-handled and greasy violoncello of the orchestra might have been. It was but an effect doubtless of the heat that she scarcely seemed clad at all; slippered, shuffling and, though somehow hatted and vaguely veiled or streamered, wrapt in a gauzy sketch of a dressing-gown, she pointed to my extravagant attention the moral of thankless personal service, of the reverse of the picture, of the cost of [...] "amusing the public" [...] in a case of amusing it, as who should say, every hour. And I had thrilled before her as the Countess in [...] "Love"--such contrasted combinations! But she carried her head very high, as with the habit of crowns and trains and tirades--had in fact much the air of some deposed and reduced sovereign living on a scant allowance; so that, all invisibly and compassionately, I took off my hat to her.|$|E

For an easier survey of the material of the four Evangelists, Eusebius divided his edition of the New Testament into paragraphs and provided it with a <b>synoptical</b> table so that it might be easier to find the pericopes that belong together. These canon tables or [...] "Eusebian canons" [...] remained in use throughout the Middle Ages, and illuminated manuscript versions are important for the study of early medieval art, as they are the most elaborately decorated pages of many Gospel books.

5000|$|Alsted {{has been}} called 'one of the most {{important}} encyclopedists of all time'. He was a prolific writer, and his Encyclopaedia (1630) long had a high reputation. It was preceded by shorter works, including the 1608 Encyclopaedia cursus philosophici. His major encyclopedia of 1630, the Encyclopaedia, Septem Tomis Distincta, was divided into 35 books, and had 48 <b>synoptical</b> tables as well as an index. Alsted described it as [...] "a methodical systemization of all things which ought to be learned by men in this life. In short, it is the totality of knowledge." [...] In its time it was praised by Bernard Lamy and Cotton Mather, and it informed the work of Alsted's student John Amos Comenius. An unfinished encyclopedic project by Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz began as a plan to expand and modernize it, and the famous diarist Samuel Pepys purchased a copy in 1660--thirty years after its initial publication. Jacob Thomasius, though, criticised it for plagiarism for verbatim copying without acknowledgment. Augustus De Morgan later called it [...] "the true parent of all the Encyclopædias, or collections of treatises, or works in which that character predominates".|$|E

The first issue of the [...] "Biblia Sacra Polyglotta Bagsteriana" [...] {{appeared}} between 1817 and 1828, four volumes in foolscap octavo and quarto form, containing, besides the prolegomena of Dr. Samuel Lee, the Hebrew Old Testament with points, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Septuagint Greek version of the Old Testament, the Latin Vulgate, the authorised English version, the Greek Textus Receptus of the New Testament, and the Peshito or ancient Syriac version. An edition was printed of a quarto French, Italian, Spanish, and German Bible, which was destroyed by fire on the premises in March 1822, when only twenty-three copies of the New Testament portion were preserved. A folio edition of the polyglot was published in 1828, repeated in 1831, and subsequently, presenting eight languages {{at the opening of}} the volume, and including all the ancient and modern versions above mentioned. Copies of the different texts and translations were brought out separately, and in various combinations. Although best known for publishing religious works, other books were sometimes issued, including 'A <b>Synoptical</b> Compend of British Botany, Arranged After the Linnean System' by John Galpine.|$|E
