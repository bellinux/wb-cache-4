5|$|Just {{before the}} end of {{hostilities}} in the Pacific, the recently established garrison headquarters No.11 Group unofficially directed the wing's operations. Following the Japanese surrender in September 1945, No.82 Wing's Liberators were converted to transports and used to repatriate RAAF personnel from the South West Pacific. Over the course of its wartime existence, the wing's personnel numbered between 3,000 and 5,000, of whom more than half were ground crew. Along with its flying squadrons, its complement included No.24 Air Stores Park, No.6 Repair and <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit,</b> and No.30 Medical Clearing Station.|$|E
5|$|The wing began re-equipping with P-51D Mustangs at Labuan in September 1945. No.481 (Maintenance) Squadron {{was formed}} in December from {{elements}} of No.22 Repair and <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit,</b> No.25 Air Stores Park, and other units based on Labuan. No.381 (Base) Squadron, established in January 1946, also utilised personnel and equipment from No.81 Wing's specialist units at Labuan, including No.47 Operational Base Unit, No.24 Medical Clearing Station, No.25 Air Stores Park and No.2 Airfield Defence Squadron. RAAF base squadrons were administrative and logistical units, intended to make their wings self-supporting and mobile for potential deployment.|$|E
5|$|No. 482 Squadron was a {{maintenance}} {{unit of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). It was formed in May 1942 as No.4 Repair and Salvage Unit, renamed No.4 Repair and <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit</b> in January 1945 and re-formed as No.482 (Maintenance) Squadron in May 1946. The squadron then became a component of No.82 (Bomber) Wing at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland. Over the years it serviced the wing's Consolidated B-24 Liberators, Avro Lincolns, English Electric Canberras, McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms, and General Dynamics F-111Cs. No.482 Squadron merged with No.3 Aircraft Depot to form No.501 Wing in March 1992. No.501 Wing continued to provide maintenance and logistics support for the F-111Cs at Amberley until disbanding in 2001.|$|E

5|$|No. 4 Repair and Salvage Unit (RSU) {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, on 18May 1942. Its inaugural {{commanding}} officer, from 1June, was acting Flight Lieutenant H.R.P. Relf. On 20October, it commenced {{a move to}} Pell Airfield, Northern Territory, becoming operational on 26December. Coming {{under the control of}} North-Western Area Command (NWA), No.4 RSU was responsible for salvaging damaged aircraft, which it subsequently repaired or dismantled for spare parts. By December 1943, its strength was over 500 officers and men. It was renamed No.4 Repair and <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit</b> on 1January 1945, and re-located to Winnellie, Northern Territory, on 11May. As the war in the Pacific moved northward, No.4 RSU's strength was reduced; by August it was under 400, including 11 officers. On 15December 1945, it moved to RAAF Station Parkes, New South Wales. The unit re-located from Parkes to RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, on 15April 1946.|$|E
5|$|No. 82 Wing {{moved to}} its present {{location}} at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in 1946, {{where it came}} {{under the control of}} the RAAF's Eastern Area Command. In May that year, No.482 (Maintenance) Squadron was formed from No.4 Repair and <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit,</b> to be responsible for repair and upkeep of the wing's aircraft. Its flying complement now included Nos.12 (formerly of No.85 Wing), 21, and 23 Squadrons, but these were renumbered Nos.1, 2 and 6 Squadrons respectively in February 1948. At the same time, the wartime Liberators were replaced by Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. During 1949–50, some of the Lincolns were specially modified with advanced radar and other instrumentation to participate in Operation Cumulative, a joint program with the Royal Air Force gathering long-range navigation and bombing data for use in potential air campaigns against the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1944 the Kittyhawk-equipped No. 78 Wing {{was heavily}} engaged in {{supporting}} the American advance along the north coast of New Guinea and another Kittyhawk wing, No. 81, {{was in the process}} of preparing to deploy to this area. To reinforce these two wings, RAAF headquarters decided to disband Nos. 84 and 86 Squadrons. No. 84 Squadron was directed to move to Aitkenvale Aerodrome near Townsville, and its advance and main parties left Horn Island on 17 May and arrived at Aitkenvale four days later. On 12 June, before the squadron was fully disbanded but after all its aircraft had been transferred, the unit was advised that it was to remain active as a cadre with approximately 30 airmen. Two days later it was decided to re-raise No. 84 Squadron as an active unit. It moved to Macrossan Airfield, which was also near Townsville, on 22 June and began to receive new Kittyhawks on 25 August. On 17 November, No. 84 Squadron moved to Ross River, also in the Townsville area, and received more personal and aircraft from No. 86 Squadron, the recently disbanded No. 3 Repair and <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit</b> and First Tactical Air Force depots.|$|E

500|$|No. 81 Wing was {{slated to}} take part in Operation Oboe One, the {{invasion}} of Tarakan, in May 1945 but was unable to move in time from Noemfoor to its new base on Morotai in the Dutch East Indies; only No.76 Squadron played any part in the battle, undertaking patrols and convoy escort. [...] The following month, No.81 Wing flew close support missions for the Australian 9th Division in Operation Oboe Six, the invasion of Labuan. Along with its three Kittyhawk squadrons, the wing's order of battle included No.457 Squadron flying Spitfires, No.25 Air Stores Park, No.24 Medical Clearing Station, No.22 Repair and <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit,</b> No.9 Repair and <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit</b> Detachment, No.111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit, and seven Radar Stations—a total of over 2,000 personnel. Its commander on Morotai and Labuan was Group Captain Ian McLachlan. No.81 Wing was to have provided two squadrons in support of Operation Oboe Two, the assault on Balikpapan, in June but Tarakan airfield, from which it was to operate, was not ready in time. [...] The wing was still based on Labuan when the Pacific War ended in August 1945. Calls soon came to serve with the formation as part of the proposed Commonwealth occupation forces in Japan, and many personnel volunteered to do so.|$|E
500|$|Arthur {{retained}} {{command of}} No.78 Wing {{for the invasion}} of Tarakan, which commenced on 1May. Augmented by No.452 Squadron's Spitfires, the wing was a last-minute replacement for No.81 Wing—which had been delayed while moving its aircraft forward from Noemfoor and northern Australia—and had only ten days {{to prepare for the}} operation. As well as its flying squadrons, No.78 Wing's complement included No.114 Mobile Fighter Control Unit (No.114 MFCU), No.29 Air Stores Park, No.28 Medical Clearing Station, and No.11 Repair and <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit.</b> On 25May 1945, Arthur was succeeded by Wing Commander Alan Rawlinson. In June and July, the wing took part in the assaults on Labuan and Balikpapan, undertaking convoy escort in the former and, joined once more by No.452 Squadron, ground-attack missions and close support of the Australian 7th Division in the latter. During July it flew 858 sorties, dropping over [...] of bombs and expending almost 350,000 rounds of ammunition, for the loss of six aircraft and four pilots killed or missing.|$|E
2500|$|Retired {{air marshal}} Peter Dye, {{head of the}} RAF Museum, {{discussed}} the logistics of the battle in 2000 and 2010, dealing specifically with the single-seat fighters. Dye contends {{that not only was}} British aircraft production replacing aircraft, but replacement pilots were keeping pace with losses. The number of pilots in RAF Fighter Command increased during July, August and September. [...] The figures indicate the number of pilots available never decreased: from July 1,200 were available, and from 1 August, 1,400 were available. Just over that number were in the field by September. In October the figure was nearly 1,600. By 1 November 1,800 were available. Throughout the battle, the RAF had more fighter pilots available than the Luftwaffe. [...] Although the RAF's reserves of single seat fighters fell during July, the wastage was made up for by an efficient Civilian Repair Organisation (CRO), which by December had repaired and put back into service some 4,955 aircraft, and by aircraft held at Air <b>Servicing</b> <b>Unit</b> (ASU) airfields.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{consider}} districting problems for emergency service systems (such as ambulance systems). In such a service system, typically, N mobile <b>service</b> <b>units</b> cooperate {{in responding to}} calls from the public. The assignment of <b>service</b> <b>units</b> is determined by a priority order (such as the order of proximity) for the available <b>service</b> <b>units.</b> We divide the entire service area into several districts by considering the priority order. We give a general formulation for the districting problem and propose a model to obtain the objective for the formulation. The objective function of the formulation is the average response time computed from a stochastic model. The model assumes the continuous-time Markov chain with characteristic of random arrival of calls, assignment of a <b>service</b> <b>unit</b> considering the priority orders, service times depending {{on a combination of}} available <b>service</b> <b>units</b> and districts.
