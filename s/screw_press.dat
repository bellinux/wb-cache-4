25|$|The olive harvest {{took place}} from late autumn to the {{beginning}} of winter, either by hand or by pole. They were placed in wicker baskets and left to ferment for a few weeks before being pressed. The <b>screw</b> <b>press,</b> although referred to as the Greek press by Pliny the Elder (XVIII, 37) was a late (2nd century BCE) Roman invention. Oil was preserved in terra cotta vases for use later. This was also the time for pruning of trees and vines and harvesting of legumes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> {{which allowed}} direct {{pressure}} to be applied on flat-plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg's time and was used {{for a wide range}} of tasks. Introduced in the 1st century AD by the Romans, it was commonly employed in agricultural production for pressing wine grapes and (olive) oil fruit, both of which formed an integral part of the mediterranean and medieval diet. The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a cloth press for printing patterns. Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the paper presses which had spread through the German lands since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.|$|E
25|$|Screw press- Grapes {{are loaded}} into an input where a large helical screw {{transfers}} the grape across perforated cylinder {{that allows the}} release juice to escape. As screw moves further down, the cake pomace is subjected to increasing pressure. While the advantage is the high throughput, the harsh pressing and lots of movement causes substantial tearing and grinding of the grape skins and seeds. This causes more minerals (such as potassium, which can affect pH), tannins and natural gums to be extracted into the juice. As much as 4% v/v of the pressed juice from a <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> could be suspended solids that {{may need to be}} treated by clarification and fining agents to be stable and filterable.|$|E
50|$|Alcohol {{solutions}} are squeezed from foods with <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> (such as soybeans, protein, pectin, and xanthan gum.) Food processing factories use <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> to separate water from waste streams and convert the solid into animal feeds. For example, sugar beet pulp, orange peel, and spent grain.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interrupted}} flight design <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> uses were broadened {{from just}} soft or mushy materials to include most materials <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> {{were used for}} because unlike the continuous design <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> the interrupted flight design did not require constant feed or consistency of material. If either were diminished in the continuous design so would production of the dewatered product, {{in order to avoid}} this while maintaining the continuous flight design a larger and heavier press with variable speed settings was a necessity; the press also entailed the need of an operator.|$|R
5000|$|The {{buildup of}} press cake {{moisture}} {{is controlled by}} a discharge door or cone. <b>Screw</b> <b>presses</b> possess different options that include perforated/slotted screens, a rotating cone, hard surfacing on the screw, and supplemental screen surface in the inlet hopper {{on the face of}} the cone. The standard construction for <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> is of stainless steel with a carbon steel frame on the larger presses.|$|R
500|$|During Eckfeldt's childhood, the {{thirteen}} British colonies along the Atlantic coast {{of what is}} now the United States revolted, and so the United States of America secured its independence. [...] After the United States Constitution was ratified, Congress and many government offices came to be housed in Philadelphia, including the newborn [...] Mint of the United States. Adam Eckfeldt built the first <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> for the new facility in 1792, the same year that the Mint Act of 1792 was passed by Congress authorizing a mint, and cut the obverse die for the experimental Birch cent of that year. He also built other machinery for the Mint, and helped superintend the early coining.|$|E
500|$|The first silver dollars {{were struck}} on October 15, 1794. The silver {{used for the}} 1794 dollars came solely from silver ingots {{deposited}} with the Mint by Mint Director David Rittenhouse on August 22, 1794. [...] Per a handwritten coin transfer warrant issued by Director Rittenhouse on October 15, 1794, 1,758 silver dollars were transferred from the custody of Chief Coiner Henry Voigt to the custody of Mint Treasurer Dr. Nicholas Way. [...] Also on October 15th, per a handwritten coin return warrant issued by Director Rittenhouse, the 1,758 silver dollars were transferred from the custody of Mint Treasurer Dr. Nicholas Way to David Rittenhouse, as a partial coin return towards his August 22nd silver deposits. The 1,758 coins that were struck by Chief Coiner Henry Voigt, though acceptable, were poorly struck due to issues with the coining press that was used during early production at the Mint. [...] It was a man-powered <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> intended for use on coins {{no larger than a}} half dollar.|$|E
500|$|Peale {{returned}} from Europe with plans he had drawn for a steam-powered coinage press, borrowing the steam machinery design from English mints and the toggle joint technology from French ones. [...] In September, Patterson, by then Mint Director {{in place of}} the retired Moore, wrote to Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury, [...] "we have just completed under the superintendence of Mr. Peale, a model of a coining press from plans which he saw in successful operation in France and in Germany, and possessing many very manifest advantages over the <b>Screw</b> <b>press</b> now applied at the Mint. Among these {{one of the most important}} is that [...] admits the immediate and easy application of steam power." [...] Director Patterson called March 23, 1836 [...] "an epoch in our coinage". To take advantage of the new press's increased production capacity, Peale designed a new machine to cut planchets, or blanks, from metal strips. This machine remained in use, almost unmodified, until 1902.|$|E
50|$|Once {{they arrive}} in the wine sheds, the grapes are pressed. The process is carried out slowly {{in order to allow}} enough time for the must to be {{extracted}} from the virtually dried-out fruits. Even so, yields of juice are low. The use of machines which completely break down the grapes is prohibited, i.e. self-emptying tanks with combined rotor crushers and must pumps, continuous <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> and small diameter <b>screw</b> <b>presses.</b>|$|R

500|$|In 1792, the Mint {{acquired}} three balances from Eckfeldt, {{who also}} lent the Mint his lathe (used for turning dies). Eckfeldt {{is believed to}} have made the die from which the 1792 half disme, considered by some the first official U.S. coin, was struck—in 1829, a visitor to the Mint met Eckfeldt and later described him as [...] "an artist made the first die used in it". Other later accounts document Eckfeldt's role in this striking: [...] an 1863 auction sold a half disme supposedly given by Eckfeldt to demonstrate his work. Eckfeldt is given as the source for the tradition that the half dismes were struck at the request of President George Washington to be used as presents. Eckfeldt operated his <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> to strike these roughly 1,500 pieces on July 13, 1792. Since the first Philadelphia Mint was still under construction at the time, these coins were produced in the cellar of John Harper, saw maker, at Sixth and Cherry Streets in Philadelphia. [...] In his annual message to Congress late that year, Washington noted the ongoing construction of a mint building and stated: [...] "There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dismes, the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them." ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{building}} {{to house the}} Philadelphia Mint opened in 1833, with up-to-date technology except in the coining process. For this, it used the transplanted machinery of its predecessor, using human muscle power to strike coins. Although the Mint wanted all coins to be identical to others of the same denomination, {{the use of the}} <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> was an impediment to this, as the force used to impress the design on the coins was not uniform. [...] Additionally, the coinage dies were made by hand, leading to differences between coins of the same year struck from different dies. This state of affairs was unsatisfactory to the director, Samuel Moore, who had for several years contemplated purchasing a modern set of steam machinery for the production of coins from the Soho Mint in Birmingham, England, founded by coining pioneer Matthew Boulton. [...] Moore instead decided to engage a new employee and send him on a special tour of European mints and refineries, in order to learn the best features of each and bring the knowledge home for use at the Philadelphia facility. The individual would be given the title of Assistant to the Assayer, Jacob R. Eckfeldt. Moore obtained the approval of Treasury Secretary Louis McLane and an appropriation of $7,000 for the purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Impulse press- A {{modification}} of the <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> that aimed to {{limit the amount of}} movement of the grapes. The press first draws the screw back into the container as the grapes to be loaded in. Then the screw moves forward horizontally acting more like a [...] "battering ram" [...] than an auger by intermittently pushing the cake in [...] "impulses" [...] against {{the far end of the}} press. While producing slightly less phenolic press fraction, the disadvantage of this press is the decrease efficiency that is almost on par with batch presses.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two major}} kinds of <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> of this design. One type, known as Expellers ®, removes water from fibrous material, while the other removes free liquid from a material.|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} {{advantages of}} these characteristics led to interrupted <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> being used to dewater fibrous materials that are neither slippery nor slimy. Examples would be alfalfa, corn husk, and, more recently, paper mill fibers.|$|R

2500|$|Oils can {{be removed}} via {{mechanical}} extraction, termed [...] "crushing" [...] or [...] "pressing." [...] This method is typically used to produce the more traditional oils (e.g., olive, coconut etc.), and it is preferred by most [...] "health-food" [...] customers in the United States and in Europe. There are several different types of mechanical extraction. Expeller-pressing extraction is common, though the <b>screw</b> <b>press,</b> ram press, and Ghani (powered mortar and pestle) are also used. Oilseed presses are commonly used in developing countries, among people for whom other extraction methods would be prohibitively expensive; the Ghani is primarily used in India. The amount of oil extracted using these methods varies widely, {{as shown in the}} following table for extracting mowrah butter in India: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{improvement}} {{was based on}} reducing the surface area of a higher density composition. At {{the beginning of the}} 19th century, makers increased density further by static pressing. They shoveled damp mill cake into a two-foot square box, placed this beneath a <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> and reduced it to [...] its volume. [...] "Press cake" [...] had the hardness of slate. They broke the dried slabs with hammers or rollers, and sorted the granules with sieves into different grades. [...] In the United States, Eleuthere Irenee du Pont, who had learned the trade from Lavoisier, tumbled the dried grains in rotating barrels to round the edges and increase durability during shipping and handling. (Sharp grains rounded off in transport, producing fine [...] "meal dust" [...] that changed the burning properties.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{matrices}} for pendent seals {{were sometimes}} {{accompanied by a}} smaller counter-seal, which {{would be used to}} impress a small emblem on the reverse of the impression. In some cases the seal and counter-seal would be kept by two different individuals, in order to provide an element of double-checking to the process of authentication. Sometimes, a large official seal, which might be in the custody of chancery officials, would need to be counter-sealed by the individual in whose name it had been applied (the monarch, or the mayor of a town): such a counter-seal might {{take the form of a}} signet-ring, and so would be necessarily smaller. Other pendent seals were double-sided, with elaborate and equally-sized obverses and reverses. The impression would be formed by pressing a [...] "sandwich" [...] of matrices and wax firmly together by means of rollers or, later, a lever-press or a <b>screw</b> <b>press.</b> Certain medieval seals were more complex still, involving two levels of impression on each side of the wax which would be used to create a scene of three-dimensional depth.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the interaction between water and oleaginous seeds (rapeseed, flaxseed and sunflower) and its consequence on processing (pressing). Sorption isotherms of whole seeds, hulls and embryos were established and highlight the uniform behaviour of seed fractions towards water. Seed expression is highly influenced by seed moisture content and water activity in unidirectional and <b>screw</b> <b>presses.</b> Transposability of discontinuous pressing to continuous <b>screw</b> <b>presses</b> has been assessed. Seed mechanical properties are affected by water activity and moisture content. Moreover, fracturability evolution according to moisture content gives indication about oil yield dependency from water content and minimal elasticity corresponds to maximal oil yield for flaxseed. The relations established between sorption isotherms, drying behaviour, mechanical properties and pressing (unidirectional and continuous) leads to global view of water impact on seed processing...|$|R

2500|$|By the 2nd century AD, the Romans {{began using}} a [...] "screw press" [...] {{that would be}} the {{predecessor}} to the basket press that would become popular in the Middle Ages. This press would include a large beam with a hole cut out of the middle through which a screw was fitted through. Attached the base of the beam was a cut piece of stone that fit the circumference of a vat that was lined with porous clay or cloth. Ropes and pulleys attached to the beam would raise the beam and stone above the vat that would be loaded with grapes. Then six to eight workers (usually slaves) would be divided {{on either side of the}} screw. The workers would walk clockwise, turning the screw as it the stone descended upon the grapes, providing added pressure with each turn. A hole or spout at the bottom of the vat would allow the juice to drain out where it was usually bucket into amphorae or other large fermentation vessels. A replica of this style Roman <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> still exist at a winery in Beaucaire, Gard in the Languedoc wine region of France.|$|E
