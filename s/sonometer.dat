40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{mathematical}} and physical models {{to be used}} in the analysis of the problem of intonation of musical instruments such as guitars, mandolins and the like, i. e., we study how to improve the tuning on these instruments. This analysis begins by designing the placement of frets on the fingerboard according to mathematical rules and the assumption of an ideal string, but becomes more complicated when one includes the effects of deformation of the string and inharmonicity due to other string characteristics. As a consequence of these factors, perfect intonation of all the notes on the instrument can never be achieved, but complex compensation procedures are introduced and studied to minimize the problem. To test the validity of these compensation procedures, we have performed extensive measurements using standard monochord <b>sonometers</b> and other basic acoustical devices, confirming the correctness of our theoretical models. In particular, these experimental activities can be easily integrated into standard acoustics courses and labs, and can become a more advanced version of basic experiments with monochords and <b>sonometers.</b> Comment: Improved version, with minor changes. 25 pages, including 6 figures and 2 tables.

50|$|A {{clinical}} bone <b>sonometer,</b> {{approved for}} use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998, is a device which tests for the risk of bone fractures associated with osteoporosis. This test, called an ultrasound bone densitometry screening, is not typically used for diagnostic purposes; it is generally used as a risk assessment tool. Testing is often recommended for those whose personal history and lifestyle choices indicate a possible high risk for osteoporosis. Testing is usually conducted by an orthopedist, rheumatologist or neurologist specializing in the treatment of osteoporosis. The patient simply places his or her heel in the <b>sonometer,</b> and it is then scanned using ultrasound to determine bone density. This is a fast and low-cost procedure generally lasting 30 seconds or less. Results typically are available immediately following the procedure. Two score results are possible: a T-score, which compares a patient's scan against that of a young person of the same gender; and a Z-score, which compares the scan against someone of similar age, weight and gender. The T-scores results are used to assess the risk of osteoporosis. A score above -1 indicates a low risk for osteoporosis; below -1 to -2.5 indicates a risk of developing osteoporosis; and a score below -2.5 indicates more intensive testing should be performed and that osteoporosis is likely present. The Z-score reports how much bone the patient has as compared to others his age. If this number is high or low, further testing may be ordered.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} panoramic radiograph, a commonly taken dental radiograph as a screening tool to detect early osseous changes (normal, mildly or severely eroded) of the mandibular inferior cortex and measure the mandibular cortical width (CW) in post-menopausal women and correlate it with the bone mineral density (BMD) measured by the ultrasound bone <b>sonometer</b> at the mid-shaft tibia region. Materials and Methods: The study included females between 45 years and 65 years of age in their post-menopausal stage (no menstruation for at least 6 - 12 months). Mandibular indices (mandibular CW and mandibular cortical shape) were evaluated from panoramic radiographs. The BMD assessment was carried out at the mid-shaft tibia region, exactly half-way between the heel and the knee joint perpendicular to the direction of the bone, using an ultrasound bone <b>sonometer.</b> It is a non-invasive device designed for quantitative measurement of the velocity of ultrasound waves as "speed of sound" in m/s, capable of measuring bone density at one or more skeletal sites. Using 1994 WHO criteria the study subjects were categorized as Group 1 : Normal, Group 2 : Osteopenia, Group 3 : Osteoporosis. (WHO T score for tibia BMD can be used as a standard). Results: The diagnostic efficacy of the panoramic radiograph in detecting osseous changes in post-menopausal women with low BMD was shown to have 96 % specificity and 60 % sensitivity with mandibular cortical shape and 58 % specificity and 73 % sensitivity with mandibular CW measurement. Factorial ANOVA analysis carried out indicated a significant correlation of BMD classification with mandibular cortical shape (F = 29. 0, P < 0. 001, partial eta squared [η 2] = 0. 85), a non-significant correlation with mandibular CW, (F = 1. 6, P = 0. 23, η 2 = 0. 86), and a more significant correlation with combined cortical shape and width (F = 3. 3, P < 0. 05, η 2 = 0. 70). Conclusion: The study concludes that the combined mandibular cortical findings (P < 0. 05) and mandibular cortical shape erosion alone (P < 0. 001) on panoramic radiograph are effective indicators of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women...|$|E

Body weight, height, body mass index and percent body fat were measured. QUS parameters of the calcaneus were evaluated using Sahara Clinical Bone <b>Sonometer.</b> Diet assessment and daily intake of miligrams of calcium was obtained by a food frequency questionnaire. No statistically significant difference regarding QUS measurements between gymnasts and swimmers was observed in this study; but after adjusting for body weight, with covariance analyses, we found significant difference in calcaneal QUS measurements between gymnasts and swimmers, with higher values for gymnasts. There were no significant differences between groups for any of the dietary variables. In conclusion physical activity in childhood could be an important factor in bone mineral acquisition; this could provide protection against risks of osteoporosis in later life.

For proving the practical utility of the proposed platform, two induction motors of 7. 5 kW and 11 kW, respectively, in single-layer winding, at 1000 rpm, with IE 3 premium efficiency were analyzed. This analysis is required because, according to IEC 60034 - 30 standard, the IE 3 efficiency standard has become mandatory for induction motors of rated power greater than 7. 5 kW. Therefore, in order to improve the motor operating efficiency, the power losses caused by noises and vibrations have to be reduced. Several variants of supply were studied, i. e., by the three-phase 50 Hz network and by a three-phase inverter at 40, 50 and 60 Hz, respectively.

[Subjects and Methods] Twelve seniors voluntarily joined the VT training group, and twenty-seven seniors voluntarily joined the control group. The VT group received VT training for three months, while the control group received no training. The bone strength of the distal radius was assessed using an ultrasound bone <b>sonometer.</b> Muscular strength in the limbs was evaluated using a Jamar handgrip dynamometer and the five times sit-to-stand test. Shoulder joint mobility was examined using a goniometer. Balance performance and self-efficacy were evaluated using the Berg Balance Scale and the Chinese version of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, respectively. [Results] The results revealed a nonsignificant group-by-time interaction effect, group effect, and time effect for all outcome variables. However, general trends of maintenance or improvement in all outcome parameters were observed to a greater extent in the VT group than in the control group. [Conclusion] VT training might be a potential fall-prevention exercise that can be used to maintain general physique, balance, and confidence in the elderly population.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the feasibility of}} using Ving Tsun (VT) martial art as a fall-prevention exercise for male seniors. We compared the radial bone strength, hand-grip strength, and standing balance control of senior VT practitioners and nonpractitioners under various sensory environments. Sixteen male VT practitioners (mean age ± SD: 51. 3 ± 7. 8 years) and 17 sex- and age-matched control adults (mean age ± SD: 53. 7 ± 5. 9 years) participated in the study. The bone strength of the distal radius, hand-grip strength, and standing balance control were assessed using an ultrasound bone <b>sonometer,</b> a Jamar dynamometer, and sensory organization test (SOT) on the NeuroCom Balance Master, respectively. A {{multivariate analysis of variance}} (MANOVA) was used to compare the outcome variables between the two groups. Results revealed that VT practitioners had significantly higher radial bone strength (T-score) on the dominant side (P = 0. 015), hand-grip strength (dominant side, P = 0. 034; nondominant side, P = 0. 026), and standing balance control (SOT composite equilibrium score, P = 0. 005) than the control participants. Male elder VT practitioners had higher radial bone strength, hand-grip strength, and better standing balance control than nonpractitioners. Our findings shed light on the use of VT exercise to prevent falls and fall-related fractures of the distal radius in male elders. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} female cross country runners ' risk factors for stress fractures and future osteoporosis. Subjects for this study consisted of 16 female collegiate cross country runners (M = 19. 9 years, SD = 1. 54) at a Division III university. A nutrition assessment consisting of a 3 -day food record and measurements of height, weight, and heel bone density using a Sahara Clinical Bone <b>Sonometer</b> was conducted on each athlete. Each athlete was also asked several questions relating to factors that affect bone health including her ethnicity, menstrual history, and use ofmedications including supplements and birth control. This study found that essentially all of the female cross country runners in this study are from a high risk gender and ethnic group. This study revealed that 43. 25 % of the cross country runners had risk factors for osteoporosis based on their weight and dietary calcium intake. Twenty-five percent of the cross country runners experienced menstrual dysfunction in the past year which is a risk factor for stress fractures and osteoporosis. This study also revealed that alliii of thc cross country runners in this study had a normal heel bone mineral density T-score and that 81. 25 % ofthc cross country runners took a multivitamin and mineral supplement at leas...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. A {{number of}} {{previous}} studies have reported an inverse relationship between osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. However, the association has remained controversial because osteoarthritis in hand joints seems to associate differently from osteoarthritis in weight-bearing joints with bone mineral mass. We studied osteoarthritis in distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints and osteoarthritis {{in the base of}} the thumb (CMC- 1) for their cross-sectional associations with metacarpal cortical bone mineral mass, and for their prediction of calcaneal broadband ultrasound attenuation. Methods. A population sample of 8000 Finns aged 30 yr and over was invited to a comprehensive health examination in 1978 – 1980; 90 % complied. Hand radiographs were taken from 3568 participants to diagnose osteoarthritis in various hand joints, and to determine two indicators of cortical bone mineral mass, the combined cortical thickness (CCT) and the metacarpal index (MCI). Calcaneal broadband ultrasound attenuation was measured 20 yr later in 340 of these participants with the Sahara <b>sonometer.</b> Results. In the cross-sectional setting, osteoarthritis in the DIP joints and osteoarthritis in the base of the thumb (CMC- 1) were significantly associated with low CCT and low MCI. These associations were proportional to the radiological severity of osteoarthritis. In the follow-up setting, symmetrical DIP osteoarthritis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, education, workload and MCI significantly predicted low values of broadband ultrasound attenuation. Conclusions. Our results indicate a direct relation of both radiological DIP osteoarthritis and CMC- 1 osteoarthritis wit...|$|E
