40|$|We {{investigate}} secure routing in ad hoc {{networks in}} which <b>security</b> <b>associations</b> exist only between {{a subset of}} all pairs of nodes. We focus on source routing protocols. We show that to establish secure routes, it is in general not necessary that <b>security</b> <b>associations</b> exist between all pairs of nodes; a fraction of <b>security</b> <b>associations</b> is su#cient. We analyze the performance of existing proposals for secure routing in such conditions. We also propose a new protocol, designed specifically for ad hoc networks with an incomplete set of <b>security</b> <b>associations</b> between the nodes. We call this protocol BISS: a protocol for Building Secure Routing out of an Incomplete Set of <b>Security</b> <b>Associations.</b> We present {{a detailed analysis of}} this protocol, based on simulations, and show that it can be as secure as the existing proposals that rely on a complete set of <b>security</b> <b>associations...</b>|$|R
