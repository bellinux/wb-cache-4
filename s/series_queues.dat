40|$|Abstract—The use of buffer thresholds, {{blocking}} {{and adequate}} service strategies are well-known techniques for computer networks traffic congestion control. This motivates {{the study of}} <b>series</b> <b>queues</b> with blocking, feedback (service under Head of Line (HoL) priority discipline) and finite capacity buffers with thresholds. In this paper, the external traffic is modelled using the Poisson process and the service times have been modelled using the exponential distribution. We consider a three-station network with two finite buffers, for which a set of thresholds (tm 1 and tm 2) is defined. This computer network behaves as follows. A task, which finishes its service at station B, gets sent back to station A for re-processing with probability �. When the number of tasks in the second buffer exceeds a threshold tm 2 {{and the number of}} task in the first buffer is less than tm 1, the fed back task is served under HoL priority discipline. In opposite case, for fed backed tasks, “no two priority services in succession ” procedure (preventing a possible overflow in the first buffer) is applied. Using an open Markovian queuing schema with blocking, priority feedback service and thresholds, a closed form cost-effective analytical solution is obtained. The model of servers linked in series is very accurate. It is derived directly from a twodimensional state graph and a set of steady-state equations, followed by calculations of main measures of effectiveness. Consequently, efficient expressions of the low computational cost are determined. Based on numerical experiments and collected results we conclude that the proposed model with blocking, feedback and thresholds can provide accurate performance estimates of linked in series networks...|$|E

Di erent {{from the most}} popular twomoment based approximations in the literature, the higher order approximation uses the higher moments of the interarrival and service distributions in evaluating the performance measures for queueing networks. It is built upon the MacLaurin series analysis, a method that is recently developed to analyze single-node queues, along {{with the idea of}} decomposition using higher orders of the moments matched to a distribution. The approximation is computationally exible in that it can use as many moments of the interarrival and service distributions as desired and produce the corresponding moments for the waiting and interdeparture times. Therefore it {{can also be used to}} study several interesting issues that arise in the study of queueing network approximations, such as the e ects of higher moments and correlations. Numerical results for single server queues and tandem queueing networks show that this approximation is better than the two-moment based approximations in most cases.

30|$|PAQM [160], to {{the best}} of our knowledge, is the first {{approach}} using ML for improving AQM. Specifically, PAQM used OLS on time series of traffic samples (in bytes) for predicting future traffic volume. Based on such predictions, PAQM dynamically adjusted the packet dropping probability. The proposed OLS method relies on the normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm to calculate the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE). Through simulations, the authors demonstrated that their linear predictor achieves a good accuracy, enabling PAQM to enhance the stability of the queue length when compared to RED-based schemes. Therefore, PAQM is capable of providing high link utilization while incurring low packet loss. Similarly, APACE [212] configure the packet dropping probability by using a similar NLMS-based OLS on time <b>series</b> of <b>queue</b> lengths to predict the current queue length. Simulations show that APACE is comparable to PAQM in terms of prediction accuracy and queue stability, while providing better link utilization with lower packet loss and delay under multiple bottleneck links.

40|$|A {{cardiovascular}} {{care system}} {{can be regarded as}} a kind of queueing network, for units which own queues are con-nected to each other according to their temporal relation-ship (e. g., since a patient should register before he receiving the consultation in a hospital, there is a directed link from the appointment unit to the consultation unit). Previous re-searches about shortening long queues or long wait times often focus on some intuitionally impact factors, like limited resources, unpredictable patient behaviors and inefficient management policies in an isolated unit (e. g., emergency department), seldom consider the factors concealed among units in a queueing network. This paper will figure out that delay cascade, a small delay in one place resulted in long delays elsewhere, is an important factor which may leads to the covariance fluctuation of wait times among connected units. In this paper, we investigate delay cascade, or how de-lays disseminate from one unit to another in a cardiovas-cular care queueing network.

40|$|We propose an {{enhancement}} to the parametric-decomposition {{method for}} calculating approximate steady-state performance measures of open queueing networks with non-Poisson arrival processes and non-exponential service-time distributions. Instead {{of using a}} variability parameter c a 2 for each arrival process, we suggest using a variability function c a 2 (ρ), 0 < ρ < 1, for each arrival process; i. e., the variability parameter {{should be regarded as}} a function of the traffic intensity ρ of a queue to which the arrival process might go. Variability functions provide a convenient representation of different levels of variability in different time scales for arrival processes that are not nearly renewal processes. Variability functions enable the approximations to account for long-range effects in queueing networks that cannot be addressed by variability parameters. For example, the variability functions provide a way to address the heavy-traffic bottleneck phenomenon, in which exceptional variability (either high or low) in the input has little impact in a <b>series</b> of <b>queues</b> with low-to-moderate traffic intensities, and then has a big impact when it reaches a later queue with a relatively high traffic intensity. The variability functions also enable the approximations to characterize irregular periodic deterministic external arrival processes in a reasonable way; i. e., if there are no batches, then c a 2 (ρ) should be 0 for ρ near 0 or 1, but c a 2 (ρ) can assume arbitrarily large values for appropriate intermediate ρ. We present a full network algorithm with variability functions, showing that the idea is implementable. We also show how simulations of single queues can be effectively exploited to determine variability functions for difficult external arrival processes.

METHODS The study uses a hybrid model combining time <b>series</b> and <b>queuing</b> theory to predict the demand and {{estimate the}} number of required beds. Four patient flow scenarios were considered according to bed requests, percentage of abandonments and average length of stay in intensive care unit beds. The results were plotted against Ministry of Health parameters. Data were obtained from the State Regulation Center from 2010 to 2011. RESULTS There were 33, 101 medical requests for 268 regulated intensive care unit beds in Rio de Janeiro. With an average length of stay in regulated ICUs of 11. 3 days, there would be a need for 595 active beds to ensure system stability and 628 beds to ensure a maximum waiting time of six hours. Deducting current abandonment rates due to clinical improvement (25. 8 %), these figures fall to 441 and 417. With an average length of stay of 6. 5 days, the number of required beds would be 342 and 366, respectively; deducting abandonment rates, 254 and 275. The Brazilian Ministry of Health establishes a parameter of 118 to 353 beds. Although the number of regulated beds is within the recommended range, an increase in beds of 122. 0 % is required to guarantee system stability and of 134. 0 % for a maximum waiting time of six hours. CONCLUSIONS Adequate bed estimation must consider reasons for limited timely access and patient flow management in a scenario that associates prioritization of requests with the lowest average length of stay...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We develop {{performance}} approximations {{that can}} help manage the pace of play in golf. In previous work we developed a stochastic model of successive groups of golfers playing on an 18 -hole golf course and derived expressions for the capacity (maximum possible throughput) of each hole and the golf course as a whole. That model captures the realistic feature that, on most holes, more than one group can be playing at the same time, with precedence constraints. We now facilitate further performance analysis with that model by developing two new approximations. First, we develop an approximation involving a series of conventional single-server queues, without precedence constraints. The key idea {{is to use the}} times between successive departures on a fully loaded hole as aggregate service times in the new model. Second, we apply established heavy-traffic limits for a <b>series</b> of conventional <b>queues</b> to develop explicit approximation formulas for the mean and variance of the time required for group n to play the entire course, as a function of n.
