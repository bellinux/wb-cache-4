5|$|A {{surface is}} more {{wettable}} when γLV and θ is low. Zisman termed the intercept of these lines when cos θ = 1, as the critical <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> (γc) of that surface.

5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} contact angle is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> is exactly equal to the liquid–air <b>surface</b> <b>tension.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>tension</b> is {{the elastic}} {{tendency}} of a fluid surface {{which makes it}} acquire the least surface area possible. <b>Surface</b> <b>tension</b> allows insects (e.g. water striders), usually denser than water, to float and stride on a water surface.|$|E
40|$|A semiempirical {{model is}} {{presented}} that predicts <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> (s) of aqueous electrolyte solutions and their mixtures, for concentrations ranging from infinitely dilute solution to molten salt. The model requires, at most, only two temperature-dependent terms to represent <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> of either pure aqueous solutions, or aqueous or molten mixtures, {{over the entire}} composition range. A relationship was found for the coefficients of the equation s = c 1 + c 2 T (where T (K) is temperature) for molten salts in terms of ion valency and radius, melting temperature, and salt molar volume. Hypothetical liquid <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> can thus be estimated for electrolytes for {{which there are no}} data, or which do not exist in molten form. <b>Surface</b> <b>tensions</b> of molten (single) salts, when extrapolated to normal temperatures, were found to be consistent with data for aqueous solutions. This allowed <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> of very concentrated, supersaturated, aqueous solutions to be estimated. The model has been applied to the following single electrolytes over the entire concentration range, using data for aqueous solutions over the temperature range 233 - 523 K, and extrapolated <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> of molten salts and pure liquid electrolytes: HCl, HNO 3, H 2 SO 4, NaCl, NaNO 3, Na 2 SO 4, NaHSO 4, Na 2 CO 3, NaHCO 3, NaOH, NH 4 Cl, NH 4 NO 3, (NH 4) 2 SO 4, NH 4 HCO 3, NH 4 OH, KCl, KNO 3, K 2 SO 4, K 2 CO 3, KHCO 3, KOH, CaCl 2, Ca(NO 3) 2, MgCl 2, Mg(NO 3) 2, and MgSO 4. The average absolute percentage error between calculated and experimental <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> is 0. 80 % (for 2389 data points). The model extrapolates smoothly to temperatures as low as 150 K. Also, the model successfully predicts <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> of ternary aqueous mixtures; the effect of salt-salt interactions in these calculations was explored...|$|R

5|$|The {{surface of}} any liquid is an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. <b>Surface</b> <b>tension,</b> then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> with the walls of a container.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} which {{allows us to}} accurately calculate the <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> and the <b>surface</b> potentials of electrolyte solutions. Both the ionic hydration and the polarizability are taken into account. We find a good correlation between the Jones-Dole viscosity $B$-coefficient and the ionic hydration near the air-water interface. The kosmotropic anions such as fluoride, iodate, sulfate and carbonate, {{are found to be}} strongly hydrated and are repelled from the interface. The chaotropic anions such as perchlorate, iodide, chlorate and bromide are found to be significantly adsorbed to the interface. Chloride and bromate anions become weakly hydrated in the interfacial region. The sequence of <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> and <b>surface</b> potentials is found to follow the Hofmeister ordering.

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>tensions,</b> {{critical}} micelle concentrations (CMCs), {{contact angles}} on hydrophobic polyethylene, and foaming characteristics of phosphatidic acids, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and phosphatidylglycerols were measured {{to determine their}} suitability as substitutes for traditional surfactants. These phospholipids have fatty acid chains of 5 to 12 carbon atoms, a range over which they are soluble at room temperature. Their <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> decrease with increasing concentrations until their CMCs are reached, above which their plateau <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> are as low as 21 mN/m, indicating excellent surface activities. In general, plateau <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> decrease with increasing chain length within each phospholipid type. The classical relationship for In CMC vs. chain length is followed with slopes typical of anionic surfactants for phosphatidic acids and phosphatidylglycerols and resembling zwitterionic surfactants for phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines, consistent with the charge on the hydrophilic group. The wetting capabilities of aqueous solutions on polyethylene are good and foam heights and stabilities are high, the latter two properties being comparable to traditional anionic (sodium dodecylsulfate) and nonionic (octylphenol polyethoxylate) surfactants. Some anomalies are observed regarding the effect of chain length on wetting and foaming, {{probably due to the}} depletion effect. Many phospholipids slowly degrade in aqueous solution. We conclude that short-chain phospholipids exhibit excellent surfactant properties and may be useful in many applications...|$|R
