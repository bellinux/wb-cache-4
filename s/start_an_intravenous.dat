5000|$|Glucagon is {{a hormone}} that rapidly {{counters}} the metabolic effects of insulin in the liver, causing glycogenolysis and release of glucose into the blood. It {{can raise the}} glucose by 30-100 mg/dL within minutes in any form of hypoglycemia caused by insulin excess (including all types of diabetic hypoglycemia). It comes in a glucagon emergency rescue kit which includes tiny vials containing 1 mg, which is a standard adult dose. The glucagon in the vial is a lyophilized pellet, which must be reconstituted with 1 mL of sterile water, included in the [...] "kit". In the widely used Lilly Emergency Kit, the water is contained in a syringe with a large needle for intramuscular injection and must be injected into the vial with the pellet of glucagon before being injected. Glucagon works if given subcutaneously, but absorption and recovery are faster if it is injected deep into a muscle (usually {{the middle of the}} outside of the thigh). It has an even more rapid effect when given intravenously but this is rarely practicable. Side effects of glucagon can include nausea and headache, but these can also occur after severe hypoglycemia even when glucagon is not used. Risks of glucagon use are far lower than risks of severe hypoglycemia, and it can usually produce a faster recovery than calling for paramedics and waiting for them to <b>start</b> <b>an</b> <b>intravenous</b> line to give dextrose. If someone uses this kit, they should be seen in an emergency room, as glucagon depletes glycogen stores, and can lead to a deadly rebound hypoglycemia.|$|E

There was received the statistically significant increase of clindamycin concentration in CSF of patients in a day after combined (intrathecal + intravenous) administration of preparation comparing with <b>an</b> <b>intravenous</b> administration. Conclusions. 1. Intrathecal administration of 150 mg. of clindamycin with 8 mg. of dexamethasone is safe. 2.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To analyse anthropometric and {{metabolic}} {{characteristics as}} {{risk factors for}} development of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in middle aged normoglycaemic men. DESIGN [...] Prospective population study based on data collected in a health survey and follow up 10 years later. SETTING [...] Uppsala, a middle sized city in Sweden. SUBJECTS [...] 2322 men aged 47 - 53, of whom 1860 attended the follow up 7 - 14 years later, at which time they were aged 56 - 64. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Incidence of non-insulin dependent diabetes. RESULTS [...] In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, variations of 1 SD from {{the mean of the}} group that remained euglycaemic were used to calculate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Blood glucose concentration 60 minutes after the <b>start</b> of <b>an</b> <b>intravenous</b> glucose tolerance test (odds ratio = 5. 93, 95 % confidence interval 3. 05 to 11. 5), fasting serum insulin concentration (2. 12, 1. 54 to 2. 93), acute insulin increment at <b>an</b> <b>intravenous</b> glucose tolerance test (1. 71, 1. 21 to 2. 43), body mass index (1. 41, 1. 01 to 1. 97), and systolic blood pressure (1. 23, 0. 97 to 1. 56) were independent predictors of diabetes. In addition, the use of antihypertensive drugs at follow up (selective or unselective beta blocking agents, thiazides, or hydralazine) was an independent risk factor (1. 70, 1. 11 to 2. 60).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although sepsis is a {{major health}} problem, data on sepsis {{epidemiology}} are scarce. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the incidence of sepsis, based on clinical findings in all adult patients treated with intravenous antibiotic in all parts of all hospitals in an entire population. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of patients ≥ 18 years, living in 2 regions in Sweden, who were <b>started</b> on <b>an</b> <b>intravenous</b> antibiotic therapy on 4 dates, evenly distributed over the year of 2015. The main outcome was the incidence of sepsis with organ dysfunction. The mean population ≥ 18 years at 2015 in the regions was 1275753. Five hundred sixty-three patients living in the regions were started on intravenous antibiotic treatment on the dates of the survey. Patients who had ongoing intravenous antibiotic therapy preceding the inclusion dates were excluded, if sepsis was already present. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-two patients were included in the study; 339 had a diagnosed infection, of those, 96 had severe sepsis according to the 1991 / 2001 sepsis definitions, and 109 had sepsis according to the sepsis- 3. This is equivalent to an annual incidence of traditional severe sepsis of 687 / 100000 persons (95 % confidence interval [CI], 549 - 824) or according to the sepsis- 3 definition of 780 / 100000 persons (95 % CI, 633 - 926). Seventy-four patients had sepsis according to both definitions. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of sepsis with organ dysfunction is higher than most previous estimates independent of definition. The inclusion of all inpatients started on intravenous antibiotic treatment of sepsis in a population makes an accurate assessment of sepsis incidence possible...|$|R
