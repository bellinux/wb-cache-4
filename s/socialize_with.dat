The camera fades to Lauren, who sings the bridge as she stands next to a background of rocks, as a take of another man is shown. The group is then scattered in different spots standing in a large rock formation, where shots of Dinah alone are spliced as she sings the chorus. Normani shares the chorus, as she sings on top of the rock cliff, shown earlier in the video. Camila seductively lays down and grabs her hair, in similarity to Ally.

5|$|An {{important}} feature that distinguished Maqam al-Khawwas from the Deir Ghassaneh mosque {{was that it}} acted primarily as a women's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain. In the pre-British Mandate era, it was frequented by women {{on a daily basis}} and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as mawsim al-banat. During this pilgrimage, which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage, a largely male affair, large groups of women and children from the villages of Bani Zeid would visit the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities, <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> other women and pray. According to Palestinian architecture expert Suad Amiry, Maqam al-Khawwas's isolation and the ritual of having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit.|$|E
5|$|Women in Washington social circles led by Floride Calhoun, {{the wife}} of Vice President John C. Calhoun, snubbed the Eatons because they married so soon after John Timberlake's death, rather than waiting for the usual {{mourning}} period; there were stories that Eaton and Peggy Timberlake had been having an affair before John Timberlake had died. Rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> the Eatons. They refused to attend social events at which she would be present. According to Emily Donelson, Eaton considered resigning in {{the first months of}} the administration.|$|E

5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting.|$|E

25|$|Gay travel {{destinations}} {{are popular}} among practitioners of gay tourism because they usually have permissive or liberal attitudes towards gays, feature a prominent gay infrastructure (bars, businesses, restaurants, hotels, nightlife, entertainment, media, organisations, etc.), {{the opportunity to}} <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> other gays, and the feeling that one can relax safely among other gay people.|$|E

25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter {{what goes on in the}} surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.|$|E
25|$|The {{sensitive}} caregiver responds socially to {{attempts to}} initiate social interaction, playfully to {{his attempts to}} initiate play. She picks him up when he seems to wish it, and puts him down {{when he wants to}} explore. When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> the baby when he is hungry, play with him when he is tired, or feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of his}} recovery, Dr. Jacobson advised Munch to only <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> {{good friends}} and avoid {{drinking}} in public. Munch followed this advice {{and in the process}} produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons—honest portrayals devoid of flattery. He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style—broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black—with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income, Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.|$|E

25|$|When Atta was ten, {{his family}} moved to the Cairo {{neighborhood}} of Abdeen, located {{near the center of the}} city. Atta's father continued to keep the family private, and did not allow Atta to <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> other neighborhood children. Atta spent most of his time at home studying, and he excelled in school. In 1985, Atta entered Cairo University, where he studied engineering. Atta was one of the highest-scoring students, and during his senior year he was admitted into the very selective architecture program. In 1990, Atta graduated with a degree in architecture and joined the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Engineers Syndicate organization. He then worked for several months at the Urban Development Center in Cairo, where he undertook tasks on architectural, planning, and building design. In 1990, Atta's family moved into an 11th floor apartment in Giza.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Berdella was intelligent, but {{a classic}} loner who rarely played outside his own home, and seldom had friends visit his home to <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> him. He was also {{severely}} nearsighted (resulting in his {{being required to}} wear thick glasses {{from the age of}} five) and afflicted with a slight speech impediment. Furthermore, as a child, he would be diagnosed as suffering from a high blood pressure, for which he was prescribed several medications. In part because of this diagnosis, Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel (b. 1956), displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure on Berdella's part, and would often compare him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father would also become physically and emotionally abusive against his children, and is known to have beaten them with a leather strap.|$|E
25|$|In a 1995 Washington Post article, Jim Marks cited Bawer's {{observation}} that (in Marks's paraphrase) “it gets harder {{to claim that}} {{gay men and lesbians}} are outside mainstream culture, when so much of mainstream culture—the Mona Lisa and Moby-Dick, to use Bawer's examples—is seen as the product of gay and lesbian minds.” In a 1996 piece on gay marriage, New York Times columnist Frank Rich cited Bawer's view that there existed “a gentlemen's agreement” among Washington conservatives. He quoted Bawer as saying: “They say 'We'll <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> you and your significant other and we'll all be charming, as long as you don't mention it in public, and we get to say anything we want in public.'” A 1997 Washington Post article about an upcoming episode of Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, “Ellen,” on which her character would come out of the closet, mimicking DeGeneres's own recent coming out, ended with a quote from Bawer. “People used to do courageous things without having a publicist around to tell the world,” he said.|$|E

500|$|When an {{orangutan}} {{reaches the}} age of two, its climbing skills improve and it will travel through the canopy holding hands with other orangutans, a behaviour known as [...] "buddy travel". Orangutans are juveniles from about {{two to five years}} of age and will start to temporarily move away from their mothers. Juveniles are usually weaned at about four years of age. Adolescent orangutans will <b>socialize</b> <b>with</b> their peers while still having contact with their mothers. Typically, orangutans live for over 30years in both the wild and captivity.|$|E
