5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} exist in formal oxidation states other than +4 or +2. Lead(III) may be obtained, {{as an intermediate}} between lead(II) and lead(IV), in larger organolead complexes; this oxidation <b>state</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> stable as both the lead(III) ion and the larger complexes containing it are radicals. The same applies for lead(I), {{which can be found}} in such species.|$|E

However, switching between enabled and sleep states is much faster than switching between enabled and suspended states, which allows devices to sleep while idle.|$|E

In striking down New York's burden, the Court utilized the Mathews test to determine what burden of proof was due.|$|E

5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 <b>state</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> observed {{in many other}} actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 <b>state</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.|$|E
5|$|Article 15 prohibits {{discrimination}} on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals, with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds. However, the <b>State</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived {{and in need of}} special protection. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence or any of them. It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service, as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion.|$|E

5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a <b>state</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E

25|$|Controllability and {{observability}} are main {{issues in}} the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a <b>state</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> controllable, then no signal {{will ever be able to}} control the state. If a <b>state</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable. Observability instead is related to the possibility of observing, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a <b>state</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.|$|E
