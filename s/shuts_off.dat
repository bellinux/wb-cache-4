5|$|Begun in 1292, the Anglican parish {{church of}} St John the Baptist {{gradually}} evolved until taking its present general form {{during the reign}} of Charles II, after the tower collapsed into the building during a storm in 1632. The tower, built over the north-east corner of the nave, now rises in three stages over the Western entrance and is surmounted by a pierced parapet and short croketted pinnacles and {{is said to have been}} built from the ruins of the abbey church. The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of the abbey, was rebuilt in 1470 and further restoration was carried out in 1634–1655, following the collapse of the tower. There is a pulpit dating from 1634 and is also a screen of the same age which <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> the choir vestry. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{was carried}} out to {{diagnose}} faults in an automotive engine using acoustic emission method. Proton Persona’s engine, which is a four cylinder engine, powered by 1. 6 liters double overhead camshaft (DOHC) with two different locations (Point A and Point B) marked {{was used as the}} main test-rig. There were three tests conducted for this project, the pencil-break test, engine under idle condition and engine under fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition. Pencil-break test is performed in order to check the most suitable material to be used as medium to transfer the signals. The source of the Acoustic Emission (AE) signals was from the condition where the fuel injector was <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> when the engine is running, and it was captured using AE sensor with the help from Physical Acoustic AE-win 3. 1 software. For engine under idle and <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition, all the domain parameters (RMS amplitude, peak amplitude and energy) was processed using MATLAB software. The parameters were then compared between idle and <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition for each fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off.</b> The results shows that the different of AE parameters between Point A and Point B, where Point B shows higher value than Point A in idle condition and also under fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition. During <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition, the RMS amplitude, peak amplitude and energy produced higher energy level compare to idle condition. This indicates defects or faults occurred. In addition, Pekan number, X was introduced as the indicator or ratio of value before fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> to value during fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off...</b>|$|R

25|$|The early {{proteins}} transcribed {{are used}} in the regulation of genetic replication of the virus.

25|$|In 1993, a {{different}} model called the opponent process model was proposed. This model explained {{that these two}} processes opposed each other to produce sleep, as against Borbely's model. According to this model, the SCN, which {{is involved in the}} circadian rhythm, enhances wakefulness and opposes the homeostatic rhythm. In opposition is the homeostatic rhythm, regulated via a complex multisynaptic pathway in the hypothalamus that acts like a switch and <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> the arousal system. Both effects together produce a see-saw like effect of sleep and wakefulness. More recently, it has been proposed that both models have some validity to them, while new theories hold that inhibition of NREM sleep by REM could also play a role. In any case, the two process mechanism adds flexibility to the simple circadian rhythm and could have evolved as an adaptive measure.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cylinder}} valves {{are currently}} of the K-valve type, {{which is a}} simple manually operated screw-down on-off valve. In the mid-1960s, J-valves were widespread. J-valves contain a spring-operated valve that is restricts or <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> flow when tank pressure falls to 300-500 psi, causing breathing resistance and warning the diver {{that he or she}} is dangerously low on air. The reserve air is released by pulling a reserve lever on the valve. J-valves fell out of favor with the introduction of pressure gauges, which allow divers to keep track of their air underwater, especially as the valve-type is vulnerable to accidental release of reserve air and increases the cost and servicing of the valve. J-valves are occasionally still used when work is done in visibility so poor that the pressure gauge cannot be seen, even with a light.|$|E

In addition, all cells are soundproofed to prevent prisoners from communicating with each other via Morse code.|$|E

25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath {{to remove heat}} and keep them cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system <b>shuts</b> <b>off.</b> When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|E

500|$|The {{structural}} {{domain of}} cTnC (cCTnC) is anchored to troponin I and T, forming the so-called IT arm, {{made up of}} cTnC93-161, cTnI41-135 and cTnT235-286 (in the cardiac complex). cCTnC binds to helical cTnI41-60 via its large hydrophobic patch, stabilizing the Ca2+-bound open conformation of cCTnC and enhancing its affinity for Ca2+ (from Kd = 40 nM to Kd = 3 nM). cTnT235-286 forms a helical coiled coil with cTnI88-135 that binds to the opposite face of cCTnC. The IT arm is anchored to tropomyosin via adjacent segments of cTnT, so it is believed to move as a unit along with tropomyosin throughout the cardiac cycle. In the low calcium environment present during diastole (~100 nM), tropomyosin is anchored into the [...] "blocked" [...] position along the actin thin filament through the binding of the troponin I inhibitory (cTnI128-147) and C-terminal (cTnI160-209) regions.
