5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> flerovium's 7s27p {{valence electron}} configuration, the 0 oxidation state {{should also be}} more stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{work is a}} {{first attempt}} to address {{efficient}} <b>stabilizations</b> <b>of</b> high dimensional advection-diffusion models encountered in computational physics. When addressing multidimensional models, the use of mesh-based discretization fails because the exponential increase {{of the number of}} degrees of freedom related to a multidimensional mesh or grid, and alternative discretization strategies are needed. Separated representations involved in the so-called proper generalized decomposition method are an efficient alternative as proven in our former works; however, the issue related to efficient <b>stabilizations</b> <b>of</b> multidimensional advection-diffusion equations has never been addressed to our knowledge. Thus, this work is aimed at extending some well-experienced stabilization strategies widely used in the solution of 1 D, 2 D, or 3 D advection-diffusion models to models defined in high-dimensional spaces, sometimes involving tens of coordinates.

5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> the main laser.

5|$|Under Vasili III Moscow {{fought a}} war with Lithuania and Poland between 1512 and 1522, during which in 1514 the Russians took Smolensk. That same year the Polish-Lithuanian rescue {{expedition}} fought the victorious Battle of Orsha under Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski and stopped the Duchy of Moscow's further advances. An armistice implemented in 1522 left Smolensk land and Severia in Russian hands. Another round of fighting took place during 1534–1537, when the Polish aid led by Hetman Jan Tarnowski made possible the taking of Gomel and fiercely defeated Starodub. New truce (Lithuania kept only Gomel), <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> the border and over two decades of peace followed.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium {{should be}} a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.7g/cm3 in the solid state; in comparison, the most dense known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from copernicium's high atomic weight, the {{lanthanide}} and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough copernicium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. However, some calculations predict copernicium to be a gas at room temperature, the first gaseous metal in the periodic table (the second being flerovium), due to the closed-shell electron configurations of copernicium and flerovium. The atomic radius of copernicium {{is expected to be}} around 147pm. Due to the relativistic <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Cn+ and Cn2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E

5|$|Due to the <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> {{its outer}} 8s electrons, unbinilium's first {{ionization}} energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 6.0eV, {{comparable to that}} of calcium. The electron of the hydrogen-like unbinilium atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ubn119+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 2.05 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like radium is 1.30 and the figure for hydrogen-like barium is 1.095. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 200pm, very close to that of strontium (215pm); the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is also correspondingly lowered to 160pm. The trend in electron affinity is also expected to reverse direction similarly at radium and unbinilium.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E
5|$|Interest in copernicium's {{chemistry}} was {{sparked by}} predictions {{that it would}} have the largest relativistic effects in the whole of period7 and group12, and indeed among all 118 known elements. Copernicium has the ground state electron configuration 5f146d107s2 and thus should belong to group12 of the periodic table, according to the Aufbau principle. As such, it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold. Experiments probing the reactivity of copernicium have focused on the adsorption of atoms of element112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures, in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy. Owing to relativistic <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> the 7s electrons, copernicium shows radon-like properties. Experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes, allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics.|$|E
