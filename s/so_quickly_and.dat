New head coach Jeff Tedford was praised for turning the program around <b>so</b> <b>quickly,</b> <b>and</b> expectations were high heading into the 2003 season.

5|$|Universal {{sold the}} film to PRC for $125,000, which {{represented}} the negative cost plus interest. The transaction occurred around August 1946, but was not made public until it was screened for the trade press on October1, marking its official release date. The sale occurred <b>so</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> hastily on the copyright files stores at the Library of Congress, the name Universal Pictures was crossed out and Pathe Industries, PRC's corporate body, was written in its place in pencil. Some pressbook advertisements circulated for the film still included the Universal Pictures logo.

An apparent deal was in place to move the team to Vancouver, but the NHL {{did not want to}} see one of their franchises from the expansion of 1967 move <b>so</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> vetoed the deal. In exchange for avoiding a lawsuit, the NHL promised Vancouver would get a team in the next expansion. Another group, headed by Minnesota entrepreneur Tom Scallen, made a new presentation and was awarded an expansion franchise for the price of $6million (three times the cost in 1967). The new ownership group purchased the WHL Canucks, and brought the team into the league with the Buffalo Sabres as expansion teams for the 1970–71 season.|$|E
25|$|Unlike these earlier shows, Moonlighting {{sometimes}} {{broke the}} fourth wall {{in much more}} involved and complex ways. Cold opens sometimes featured Shepherd and Willis (in character as Maddie Hayes and David Addison), other actors, viewers, or TV critics directly addressing the audience about the show's production itself. These cold opens were originally born out of desperation {{as a way to}} fill air time, since the dialogue on the show was spoken <b>so</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> the producers needed something to fill the entire hour. In some other episodes, the plot suddenly changed into extended sequences that involved crew dismantling or changing the sets, characters wandering off the set into other parts of the studio, production crew stepping into the scene as a deus ex machina (e.g. a propmaster suddenly walking into the scene and taking the villain's gun away), or guest actors dropping character and referring to each other by their real names. However, other than in stand-alone openings, the main actors never stepped out of character during the episodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} short: {{in the morning}} of the same day the Byzantines {{attacked}} and the squad of Aplakes engaged the Bulgarians first. It managed to inflict some casualties to the Bulgarians but from the very beginning most of the Byzantines were so frightened that they did not even engage their enemy. The Byzantines could not withstand even the first Bulgarian counter-attack and when Khan Krum advanced with the Bulgarian heavy cavalry against the left flank of Byzantines they immediately ran away. The Anatolian squad was the first to flee followed by the entire army. The soldiers of Aplakes were left behind and most of them perished, including their commander. The battle took place in a valley and when the Bulgarians saw the retreating enemy which was in the higher positions they at first suspected a trap. In fact they also did not expect to achieve success <b>so</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> at first did not chase them. But when the Bulgarians were certain that the enemy was fleeing in panic, their heavy cavalry rushed after the Byzantines. Many of them perished during the flight, others hid in different fortresses which were taken by the Bulgarians one by one and the rest managed to reach Constantinople. The chief commanders of Byzantine army, including the Emperor Michael I Rangabe and Leo the Armenian, were the first to abandon the battlefield. The Bulgarians took the Byzantine camp and a rich prize including gold and weaponry.|$|E

Commentators have noted that the song and its accompanying video, both now considered modern pop classics, served as a wonderful introduction to the band. The Metro's Jon O’Brien concluded that: “From its lyrical themes of female solidarity to its insanely catchy pop hooks and mischief-making promo, the worldwide chart-topper encapsulated everything that made the group so spellbinding {{in the space of}} just two minutes and 52 seconds.” Digital Spy's Lewis Corner agreed, adding: [...] "It's hard to imagine any other pop act managing to make this much of an impact <b>so</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> effortlessly ever again." ...|$|E

With the deadline looming, Hendrix, Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session, but they could not match the quality of the lost mix of [...] "If 6 Was 9". Bassist Noel Redding had a tape recording of this mix, which had to be smoothed out with an iron as it had gotten wrinkled. During the verses, Hendrix doubled his singing with a guitar line which he played one octave lower than his vocals.

Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times said he {{was initially}} skeptical of the Robin and Katherine romance subplot, but said he liked how it was presented. [...] "It wasn’t contrived like other girl-on-girl scenes on television that we see. ... I just hate it when it’s used to seem 'edgy' or to sell an episode, and I hope that isn't the case here." [...] Kennedy said the Bree and Orson scenes led to [...] "a tender moment", but said Susan was annoying and the Lynette plotline was somewhat insulting toward women. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad {{said he was}} surprised Robin's back story was fleshed out <b>so</b> <b>quickly,</b> <b>and</b> speculated {{it could lead to}} a permanent role in the series. Carreau said the pairing of Robin and Katherine could be [...] "very interesting", and that {{the best part of the}} episode was the comical conversation between Robin and Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) at the end.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} by Kurt's storyline in {{the episode}} [...] "Never Been Kissed". NPR Linda Holmes found it [...] "absurd" [...] that a teenager as deeply in denial as Karofsky would transition from bullying to kissing Kurt <b>so</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> {{described it as}} [...] "emotionally and behaviorally unsound". Leah Anthony Libresco of the Huffington Post called the episode [...] "extraordinarily counterproductive", and disapproved of Will treating Kurt's upset as the key problem, rather than the unchecked bullying provoking it. She found Blaine's advice to Kurt [...] "misleading and dangerous", especially the suggestion that targeted children should {{be held responsible for}} confronting their attackers and putting themselves at risk of further injury, rather than for protecting themselves. Poniewozik noted that the storyline was inherently flawed, as the show had previously treated bullying in a light-hearted rather than serious manner, but said that its saving grace was the focus it placed on Colfer: [...] "probably the strongest actor with the most interesting character among the Glee kids".|$|E

The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened <b>so</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece.

[...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called Scar a [...] "delectably wicked" [...] villain. Maslin went on to praise Irons' voice acting, writing that the actor [...] "slithers through the story in grandiose high style, with a green-eyed malevolence {{that is one of}} film's chief delights." [...] Leah Rozen of People described Scar as [...] "a flawless realization of Irons' special talent." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune lauded Scar as the film's [...] "best character," [...] jokingly describing him as [...] "Irons' Claus von Bulow with fur." [...] Similarly, ComingSoon.net's Joshua Starnes hailed Scar as [...] "the best part of the film." [...] Praising both Scar and Irons' acting, Starnes continued, [...] "He switches <b>so</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> easily from campy to deadly its like a showcase for how to do an over-the-top villain right." [...] Concluding that [...] "Villains are often the most memorable characters in a Disney animated film," [...] Roger Ebert described Scar [...] "one of the great ones." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews reviewed, [...] "Gone is the buffoonery that has marked the recent trio of Ursula, Gaston, and Jafar," [...] writing, [...] "Scar is a sinister figure, given to acid remarks and cunning villainy."

500|$|Writing for Variety, Justin Chang said: [...] "One of the film's more {{remarkable}} achievements is that, despite their obvious differences {{in class and}} background, Therese and Carol seem to ease themselves (and the audience) <b>so</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> naturally into a bond {{that they have no}} interest in defining, or even really discussing — a choice that works not only for an era when their love dared not speak its name, but also for Haynes’ faith {{in the power of the}} medium to achieve an eloquence beyond words." [...] Francine Prose wrote in The New York Review of Books: [...] "Among the virtues of Todd Haynes's new film, Carol, is the delicacy, the patience, and the sheer amount of screen time that it lavishes on the experience of falling in love: the hesitations and doubts, the seemingly casual exchanges freighted with meaning and suppressed emotion, the simple happiness of being together." [...] Anita Katz from The San Francisco Examiner said: [...] "Haynes triumphs in his quest to make a sweeping romantic melodrama with social substance at the core. As a period piece, the movie immerses us in 1950s styles and attitudes. As a sensory experience, it dazzles with everything from rain-streaked windows to Therese’s plaid tam-o-shanter ... Haynes powerfully addresses the consequences of ignorance and intolerance. Impressively textured, the drama is filled with secret glances and other subtle aspects of forbidden love." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote: [...] "Carol" [...] is a performance of a performance, whereby codes and signals convey the most essential stuff of life, while the kabuki of being [...] "normal" [...] plays out with the carefully cultivated — and patently false — perfection of the toy train village Carol buys from Therese at their first meeting. Working from a carefully crafted script by Phyllis Nagy, Haynes portrays two people thirstily drinking each other in, while on the outside, they sip tea and cocktails with prim decorum." [...] Naming it [...] "one of the year's very best films", Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Camera virtuoso Edward Lachman finds visual poetry in the hothouse eroticism that envelops Carol and Therese, an amateur photographer who keeps framing Carol in her lens. Blanchett, a dream walking in Sandy Powell's frocks, delivers a master class in acting. And Mara is flawless ... Haynes' commitment to outcasts, then and now, makes Carol a romantic spellbinder that cuts deep." ...|$|E
