25|$|In 1885 {{the family}} left Arvier {{to work on}} the other side of the Alps, as most Valdotainians did at that time. The wish for a better life is a likely {{explanation}} but does not suggest why they travelled so far, almost to the Belgian border. Speculation surrounds the move, possibly because it was in secret. To emigrate needed authority and mayors had been told by the <b>sub-prefect</b> of Aoste to refuse or at least make permission difficult. If the family travelled separately, it would explain the legend that Maurice, then 14, was exchanged for a round of cheese: it could have been payment to a guide to lead him clandestinely over the mountains or payment in return for custody of the son.|$|E
500|$|In 1923, the <b>sub-prefect</b> of Corleone {{warned the}} Ministry of Interior that Cascioferro was [...] "one {{of the worst}} offenders, quite capable of {{committing}} any crime." [...] In May 1925, he was arrested as the instigator of a murder. He {{was able to be}} released on bail, as usual. However, with the rise of Fascism, his reputation and immunity was declining.|$|E

2500|$|The Türrs {{immediately}} became prominent {{figures in}} the town's social life, as seen in repeated reports in the local paper, the [...] "Il Lago Maggiore". The return after a visit to France of [...] "The Valorous Hungarian General and his Most Beautiful and Amiable Consort, Princess Bonaparte" [...] was a major local news item. The couple were hosted and feted by the town's dignitaries (<b>sub-prefect,</b> municipal councillors and {{the commander of the}} local National Guard) with a civic band playing various pieces, prominently ones associated with Garibaldi.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, on {{the evening}} of 19 February 1802, a mob {{assembled}} and raided the castle of La Sarraz, seizing and burning the archives listing the taxes due for the surrounding area, on the understanding that no taxes could be levied without the documents establishing what was due and by whom. The <b>sub-prefect</b> of Cossonay noted that the raid had been conducted by a large number of people, and that they had taken the time to sort through the archives, taking all deeds and administrative papers of value but leaving all family records in place.|$|E
5000|$|In Brazil, a prefect (prefeito) is {{the elected}} {{head of the}} {{executive}} branch in a municipality. Larger cities, such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, etc., also have <b>sub-prefects,</b> appointed to their offices by the elected prefect.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You utter ass!' said Mullins, {{and caught}} {{him by the}} back of his stiff neck and ran him down to the hall where the <b>sub-prefects,</b> who sit below the salt, made him welcome with the {{economical}} bloater-paste of mid-term.|$|R
2500|$|The {{authorities}} seem to {{have been}} quite aware that the movement was raised in opposition to the feudal taxes. Historian Eugène Monod, for instance, mentions that in early April 1802, one of the <b>sub-prefects</b> had advised that their abolition would be [...] "the one and only way to restore the peace".|$|R
2500|$|In this context, Bai Juyi overstepped his minor {{position}} by memorializing the emperor. As Assistant Secretary to the Prince's Tutor, Bai's memorial was {{a breach of}} protocol — he should have waited for those of censorial authority {{to take the lead}} before offering his own criticism. This was not the only charge which his opponents used against him. [...] His mother had died, apparently caused by falling into a well while looking at some flowers, and two poems written by Bai Juyi — the titles of which Waley translates as [...] "In Praise of Flowers" [...] and [...] "The New Well" [...] — were used against him as a sign of lack of Filial Piety, one of the Confucian ideals. [...] The result was exile. Bai Juyi was demoted to the rank of <b>Sub-Prefect</b> and banished from the court and the capital city to Jiujiang, then known as Xun Yang, on the southern shores of the Yangtze River in northwest Jiangxi Province. After three years, he was sent as Governor of a remote place in Sichuan. At the time, the main travel route there was up the Yangzi River. This trip allowed Bai Juyi a few days to visit his friend Yuan Zhen, who was also in exile and with whom he explored the rock caves located at Yichang. Bai Juyi was delighted by the flowers and trees for which his new location was noted. [...] In 819, he was recalled back to the capital, ending his exile.|$|E

50|$|The Province of the Azores {{resulted}} from the abolishment of the Captaincy-General of the Azores, but retained its capital {{in the city of}} Angra do Heroísmo, on the island of Terceira. The administrative territory was divided three comarcas: Angra, administered by a prefect; Ponta Delgada, and Horta, administered by <b>sub-prefects.</b>|$|R

6000|$|When Julius Fabricius, <b>Sub-Prefect</b> of the Weald, [...] In {{the days}} of Diocletian owned our Lower River-field, [...] He called to him Hobdenius--a Briton of the Clay, [...] Saying: 'What about that River-piece for layin' in to hay?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Away we {{went through}} the streets, the <b>Sub-prefect</b> cross-examining and congratulating me in the same breath as we marched at the head of our {{formidable}} posse comitatus. Sentinels were placed at the back and front of the house the moment we got to it; a tremendous battery of knocks was directed against the door; a light appeared at a window; I was told to conceal myself behind the police--then came more knocks and a cry of [...] "Open {{in the name of the}} law!" [...] At that terrible summons bolts and locks gave way before an invisible hand, and the moment after the <b>Sub-prefect</b> was in the passage, confronting a waiter half-dressed and ghastly pale. This was the short dialogue which immediately took place: ...|$|E
60|$|Meantime Winton, very {{penitent}} {{and especially}} polite towards Vernon, was being cheered with cocoa in Number Five Study. They had some difficulty in stemming {{the flood of}} his apologies. He himself pointed out to Vernon that he had attacked a <b>sub-prefect</b> for no reason whatever, and, therefore, deserved official punishment.|$|E
50|$|In 1834 the serenos (town watchmen) of the viceroyal {{period were}} re-constituted, now {{properly}} armed and in uniform. This occurred under {{the presidency of}} Marshal Luis José de Orbegoso y Moncada. Soon afterwards, the “Arequipa regulations” created the posts of Inspector and Guard (Celador), and the Order and Internal Security Forces came under the superintendent of police in Lima, and under the <b>sub-prefects</b> in the provinces.|$|R
5000|$|City arrondissements (such as in Dakar and Pikine) {{are divided}} into Communes d'arrondissement. In the Dakar Region, since 1996, the four Arrondissements have been {{subdivided}} into such Communes d'arrondissement, with appointed <b>Sub-Prefects,</b> answerable to their Arrondissement Prefects. Outside the large cities, the built up areas are titled communes de ville and the rural arrondissements divided into communautés rurales which maintain the same powers: city councils and mayors, directly elected.|$|R
2500|$|Garin {{worked as}} a chimney sweep, which again fits having been led {{individually}} across the mountains. Among the <b>sub-prefect's</b> reasons for stopping emigration was concern about [...] "avid speculators who, claiming to teach a trade to young children, especially that of chimney sweep, set out to seduce their parents with promises and false hopes [...] get their children... to get a large profit from them by exploiting their fatigue, their misery and sometimes even their life.".|$|R
6000|$|They met King {{on their}} way, {{stepping}} statelily and rubbing his hands. 'I have applied,' said he, 'for {{the services of}} an additional <b>sub-prefect</b> in Carton's unlamented absence. Your name, Winton, seems to have found favour with the powers that be, and--and all things considered--I am disposed to give my support to the nomination. You are therefore a quasi-lictor.' ...|$|E
6000|$|No {{object that}} was at all {{extraordinary}} appeared {{in any part of}} it. The <b>Sub-prefect</b> looked round the place, commanded everybody to be silent, stamped twice on the floor, called for a candle, looked attentively at the spot he had stamped on, and ordered the flooring there to be carefully taken up. This was done in no time. Lights were produced, and we saw a deep raftered cavity between the floor of this room and the ceiling of the room beneath. Through this cavity there ran perpendicularly a sort of case of iron thickly greased; and inside the case appeared the screw, which communicated with the bed-top below. Extra lengths of screw, freshly oiled; levers covered with felt; all the complete upper works of a heavy press--constructed with infernal ingenuity so as to join the fixtures below, and when taken to pieces again, to go into the smallest possible compass--were next discovered and pulled out on the floor. After some little difficulty the <b>Sub-prefect</b> succeeded in putting the machinery together, and, leaving his men to work it, descended with me to the bedroom. The smothering canopy was then lowered, but not so noiselessly as I had seen it lowered. When I mentioned this to the <b>Sub-prefect,</b> his answer, simple as it was, had a terrible significance. [...] "My men," [...] said he, [...] "are working down the bed-top for the first time--the men whose money you won were in better practice." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now no one {{expected}} fireworks from gentle Paddy Vernon, <b>sub-prefect</b> of Hartopp's House, but, as must often {{be the case with}} growing boys, his mind was in abeyance for the time being, and he said, all in a rush, on behalf of Regulus: 'O magna Carthago probrosis altior Italiae ruinis, O Carthage, thou wilt stand forth higher than the ruins of Italy.' ...|$|E
50|$|There was a {{complete}} structure of Prefects, at the summit two head boys and two head girls, then headmasters/senior prefects, prefects, <b>sub-prefects,</b> and TSPs Sub Prefects. This separate organisation was particularly called upon when teaching staff took the decision to stop monitoring the substantial play-grounds, in the sometimes turbulent mix of social classes, religious and ethnic origins, and the heady mix of boy and girl in the 1960s. Mr Williams, in the mid-1960s, one of two deputy heads, was required to dispense summary justice on boys presented by Prefects.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{department}} {{is administered by}} a departmental council (conseil départemental), an assembly elected for six years by universal suffrage, {{with the president of}} the council as executive of the department. Before 1982, the executive of a department was the prefect (préfet) who represents the French government in each department and is appointed by the president of France. The prefect is assisted by one or more <b>sub-prefects</b> (sous-préfet) based in the subprefectures of the department. Since 1982, the prefect retains only the powers that are not delegated to the department councils.|$|R
50|$|The school uniform {{was a black}} blazer, grey trousers, {{and white}} shirt for Senior Boys and a grey shirt for Junior Boys, worn with the school tie which had pale blue and navy blue {{diagonal}} broad stripes. The school badge was a white dove descending on a black background, with the letters Q.M.S.B. beneath. A subfusc suit could also be worn {{in place of the}} blazer and grey trousers, but latterly the habit had declined. Boys in the lower school, up to 4th form, wore a black peaked cap with a silver emblem of the dove descending. <b>Sub-prefects</b> wore blue ties with a silver dove emblem and full prefects wore a blue tie with a gold dove emblem. Full prefects wore a silver tassel on their school caps.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just a trifle. Look at my beak! Well, we got {{all these}} pretty marks at footer--owin' to the zeal with which we played the game,' said Stalky, dusting himself. 'But d'you think you're fit to be let loose again, Pater? 'Sure you don't want to kill another <b>sub-prefect?</b> I wish I was Pot. I'd cut your sprightly young soul out.' ...|$|E
60|$|The 'tump-tump' of the puntabouts {{before the}} sides settled to games {{came through the}} open window. Winton, like his House-Master, loved fresh air. Then they heard Paddy Vernon, <b>sub-prefect</b> on duty, calling the roll {{in the field and}} marking defaulters. Winton wrote steadily. King curled himself up on a desk, hands round knees. One would have said that the man was gloating over the boy's misfortune, but the boy understood.|$|E
6000|$|We {{left the}} house in the sole {{possession}} of two police agents--every one of the inmates being removed to prison on the spot. The <b>Sub-prefect,</b> after taking down my [...] "proces verbal" [...] in his office, returned with me to my hotel to get my passport. [...] "Do you think," [...] I asked, as I gave it to him, [...] "that any men have really been smothered in that bed, as they tried to smother me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In France the préfet (prefect) {{is a top}} ranking {{public servant}} who belongs to the {{so-called}} Corps préfectoral. The function was created on 17 February 1800 by Napoléon Bonaparte after his successful coup d'état of 9 November 1799 which made him Head of State with the title Premier Consul. The prefect's role at that time (until the reform of the function in the 1980s) {{was to be the}} top representative of the central government as well as the chief administrator in a département (which can be compared to a county in most English-speaking nations) [...] His agency services as well as his circumscription (=territory in which he is in charge) are called préfecture. <b>Sub-prefects</b> (sous-préfets, sous-préfecture) operate as assistants in the arrondissements (subdivisions of a département) under his authority and control.|$|R
50|$|Ivory Coast {{is divided}} into five levels of {{administrative}} subdivision, but these divisions are not written into the constitution. It {{is divided into}} 14 first-level districts, 31 second-level regions, 108 third-level departments, and 510 fourth-level sub-prefectures. By law, districts are to be headed by governors appointed by the central government; however, as of 2016, {{only two of the}} 14 districts have had governors nominated, so most the districts have not yet become functional governmental entities. Each region and department is headed by a prefect appointed by the central government. Sub-prefectures are headed by <b>sub-prefects,</b> also appointed by the central government. In 2002, the country held its first departmental elections to select departmental councils to oversee local infrastructure development and maintenance as well as economic and social development plans and projects. Where needed, there are 197 fifth-level communes, each headed by an elected mayor.|$|R
50|$|Born in Iași, he was {{descended from}} boyar {{families}} on both sides. His father's first name was originally Adam but became Adamachi under Greek influence, while his surname was Arapu. His mother Eufrosina, {{the daughter of}} Constantin Bantaș from Vaslui, came from another old noble family. According to the prevailing custom, Vasile was educated {{at home and in}} private schools. He was especially interested in arithmetic and geometry, and learned French and German. In 1835, he was named pomoșnic (<b>sub-prefect's</b> assistant) at the princely council in Iași. In 1836, he was given the honorific title of high clucer. In 1848, he was named comis (Master of the Horse). In 1853, he was made spătar for services to the country as administrator of Vaslui County and president of the Iași eforie (administrative council). Following the adoption of the 1866 Constitution of Romania, a country formed after the intervening Union of the Principalities, Adamachi served two terms in the Romanian Senate.|$|R
