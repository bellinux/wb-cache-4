40|$|ABSTRACT Cotyledon Black Decay (CBD) on <b>soybean</b> <b>sprout</b> {{mimics the}} black spot due to {{microbial}} infection. CBD, not visible or predictable at seedlot state, for some reason, shows up exclusively on cotyledon of <b>soybean</b> <b>sprout</b> during sprouting process. Such an incidence rate fluctuated from 0. 8 to 19. 5 % {{over three years}} from 2004. We suspected some pod-infecting anthracnose fungi and/or pod-blight path-ogen, or pod-sucking bean bug, {{one of the major}} pests of soybean, might have involved, of which we ruled out fungal pathogen because it was preventable through heat treatment, a proven method for seedlot disinfestation.

This finding is the first report to confirm that bean bug damage to pod at R 8 stage is directly responsible for the CBD, which did not concur with any other deleterious effects on sprouting such as reduction in hypocotyls elon-gation and rooting except unsightly sprout quality. How-ever, earlier feeding either at green pod or greenish yellow pod stage (R 6 -early R 7 stage) resulted in rather severe dama-ges, which strikingly reduced hypocotyls growth to about one forth to about two third, as well as the reduction in rates of seed germination...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the effect of <b>soybean</b> <b>sprout</b> flour consumption on serum calcium and phosphorus levels in ovariectomized rats. Methods A randomized post-test-only control group design involving 25 female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 2 months, which were divided into five groups: (i) normal controls on standard feed diet AIN- 93 (C-N), (ii) ovariectomy controls on standard feed diet (OVX -N); (iii) ovariectomized rats on standard feed diet + ethinylestradiol (OVX -E), (iv) ovariectomized rats on standard feed diet + soybean flour (OVX -S); (v) ovariectomized rats on standard feed diet + <b>soybean</b> <b>sprout</b> flour (OVX -SS). The rats were treated for 6 weeks, then {{on the last day of}} treatment blood sampling was conducted. Analysis of calcium and phosphorus in serum was performed using the Arsenazo III photometric method. Data were analyzed using one-way Anova. Results Mean serum calcium level was highest in the OVX-SS group (12. 59 mg/dL ± 1. 32), while mean serum phosphorus level was highest in the C-N group (1. 708 mg/dL ± 0. 28). <b>Soybean</b> <b>sprout</b> flour consumption had a significant effect on serum calcium levels (p= 0. 019), yet it had no effect on body weight and serum phosphorus levels of the rats.

After a 21 -day administration period, statistical differences in the lead accumulation in the femurs of the rats were noted. Iron-deficient rats accumulated {{more than four times}} the amount of lead in their bones than rats without iron-deficiency. No further decrease was observed in haemoglobin concentrations in the groups of animals fed with lead isolates, either iron-deficient or iron non-deficient.

40|$|GABA {{exists in}} the brain and medulla spinalis of mammals. A small of amount of GABA is also found in plants. Available natural foods in the market that richly contain GABA include anka, active brown rice, GABA tea and {{fermented}} soybean. Literatures indicate forced germination can greatly increase the GABA contents of seeds. This study, therefore, selects such common edibles as adzuki beans, mung beans, soybeans and wheat seeds for experiment. After causing them to sprout, it tests the degree of germination and examines the GABA content of different germination positions in order to identify the seed that has the best GABA production potential. The most frequently employed HPLC method for examining GABA is the precolumn derivatization method. This experiment selects three derivatization reagents, HN, PITC and OPA, to derivatize the samples, analyze the GABA content through HPLC and compare the results. Experiment results indicate the HN derivatization method is not effective for test objects of complicated ingredients, such as gaba tea, germinated brown rice and germinated seed samples. We were unable to identify the GABA peak on the HPLC spectrum. When dealing with samples that contain large amount of amino acid, such as germinated brown rice and sprouted seeds, the PITC derivatization method is prone to disturbance and has the tendency to overestimate the GABA content. The OPA derivatization method effectively isolates the GABA peak of all test samples of this experiment. That its derivatization is simple and speedy makes it suitable for broader applications. Among the seed samples selected for the experiment, adzuki beans have the highest GABA production potential followed by soybeans. So among the experiment samples, the whole grain of Kaohsiung # 7 and # 8 adzuki beans sprouted to 6 cm and <b>soybeans</b> <b>sprouted</b> to 9 cm have the greatest GABA content per weight unit. Most of the seeds contain almost no GABA before sprouting. Among the sampling lengths (0 - 9 cm), sprouting of 0. 5 cm has the lowest GABA content. When the sprouting is greater than 0. 5 cm, the GABA content rises significantly as the length of the sprouting increases. Between sprouted adzuki bean and mung bean products, the taste of adzuki bean product is better than mung bean product. Heating enhances the taste. Among <b>sprouted</b> <b>soybean</b> products, soy milk preserves the greatest amount of GABA. Drinking of 531 mL of the soy milk made according to the process of this experiment will result in intake of 18 mg GABA for reduction of blood pressure. Drinking of 338 mL of the soy milk made according to regular process will attain the same effect.

40|$|Abstract Background Estradiol (E 2) mediates various {{intracellular}} signaling cascades {{from the}} plasma membrane via several estrogen receptors (ERs). The pituitary is an estrogen-responsive tissue, {{and we have}} previously reported that E 2 can activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as ERK 1 / 2 and JNK 1 / 2 / 3 in the membrane ERα (mERα) -enriched GH 3 /B 6 /F 10 rat pituitary tumor cell line. Phytoestrogens are compounds found in plants and foods such as <b>soybeans,</b> alfalfa <b>sprouts,</b> and red grapes. They are structurally similar to E 2 and share a similar mechanism of action through their binding to ERs. Phytoestrogens bind to nuclear ERs with a much lower affinity and therefore are less potent in mediating genomic responses. However, {{little is known about}} their ability to act via mERs to mediate nongenomic effects. Methods To investigate the activation of different nongenomic pathways, and determine the involvement of mERα, we measured prolactin (PRL) release by radio-immunoassay, MAPK activations (ERK 1 / 2 and JNK 1 / 2 / 3) via a quantitative plate immunoassay, and intracellular [Ca 2 +] by Fura- 2 fluorescence imaging in cells treated with E 2 or four different phytoestrogens (coumestrol, daidzein, genistein, and trans -resveratrol). Results Coumesterol and daidzein increased PRL release similar to E 2 in GH 3 /B 6 /F 10 cells, while genistein and trans -resveratrol had no effect. All of these compounds except genistein activated ERK 1 / 2 signaling at 1 – 10 picomolar concentrations; JNK 1 / 2 / 3 was activated by all compounds at a 100 nanomolar concentration. All compounds also caused rapid Ca 2 + uptake, though in unique dose-dependent Ca 2 + response patterns for several aspects of this response. A subclone of GH 3 cells expressing low levels of mERα (GH 3 /B 6 /D 9) did not respond to any phytoestrogen treatments for any of these responses, suggesting that these nongenomic effects were mediated via mERα. Conclusion Phytoestrogens were much more potent in mediating these nongenomic responses (activation of MAPKs, PRL release, and increased intracellular [Ca 2 +]) via mERα than was previously reported for genomic responses. The unique non-monotonic dose responses and variant signaling patterns caused by E 2 and all tested phytoestrogens suggest that complex and multiple signaling pathways or binding partners could be involved. By activating these different nongenomic signaling pathways, phytoestrogens could have significant physiological consequences for pituitary cell functions. </p...|$|R
