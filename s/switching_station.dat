5|$|The first Power Station in Eccles {{was built}} along Cawdor Street, and opened on 14 December 1896 by Alderman W. D. Kendall. The second and much larger Barton Power Station {{was built in}} 1920 {{alongside}} the Manchester Ship Canal and Bridgewater Canal. It was opened on 11 October 1923 by the Earl of Derby, and supplied electricity to Manchester and the South East Lancashire Electricity District. It ceased generation in March 1974, operating from thereon only as a <b>switching</b> <b>station,</b> and was demolished in June 1979.|$|E
5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a <b>switching</b> <b>station</b> west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E

This tradition has continued since the 1950s when a signal operator, Joe Wojtowicz, started hanging a string of Christmas lights in the tunnel. While PATH officials were initially concerned about putting up decorations in the tunnel, they later acquiesced and the tradition continues to this day.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, three {{additional}} backup generators for Units 2 and 4 {{were placed in}} new buildings located higher on the hillside, to comply with new regulatory requirements. All six units were given access to these generators, but the switching stations that sent power from these backup generators to the reactors' cooling systems for Units 1 through 5 {{were still in the}} poorly protected turbine buildings. The <b>switching</b> <b>station</b> for Unit 6 was protected inside the only GE Mark II reactor building and continued to function. All three of the generators added in the late 1990s were operational after the tsunami. If the switching stations had been moved to inside the reactor buildings or to other flood-proof locations, power would have been provided by these generators to the reactors' cooling systems.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. National Security Agency wishes {{to predict the}} routing of messages over various communications networks. Before routing predictions {{can be made in}} a public switch telephone network (PSTN), the hierarchical level of the network's <b>switching</b> <b>stations</b> must be known. This thesis develops an integer linear programming model foraccomplishing this classification. In this model, a PSTN isrepresented as a graph in which <b>switching</b> <b>stations</b> are nodes and the logical connections between the <b>switching</b> <b>stations</b> are arcs. Algebraic constraints represent the engineering standards common to PSTNs. The model also incorporates probabilistic inferences about the class of <b>switching</b> <b>stations</b> to improve classification accuracy for networks not following typical PSTN structural practices. Preprocessing routines that analyze the network's topology and employ various heuristics {{to reduce the size of}} the problem are evaluated. The model is implemented in GAMS Development Corporation's Generic Algebraic Modeling System and sample PSTNs are solved using IBM's Optimization Subroutine Library solver on a 166 MHz desktop personal computer.

40|$|The National Security Agency (NSA) {{collects}} {{and processes}} signals intelligence information {{for national security}} purposes. As part of this mission, NSA predicts message routing over public switched telephone networks (PSTNs). The hierarchical switching level (or classification) of PSTN <b>switching</b> <b>stations</b> must be determined before making routing predictions. This thesis develops a fast graph-theoretic algorithm for accomplishing this classification. An undirected connected graph models a target PSTN; <b>switching</b> <b>stations</b> are nodes and logical connections between the <b>switching</b> <b>stations</b> are unit-length arcs. We develop bounds for the minimum number of switching levels and implicitly enumerate all possible classifications for each PS TN.

Solutions are obtained in under one second for nine real-world PSTNs, and large notional networks of over 300 nodes and 900 arcs are classified in under one minute.
