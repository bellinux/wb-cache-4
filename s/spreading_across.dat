5|$|After <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> the United States, the {{remnants}} moved through Ontario and Quebec, producing hurricane-force wind gusts and 40ft (12m) waves along Lake Ontario. Throughout the lake, 55vessels sunk {{due to the}} storm, resulting in {{tens of thousands of}} dollars in damage. High winds caused power outages and structural damage, as well as destroyed wheat fields across Ontario. In Toronto, the storm killed three people and injured others.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, the Kingdom of England formed part of the Angevin empire <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> Western Europe. Henry was named after his grandfather, Henry II, who had built up this vast network of lands {{stretching}} from Scotland and Wales, through England, across the English Channel to the territories of Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou in north-west France, onto Poitou and Gascony in the south-west. For many years the French Crown was relatively weak, enabling first Henry II, and then his sons Richard and John, to dominate France.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> the island. The epidemic {{made its way}} to Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, and hit the city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would {{have to take care of}} 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues from that point on) would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E

5|$|The Last Dog on Earth is a 2003 {{young adult}} novel written by Daniel Ehrenhaft. It follows Logan, a lonely 14-year-old boy who adopts a dog from an animal shelter and names her Jack. The pair's {{relationship}} is soon threatened by an incurable prion disease <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> the nation. Infected dogs become unnaturally violent and bloodthirsty, {{culminating in the}} deaths of several people. As public fear heightens and the government intervenes to control the outbreak, Logan struggles to reform his life and remain with Jack.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} {{wave that}} caused the flooding moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September29. Moving westward, the system entered the eastern Caribbean Sea on October5, although rainfall began <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> Puerto Rico the day prior. The wave's associated convection, or thunderstorms, were amplified by an upper-level trough to its west. It was developing into a tropical cyclone while it moved across Puerto Rico. When the system's rainbands reached the mountains of southern Puerto Rico, it produced torrential rainfall, and additional precipitation occurred owing to the system's slow movement.|$|E
5|$|Upon Jimena {{crossing}} Central America, the NHC {{noted the}} possibility locally heavy rainfall <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> much of Central America and in extreme Southwestern Mexico. As the storm moved {{parallel to the}} Mexican coast, {{interests in the region}} were asked to watch the progress of the system and officials in the area opened shelters due to the risk of high winds. The Sonora state government issued a blue (initial) alert for 14municipalities on the southern portion of the state the afternoon of August 31. Later on the day, the blue alert was upgraded to a green alert, citing the risk of large rainfall amounts.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, the Despensers were {{increasingly}} using Caerphilly Castle as their main {{residence in the}} region rather than Cardiff. Thomas le Despenser was executed in 1400 on charges of conspiring against Henry IV. In 1401 rebellion broke out in North Wales {{under the leadership of}} Owain Glyndŵr, quickly <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> the rest of the country. In 1404 Cardiff and the castle were taken by the rebels, causing considerable damage to the Black Tower and the southern gatehouse in the process. On Thomas's death the castle passed first to his young son, Richard, and on his death in 1414, through his daughter Isabel to the Beauchamp family. Isabel first married Richard de Beauchamp, the Earl of Worcester and then, on his death, to his cousin Richard de Beauchamp, the Earl of Warwick, in 1423.|$|E
5|$|In early 2016, Sabah had a {{total number}} of 42,047 {{teachers}} teaching in various pre-schools, primary and secondary schools. Following the decentralisation of power {{from the federal government}} to state government as well to improve the education in the state, there has been a target to reach 90% of teachers from Sabahans itself. Sabah State Library are the main public library in the state. There is another 11 Indonesian schools (beside the main Indonesian school in the state capital) <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> Sabah mainly for Indonesian migrants children residing in the state. Since 2014, Filipino migrants children also have been enrolled to recently established Alternative Learning Centre (ALC) that was set-up by Filipino volunteers in Sabah with a collaboration with various local non-governmental organisations (NGO).|$|E
5|$|Matters were {{complicated}} by mass illnesses <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> London; the epidemic, probably flu, {{reduced the number}} of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled. Even Henry Fielding's play The Miser, which was to open early January, was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members, including Theophilus. The Miser was eventually staged in mid February and was successful, but another of his plays, Deborah: or, a Wife for You All, lasted only one night on 6 April 1733. Regardless of the problems plaguing the season, it was positive for Fielding while it lasted, with six of his plays being produced on stage along with Thomas Arne's The Opera of Operas, Fielding's Tom Thumb set to music.|$|E

5|$|This {{eruption}} style {{can take}} the form of either lava flows, <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> the floor of the paterae, or lava lakes. Except for observations by Galileo during its seven close flybys, {{it can be difficult to}} tell the difference between a lava lake and a lava flow eruption on a patera floor, due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics. Intra-patera lava flow eruptions, such as the Gish Bar Patera eruption in 2001, can be just as voluminous as those seen spreading out across the Ionian plains. Flow-like features have also been observed within a number of paterae, like Camaxtli Patera, suggesting that lava flows periodically resurface their floors.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{district}} council worked with King's College to establish plots {{of land for}} development around Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. A town planning competition was held, won by A & J Soutar, town planners from Wandsworth, who sought to create a symmetrical design <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> Ruislip parish. Many {{of the woods and}} historic sites including Manor Farm were to be demolished and cleared as part of the plan, making way for a projected total of 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents. Only the church in Ruislip, St. Martin's, would have been spared. An outline map was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A local board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911, which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 12. It tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection, and subsequent to moving through the southern Windward Islands it crossed northern Central America. Convection increased on June 20 as the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean. Under the influence of southeasterly flow from developing Hurricane Celia in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the south-southwesterly flow from a mid- to upper-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico, the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while <b>spreading</b> <b>across</b> Cuba and southern Florida. On June 24, a mid-level circulation developed near the Yucatán Channel, and shortly thereafter satellite image loops indicated deep convection with some cyclonic rotation near the western tip of Cuba. A reconnaissance aircraft flight was dispatched late on June 24 into the system to determine if it developed into a tropical cyclone, though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. Subsequent to the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on June 25 ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235miles (375km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to an earlier subtropical storm.|$|E
