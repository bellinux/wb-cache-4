5|$|I {{will never}} break {{the word of}} a prince spoken in public place, for my honour's <b>sake.</b> <b>And</b> {{therefore}} I say again, I will marry as soon as I can conveniently, if God take not him away with whom I mind to marry, or myself, or else some other great let happen.|$|E
5|$|After adolescence, most {{physical}} training for males {{was of a}} military nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own <b>sake,</b> <b>and</b> condemned Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games in the Greek manner.|$|E
5|$|Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (soy sauce) and <b>sake,</b> <b>and</b> the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related Aspergilli. Quorn, a meat substitute, is made from Fusarium venenatum.|$|E

5|$|In 1884 and 1885, {{through the}} {{influence}} of Archer, Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of The World in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw. The two figures in the contemporary art world whose views Shaw most admired were William Morris and John Ruskin, and he sought to follow their precepts in his criticisms. Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw, who rejected the idea of art for art's <b>sake,</b> <b>and</b> insisted that all great art must be didactic.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, Whitney {{returns and}} she helps the Carters repair their new till. Johnny offers her {{the chance of}} moving back into the Vic, which Whitney accepts. Mick also offers her her old job back as a barmaid and Whitney accepts this too. However, Shirley warns Whitney {{to stay away from}} Mick and she tells Shirley that she cannot stop her from being at the Vic. In private, Whitney reveals to Mick that she is engaged to Woody and she shares the news with her family and friends. She asks Mick to give her away and he agrees. Mick struggles with Woody's presence, but agrees to get on with him for Whitney's <b>sake</b> <b>and</b> Whitney admits to Mick {{although}} she can't be with him, she loves him. Linda throws her out after she figures out she's the one Mick kissed and Whitney moves in with Stacey, Stacey's husband and Bianca's relative, Martin Fowler (James Bye) and their kids. Mick takes the rest of her stuff round and offers her £200 in lieu of lost wages but she tells him to keep his dirty money, annoyed with him revealing all.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (<b>sake)</b> <b>and</b> grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E

25|$|Adoration is {{the first}} {{attitude}} of man acknowledging {{that he is a}} creature before his Creator. Praise is the form of prayer which recognizes most immediately that God is God. It lauds God for his own <b>sake</b> <b>and</b> gives him glory, quite beyond what He does, but simply because He is.|$|E
25|$|Biblical {{descriptions}} of the incense offering have been further elaborated and expanded upon in midrashic, Talmudic, Geonic, and subsequent rabbinic literature. Jews continue to study {{the laws of the}} incense offering, both for its own <b>sake</b> <b>and</b> for its potential utility in an eschatological restoration of Temple service.|$|E

25|$|The {{beauty and}} value {{of many of the}} Latin Breviaries were brought to the notice of English churchmen by one of the numbers of the Oxford Tracts for the Times, since which time they have been much more studied, both for their own <b>sake</b> <b>and</b> for the light they throw upon the English Prayer-Book.|$|E
25|$|Acute accents are {{sometimes}} added to loanwords where a final e is not silent, for example, maté from Spanish mate, the Maldivian capital Malé, <b>saké,</b> <b>and</b> Pokémon from the Japanese compound for pocket monster, {{the last three}} from languages which do not use the Roman alphabet, and where transcriptions do not normally use acute accents.|$|E
25|$|Dilbert portrays {{corporate}} {{culture as a}} Kafkaesque world of bureaucracy for its own <b>sake</b> <b>and</b> office politics that {{stand in the way}} of productivity, where employees' skills and efforts are not rewarded, and busy work is praised. Much of the humor emerges as the audience sees the characters making obviously ridiculous decisions that are natural reactions to mismanagement.|$|E

25|$|Emperor Saga of the Heian period adopted this practice, {{and held}} flower-viewing parties with <b>sake</b> <b>and</b> feasts {{underneath}} the blossoming boughs of sakura {{trees in the}} Imperial Court in Kyoto. Poems would be written praising the delicate flowers, which were seen {{as a metaphor for}} life itself, luminous and beautiful yet fleeting and ephemeral. This was said to be the origin of Hanami in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The {{functional}} and formalized shapes and {{spaces of the}} modernist movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own <b>sake,</b> <b>and</b> new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. Perhaps most obviously, architects rediscovered the expressive and symbolic value of architectural elements and forms that had evolved through centuries of buildingoften maintaining meaning in literature, poetry and artbut which had been abandoned by the modern movement.|$|E
25|$|Although Calvinists believe God and {{the truth}} of God cannot be plural, they also believe that those civil {{ordinances}} of man which restrain man from evil and encourage toward good, are ordinances of God (regardless of the religion, or lack of it, of those who wield that power). Christians are obligated to be at peace with all men, {{as far as it}} is up to them, and to submit to governments for the Lord's <b>sake,</b> <b>and</b> to pray for enemies.|$|E

25|$|Others have conquered and ruled; we alone conquer for conquest's <b>sake</b> <b>and</b> Dominate for {{no other}} purpose than Domination itself; the name we half-consciously chose for our state is no accident.

25|$|Arnold {{jumped out}} of the {{airplane}} near the base of the airfield control tower and picked up a Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) from a Marine who did not need it anymore. A member of the All Navy Pistol Team and a longtime pistol and bird shooter, Arnold was an excellent marksman, and shot down a torpedo plane coming in to strafe the new control tower next to which he was standing. The plane crashed on the field. Between the two waves, Jack and a couple of sailors went over to look at the wreckage. Discovering it belonged to the first wave’s Torpedo Squadron Commander, they drank the downed pilot's <b>sake</b> <b>and</b> returned to the battle. That kill from the ground was later to make Jack the only known pilot who shot down five aircraft (one with a BAR, two with an Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, and two with a Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter) who was not an ace.|$|E
