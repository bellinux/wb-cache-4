500|$|When Sarah Waters was 19 years old, {{she joined}} a student house in Whitstable, Kent, sharing {{a bed and}} then {{falling in love with}} another young woman. They lived there for two winters in what became a six-year relationship. She recalled, [...] "It was cold, isolated, romantic and so intense—quite special." [...] In 1995, Waters was at Queen Mary and Westfield College writing her PhD {{dissertation}} on gay and lesbian historical fiction from 1870 onward when she became interested in the Victorian era. While learning about the activism in socialism, women's suffrage, and utopianism of the period, she was inspired to write a work of fiction of the kind that she would like to read. Specifically, Waters intended to write a story that focused on an urban setting, diverging from previous lesbian-themed books such as Isabel Miller's Patience and Sarah, in which two women escape an oppressive home life to live together freely in the woods. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> at the time, [...] "there's so much more to lesbian history than that".|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words [...] "He withdraws not {{his eyes from}} the righteous" [...] in [...] to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty as shown in her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, but my father is a trickster, and he will outwit you." [...] Jacob replied, [...] "I am his brother in trickery." [...] She said to him, [...] "Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?" [...] He replied, [...] "Yes, with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself subtle." [...] He asked her, [...] "What is his trickery?" [...] She replied: [...] "I have a sister older than I am, and he will not let me marry before her." [...] So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "Now my sister will be put to shame," [...] so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah," [...] we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not know until then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants..|$|E
