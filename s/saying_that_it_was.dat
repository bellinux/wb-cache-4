5|$|A soundtrack album, Soma Bringer Original Soundtrack, was {{released}} through the Sleigh Bells label on April 2, 2008. The soundtrack covers three discs. In addition to tracks used in-game, the album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks. Ben Schweitzer, writing for RPGFan, positively compared the score to earlier works by Mitsuda, calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to earlier work. Don Kotowski of Video Game Music Online gave the soundtrack album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. He frequently praised Mitsuda's style, and like Schweitzer {{noted that it}} often recalled his earlier work. He also praised the additional tracks for their richness and depth, finishing his review by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a soundtrack {{not to be missed}} by buyers of video game music.|$|E
5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1988, the Supreme Council of Soviet Armenia {{voted to}} accept Nagorno-Karabakh into Armenia. On 17 June 1988, the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet refused to {{transfer}} the area to Armenia, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> part of Azerbaijan. The leading members of the Karabakh Committee, a group of intellectuals leading the demonstrations, were arrested in December 1988, but were freed in May 1989. On 1 December 1989, the Soviet Armenian Supreme Council and NKAO Supreme Council declared the unification of the two entities (օրենք «Հայկական ԽՍՀ-ի և Լեռնային Ղարաբաղի վերամիավորման մասին»). In January 1990, another pogrom took place against Armenians, this time in Baku. In the meantime, most Azerbaijanis of Armenia and Armenians of Azerbaijan left their homes and moved to their respective countries.|$|E

5|$|The Romans {{had just}} {{defeated}} the Seleucids in the Roman-Syrian War and had {{forced them to}} thereby sue for peace. Following their recently successful operation in Syria, the Romans then turned their attention towards the Gallic tribes of Galatia who had emigrated to Asia Minor almost 100 {{years prior to the}} ensuing military engagement. Gnaeus Manlius Vulso, the consul, excused the invasion by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in retaliation for the Galatians supplying troops to the Seleucids during the war. Vulso embarked on this campaign without the permission of the Roman Senate. Joined by Pergamum, the Romans marched inland and attacked the Galatians. They defeated the Galatians in a battle on Mount Olympus and followed up the victory by defeating a larger army near Ankara.|$|E
5|$|In January 1978, Kerry {{arrived at}} Indiana University, {{studying}} theatre, drama and telecommunications. Based on {{the times that}} he recorded for Indiana, Kerry was named in the Australian squad for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada. However, his international career {{appeared to be in}} disarray when along with two teammates, Tonelli and Joe Dixon, he was expelled from the Australian team for breaking a curfew on American Independence Day during a training camp in Honolulu, Hawaii. According to Tonelli, Kerry was late because he was courting a female he had met, while Tonelli and Dixon had been drinking. Tonelli also admitted to the officials that he had smoked marijuananot illegal under Hawaii lawon the night. In the aftermath of the incident, Tonelli appeared on Australian television, strongly denying rumours that he had been involved in a drug-fuelled orgy with teammates. He admitted to smoking marijuana, but defended his actions, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not illegal. Supporters in Australia, including future Prime Minister Bob Hawke, launched a petition for the reinstatement of the trio, which garnered thousands of signatures, but to no avail.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E

5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} martensitic stainless steel. The Patent Office rejected his application <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created {{the first set of}} stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were {{made about the}} toll machines, due to their low height and needing the exact amount of the toll. In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property tax purposes, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' {{to try to get}} a deal. OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not in the best interest of the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E
