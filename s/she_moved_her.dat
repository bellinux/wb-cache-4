500|$|She {{quickly found}} a new untenured {{research}} associate role under James Whittenberger, Chair of Physiology at Harvard School of Public Health, working with Dr. Jere Mead. [...] She continued the research on air pollution, which she began under Drinker, until she left the school in 1977. Partly {{because of the difficulty}} in obtaining tenure at Harvard, both for herself and for her colleague Sheldon Murphy, and partly because she needed to work with engineers to produce suitable combustion products, <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> research to the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and accepted a promotion to lecturer, securing funding for 12 years. When <b>she</b> <b>moved,</b> <b>her</b> new focus was the role of metals in the inhalation of sulfuric acid.

Her mother's relationship with Southall ended when Cher was nine years old, but she considers him her father and remembers him as a [...] "good-natured man who turned belligerent when he drank too much". Holt remarried and divorced several more times, and <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> family around the country (including New York, Texas, and California). They often had little money, and Cher recounted having had to use rubber bands to hold her shoes together. At one point, her mother left Cher at an orphanage for several weeks.

500|$|The initial {{bombardment}} commenced at 05:50, {{against the}} site of six [...] guns, atop Pointe du Hoc. When Texas ceased firing at the Pointe at 06:24, 255 14-inch shells had been fired in 34 minutes—an average rate of fire of 7.5 shells per minute, which was the longest sustained period of firing for Texas in World War II. While shells from the main guns were hitting Pointe du Hoc, the 5-inch guns were firing on the area leading up to Exit D-1, the route to get inland from western Omaha. At 06:26, Texas shifted her main battery gunfire to {{the western edge of}} Omaha Beach, around the town of Vierville. Meanwhile, her secondary battery went to work on another target on the western end of [...] "Omaha" [...] beach, a ravine laced with strong points to defend an exit road.

500|$|When Charles {{became ill}} in the 1390s, Isabeau was 22; {{she had three}} {{children}} and had already lost two infants. During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize her, and caused her great distress by demanding her removal when she entered his chamber. The Monk of St Denis wrote in his chronicle, [...] "What distressed her above all was to see how on all occasions... the king repulsed her, whispering to his people, 'Who is this woman obstructing my view? Find out what she wants and stop her from annoying and bothering me. As his illness worsened {{at the turn of}} the century, she was accused of abandoning him, particularly when <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> residence to the Hôtel Barbette. Historian Rachel Gibbons speculates that Isabeau wanted to distance herself from her husband and his illness, writing, [...] "it would be unjust to blame her if she did not want to live with a madman." ...|$|E
500|$|Nancy Reagan was First Lady of California {{during her}} husband's two terms as governor. She disliked {{living in the}} state capital of Sacramento, which lacked the excitement, social life, and mild climate to which she was {{accustomed}} in Los Angeles. She first attracted controversy early in 1967, when, after four months' residence in the California Governor's Mansion in Sacramento, <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> family into a wealthy suburb, because fire officials had labeled the mansion as a [...] "firetrap." [...] Though the Reagans leased the new house at their expense, the move was viewed as snobbish. Reagan defended her actions as being {{for the good of}} her family, a judgment with which her husband readily agreed. Friends of the family later helped support the cost of the leased house, while Reagan supervised construction of a new ranch-style governor's residence in nearby Carmichael. The new residence was finished just as Ronald Reagan left office in 1975, but his successor, Jerry Brown, refused to live there. It was sold in 1982, and California governors lived in improvised arrangements until Brown moved into the Governor's Mansion in 2015.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1811, King George III {{had become}} {{permanently}} insane, and the Prince of Wales was appointed as Regent. He restricted Caroline's access to Princess Charlotte further, and Caroline became more socially isolated as members of high society chose to patronise George's extravagant parties rather than hers. <b>She</b> <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> London residence to Connaught House in Bayswater. Caroline needed a powerful ally to help her oppose George's increasing ability to prevent her from seeing her daughter. In league with Henry Brougham, an ambitious Whig politician who favoured reform, she began a propaganda campaign against George. George countered by leaking Lady Douglas's testimony from the [...] "Delicate Investigation", which Brougham repudiated by leaking the testimonies of the servants and Mrs Austin. Charlotte favoured her mother's point of view, as {{did most of the}} public. Jane Austen wrote of Caroline: [...] "Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman and because I hate her Husband." ...|$|E

[...] The Goddards also noticed that her pupils were constricted.

At 8:30 pm, a taxicab arrived to take her home, and she promised to telephone the Goddards soon.|$|E
