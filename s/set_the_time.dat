5|$|However, Sitchin, {{who died}} in 2010, denied any {{connection}} between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for the last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that {{he believed that the}} Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session was}} held on Saturday afternoon and lasted one-hour between 13:00 to 14:00 CEST, each driver was allowed up to twelve timed laps, with their fastest lap used to determine their grid position. Cars were timed using a TAG Heuer timing system, which measured to an accuracy of one-thousandth of a second. At {{the end of the}} session, the three fastest drivers had all set the same laptime, the first time this had happened {{in the history of the}} World Championship. Jacques Villeneuve was first to set a time of 1:21.072, fourteen minutes into the one hour session. A further fourteen minutes later, Michael Schumacher posted an identical time. With nine minutes of the session remaining, Heinz-Harald Frentzen crossed the line, again with a time of 1:21.072. Under the regulations, in the event of drivers setting equal times in qualifying, the order in which the times were set is considered, with the first driver to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> given precedence. Villeneuve was awarded pole position on the starting grid for the race, with Schumacher second and Frentzen third. Fourth place on the grid went to the reigning World Champion, Damon Hill, in his Arrows, with a time of 1:21.130, 0.058 seconds behind the time of the leading three. Hill had been on course to get pole position but had to slow towards the end of the lap because of yellow flags due to an incident involving Ukyo Katayama's Minardi.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of 1857 model Waltham movements are keywind {{from the rear}} and keyset from the front. A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory. The earliest stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with no reversing clutch on the winding stem, and had no setting mechanism; these early movements required using a key to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Later stemwind movements were lever setting, with a unique design of set lever which pivoted out from the movement rather than pulling out. Later 1857 movements also added a reversing clutch, a feature ubiquitous on all subsequent Waltham stemwind watches. All stemwind 1857 movements have the winding stem located at 3:00.|$|E
25|$|It is {{straightforward}} {{to turn a}} proof of Moon and Moser's 3n/3 bound {{on the number of}} maximal independent sets into an algorithm that lists all such sets in time O(3n/3). For graphs that have the largest possible number of maximal independent sets, this algorithm takes constant time per output set. However, an algorithm with this time bound can be highly inefficient for graphs with more limited numbers of independent sets. For this reason, many researchers have studied algorithms that list all maximal independent sets in polynomial time per output <b>set.</b> <b>The</b> <b>time</b> per maximal independent set is proportional to that for matrix multiplication in dense graphs, or faster in various classes of sparse graphs.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the time}} of day or night in Paris was largely {{announced}} by the church bells; in 1789 there were 66 churches, 92 chapels, 13 abbeys and 199 convents, all of which rang their bells for regular services and prayers; sometimes a little early, sometimes a little late. A clock had also been installed in a tower of the palace on the Île de la Cité by Charles V in about 1370, and it also sounded the hour. Wealthy and noble Parisians began to have pocket watches, and needed a way to accurately <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> so sundials appeared around the city. The best known-sundial was in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. In 1750, the Duke of Chartres had a cannon installed there which, following the sundial, was fired precisely at noon each day.|$|E

25|$|Though {{publication}} was in 1975, and {{the novel}} was written over 30 years earlier, {{it remains to}} <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> period of the story, beyond summer time. The age of Hastings' daughter puts the story after the Second World War, as does the complete absence of war time conditions and restrictions (e.g., no mention of rationing or bombing in London), but nothing sets a specific post-war year. The bit of arithmetic to show the story is set post-war starts from the marriage of Arthur Hastings and Dulcie (Cinderella) Duveen {{at the end of}} The Murder on the Links (published in 1923), and some years needed for the births of their four children, of whom Judith, age 21, appears to be the youngest. The story was not rewritten to add more specific markers of the years post Second World War, such as car models, clothing styles, or world events. The story clearly ends Poirot's career, as he dies in the novel, using his death for a resolution he had never before considered for a murderer: to become one himself. Poirot's death was announced in the New York Times, a rare honor for a fictional character.|$|E

Maruyama, however, was mistaken. He and his troops were actually [...] south of the airfield. By the evening of 21 October, it was clear to Maruyama that his units would not be in position to attack the next day, so he postponed the attack to 23 October and put his men on half rations to conserve their dwindling food supply.

500|$|... "How Will I Know" [...] is {{composed}} in a 1980s dance beat. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "perky synth-funk".

The beat is <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> signature of common time and moves at a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song also has the sequence of G-Bm7-G/C-D-Em-D as its chord progression. Houston's vocals in the song span from the note of E4 to the high note of G5. Lyrically, the song speaks about the protagonist trying to discern whether a boy she likes will ever like her back. She is also hesitant, because her friends tell her [...] "love can be deceiving", and she is so shy that she cannot phone him. Later, she feels {{that it might be}} a dream, but realizes that [...] "there's no mistaking", and that what she feels is really love.|$|E
500|$|A {{critical}} playtest of {{the game}} occurred in January 2007, where initial feedback from the players was mostly negative, including issues of the setting being too dark, having no idea where to go, and distrusting Atlas, {{who at the time}} was voiced in a southern drawl, described as a [...] "lecherous Colonel Sanders". The team took this criticism to heart, revamping several elements during those extra months such as improving the lighting, implementing a quest marker, and using an Irish voice for Atlas to make him sound more trustworthy. During another late-stage playtest with the title [...] "ninety-nine percent" [...] complete according to Levine, the playtesters did not like the game at all as they felt no connection to the player-character Jack, and the person overseeing the tests told Levine that the game was likely to be a failure. At this point, BioShock did not have many cutscenes, as Levine was ideologically opposed to them. However, the following day, Levine and the lead group came up with a [...] "cheap" [...] way to correct this, by adding the initial cut scene within the plane and the subsequent plane crash, as this helped to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> frame, place the player {{in the role of the}} character, and alluded to the [...] "would you kindly" [...] line later in the game. Levine likened this approach to the initial aircraft crash at the onset of the television show Lost to quickly establish character and setting.|$|E
2500|$|According to James Gunn, one of Wells's major {{contributions}} to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his [...] "new system of ideas". In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as [...] "the plausible impossible" [...] and [...] "suspension of disbelief". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived {{the idea of using}} a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term [...] "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle. He explained that while writing The Time Machine, he realized that [...] "the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> Traveller were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts." [...] In [...] "Wells's Law", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the [...] "law" [...] appears in his introduction to The Scientific Romances of H.G. Wells (1933), ...|$|E

2500|$|The Militia Law of Arkansas as {{published}} in 1860 provided for a two-tiered militia system. [...] Section {{one of the}} law made all able-bodied free white male inhabitants {{between the ages of}} 18 and 45 liable for service. The militiamen were required to provide their own weapons and equipment and were to muster four times annually, including two company drills, one battalion muster, and one regimental muster. No provision was made for uniforms for the private militiamen, while officers were required to acquire and wear the uniform of the United States Army. Additionally, section 57 of the act allowed each county to raise up to four Volunteer Companies. These Volunteer Companies were to be either infantry, riflemen, cavalry, or artillery. While the Volunteer Companies were to be separate from the regular militia units, they remained under the supervision and authority of the local militia regimental commander, who was required to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and place of the election of officers for volunteer companies and certify their election to the governor. [...] Volunteer Companies were required to drill at least once per month (although the Pulaski Artillery, a Volunteer Artillery Company organized in Little Rock in December 1860, scheduled drill three times a week). Volunteer Companies were allowed to select and acquire their own uniforms and their officers were authorized to wear the uniform of the company. [...] While the standard militia units were organized into lettered companies organized roughly along township boundaries, Volunteer Companies usually adopted colorful names to set them apart. Membership in the Volunteer Companies was encouraged by the provision that once a militiaman had completed five years service in a Volunteer Company, he was exempted from further militia service.|$|E
2500|$|The law {{allowed the}} {{governor}} to appoint an adjutant general and a quartermaster general. [...] The militia was to {{be divided into two}} divisions, each commanded by a major general, and each division was divided into three brigades, each commanded by a brigadier general. [...] This organization was similar to the 1833 amendment passed by the territorial legislature, but now the general officers would be elected by the field grade officers of the militias instead of being appointed by the president. [...] The new law <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and place for the first election of general officers to occur in 1837. [...] Each officer was required to wear a sword and all officers above the company grade were required to wear the uniform of their equivalent in the United States Army. [...] The terms of service for officers were set at three years and provisions were made to allow election results to be contested. [...] Militiamen were required to attend two company musters, one battalion muster and one regimental muster each year. [...] Regiments were authorized and directed to conduct annual Courts Martial and provisions were made for the collections of fines levied by the Court Martial and payment {{of the members of the}} court. Parents and guardians were made liable for payment of fines on behalf of their children under the age of 21 who failed to appear at a designated muster. [...] Money raised by payment or collection of fines was to be utilized to purchase drums, fifes and Colors. [...] Commissioned officers were required to report to the local parade ground, with a rifle or musket, two days before the annual regimental muster for the purpose of receiving additional training to prepare them to drill their soldiers. The militia was to be trained in accordance with the regulations of the regular army of the United States. [...] First sergeants were required to call roll no later than 10 o'clock on each day appointed for a muster to determine the number present. The law limited the amount of time that a militiaman could be called to duty to six months per tour. Any officer was authorized to call out the militia in the event of sudden invasion or insurrection. [...] The law provided that copies of the law were to be printed and delivered to each officer, who was to hand his copy of the law to his successor upon leaving office. Many of the counties did not elect officers for their militia regiments until much later, some as late as 1845 on the eve of the war with Mexico.|$|E
