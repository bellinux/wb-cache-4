Again, in science, such inferences are always made to some limited (sometimes extremely high) degree of probability and in this case {{absence of evidence}} is evidence of absence when the positive evidence <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> but is not.|$|E

Rab Tosh o' Fleckie’s wife was heavy-footed at the time, and Doctor Munn had been a' nicht wi' her, {{and when he came}} to Barbie Water in the morning it was roaring wide frae bank to brae; where the brig <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> was naething but the swashing o' the yellow waves. Munn had to drive a' the way round to the Fechars brig, and in parts of the road, the water was so deep that it lapped his horse’s bellyband.|$|E
25|$|The steel barque Anjou ran ashore on Auckland Island on 5 February 1905. The 22 {{crew members}} made it ashore in Carnley Harbour on {{three of the}} ship's boats after rowing against strong currents. Ten days later they reached the depot at Camp Cove, which {{provided}} them with ample supplies {{as well as the}} shipping schedule of the Hinemoa so they knew how long they would have to wait for rescue. Captain Le Tellac commended the provisions that the government had left for the castaways, without which they would not have survived. (It was noted, however, that some of the supplies that <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> were missing; these were later recovered from the house of a Mr Glenning, a lessee of the island.) Reaching Norman Inlet on 7 May, Captain Bollons of the Hinemoa noticed signs that there were castaways, located them, and was able to pick them up from the island and carry them to Dunedin. Sailors from the Compadre and the Anjou engraved their names {{on the walls of the}} Camp Cove depot.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} {{interview}} he ever gave, in August 1970, Goddard told David Yallop that being Lord Chief Justice {{was not an}} easy job. When Yallop, who believed that Craig <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> imprisoned for manslaughter and Bentley thus cleared, asked Goddard about Derek Bentley's execution, he received the following reply, [...] "Yes, I thought that Bentley was going to be reprieved. He certainly <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>There's</b> {{no doubt in my mind}} whatsoever that Bentley <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reprieved".|$|R

500|$|When KAL007 did {{not reach}} Bethel at 50 minutes after takeoff, a {{military}} radar at King Salmon, Alaska, tracked KAL007 at [...] north of where it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>There</b> {{is no evidence to}} indicate that civil air traffic controllers or military radar personnel at Elmendorf Air Force Base (who were in a position to receive the King Salmon radar output) were aware of KAL007's deviation in real-time, and therefore able to warn the aircraft. It had exceeded its expected maximum deviation sixfold, [...] of error being the maximum expected drift from course if the inertial navigation system was activated.|$|E
500|$|Windows 8.1 {{received}} more positive reviews than Windows 8. Tom Warren of The Verge still considered the platform to be a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{due to the}} number of apps available, the impaired level of capabilities that apps have in comparison to desktop programs, and because he felt that mouse and keyboard navigation was still [...] "awkward". However, he touted many of the major changes on Windows 8.1, such as the expanded snapping functionality, increased Start screen customization, SkyDrive and Bing integration, improvements to stock apps, and particularly he considered the Mail app to be [...] "lightyears ahead" [...] of the original version from 8. He concluded that [...] "Microsoft has achieved a lot within 12 months, even a lot of the additions feel like they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> from the very start with Windows 8." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} Romantic tradition, in {{reaction}} to the spirit of the Enlightenment, folklorists collected folktales, epic poems, and ballads, and brought them out in printed form. [...] The Brothers Grimm were inspired in their collection, Grimm's Fairy Tales, by the movement of German Romanticism. [...] Many other collectors were inspired by the Grimms and the similar sentiments. [...] Frequently their motives stemmed not merely from Romanticism, but from Romantic nationalism, in that many were inspired to save their own country's folklore: [...] sometimes, as in the Kalevala, they compiled existing folklore into an epic to match other nation's; sometimes, as in Ossian, they fabricated folklore that <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b> [...] These works, whether fairy tale, ballads, or folk epics, were a major source for later fantasy works.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, {{during a}} news conference in Staten Island, Bloomberg {{declared}} his strong opposition to legislation proposed in Congress calling for a clear timetable for troop withdrawal. He said, [...] "We ask our young men and women to go over and to fight, {{and if you have a}} deadline knowing they're pulling out, how can you expect them to defend this country? How can you expect them to go out and put their lives at risk? I just think that's untenable and that this is not a responsible piece of legislation. It is totally separate of how we're conducting the war. It's totally separate of whether we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b> The issue that you asked about is plain and simple: Should the Congress pass a law forcing the president to withdraw troops at a given point in time? I think that is not something that is in the country's interest or in the military's interest." ...|$|E

The Milestone Award is given by the IIHF Hall of Fame to teams that have {{made significant contributions to}} international hockey. In 2012, Kharlamov's 1972 Summit Series Soviet Union team was given this honor. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the IIHF in 2008, a panel of experts named Kharlamov to the Centennial All-Star Team, along with 3 other Soviet stars, Vladislav Tretiak, Viacheslav Fetisov and Sergei Makarov. Kharlamov was {{inducted into}} the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2005. His induction was met with praise from one of the players who idolized him, Ilya Kovalchuk, who said [...] "He <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> many years ago. I think {{he was one of the}} best players in the world." [...] Kharlamov was the second Soviet trained player, after Tretiak, to be {{inducted into the}} Hall of Fame. Upon hearing the news of his father's induction, Alexander Kharlamov said [...] "I want to say thank you for remembering my father." [...] In 2014, Kharlamov was part of the inaugural class inducted into the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E

2500|$|By 1956, Jake and {{his family}} have moved to Miami. After he stays out all night at his new nightclub there, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce (which she has been {{planning}} since his retirement) as well as full custody of their kids. She also threatens to call the cops if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He tries and fails to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt instead of selling the belt itself. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he happens upon his estranged brother Joey, who forgives him, but is elusive. Returning to the opening scene in 1964, Jake refers to the [...] "I coulda been a contender" [...] scene from the 1954 film On the Waterfront starring Marlon Brando, complaining that his brother <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for him but is also keen enough to give himself some slack. After a stagehand informs him that the auditorium where he is about to perform is crowded, Jake starts to chant [...] "I'm the boss" [...] while shadowboxing.|$|E
