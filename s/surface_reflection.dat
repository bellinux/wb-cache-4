40|$|Spacecraft radar {{sounding}} signals at frequencies {{higher than the}} ionospheric peak plasma frequency are not reflected by the ionosphere. Instead, they {{make it to the}} ground where they are reflected by the planetary surface. We analyze the intensity of the <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> measured by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) ionospheric radar sounder on board the Mars Express spacecraft. Apart from the surface reflectivity and the spacecraft altitude, the detected intensity of <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> is controlled primarily by the signal attenuation during the ionospheric propagation. We focus on the nightside region, where the ionospheric densities in the main layer are too low to cause a significant attenuation and allow sampling of the <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> at frequencies down to 3 MHz. The attenuation occurs mainly at altitudes below 100 km, where the electron-neutral collision frequency is a maximum. The intensity of <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> can thus serve as a proxy for electron densities at low altitudes not accessible by the direct ionospheric {{radar sounding}}. We analyze the intensity of <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> as a function of relevant controlling parameters. The intensity of <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> is lower at higher solar zenith angles on the nightside and during the periods of larger solar activity. Moreover, it exhibits a seasonal variation that is related to the dust storm occurrence. The intensity of <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> is lower in areas of closed magnetic field lines, suggesting that nightside electron densities behave rather differently at low altitudes than at higher altitudes. This is confirmed by comparison with simultaneous observations of the main ionospheric layer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSea surface {{infrared}} reflectivity is {{an important}} parameter in oceanic remote sensing. Most analytical models consider single <b>surface</b> <b>reflections,</b> and the polarization is usually ignored. However, a loss of energy is reported for large observation angles (θ > 50 °) because multiple <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> are ignored. This article generalizes the infrared reflectivity derivation of Li et al. (Appl. Opt., Vol. 52, 6100 - 6111, 2013) for 1 D surfaces (2 D problems) to 2 D surfaces (3 D problems), so that the cross-polarization effect can be taken into account. The contributions of one and two successive <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> are analyzed separately. The bidirectional reflectivity and the hemispherical reflectivity are studied. It is shown that the sea surface infrared reflectivity is significant for large incidence and observation angles. The energy conservation criterion is then checked. The loss of energy is largely reduced after taking into account two <b>surface</b> <b>reflections...</b>|$|R

One technology uses aluminum composite reflector panels, achieving over 93% reflectivity and coated with a speciality coating for surface protection. Metal reflectors offer some advantages over glass reflectors, as they are lightweight and stronger than glass and relatively inexpensive. The ability to retain parabolic shape in reflectors is another advantage, and normally the subframe requirements are reduced by more than 300%. The top <b>surface</b> <b>reflection</b> coating allows for better efficiency.|$|E

[...] Observatory lore holds that nose grease was used to reduce stray light and reflections in transmissive telescopes before the development of vacuum antireflective coatings.

The same effect is sometimes used by numismatic hobbyists to alter the apparent grade of slightly worn coins.|$|E
50|$|In the {{detection}} sub-process location and property vectors are recorded to allow particle localization for ejection and material classification for discrimination purposes. All detection technologies applied {{have in common}} to be cheap, contactless and fast. The technologies are subdivided in transmitting and reflecting groups, the first measuring the inner content of a particle while the later only uses the <b>surface</b> <b>reflection</b> for discrimination. Surface, or reflection technologies have the disadvantage that the surfaces need to be representing the content, thus need to be clean from clay and dust adhesions. But by default <b>surface</b> <b>reflection</b> technologies violate the Fundamental Sampling Principle because not all components of a particle have the same probability of being detected. The main transmitting technologies are EM (Electromagnetics) and XRT (X-ray-Transmission). EM detection {{is based on the}} conductivity of the material passing an alternating electromagnetic field. The principle of XRT is widely known through the application in medical diagnostics and airport luggage scanners. The main surface or reflection technologies are traditionally X-ray luminescence detectors capturing the fluorescence of diamonds under the excitation of X-ray radiation and color cameras detecting brightness and colour difference. Spectroscopic methods such as near-infrared spectroscopy known from remote sensing in exploration in mining for decades, have found their way into industrial scale sensor-based sorters. Advantage of the application of near-infrared spectroscopy is that the evidence can be measured on the presence of specific molecular bonds, thus minerals composition of the near-infrared active minerals. There is more detection technologies available on industrial scale sensor-based ore sorters. Readers that want to go into detail can find more in the literature.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, a California {{medical device}} manufacturer, 3Gen, {{introduced}} the first polarized dermatoscope, the DermLite.

With the marketing of polarised dermatoscopes, dermatoscopy increased in popularity among physicians worldwide. Although images produced by polarised light dermatoscopes are slightly different from those produced by a traditional skin contact glass dermatoscope, they have certain advantages, such as vascular patterns not being potentially missed through compression of the skin by a glass contact plate.|$|E

50|$|In August 2013, {{during a}} {{recollection}} of the patent, Dr. Biard stated the following:The first diodes that we saw emitting light were not designed to be LEDs. They were varactor diodes and tunnel diodes, which had all of the N-type surface and P-type surface covered with Ohmic contact to achieve a low series resistance. At the time, the varactor diodes had an etched mesa geometry and the IR light came out {{around the edge of}} the mesa. On the tunnel diodes, the light could be seen at the edges of the chip. They did not emit very much light, but it was enough for us to see with the IR image converter microscope. That led us to create a structure in which the N-type surface of the chip had spaced contacts, so the light emitted at the junction could be emitted from most of the top surface of the chip. Gary made those spaced N-type Ohmic contacts by tin plating metal wires and alloying the tin on the surface of the wire to the N-type GaAs surface. With a rectangular chip of GaAs, most of the light emitted at the junction was reflected at the exit surface. The index of refraction of GaAs is 3.6 and air has an index of 1.0. This means that ~97% of the light emitted at the junction is totally internally reflected at the exit surface. The highest quantum efficiency that can be expected from a rectangular LED chip is ~2%, even with an anti-reflection coating on the optical exit surface. This total internal reflection problem led us to come up with the hemispherical dome LED. In this diode the N-type GaAs substrate is shaped into a hemisphere and the hemispherical surface is covered with an anti-reflection coating (preferably silicon nitride) to minimize front <b>surface</b> <b>reflection.</b> The LED P-N junction is in the center of the flat face of the hemisphere. The central P-type region is covered with the anode Ohmic contact. The cathode Ohmic contact was a donut shape that covered most of the remainder of the N-type flat surface of the hemisphere. By making the diameter of the hemisphere 3.6 times larger than the diameter of the P-type layer, all the light at the exit surface of the hemisphere was inside the critical angle for total internal reflection. This resulted in a huge increase in quantum efficiency because up to 50% of the light emitted at the junction could escape from the chip at the hemispherical exit surface. The other half of the light went toward the P-type Ohmic contact and was absorbed in the GaAs. The absorption in the thicker N-type GaAs between the junction and exit surface resulted in less improvement in quantum efficiency than what we had hoped for, however, the dome LEDs were much more efficient.|$|E
