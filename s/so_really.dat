5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. <b>So,</b> <b>really,</b> I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and <b>so</b> <b>really</b> I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

[...] During the making of the album Vedder considered the title Superun-owned, a play on Soundgarden's 1994 album, Superunknown. He explained, [...] "We're un-owned. We want to remain un-owned." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{accompanying}} Songz on 106 & Park when promoting, Ready, Drake {{explained the}} video, stating: [...] "The {{concept of the}} video {{is the fact that}} 'successful,' it applies to so many people that me and Trey just want to get the point across that we see ourselves and we see success in other individuals <b>so</b> <b>really,</b> it's a video about potential. It's a video about understanding that no matter what you do, there's a way to be successful doing it. It's one of those motivational videos. It actually ends with a quote from Barack Obama which {{is one of my favorite}} quotes I've ever read, so we decided to put it in the video. It's vivid." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore and Gibbons {{designed}} Watchmen {{to showcase}} the unique {{qualities of the}} comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths. In a 1986 interview, Moore said, [...] "What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that Watchmen {{was designed to be}} read [...] "four or five times", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, [...] "s it progressed, Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin, a gimmick [...] <b>So</b> <b>really</b> the plot itself is of no great consequence [...] it just really isn't the most interesting thing about Watchmen. As we actually came to tell the tale, that's where the real creativity came in." ...|$|E
500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, <b>so</b> <b>really</b> I just kind of wandered around {{for about a month}} not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E

It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, <b>so</b> <b>really</b> there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E

2500|$|A four funnel liner, four funnelled liner or four stacker is {{an ocean}} liner with four funnels. The SS Great Eastern, {{launched}} on 31 January 1858 (a full 40 {{years ahead of}} any comparable ships), was the only ocean liner to sport five funnels. As one funnel was later removed, the Great Eastern, by default, became the first ocean liner to have four funnels. However, after the Great Eastern became a four funnel ship she never carried passengers <b>so</b> <b>really</b> {{should not be considered}} the first four funnel liner. [...] The SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, launched on 4 May 1897, was properly the first ocean liner to have four funnels {{and was one of the}} first of the golden era of ocean liners that became prominent in the early- to mid-20th century. The most famous four funnel liners are the RMS Titanic, which sank after striking an iceberg on her maiden voyage on 14 April 1912, and the RMS Lusitania, which was torpedoed on 7 May 1915 during the First World War.|$|E

2500|$|Cecil's killing went largely unnoticed in the animal's native Zimbabwe. The country's The Chronicle {{newspaper}} wrote: [...] "It {{is not an}} overstatement {{that almost}} 99.99 percent of Zimbabweans didn’t know about this animal until Monday. Now we have just learnt, thanks to the British media, that we had Africa’s most famous lion all along, an icon!" [...] The BBC's Farai Sevenzo wrote: [...] "The lion's death has not registered much with the locals". [...] At the same time, Zimbabwean officials stated that the killing of Cecil had already caused a decrease of tourism revenues. A significant decrease was noted in Hwange, where the lion had lived. Many international tourists, who had planned to see the lion, had cancelled their trips. [...] "This killing is a huge loss to our tourism sector that was contributing immensely to the national wealth", said Emanuel Fundira, {{the president of the}} Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe. [...] "We had a lot of people, in terms of visitors, coming in to the country to enjoy and view Cecil, <b>so</b> <b>really</b> this was a great loss," [...] Fundira said, and that Cecil's presence was [...] "a draw card," [...] and compared his death to [...] "the demise of an icon". The director of the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, Karikoga Kaseke, said that tourism had been booming, but that Zimbabwe was now perceived as a country which was not interested in protecting and promoting animal rights, and this had also had a negative effect on the tourism sector.|$|E
