6000|$|... "Where's {{that deep}} lead? Over with it, you there!" [...] Captain Davenport held the lead line {{and watched it}} <b>sag</b> <b>off</b> to the northeast. [...] "There, look at that! Take hold of it for yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the middle}} of the next {{afternoon}} saw despair and mutiny on her smoking deck. The current had accelerated, the wind had slackened, and the Pyrenees had <b>sagged</b> <b>off</b> to the west. The lookout sighted Barclay de Tolley to the eastward, barely visible from the masthead, and vainly and for hours the PYRENEES tried to beat up to it. Ever, like a mirage, the cocoanut trees hovered on the horizon, visible only from the masthead. From the deck they were hidden by the bulge of the world.|$|R
5000|$|... "Here Comes the Sun" [...] {{was written}} {{at the time}} when Apple was getting like school, where we had to go and be businessmen: 'Sign this' and 'sign that.' Anyway, it seems as if winter in England goes on forever, by the time spring comes you really deserve it. So one day I decided I was going to <b>sag</b> <b>off</b> Apple and I went over to Eric Clapton's house. The relief of not having to go see all those dopey {{accountants}} was wonderful, and I walked around the garden with one of Eric's acoustic guitars and wrote [...] "Here Comes the Sun".|$|R
60|$|But {{the wind}} was light, the Pyrenees' bottom was foul, {{and she could not}} beat up against the strong {{westerly}} current. At the end of two hours she had lost three miles. The sailors worked eagerly, as if by main strength they could compel the PYRENEES against the adverse elements. But steadily, port tack and starboard tack, she <b>sagged</b> <b>off</b> to the westward. The captain paced restlessly up and down, pausing occasionally to survey the vagrant smoke wisps and to trace them back to the portions of the deck from which they sprang. The carpenter was engaged constantly in attempting to locate such places, and, when he succeeded, in calking them tighter and tighter.|$|R
500|$|After {{several dozen}} glass {{manufacturing}} firms were interviewed, L. E. Smith Glass Company {{emerged as the}} company to produce 22,500glass blocks near the upper limit {{of the size of}} press glass formed from hand-poured molten glass and cast iron molds. [...] The process used sand and soda ash heated to a temperature of [...] and [...] "gathered" [...] with a large clay ball resembling a honey dipper. Rather than use a standard plunger to ensure the glass that <b>sagged</b> <b>off</b> the rod spread to the corners of the mold, they relied on gravity. [...] The full mold was annealed (reheated in an oven to [...] ) and cooled. [...] Over the course of four months of production, about 350 blocks were produced per day.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] he decided, [...] "I don't {{want you}} to suffer any inconvenience. Besides, I am going to Washington this afternoon. You can keep on selling {{as long as the}} market's steady. Directly it <b>sags,</b> hold <b>off.</b> If necessary, even buy a few more. You {{understand}} me? Don't sell a single block under to-day's price. Keep the market at that figure. It's an easy job, because next week Anglo-French will go up again." ...|$|R
500|$|Lowe and Hanton busked {{through the}} song, which {{was cut short}} by Phillips waving his hands to {{indicate}} that the cutting needle was getting close to the centre of the acetate. He then handed the band a fragile 78rpm 10-inch acetate record. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and planned to put it up for auction at Sotheby's, but sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. McCartney later had the two songs digitally re-mastered and pressed 50 copies, giving them to friends as a Christmas present, although the two songs were released on 21 November 1995, as part of The Beatles Anthology (Anthology 1). McCartney later said, [...] "The strangest thing for me, listening to it, is that it's like drowning, it's like your life flashing by in front of you. From the earliest things by me and John when we used to <b>sag</b> <b>off</b> school and the earliest demo tape we ever made, to the first little record we made which was a version of John singing [...] "That'll Be The Day", and a little song of mine [...] on the other side that's never been released before." ...|$|R
50|$|Both {{semifinal}} playoff rounds {{provided some}} great moments. Sag Harbor and Center Moriches {{were engaged in}} two tightly contested extra inning contests. Game 1 was scoreless for 12 innings, until the Battlecats scored three runs <b>off</b> <b>Sag</b> Harbor closer Jacob Bodner (Xavier) for a 3-0 win the 13th inning. Game 2 was tied at 2-2 {{in the bottom of}} the 10th when Zach Persky (Rollins) drove home the winning run for the Battlecats to upset the Whalers and advance Center Moriches to the HCBL Championship.|$|R
5000|$|De Lappe {{remembered the}} {{contrast}} between Lawrence's indifferent singing voice and the force of her performance: [...] I used to listen to Gertrude Lawrence on the public address system every night in our dressing rooms, and she'd get onto a note and <b>sag</b> down <b>off</b> of it. The night after I left the show to go into Paint Your Wagon, Yul Brynner gave me house seats and I saw her from the front and I was so taken by her. She had such a star quality, you didn't care if she sang off-key. She more than dominated the stage. Boy, was that a lesson to me. Lawrence had not yet discovered that she was dying from liver cancer, and her weakened condition was exacerbated by the demands of her role. At the age of 52, she was required to wear dresses weighing 75 lb while walking or dancing a total of 4 mi during a 3Â½ hour performance eight times a week. Lawrence {{found it hard to}} bear the heat in the theatre during the summer months. Understudy Constance Carpenter began replacing her in matinee performances. Later in the year Lawrence's strength returned, and she resumed her full schedule, but by Christmas she was battling pleurisy and suffering from exhaustion. She entered the hospital for a full week of tests. Just nine months before her death, the cancer still was not detected. In February 1952, bronchitis felled her for another week, and her husband Richard Aldrich asked Rodgers and Hammerstein if they would consider closing the show for Easter week to give her a chance to recover fully. They denied his request, but agreed to replace her with the original Ado Annie from Oklahoma!, Celeste Holm, for six weeks during the summer. Meanwhile, Lawrence's performances were deteriorating, prompting audiences to become audibly restive. Rodgers and Hammerstein prepared a letter, never delivered, advising her that [...] "eight times a week you are losing the respect of 1,500 people". In late August, Lawrence fainted following a matinee and was admitted to the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. She slipped into a coma and died on September 6, 1952, aged 54. Her autopsy revealed liver cancer. On the day of her funeral, the performance of The King and I was cancelled. The lights of Broadway and the West End were dimmed; she was buried in the ball gown she wore during Act 2.|$|R
