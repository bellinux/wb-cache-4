In this paper, I argue that governments often reorganize their bureaucracies precisely to ameliorate the agency problems that past governments have imposed upon them. To illustrate the principal lines of argument, I trace the lifecycles of all agencies in the Swedish executive administration between 1960 and 2014 and show that they suffer considerably greater risk of termination when an ideological opponent of the government is responsible for appointing their heads. Because all agency heads serve on fixed-terms in the Swedish case, all incoming governments are bound to inherit the appointees of their predecessors. However, only in some situations are they bound to inherit the appointees of opposing groups—namely, following partisan shifts in government.

The properties focused on were thermal conductivity (λ), thermal resistance (R), and thermal diffusivity (D). The results for PSW panels {{were compared with}} those for commercial wood-based boards, solid wood, and commercial insulators. The λ values were measured for PSW panels and their core and face elements. As a result, the composite theory of λ {{was found to be}} appropriate for PSW composites, because the calculated/experimental λ ratios were approximately 90 %. The λ values for PSW panels with densities of 340 kg/m 3 (PSW 350) and 410 kg/m 3 (PSW 400) were 0.070 and 0.077 W/mK, respectively. The R values for PSW 350 and PSW 400 were 1.4 and 1.2 m 2 K/W, and the D values were 0.00050 and 0.00046 m 2 /h, respectively. Consequently, the PSW provided thermal insulation properties superior to those of the boards and in terms of warmth-keeping properties were greatly advantageous over the insulators. These advantages were due to the moderate densities of PSW panels. The PSW panel with sufficient thickness showed remarkably improved thermal resistance compared with those of the boards.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{relatively}} recent innovation in building component systems for housing, Structural Insulated Panels systems (SIPs) are fast gaining popularity in North America and Europe. A prefabricated structural element, SIPs {{can be used}} for walls, roofs and floors without the requirement for framing. Hailed as a ‘green building product ’ and promoted as environmentally sustainable, the <b>Structural</b> <b>Insulation</b> Panel Association claims in its website that SIPs create a ‘green ’ home through: • Energy efficiency and renewable energy • Waste reduction during the construction process • Creation of healthy indoor environments While these claims have validity when SIPs are compared to light timber framed construction, SIPs still have a high environmental footprint, are not biodegradable and typically contain chemicals that are considered hazardous. This paper looks at emerging research into ‘BioSIPs’, biologically based Structural Insulated Panel systems, to compare the attributes and assess the disadvantages of these potentially new ‘green ’ building components. It does this by comparing the performance of a typical Structural Insulated Panel system with a variety of BioSIPs. It then goes on to consider which components of SIPs could be improved on and identifies how this could be achieved {{in the context of the}} New Zealand environment...|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{concrete}} {{takes the}} lead in the world of construction as a <b>structural</b> <b>insulation</b> material used in the construction and reconstruction of buildings and constructions of various purposes. In this artificial stone building material, pores are distributed relatively evenly and occupy from 20 to 90 % of the concrete volume, ensuring good thermal qualities, which allows cellular concrete houses to keep warmth well. For production of cellular concrete, Portland cement, “burnt lime”, and fine-pulverized blast furnace slags, with a hardening activator are used as binders. As silica components, quartz sand or “fly ash” obtained by combustion of pulverized fuel in power plants as well as secondary products of different ore dressing treatments are used. The low density and high thermal insulation properties of cellular concrete enables 3 times lighter wall weight than the weight of brick walls and 1. 7 times lighter than the walls of ceramsite concrete. Thermal insulation and mechanical properties of cellular concrete make possible to construct of it single-layer protecting structures with the desired thermal resistance.

Fibrosis developed after 6 months. Nodular scars and perifocal emphysema were seen after 12 months. Four rats had a papillary adenoma in a major bronchus after 18 months exposure to PUF II. There is widespread usage of polyurethane foam in the insulation and construction industries. The potential for exposure of workers to dusts generated during cutting operations led Laskin and co-workers to initiate inhalation studies with freshly generated polyurethane foam dusts. (1).

40|$|At Langley Research Center, Erik Weiser and {{his colleagues}} in the Advanced Materials and Processing Branch were working with a new {{substance}} for fabricating composites for use in supersonic aircraft. The team, however, was experiencing some frustration. Every time they tried to create a solid composite from the polyimide (an advanced polymer) material, it bubbled and foamed. It seemed like the team had reached a dead end in their research - until they had another idea. "We said, This isn t going to work for composites, but maybe we could make a foam out of it," Weiser says. "That was kind of our eureka moment, {{to see if we could}} go in a whole other direction. And it worked. " Weiser {{and his colleagues}} invented a new kind of polyimide foam insulation they named TEEK. The innovation displayed a host of advantages over existing insulation options. Compared to other commercial foams, Weiser explains, polyimide foams perform well across a broad range of temperatures, noting that the NASA TEEK foams provide effective <b>structural</b> <b>insulation</b> up to 600 F and down to cryogenic temperatures. The foam does not burn or off-gas toxic fumes, and even at - 423 F - the temperature of liquid hydrogen - the material stays flexible. The inventors could produce the TEEK foam at a range of densities, from 0. 5 pounds per cubic foot up to 20 pounds per cubic foot, making the foam ideal for a range of applications, including as insulation for reusable launch vehicles and for cryogenic tanks and lines. They also developed a unique, friable balloon format for manufacturing the foam, producing it as hollow microspheres that allowed the foam to be molded and then cured into any desired shape - perfect for insulating pipes of different sizes and configurations.

40|$|The primary {{application}} for cryogenic insulating foams will be fuel tank applications for fueling systems. It {{is crucial for}} this insulation to be incorporated into systems that survive vacuum and terrestrial environments. It is hypothesized that by forming an open-cell silica-reinforced polymer structure, the foam structures will exhibit the necessary strength to maintain shape. This will, in turn, maintain the insulating capabilities of the foam insulation. Besides mechanical stability {{in the form of}} crush resistance, it is important for these insulating materials to exhibit water penetration resistance. Hydrocarbon-terminated foam surfaces were implemented to impart hydrophobic functionality that apparently limits moisture penetration through the foam. During the freezing process, water accumulates on the surfaces of the foams. However, when hydrocarbon-terminated surfaces are present, water apparently beads and forms crystals, leading to less apparent accumulation.
