40|$|Abstract. Lightweight materials, such as {{aluminum}} die castings, {{are used}} {{more and more}} for automotive applications. Due to the limited weldability, joining these materials by <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> has been established. The challenge {{in this regard is}} that these materials, especially new high strength aluminum die castings, have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining by forming of these materials can be accompanied by cracks, which develop during the forming operation.

40|$|The hybrid use of {{dissimilar}} lightweight materials, such as {{aluminum alloy}} and advanced {{high strength steel}} (AHSS), has become a critical approach to reduce the weight of ground transportation vehicles. <b>Self-piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> (SPR) as a preferred cold-forming fastening method is facing problems like weak interlocking and insufficient penetration, due to the reduced formability of AHSS. In this paper, a new process named electroplas-tic <b>self-piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> (EP-SPR) was proposed to reduce the deformation resistance of AHSS DP 780, by applying a direct current (dc) to it during the riveting process. The influence of dc on force and displacement characteristics throughout the riveting process, joint physical attributes and quasi-static performances for two sheet combinations, e. g., AA 6061 -T 6 to DP 780 (combination 1) and DP 780 to AA 6061 -T 6 (combination 2), were studied and compared with the traditional SPR joints.

40|$|<b>Self-piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> (SPR) {{is a cold}} {{mechanical}} joining process used to join two or more {{sheets of}} materials by driving a rivet piercing through the top sheet or the top and middle sheets and subsequently lock into the bottom sheet {{under the guidance of}} a suitable die. SPR is currently the main joining method for aluminium and mixed-material lightweight automotive structures. SPR was originated half century ago, but it only had significant progress in the last 25 years due to the requirement of joining lightweight materials, such as aluminium alloy structures, aluminium-steel structures and other mixed-material structures, from the automotive industry. Compared with other conventional joining methods, SPR has many advantages including no pre-drilled holes required, no fume, no spark and low noise, no surface treatment required, ability to join multi-layer materials and mixed materials and ability to produce joints with high static and fatigue strengths. In this paper, research investigations that have been conducted on <b>self-piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> will be extensively reviewed. The current state and development of SPR process is reviewed and the influence of the key process parameters on joint quality is discussed.

40|$|Advanced {{lightweight}} materials, such as {{high strength}} aluminium and magnesium alloys, are used in an expanding range of engineering applications, {{such as in the}} transport sector, machine and equipment construction or the general construction industry. Thermal welding of these materials is, in contrast to steel, problematic since it severely affects both the static and fatigue resistance of the joint and the base material. This has strengthened the demand for more suitable joining techniques without heat input. The focus of the present research is on the application of two of the most important conventional cold joining techniques (clinching and <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting)</b> for these new emerging lightweight materials. The challenge in this regard is that these materials have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining these materials can be accompanied by cracks which develop during the forming operation. This situation has limited the use of these materials and of the joining processes in the past. The aim of the project was to develop rules and guidelines based on scientific results determining either how cracks induced by clinching or <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> can be avoided or which cracks are acceptable. Therefore, the damage behaviour of lightweight materials, such as aluminium and magnesium, during the clinching and <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> process was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The results from the project can be summarized as follows:Depending on the joining parameters and location in the component, different damages can occur during clinching or <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> of materials with limited ductility. The relationships between joining parameters and the risk for damages in the closing head or part edge are demonstrated in this report and the risk for joining process-induced damages can be minimized by choosing the suitable joining tools. For all material combinations considered within this project it could not be observed that the joining process-induced damages {{have a negative effect on}} the resulting joint strength. This was determined for quasi-static and cyclic loads for both clinching as well as <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting.</b> In the numerical investigations regarding the damage modelling it was determined that the damage location as well as the level can be calculated by simple as well as complex fracture models. However, calculation of crack propagation in the die-sided part for clinching or <b>self-pierce</b> <b>riveting</b> using FEM is only possible to a limited extent...|$|R
