The bearings and their oilfilms are approximated {{to a set of}} non-linear elastic springs and dampers rotating relative to the shaft when it is subjected to a rotating unbalance or inner race surface waviness. Under gravity load, the shaft’s initial vibration is damped down to a limit cycle operating at a quasi-simple harmonic frequency of small amplitude. Rotating unbalance and surface features introduce further signijjcantfrequencies which influence the output response.

40|$|Estimates {{of forest}} stand mean height using {{airborne}} LiDAR (light detection and ranging) instruments {{have been reported}} previously with accuracies comparable to traditional ground-based measurements. However, the small area covered by a LiDAR sensor in a single aircraft overpass is a significant hindrance for large-scale forest inventories. In comparison, airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) systems are also able to make estimates of surface height, but the swath coverage is often far greater, typically five or ten {{times that of the}} LiDAR coverage. A set of interferometric data takes was acquired by the ESAR airborne sensor over a managed pine plantation at Thetford Forest, UK. Scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> estimates were made from two single-pass X-band acquisitions and polarimetric repeat-pass L-band acquisitions and compared with height estimates made from a separate LiDAR acquisition. The relationship between the scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>heights</b> and stand top heights estimated, and the accuracy of stand top height estimates estimated from InSAR and LiDAR is quantified by the root mean square error (rmse). General yield class models by the Forestry Commission (UK) were used to estimate stand top height from a GIS database used for forest management. The longer wavelength L-band radiation penetrates deeper into the canopy than the X-band, and the scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> is affected by both forest structural parameters (canopy density, understorey, and gaps) and sensor parameters (look-angle and reduced coherence through temporal and volume decorrelation). Consequently, a simple translation of scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> into stand top height gives noisy results for L-band, with observed rmse values between ± 3. 1 m in the near-range and ± 6. 4 m in the far-range. The X-band based top height estimates are more accurate, with rmse between ± 2. 9 m in the near- and ± 4. 1 m in the far-range, which can be further reduced by an empirical incidence angle correction. Stand top height estimates from LiDAR achieved an rmse of only ± 2. 0 m. The X-band scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>heights</b> have also been related to mean stand height and are comparable with heights observed from the LiDAR sensor and field measurements. An rmse of ± 2. 5 m for the mean stand height estimates based on the X-band dataset was found. Finally, we briefly discuss error propagation from the use of a terrain model, here provided by the Ordnance Survey...|$|R

40|$|GeoSAR is {{a unique}} dual-band, {{interferometric}} SAR (DBInSAR) sensor capable of collecting single-pass, X-band (VV) and P-band (HH) interferometric data simultaneously. In this paper we examine the dependence of the P-band HH interferometric phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> upon forest and terrain parameters. We develop a simple model for P-band GeoSAR observations, and use the model {{to show how the}} elevation in P-band HH phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> above true ground height is related to the volume-to-ground scattering ratio. GeoSAR is not fully-polarimetric, but records cross-polar (HV) returns at P-band (although not interferometrically). We conjecture that these returns are dominated by direct-volume scattering and related to the direct-volume HH backscatter. We use this relationship to model the dependence of the P-band HH DTM height upon the HV/HH ratio, and the difference in X-band DEM with P-band DTM heights. The relationships are examined using simulated forest InSAR data, and a model is proposed for ground-height and tree-height estimation using DBInSAR that does not require full polarimetry...|$|R

The effect of drum diameter, drum length, rotating speed, oil lm thickness, oil properties, and drum <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> above the oil/water interface surface were analyzed with respect to oil recovery rate of the drum skimmer. Crude, diesel, SAE 10 W and SAE 140 W oils were used during this investigation. It was found that oil recovery rate increases with increasing drum diameter, drum length, drum <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> above the oil/water interface, and oil slick thickness oil viscosity, and increases as oil density and surface tension decreases. The results revealed that the drum skimmer is an effective device for recovering spills of low viscosity oil, such as light crude oil, which is the type of oil involved in most serious spills and pollutions of the sea. Furthermore, an empirical equation is proposed for predicting the oil recovery rate of the device. The equation can be applied to different oils, and gives good agreement with observed data...|$|R

In this study, three semielliptic sections of aspect ratio 0. 8 were used for Savonius bucket while the Darrieus blade used three wings of airfoil NACA 0015.

If it is not parallel to the propeller shaft and stern tube bearings, {{the magnitude of the}} maximum oil film pressure generated in the bearing increases significantly. The magnitude of the maximum oil film pressure generated is greatly affected by the attitude angle of the shaft. As the attitude angle of the shaft is varied from 90 to 180 degrees, the maximum oil film pressure gradually increases. If the eccentricity at the centre of the bearing, the angle of the <b>shaft</b> <b>centre</b> relative to the bearing centre and the attitude angle of the shaft can be determined, then it is possible to quantitatively determine the maximum oil film pressure taking the elastic deformation of the bearing into account by the method described in this paper...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{experimental data}} {{have demonstrated the}} severity of idling gear rattle depends {{not only on the}} amplitude, but also the phase of an external sinusoidal forcing. One possible explanation for this is in small tooth profile errors. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis, by deriving an equation of motion incorporating an error function and losses at the mesh interface, values of which are obtained from experimental data. By solving the equations of motion, theoretical gear rattle trajectories are obtained. Theoretical and experimental trajectories are then compared, by way of time domain plots as well as via contour plots linking the amplitude of backlash oscillation to the amplitude and phase of input forcing. For most profile error functions, good agreement is achieved between the model and experimental data. In the case where the profile errors are dominated by misalignment between the gear and <b>shaft</b> <b>centres</b> agreement is less good and suggestions of areas of further study required for model refinement are proposed. <br/...|$|R
