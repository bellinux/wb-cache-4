5|$|A {{designer}} named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming he}} developed the <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a <b>Solid</b> <b>State,</b> allowing him {{to move into the}} society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal.|$|E

5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its <b>solid</b> <b>state,</b> {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|If general {{relativity}} {{were considered to}} be one of the two pillars of modern physics, then quantum theory, the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> physics, would be the other.

40|$|Closely {{related to}} the quantum {{information}} processing in <b>solid</b> <b>states,</b> we study the quantum measurement of single electron state by a mesoscopic charge-sensitive detector, namely the quantum point contact (QPC). We find that the conventional Lindblad-type master equation is not appropriate for describing the underlying measurement dynamics. The treatment developed in this work properly accounts for the energy-exchange between the detector and the measured system, and its role on the detailed-balance relation. A valid description for the QPC measurement dynamics is provided which may have impact {{on the study of}} quantum measurement and quantum feedback control in <b>solid</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

5|$|Togusa tracks {{down one}} of the missing children, now {{assigned}} to an elderly man in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the <b>Solid</b> <b>State.</b> Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.|$|E

40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{spectra of}} (CH 3) 2 PH and (CD 3) 2 PH {{have been studied}} and assignments made. In the infrared, the region between 4000 and 33 wavelength/cm was recorded for the gaseous and <b>solid</b> <b>states,</b> while Raman spectra from 3500 to 10 wavelength/cm in the gaseous, liquid and <b>solid</b> <b>states</b> were observed. There is some evidence of weak hydrogen bonding, based {{on the behavior of}} the phosphorus-hydrogen stretching and bending modes. There also appears to be considerable interaction between the methyl rocking and phosphorus-carbon stretching modes. The a double prime and a prime torsional modes appear to be accidentally degenerate at 182 and 142 wavelength/cm for the 'light' and 'heavy' compounds, respectively. This gives barriers of 2. 14 and 2. 30 kcal/mole, respectively...|$|R
5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E

50|$|For {{atoms and}} nonpolar molecules, the London {{dispersion}} force {{is the only}} intermolecular force, and is responsible for their existence in liquid and <b>solid</b> <b>states.</b> For polar molecules, this force is {{one part of the}} van der Waals force, along with forces between the permanent molecular dipole moments.|$|R
30|$|We {{employed}} an {{easy and}} direct method {{to measure the}} thermal conductivity of epoxy in the liquid (nanofluid) and <b>solid</b> (nanocomposite) <b>states</b> using both rodlike and platelet-like carbon-based nanostructures. Comparing the experimental results with the theoretical model, an anomalous enhancement was obtained with multiwall carbon nanotubes, probably due to their layered structure and lowest surface resistance. Puzzling results for functionalized graphene sheet nanocomposites suggest that phonon coupling of the vibrational modes of the graphene and of the polymeric matrix plays a dominant role on the thermal conductivities of the liquid and <b>solid</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this research, the {{synthesis}} of boron-ketoiminate-containing polymers is reported with large molecular weights ([Mn] = 20 000) and their optical properties are examined by UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectrometries.

These optical properties {{can be explained by}} a donor-acceptor interaction between the boron ketoiminate and the electron-donating comonomer such as fluorene or bithiophene. Furthermore, in the <b>solid</b> <b>states,</b> their emission colors can be successfully tuned from blue to orange by the substituents on the nitrogen atom with the difference of the steric hindrance (λ [PL, THF] = 464 - 546 nm, λ [PL, film] = 486 - 604 nm) ...|$|R
5|$|In the <b>solid</b> <b>state,</b> flerovium is {{expected}} to be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density variously predicted to be either 22g·cm−3 or 14g·cm−3. The electron of the hydrogen-like flerovium ion (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Fl113+) {{is expected}} to move so fast that it has a mass 1.79 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like lead and tin are expected to be 1.25 and 1.073 respectively. Flerovium would form weaker metal–metal bonds than lead and would be adsorbed less on surfaces.|$|E
