50|$|The Convention {{does not}} {{consider}} saving lives to be part <b>of</b> <b>salvage,</b> but {{the protection of the}} environment is part <b>of</b> <b>salvage.</b> Oil pollution can cause damage to the environment. If the salvor prevents oil pollution from happening, he indeed performs a valuable service to the community as mentioned by (1997) 1 Lloyd's Rep 323 (HL), pp 326-28. Therefore, the salvor will be rewarded with special compensation, i.e., liability <b>salvage</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>property</b> <b>salvage.</b>|$|R

50|$|With the {{acceptance}} of the Act on Civil Protection and Civil Defence in January 2004 an integral system has become operational in Switzerland that serves to master natural and technological disasters rapidly and at low cost by integrating all relevant forces in a modular fashion. The main objective here is to minimise damage to life and limb or cultural property. The most important partner for the protection <b>of</b> cultural <b>property</b> are - apart from the civil defence and the police - the fire services. Their cooperation has been intensified since 2004. Together with representatives from the Swiss Conference of Fire Brigade Inspectors (SFIK) sequences, documents and strategies have been defined that enable optimum cooperation <b>of</b> cultural <b>property</b> protection and fire services. The cultural property rescue system (‘Curesys’) integrates cultural assets in the event of damage into fire brigade operations in order to ensure the most conservative <b>salvage</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>property</b> possible.The military may also become an important partner for the protection <b>of</b> cultural <b>property</b> because troops can be called in for subsidiary operations in the event of natural incidents for example.|$|R

He was present for the launch of the support committee for Sassou Nguesso's candidacy on 6 February 2002, and on that occasion he elaborated his view that Sassou Nguesso was [...] "a symbol of hope, peace and freedom" [...] by symbolically assigning a positive characteristic to each letter of the name [...] "Sassou", in French: [...] "S is for security (sécurité), A is for joy (allégresse), S is for concern for others (souci des autres), S is for the <b>salvage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> the people of Mfilou (sauvetage des biens des gens de Mfilou), O is for organizer of peace (organisateur de la paix), and U is for national unity (unité nationale)".
