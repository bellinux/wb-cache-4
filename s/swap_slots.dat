40|$|As the {{business}} plans of European and US legacy carriers mature and adapt to deregulation, open skies and competition from LCCs, new strategies have developed to feed hubs and operate the route system in efficient and more cost effective ways.

500|$|The user {{interface}} design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis {{originally intended to}} integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, {{it was decided that}} the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered [...] "clunky and slow", was replaced in preference of a list system. Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to <b>swap</b> and <b>slot</b> weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. [...] "This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that we all had to be pretty creative in how things were designed," [...] Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. [...] "We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you felt like you could take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive," [...] lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} in wireless sensor networks is to design an energy efficient communication protocol. In this paper, we present an innovative code-based sleep and wake-up scheduling scheme to minimize energy consumption caused by idle listening. The proposed scheme called SWAP divides time into slots of equal length, and {{at the beginning of}} each slot a sensor node enters either an active or power-saving state. The slot scheduling at each node is based on a binary vector, which is constructed using the mathematical properties of finite fields. The set of scheduling vectors generated by <b>SWAP</b> distributes active <b>slots</b> of nodes evenly over entire time frame. This distribution of active slots reduces channel contention and allows better channel utilization. The SWAP scheduling scheme also ensures that any pair of neighboring nodes using the proposed scheduling scheme will be able to communicate each other since their active periods overlap at least once within a cycle of the sleep and wake-up slots. We also design a packet prioritization scheme in SWAP to reduce the packet latency of delay sensitive packets. To evaluate the energy efficiency and performance of the proposed mechanism, we have implemented SWAP in TOSSIM, and compared it with a widely used channel access protocol, BMAC with LPL, in terms of packet delivery ratio, power consumption and delay. The results of our study show that SWAP outperforms BMAC in terms of energy consumption while maintaining comparable packet delivery ratio and latency.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this thesis {{is to present}} the design and evaluation of intelligent MAC protocols for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The objective {{of this research is}} to improve the channel utilisation of WSNs while providing flexibility and simplicity in channel access. As WSNs become an efficient tool for recognising and collecting various types of information from the physical world, sensor nodes are expected to be deployed in diverse geographical environments including volcanoes, jungles, and even rivers. Consequently, the requirements for the flexibility of deployment, the simplicity of maintenance, and system self-organisation are put into a higher level. A recently developed reinforcement learning-based MAC scheme referred as ALOHA-Q is adopted as the baseline MAC scheme in this thesis due to its intelligent collision avoidance feature, on-demand transmission strategy and relatively simple operation mechanism. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} reinforcement learning technique can considerably improve the system throughput and significantly reduce the probability of packet collisions. However, the implementation of reinforcement learning is based on assumptions about a number of critical network parameters. That impedes the usability of ALOHA-Q. To overcome the challenges in realistic scenarios, this thesis proposes numerous novel schemes and techniques. Two types of frame size evaluation schemes are designed to deal with the uncertainty of node population in single-hop systems, and the unpredictability of radio interference and node distribution in multi-hop systems. A <b>slot</b> <b>swapping</b> techniques is developed to solve the hidden node issue of multi-hop networks. Moreover, an intelligent frame adaptation scheme is introduced to assist sensor nodes to achieve collision-free scheduling in cross chain networks. The combination of these individual contributions forms state of the art MAC protocols, which offers a simple, intelligent and distributed solution to improving the channel utilisation and extend the lifetime of WSNs...|$|R
