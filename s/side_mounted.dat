5|$|Side-mount {{cylinders}} are cylinders {{clipped to}} the harness at the diver's sides which carry bottom gas when the diver does not carry back mount cylinders. They {{may be used}} in conjunction with other <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> stage, travel and/or decompression cylinders where necessary. Skilled side-mount divers may carry as many as three cylinders on each side. This configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves. Side mounting is primarily used for technical diving, but is also sometimes used for recreational diving, when a single cylinder may be carried, complete with secondary second stage (octopus) regulator, in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving.|$|E
5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E

50|$|Side-mounted {{cylinder}}s—Easy {{to install}} and service, but the mounts produce a turning moment as the cylinder applies force to a load, increasing wear and tear. To avoid this, specify a stroke at least {{as long as the}} bore size for <b>side</b> <b>mount</b> cylinders (heavy loading tends to make short stroke, large bore cylinders unstable). <b>Side</b> <b>mounts</b> need to be well aligned and the load supported and guided.|$|R
25|$|Leclerc Koufra, or Leclerc T40 : A {{proposal}} {{from the late}} 2000s to convert existing Séries 1 vehicles into a 'heavy' reconnaissance scout, primarily for urban warfare. The conversion included a brand new turret incorporating a CTA CT40 Case Telescoped Weapon System (CTWS) as well as grenade launchers, along with provision for two <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> anti-tank missiles.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{configurations}} {{used for}} increased primary gas supply are manifolded or independent twin back mounted cylinders, multiple <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> cylinders, or rebreathers. Bailout and decompression gas may {{be included in}} these arrangements, or carried separately as side-mounted stage and decompression cylinders. Cylinders may carry a variety of gases depending on when and {{where they will be}} used, and as some may not support life if used at the wrong depth, they are marked for positive identification of the contents. Managing the larger number of cylinders is an additional task loading on the diver. Cylinders are usually labeled with the gas mixture and will also be marked with the maximum operating depth and if applicable, minimum operating depth.|$|E

2500|$|Wrecks in {{shallower}} waters tend {{to deteriorate}} faster than wrecks in deeper water due to higher biological activity. [...] Accordingly, {{many of the}} older and larger shipwrecks that tend to offer full penetration dives tend to be deeper dives. [...] This can present additional complications; if a wreck dive {{is intended to be}} a decompression dive, then the diver will normally carry decompression gases in <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> cylinders. [...] However, it is difficult to penetrate many wrecks with both back mounted and <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> cylinders, requiring divers to either use a different configuration, or leave their decompression gases outside the wreck prior to penetration. [...] This creates the possibility of a diver being unable to relocate their decompression gases if they exit the wreck at a different point from which they enter it.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the subway}} scene, the set was first {{planned to be}} shot in a real subway station, but due {{to the amount of}} the actions and the wire works, the {{decision}} was made to shoot on set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, Chad Stahelski, Reeves' stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs, knees, and a dislocated shoulder. Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot where Neo was slammed into a booth. The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the outside view from inside the building was a large, three story high cyclorama. The helicopter was a full-scale light-weight mock-up suspended by a wire rope operated a tilting mechanism mounted to the studio roofbeams. The helicopter had <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> to it a real minigun, which was set to cycle at half normal full (3000 rounds per min) firing rate. The visual effect of the helicopters rotating blades was effected by using strobe lighting.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, the 90th, now a {{bombardment}} squadron, {{operated in}} the South Pacific, flying Douglas A-20 Havoc and North American B-25 Mitchell aircraft. [...] Their main mission involved highly-dangerous skip bombings. [...] In {{an effort to}} improve the effectiveness and protection of the 3d Bombardment Group's pilots, Major Paul 'Pappy' Gunn, 3d Bombardment Group engineering officer, devised a modification of the B-25C. [...] The modification replaced the forward bombardier with four forwards firing [...]50 caliber machine guns, supplemented with two twin [...]50 caliber gun packages <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> on the fuselage. [...] The lower turret was discarded. [...] The A-20s received similar modifications. [...] The modified aircraft were first employed by the 90th and proved exceptionally effective, receiving the nickname 'commerce destroyers.' [...] During the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, every aircraft in the 90th scored a hit on the Japanese convoy of 18 ships. [...] It was the first sea-level attack by B-25 strafers in World War II and demonstrated that this tactic was extremely effective. [...] The squadron also participated in the raids on Wewak, New Guinea, which were preemptive strikes that virtually ended the threat of enemy offensive air capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|In late December 1854 {{the newly}} formed Victorian Government faced their first crisis. Three years earlier, in 1851, gold had been {{discovered}} in Ballarat, and soon after in Bendigo, triggering the Victorian gold rush. The government imposed heavy mining taxes, which caused a miners revolt, culminating in the Eureka Stockade. About 1,000 miners fortified a position, and at 3:00am on 3 December 1854, a party of 276 members from the 1st/12th and 2nd/40th Regiments supported by Victorian police, {{under the command of}} Captain John Thomas, approached the Eureka Stockade and a battle ensued. The police took up holding positions on two sides of the stockade, with a further unit of mounted police held in reserve. On a third <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> members of the 2nd/40th pressed in, supported by a combined storming party made up from members of the 2nd/40th and the 1st/12th Foot East Suffolk which approached from the north and south. The miners, about 150 strong– of whom 100 were armed– were no match for the military and they were routed in less than 15 minutes, with six soldiers and 34 miners being killed. A contingent of the 1st/99th Regiment, then serving in Tasmania, was dispatched to aid them, however they were not required. The result of this action was the effect that it had on public opinion surrounding the issue of the British garrison's presence in Australia; a gathering of citizens in Melbourne shortly after the incident at Eureka expressed a desire {{for the creation of a}} [...] "constitution under which there would be no troops in the colony but for part-time citizens soldiers recruited from among the community".|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, small block engine {{displacement}} increased from [...] to , though output remained the same. All other engines and transmission choices remained unchanged {{from the previous}} year, though the L30 base engine was now the ZQ3 and the L79 motor was redesignated the L46. All cars featured [...] steel wheels (increased from 7inches). Tire size remained the same, although {{this was the first}} year for optional white lettered tires and the last for red striped tires. Carried over from the previous year were seven available rear axle ratios ranging from 2.73 to 4.56. Standard ratio remained 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. The optional Positraction rear axle, mandated on many engine/gearbox combinations, was installed on more than 95% of the cars. [...] "Stingray" [...] script nameplates appeared on front fenders, now one word, in contrast to the “Sting Ray” name used previously. Exterior door handles were redesigned so the finger plate would actuate the door, eliminating the separate release button. Backup lights were integrated into the inboard taillights, headlight washers were added, and front grilles were made all black. <b>Side</b> <b>mounted</b> exhausts and front fender vent trim were options for this year only. On the inside, revised door panels provided additional shoulder room in the C3's tighter cabin and headrests became standard. Steering wheel diameter was reduced from 16 to 15inches to permit easier entry and exit, the ignition switch was moved from the dash to the steering column, and map pockets were added to the dash area in front of the passenger seat. Accounting for 57% of the cars, coupes with their removable roof panels, began a trend of outselling roadsters. An extended production cycle due to a labor dispute increased '69 volume.
