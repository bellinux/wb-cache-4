We {{made use of}} the n-heptane cracking, as a model reaction, and several other characterisation techniques. ZSM- 20 presents a different framework symmetry and higher Si/Al ratio than Y zeolite, after its normal synthesis; its Si/Al ratio is close {{to that of the}} Y ultrastabilised form, USY. The ion exchange efficiency of Na"+ cations was a little higher on ZSM- 20 than on Y zeolite. The resulting increase in catalytic activity was not proportional to proton content. The most acidic form of ZSM- 20 presented remarkably higher activity and thermal stability and lower coke formation selectivity, than the acidic form HY. All properties are closer to those of the acidic ultrastabilised form USHY, but HZSM- 20 was still more active. The deactivating effect of coke was lower on ZSM- 20 than on Y zeolite, despite its higher coking activity. Both zeolites produced coke compounds of similar nature: branched poliaromatics in the same range of molecular weights and carbon numbers. ZSM- 20 favoured the branching of these compounds. The initial activity of HZSM- 20 decreased after ion exchange with Lanthanum cations. Behind thermal treatment at 800 degC, its structural thermal stability remained pratically unchanged, but the initial cracking activity registered a Rare-Earth induced positive change. Concerning to Vanadium poisoning, ZSM- 20 suffered a more important metal induced crystallinity loss than USHY, after hydrothermal treatment. Neverthless, the Vanadium effect on the initial cracking activity was comparable in both catalysts: the acidic form of ZSM- 20 presented a catalytic behaviour {{similar to that of the}} ultrastabilised form of Y zeolite, specially for the most severe treatment, with no need of any <b>stabilising</b> <b>treatment.</b> These observations, just as the results of the ion exchange efficiency, of the coke deactivating effect and of the coke components branching, are consistent with the lower ZSM- 20 porous structure tortuosity, relative to Y zeolite. SAPO- 37, a faujasite-like silicoaluminophosphate, presented a remarkably lower acidity and catalytic activity than HY zeolite. Meanwhile, SAPO- 37 favoured the selectivity for coke formation and isomerization, in relation to n-heptane cracking. Its lowest acidity, had not significant consequences on coke compositionAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av. D.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bipolar {{disorder}} {{is a common}} debilitating illness, characterised by acute affective episodes with full or partial inter-episode remission. Effective and acceptable treatment of acute episodes is required. Valproate has become a leading adjunctive and alternative mood <b>stabilising</b> <b>treatment</b> to lithium in bipolar disorder. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and acceptability of valproate {{in the treatment of}} acute episodes of bipolar disorder. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search included the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Registrar (CCDANCTR), the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register (CCTR), reference lists of relevant papers and books, and contact with authors of trials, experts and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing valproate with placebo, other mood stabilisers and antipsychotic medication in the treatment of any bipolar affective episode. Participants were of both sexes, of all ages, with a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder approximating to ICD 10 Code F 31 and DSM IV 296. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers blind to the authorship and source of papers. Ten randomised controlled trials were found comparing valproate with other interventions in mania. None was found examining its use in depression or mixed affective episodes. Data were extracted on the main outcome 'failure to respond {{by the end of the}} study' assessed by a less than 50 % reduction in the Young Mania Rating Scale or the SADS-S mania scale. Three trials (316 participants) compared valproate with placebo. Three trials (158 participants) compared valproate with lithium. Two trials (363 participants) compared valproate with olanzapine. One trial (36 participants) compared valproate with haloperidol. Two trials (59 patients) compared valproate with carbamazepine. Acceptability of treatment was estimated using the outcome measure 'total number of subjects withdrawing from the study'. Three trials (321 patients) contributed to the comparison between valproate and placebo, two studies (144 patients) contributed to the comparison with lithium. One study (30 patients) provided data on this outcome in the comparison between valproate and carbamazepine. Pooled relative risks (with 95 % confidence intervals) were calculated using fixed effect approaches. MAIN RESULTS: Valproate was more efficacious than placebo (RRR 38 %; RR 0. 62; 95 % C. I. 0. 51 to 0. 77) in the treatment of mania. There was no significant difference between valproate and lithium (RRI 5 %; RR 1. 05; 95 % C. I. 0. 74 - 1. 50) or between valproate and carbamazepine (RRR 34 %; RR 0. 66; 95 % C. I. 0. 38 to 1. 16). Valproate was less effective than olanzapine (failure to achieve clinical response; RRI 25 %; RR 1. 25, 95 % C. I. 1. 01 to 1. 54; average of 2. 8 point less change on the Mania Rating Scale (95 % CI 0. 83 to 4. 79). There were no significant differences in acceptability as measured by total number of subjects withdrawing from the study. There were significant differences in the side effect profiles of valproate and olanzapine, with more sedation and weight gain on olanzapine. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is consistent, if limited, evidence to suggest that valproate is an efficacious treatment for acute mania. Valproate may be less effective than olanzapine but may cause less sedation and weight gain. More well designed, randomised controlled trials investigating the relative efficacy and acceptability of valproate in the treatment of the full range of acute affective episodes occurring in bipolar disorder are required...|$|E

Design: In this cross sectional study, a commercial portable motion detector with computer memory, similar to a wrist watch (the actigraph) {{was used to measure}} movement. The measurements were compared with a clinical decision based on the neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) score. Movement was analysed, using non-parametric tests, in three groups: a control group of 10 infants, 13 opiate exposed newborns not treated for NAS, and 30 newborns treated for NAS (17 before treatment, eight within 24 hours of <b>treatment,</b> five when <b>stabilised).</b> Results: There were significant differences in the median activity score, expressed as counts per minute (cpm), in the pretreatment group (124 cpm) compared with the control (42 cpm, p, 0. 0001), non-treated (74 cpm, p = 0. 001), and <b>stabilised</b> <b>treatment</b> (75 cpm, p = 0. 007) groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} impact on general {{practitioners}} and hospital consultants of hospital outpatient dispensing policies in England. DESIGN [...] Postal questionnaire and telephone interview survey of general practitioners and hospital consultants in January 1991. SETTING [...] 94 selected major acute hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS [...] 20 general practitioners {{in the vicinity of}} each of 94 selected hospitals and eight consultants from each, selected by chief pharmacists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Proportions of general practitioners unable to assume responsibility for specialist drugs and of consultants wishing to retain responsibility; association between dispensing restrictions and the frequency of general practitioners being asked to prescribe hospital initiated treatments. RESULTS [...] Completed questionnaires were obtained from 1207 (64 %) of 1887 general practitioners and 457 (63 %) of 729 consultants. 570 (46 %) general practitioners felt unable to take responsibility for certain treatments, principally because of difficulty in detecting side effects (367, 30 %), uncertainty about explaining treatment to patients (332, 28 %), and difficulty monitoring dosage (294, 24 %). Among consultants 328 (72 %) wished to retain responsibility, principally because of specialist need for monitoring (93, 20 %), urgent need to commence treatment (64, 14 %), and specialist need to initiate or <b>stabilise</b> <b>treatment</b> (63, 14 %). The more restricted the drug supply to outpatients, the more frequently consultants asked general practitioners to prescribe (p less than 0. 01) and complete a short course of treatment initiated by the hospital (p less than 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS [...] Restrictive hospital outpatient dispensing shifts clinical responsibility on to general practitioners. Hospital doctors should be able to retain responsibility for prescribing when the general practitioner is unfamiliar with the drug or there is a specialist need to initiate, <b>stabilise,</b> or monitor <b>treatment...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of the Plavinas dam, Latvia was {{the subject}} of this final thesis. The objective was to investigate the weaknesses of the Plavinas dam and to present possible <b>stabilising</b> <b>treatments.</b> This includes a rough estimate on costs and construction methods. Plavinas hydroelectric power station is the most important dam in Latvia, supplying 30 % of the countrys power. The Plavinas blocks the runoff of the Daugava River, resulting in the formation of a reservoir. The power plant is a composite type structure consisting of a concrete power house and a spillway, which is located on top of the power house. The water from the reservoir can either flow through ten generating units located in the concrete power house, which is approximately 200 m long, or flow over the power house, the spillway. The head difference between the reservoir and the tailrace measures 40 m. Several kilometres of hydraulically filled embankment dams extend to both sides of the concrete power house. The dam is founded on glacial till overlying a sandstone layer. Drainage wells were incorporated in the foundation of the power house. This drainage system reduces the large uplift water pressures from the head difference between the reservoir level and the tailrace. This results in a larger effective weight of the structure, which is favourable for the bearing capacity of the structure against sliding and toppling. There are indications that the drainage wells, which can not be replaced under the concrete structure, do not function according to specifications: an increase of uplift water pressures is monitored. This could endanger the stability of the power house. transport of fine soil particles with the groundwater flow in the regional aquifer is occurring towards the drainage galleries near the right embankment as well as the drainage system underneath the structure. settlements of the power house have been observed, which seems to be caused by collapsing seepage channels. The power house structure and the aprons were schematised and the normative loading cases were determined. The stability of the structure was calculated for the following situations: original design assumptions in which the uplift water pressure is reduced by approximately 90 % rising water pressures due to continuously less effective original drainage system complete failure of drainage wells without compensating treatments different treatments, increasing the stability of the power house in case the original drainage fails entirely, either by adding more weight to compensate for the larger uplift water pressure or by reducing the uplift pressure by an extension of the seepage path or new drains. The different <b>stabilising</b> <b>treatments</b> were analysed in a multi criteria analysis taking into account amongst others the problem elimination, durability and feasibility of execution. The alternative of new drains in the downstream apron close to the power house provided the best alternative. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|The risk {{of protein}} {{instability}} {{is present in}} wines and must be correctly estimated in order to intervene appropriately to prevent the problem, in respect of {{the overall quality of}} the wine. In consideration of the risk of instability of wine proteins, various methods have been proposed and utilised to foresee the phenomenon. Nevertheless, evaluations with methods currently in use provide contradictory results and make it difficult to interpret the final data. Considering the disparate responses to current methods and their intrinsic problems, a new test was realised that takes advantage of the electropositivity of proteins at wine pH, proteins being practically the only substances with a positive electric charge. The method realises the electro neutralisation of the proteins, which become insoluble when they reach the isoelectric point, determining a measurable degree of turbidity. The reactant used is a stabilised, titled mixture of anionic organic polyelectrolytes, which can be standardised. Addition of the reactant produces rapid neutralisation of only the proteins, without interacting with the other components of the wine, such as tannins and polysaccharides, whether they are in solution or colloidal form. Additionally, the sample must not be filtered, because the difference in turbidity between the original sample and the sample after addition of the reactant is evaluated. The response of the proteins on the model solution is perfectly linear, even if the intensity of the reaction may vary from protein to protein; this aspect does not influence the result, inasmuch as it is precisely what we are effectively interested in: namely, to evaluate potential instability, which may therefore be different according to the type of protein. On the basis of the results obtained with the proteins analysed, an analytical sensitiveness of about 10 mg/L was obtained, which is a more than acceptable value to meet oenological requirements. From the experiments conducted a wine may be considered potentially unstable when it shows a test value of even just a few turbidity units (NTU). The rapidity and simplicity of execution (1 min) of the test make it applicable even directly in the wine cellar, which may enable oenologists to perform on-line controls on protein stabilisation, without having to send samples to the laboratory; the information is therefore immediately usable and manageable in the wine cellar. The analytical approach through electro neutralisation of the positive charge of proteins in wine is a more specific method with respect to some systems in use, and thus allows exclusive evaluation of potential protein instability, without overestimating the problem and running the risk of performing <b>stabilising</b> <b>treatments</b> that do not respect the quality of the wine...|$|R

40|$|Transformation induced {{elasticity}} (TRIP) effects {{associated with}} austenite dispersions in low alloy Fe-Mn-Si steels {{can be enhanced}} by austenite stabilisation. Austenite which forms during conventional intercritical annealing does not possess the required stability in order to exhibit TRIP effects. In this work, thermodynamic calculations indicated that it is feasible to form austenite by a cementite to austenite conversion which occurs under paraequilibrium conditions, i. e with partition of carbon but with no partition of substitutional alloying elements. In this way the austenite inherits the manganese content of cementite and is chemically <b>stabilised.</b> A <b>treatment</b> consisting of a two-step annealing has been examined. In the first step, soft annealing, an Mn-enriched cementite dispersion in ferrite is formed. In the second step, intercritical annealing, austenite nucleates on the cementite particles, which are consumed to form austenite. It was experimentally determined that this austenite has been enriched in manganese and carbon and, therefore, is stabilised. The conversion reaction {{is followed by the}} conventional austenite nucleation at ferrite grain boundaries. This austenite is lean in manganese and is not stable. The net effect of the two-step annealing treatment is a significant austenite stabilisation relative to simple intercritical annealing, indicating a potential for enhanced TRIP effects in this class of steels...|$|R

Little is known about how highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) might reverse these dynamics. We use panel survey data from Khayelitsha (Cape Town) to explore changes {{in the presence of}} mothers, fathers, sisters and sexual partners in HAART patient households over time. We show that HAART patients, when they first started treatment (i. e. were sick with AIDS), {{were more likely to be}} living with their mothers and in parent-headed households than their counterparts in the general population (that is, a sample of Khayelitsha residents and matched to HAART survey respondents by age, gender and education). Over time, the presence of mothers, fathers and parental household heads drops significantly and the living arrangements of HAART patients become indistinguishable from those in the matched sample in this respect. This is consistent with the hypothesis that parental support is no longer required once HAART restores health, thereby enabling patients to live independent, healthy lives. We also show that over time there is a marked increase in the proportion of HAART patients with sexual partners resident in the household. However, the proportion remains significantly lower than for their counterparts in the general population, and HAART patients are more likely to live in single-person households.

Several examples illustrate the need for a better understanding of this subject. The fear that diet vitamin K could deregulate the equilibrium of oral vitamin K antagonist treatment leads to recommend a quite total suppression of vitamin K containing components in the diet of anticoagulated patients. This leads to an opposite effect: a high sensitivity to vitamin K and to disequilibrium of the anticoagulant treatment while a comprehensivemoderate and regular diet intake of vitamin K first facilitates the food choice of the patients but also helps to <b>stabilise</b> the <b>treatment</b> of chronically anticoagulated patients. Vitamin K plays a role in bone calcification and in osteoporosis prevention. Until recently the food supplementation with vitamin K in view of preventing osteoporosis in general population was strongly limited due to fear to affect the treatment equilibrium in anticoagulated patients.

A fibro-inflammatory stage was characterised by the coexistence of a persistent immune cellular lesion pattern with further focal modelling of a sub-epithelial neo-synthesised connective matrix. LOX expression was observed at the tips of intra-luminal fibrotic protrusions, together with tenascin and cellular fibronectin. A fibrotic stage was characterised by dense ECM deposits spreading throughout the peri-bronchiolar connective tissue, resulting in bronchiole obliteration and final disappearance. In contrast to reversible cases of fibrosis, persistence of long-term LOX expression reflecting continuing fibrosing activity might account for the irreversible status of BO. Our two cases illustrated that, at inflammatory and fibro-inflammatory stages, BO may be <b>stabilised</b> by immunosuppressive <b>treatment,</b> while the persistence of LOX expression in the fibrotic stage might correspond to a disease that becomes irreversible and fatal.

In contrast to reversible cases of fibrosis, persistence of long-term LOX expression reflecting continuing fibrosing activity might account for the irreversible status of BO. Our two cases illustrated that, at inflammatory and fibro-inflammatory stages, BO may be <b>stabilised</b> by immunosuppressive <b>treatment,</b> while the persistence of LOX expression in the fibrotic stage might correspond to a disease that becomes irreversible and fatal...|$|R

Methods. 150 consecutive psychiatric patients attending outpatient review in a community mental health centre in Dublin were approached and asked to complete a semistructured questionnaire designed to assess the objectives of the study. Results. 145 patients completed the questionnaire giving a response rate of 97 %. Ninety-eight patients (68 %) preferred attending a specialized psychiatry service even when <b>stabilised</b> on their <b>treatment.</b> The common reason given by patients in this category was fear of substandard quality of psychiatric care from their general practitioners (GPs) (67 patients, 68. 4 %). Twenty-nine patients (20 %) preferred to attend their GP for continuing mental health care. The reasons given by these patients included confidence in GPs, providing same level of care as psychiatrist for mental illness (18 patients or 62 %), and the advantage of managing both mental and physical health by GPs (13 patients, 45 %). Conclusion. Most patients who attend specialised psychiatric services preferred to continue attending specialized psychiatric services even if they become mentally stable than primary care, with most reasons revolving around fears of inadequate psychiatric care from GPs...|$|R
40|$|According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, {{there are}} between 1. 2 and 1. 5 million opiate {{dependent}} {{individuals in the}} European Union (EMCDDA, 2010) with an estimated 18, 136 and 23, 576 opiate users resident in Ireland (Kelly et al., 2009). Approximately 11, 807 opiate users in Ireland are known to services and are predominantly aged between 25 and 34 years, male, early school leavers, unemployed (Kelly et al., 2009; Carew et al., 2009). In terms of treatment data, records show an increase in both prevalence and incidence rates among 15 to 64 year olds, with 11, 538 cases treated in 2007 (Carew et al. 2009).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{review the}} {{efficacy}} of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABCP) in medically refractory ventricular arrhythmia.  DESIGN—Retrospective analysis {{of the outcome of}} patients with ventricular arrhythmia treated with IABCP after transfer between 1992  and 1997.  SETTING—Tertiary cardiac referral centre.  PATIENTS— 21 patients (mean age 58  years) who underwent IABCP for control of ventricular arrhythmia. All had significant left ventricular impairment (mean ejection fraction 28. 6 %); 18  had coronary artery disease.  RESULTS—Before IABCP, 10  patients had incessant monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and 11  had paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF). IABCP resulted in suppression of ventricular arrhythmia in 18  patients, of whom 13  were weaned from IABCP. After stabilisation of ventricular arrhythmia, 10  patients were maintained on medical treatment alone and one underwent endocardial resection. IABCP was maintained until cardiac transplantation in five patients. One patient had a fatal arrest before discharge and one died from progressive heart failure. IABCP failed to control ventricular arrhythmia in three patients and was subsequently discontinued. A cardiac assist device was employed in one of these until cardiac transplantation; the other two were eventually <b>stabilised</b> on medical <b>treatment.</b> Nineteen patients were discharged from hospital. Overall survival was 95 % at mean follow up of 25. 7  months.  CONCLUSIONS—IABCP can be an effective means of controlling refractory ventricular arrhythmia, allowing time for the institution of more definitive treatment.    Keywords: ventricular arrhythmia; intra-aortic balloon counterpulsatio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionCotrimoxazole (CTX) {{prophylaxis}} {{is recommended}} by the World Health Organisation for HIV infected persons. However, once HIV infected patients have commenced ART in resource limited settings, the benefits of continued CTX prophylaxis are not known. The few studies that investigated the safety of discontinuing CTX prophylaxis in these settings had limitations due to their design. Materials and methodsCOSTOP is a randomised double blind placebo controlled non-inferiority trial among HIV infected Ugandan adults <b>stabilised</b> on anti-retroviral <b>treatment</b> (ART). Participants with CD 4 count of 250 or more cells/mm 3 are randomised to two arms: the intervention arm in which CTX is discontinued and the control arm in which CTX prophylaxis is continued. The study aims to assess whether the intervention regimen is not inferior, {{with respect to the}} incidence of pre-defined CTX-preventable events, to the control regimen and superior with respect to the incidence of haematological adverse events. DiscussionStudies that have previously evaluated the safety of discontinuing CTX prophylaxis among HIV infected adults in resource limited settings have provided moderate to low quality evidence owing in part to methodological limitations. COSTOP is designed and conducted with sufficient rigour to answer this question. The results of the trial will assist in guiding policy recommendations. ConclusionThis paper describes the design and methodological considerations important for the conduct of CTX cessation studies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInterleukin- 1 receptor-associated kinase, IRAK, {{has been}} shown to {{activate}} NFκB in response to interleukin- 1. We have explored the involvement of IRAK in regulation of the interleukin- 2 gene in the murine thymoma cell line EL 4. NOB- 1 by examining its effect on interleukin- 2 promoter-linked reporter gene expression, interleukin- 2 gene transcription and interleukin- 2 protein production. Cells transfected with IRAK displayed high levels of phosphorylated IRAK, increased interleukin- 2 promoter-linked reporter gene expression (which was dependent on NFκB) and interleukin- 2 gene transcription. IRAK was unable, however, to increase interleukin- 2 protein production. Overexpression of TRAF- 6 induced similar responses and again failed to increase interleukin- 2 protein production. A dominant negative TRAF- 6 inhibited reporter gene expression and interleukin- 2 protein production in response to both interleukin- 1 and IRAK transfection. Interleukin- 1 treatment and IRAK or TRAF- 6 transfection increased interleukin- 2 mRNA production. Only interleukin- 1 <b>treatment</b> <b>stabilised</b> the induced transcripts with 50 % being detectable at 20 h post induction. The interleukin- 2 mRNA induced in IRAK- or TRAF- 6 -transfected cells was depleted by > 90 % at 6 h post induction. These data implicate IRAK and TRAF- 6 in transcriptional regulation of interleukin- 2 gene expression via NFκB, and provide direct evidence that IRAK lies upstream from TRAF- 6. Neither IRAK nor TRAF- 6 participates in stabilisation of interleukin- 2 mRNA which is required for interleukin- 2 protein production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Wastewater sludges {{are used}} in {{agriculture}} as soil amendment and fertilizer, {{with regard to their}} organic matter and nutrient content. However, availability of nitrogen and phosphorus from sludge-amended soils and their transfer in runoff may lead to eutrophication of downstream surface water. The aim {{of this study is to}} establish and compare the effect of two different sludges on these transfers: an anaerobically digested and thermically <b>stabilised</b> sludge (Seine-Aval <b>treatment</b> plant, sludge no. 1), and a limed sludge (Saint-Quentin treatment plant, sludge no. 2). Experiments were performed on 12 sloping micro-plots (1 m × 1 m) submitted to sludge spreading and controlled rainfall simulation. Runoff water was sampled and analysed for concentrations in nitrogen species and phosphorus. Results show that spreading of sludge no. 1 increased both ammonium nitrogen (mean of 1. 1 mg L− 1 N–NH 4 vs. 0. 2 mg L− 1 N–NH 4 for control micro-plots) and particulate phosphorus concentrations (mean of 2 mg L− 1 P vs. 1. 1 mg L− 1 P for control micro-plots) in runoff water. On the other hand, sludge no. 2 did not induce any significant effect on nutrient concentrations in runoff. These results are related to chemical composition and physical treatment of sludges. This study underlines the existence of a short-term risk of nutrient mobilisation by runoff after sludge spreading on soil, and the need to check precisely the impact of this practice on water quality...|$|R

40|$|Enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (ERT) with recombinant human alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) in late-onset Pompe disease is moderately effective. Little {{is known about}} the clinical course after treatment termination and the resumption of ERT. In Switzerland, rhGAA therapy for Pompe disease was temporarily withdrawn after the federal court judged that the treatment costs were greatly out of proportion compared to the benefits. Re-treatment was initiated after the therapy was finally licensed. We retrospectively analysed seven Pompe patients, who underwent cessation and resumption of ERT (median age 43  years). The delay from first symptoms to final diagnosis ranged from 4 to 20  years. The demographics, clinical characteristics, assessments with the 6 -min walking test (6 -MWT), the predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) and muscle strength were analysed. Before initiation of ERT, all patients suffered from proximal muscle weakness of the lower limbs; one was wheelchair-bound and two patients received night-time non-invasive ventilation. Initial <b>treatment</b> <b>stabilised</b> respiratory function in most patients and improved their walking performance. After treatment cessation, upright FVC declined in most and the 6 -MWT declined in all patients. Two patients needed additional non-invasive ventilatory support. Twelve months after resuming ERT, the respiratory and walking capacity improved again in most patients. However, aside for one patient, none of the patients reached the same level of respiratory function or distance walked in 6  min, as at the time of ERT withdrawal. We conclude that cessation of ERT in Pompe disease causes a decline in clinical function and should be avoided. Resuming treatment only partially recovers respiratory function and walking capacity...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide as the new standard of care for patients with glioblastoma, {{there has been an}} increasing awareness of progressive and enhancing lesions on MRI, noted immediately after the end of treatment, which are not related to tumour progression, but which are a treatment effect. This so-called pseudoprogression can occur in up to 20 % of patients who have been treated with temozolomide chemoradiotherapy, and can explain about half of all cases of increasing lesions after the end of this treatment. These lesions decrease in size or <b>stabilise</b> without additional <b>treatments</b> and often remain clinically asymptomatic. Additionally, there is evidence that treatment-related necrosis occurs more frequently and earlier after temozolomide chemotherapy than after radiotherapy alone. The mechanisms behind these events have not yet been fully elucidated, but the likelihood is that chemoradiotherapy causes a higher degree of (desired) tumour-cell and endothelial-cell killing. This increased cell kill might lead to secondary reactions, such as oedema and abnormal vessel permeability in the tumour area, mimicking tumour progression, in addition to subsequent early treatment-related necrosis in some patients and milder subacute radiotherapy reactions in others. In patients managed with temozolomide chemoradiotherapy who have clinically asymptomatic progressive lesions at the end of treatment, adjuvant temozolomide should be continued; in clinically symptomatic patients, surgery should be considered. If mainly necrosis is noted during surgery, continuation of adjuvant temozolomide is logical. Trials on the treatment of recurrent malignant glioma should exclude patients with progression within the first 3 months after temozolomide chemoradiotherapy unless histological confirmation of tumour recurrence is available. Further research is needed to establish reliable imaging parameters that distinguish between true tumour progression and pseudoprogression or treatment-related necrosi...|$|R
40|$|PhDMutations in the melanocortin- 4 {{receptor}} (MC 4 R) are {{the most}} common cause of monogenic obesity. The majority of MC 4 R mutations are predicted to cause the receptor to aberrantly fold. Misfolded MC 4 R fails to traffic to the plasma membrane (PM) and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recent studies with other G-protein coupled receptors have shown that stabilisation of misfolded receptor, by pharmacological chaperones, promotes trafficking to the cell surface where the receptor may be functional. The objective of this thesis was to develop a rapid throughput cell culture based assay to monitor MC 4 R trafficking to the PM and to screen chemical chaperones and inducers and inhibitors of endogenous molecular chaperones, for the ability to promote folding and cell surface expression of mutant MC 4 R. The work presented here confirmed that clinically occurring MC 4 R mutants S 58 C, N 62 S, P 78 L, D 90 N, L 106 P, C 271 Y and P 299 H are intracellularly retained in HEK 293 cells. The cell culture assay was used to screen a number of compounds, which have been previously reported to act as chemical chaperones by <b>stabilising</b> protein folding. <b>Treatment</b> with 4 -phenyl butyric acid (4 -PBA) and trehalose increased total cellular levels of wild-type and mutant MC 4 R.
