50|$|In 1948, McLouth Steel {{started its}} $100 million {{expansion}} program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI. Construction {{on the first}} major construction program was started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill,</b> a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill,</b> {{also known}} as a {{reversible}} finishing mill, is similar to a reversing rolling mill except two coilers are used to feed the material through the mill. One coiler is on the entrance side and the other on the exit side. The coilers pull the material through the mill, therefore the process is more similar to drawing than rolling. The material is fed back and forth through the mill until the desired thickness is reached, much like a reversing rolling mill.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, synergy {{agreements}} {{were made}} with other steel producers: instead of everyone doing everything across {{the whole range of}} products, only the most profitable site for each would remain in existence. Thus, the <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> at Dudelange was closed. [...] 1979 showed that these measures would not be enough: the steel crisis intensified, through increased inflation, which increased interest levels on loans, the second oil crisis, which caused energy and raw material prices to shoot up, and over-production, which was still a factor in different steel-producing countries, despite the Davignon Plan.|$|E
50|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was {{dedicated}} and McLouth Steel became {{able to produce}} iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day.

Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton electric arc furnaces. The reversing <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> {{was replaced by a}} six stand continuous 60 in hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to compliment the blooming mill.

Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the microstructural behaviour of the strip ends relative to the strip bulk. Good correlation between the development of hard ends that arise in the final strip and strip temperature and mean flow stress has been found by analysing mill log data. Measurement of the recrystallization kinetics under conditions that simulate <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> rolling have shown that deformation temperatures below 950 Â°C can lead to incomplete recrystallisation during the <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> inter-pass.

40|$|Coiler drums are {{integral}} {{components of the}} <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> reversing hot strip rolling process. A <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> produces hot rolled strip steel from cast slabs, which are heated before being converted, via roughing, to a transfer bar, of which the thickness is subsequently reduced to the desired gauge {{by means of a}} reverse rolling process performed by the <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill.</b> Coiler drums are located inside two Steckel furnaces, which are positioned {{on both sides of the}} mill stand. As the strip thickness is reduced during each pass, the length increases. In order to obtain high rolling speeds and retain temperature, the strip is successively coiled and uncoiled, under tension, onto and from the heated coiler drums during processing. As coiler drums have a high unit cost and a significant impact on the quality of the finished product, coiler drum performance is important to <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> operators. The high cost is associated with the high alloy composition of the casting and the specialised manufacturing process required for the production of coiler drums. Deterioration of the coiler drum condition over its service lifespan can adversely affect the quality of the final product, namely coiled strip. This investigation was therefore undertaken to gain insight into coiler drum failure mechanisms, which will benefit <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> operators, mill suppliers and coiler drum suppliers.

40|$|Since 1994, IPSCO has {{produced}} over 180, 000 tons of X 80 linepipe.

40|$|Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is a two phase alloy {{used in the}} aerospace, {{military}} and biomedical industries. The thermomechanical processing (TMP) of Ti- 6 A- 4 V involves {{the breakdown of the}} ingot microstructure at temperatures above the beta transus (TÎ²) into fine lamellar colonies. Subsequent hot deformation is carried out at temperatures within the two phase region to produce a microstructure that is either equiaxed or bimodal. However, to avoid the formation of shear bands, voids or cracks within the final microstructure, this secondary fabrication is carried out at slow speeds, and these render the TMP of titanium a time consuming and expensive process. This project aims to investigate the possibility of using a <b>steckel</b> <b>mill</b> for the TMP of Ti 6 Al 4 V. A <b>steckel</b> <b>mill</b> is a single stand reversing mill with 2 coiler furnaces on either side. These furnaces allow for the annealing of strip metal in between passes thus keeping the strip at a high temperature throughout processing. In this way, reversing passes can occur indefinitely until a desired gauge thickness is achieved. A <b>steckel</b> <b>mill</b> therefore represents a cheaper and faster method to produce metal sheet or plate. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V cylinders with a diameter of 10 mm and length of 15 mm were uniaxially compressed in the Gleeble 3800. Hot compression was carried out isothermally in a 3 pass schedule at temperatures of 850 Â°C, 950 Â°C and 1050 Â°C. The strain was kept constant at 0. 48 and strain rates of 1 /s and 10 /s employed. Interpass times corresponding to a strain rate of 10 /s were 44 s and 77 s, whilst those corresponding to a strain rate of 1 /s were 324 s and 712 s. Statistical analysis in the form of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the parameter most influential on the microstructural evolution of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and the Taguchi method used to identify the optimum parameters suitable for the TMP of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using a <b>steckel</b> <b>mill.</b> Three successive passes at 850 Â°C, 1 /s resulted in a microstructure consisting of coarse, deformed grains and some finer recrystallised grains. The influence of a low strain rate was such that it promoted recrystallisation at this temperature, while that of interpass time brought about recrystallisation and grain growth. At the same temperature and a strain rate of 10 /s, less recrystallisation, together with a heavily deformed microstructure was observed. This was due to the heterogeneous distribution of strain which was a consequence of the high strain rate used. At 950 Â°C, at both 1 /s and 10 /s, 1 pass resulted in a bimodal microstructure. With subsequent passes, the amount of equiaxed alpha was observed to increase. This increase was a result of a strain induced phase transformation (SIT) from beta to alpha at high temperatures. The extent of this transformation increased with an increase in strain rate. Therefore, after 3 consecutive passes at 10 /s, a fully alpha (though heavily deformed) microstructure was formed. A subsequent post deformation heat treatment would lead to recrystallisation of these grains and a microstructure consisting of refined equiaxed grains the result. After 1 pass at 1050 Â°C, at either 1 /s or 10 /s, a WidmanstÃ¤tten microstructure was formed. However, after 3 consecutive passes at 1 /s, the microstructure remained mostly WidmanstÃ¤tten whilst at 10 /s, a bimodal microstructure was formed. The combination of a high strain rate, low interpass times, sequential strain imparted on the sample as well as the high temperature at which the compressions were carried out, elevated {{the extent to which a}} strain induced phase transformation from alpha to beta proceeded. Statistical analysis using ANOVA and the Taguchi method revealed that a schedule of 3 passes performed at 1050 Â°C, 1 /s and the corresponding interpass times as being the optimum parameters for the TMP of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V during <b>steckel</b> <b>mill</b> rolling. Analysis of the microstructural evolution across all 3 temperatures, however, showed that 3 passes carried at 950 Â°C, 10 /s, with interpass times of 44 s and 77 s, as being the optimum parameters. <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> rolling of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V has thus been confirmed as a feasible process for the production of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheet material...|$|E

40|$|AISI 430 {{ferritic}} {{stainless steel}} (FSS) is {{the most widely used}} FSS alloy due to good resistance to stress corrosion cracking. Owing to the chemical composition range, AISI 430 alloys undergo a partial phase transformation of ferrite to austenite when subjected to hot rolling temperatures. Consequently, the alloys consist of ferrite and austenite during processing. The presence of austenite and ferrite influences the microstructure evolution and texture development during hot rolling and subsequent annealing heat treatments. Two AISI 430 FSS heats of varying austenite volume fraction were used in this study. The two AISI 430 FSS heats were deformed using the first three passes of the <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> hot rolling process. Post deformation heat treatments namely: continuous phase transformation and martensite tempering heat treatments were performed after three successive simulated <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> passes. Microstructure analyses were performed using light microscopy and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD). The microstructure analyses were performed in order to determine microstructure evolution and texture development during hot deformation and post deformation heat treatments. The difference in austenite volume fraction in the respective heats A and B has profound influence on the possibilities for microstructure and texture evolution. For the higher austenite volume fraction heat A, the post-deformation path for austenite decomposition can lead to two very different textures in the prior austenite regions. During continuous diffusional transformation from austenite to ferrite the final texture is influenced by expected variant selection as well as growth selection during the prolonged isothermal heat treatment. The result is relatively strong { 001 } texture and comparably very weak Î³-fiber texture. In the case of the martensite tempering process the Î³-fiber texture that is inherited from the austenite to martensite diffusionless transformation is maintained in the prior austenite regions. The mode of post-deformation heat treatment does not significantly impact on texture development in heat B where the texture is dominated by recovery and growth in the primary ferrite phase...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves [105]- 110). The microstructural {{evolution of}} AISI {{304 stainless steel}} in the <b>Steckel</b> <b>mill</b> rolling process is investigated. This study includes the analysis of mill logs, microstructural examination of the mill product, deformation simulations and post deformation heat treatments. The mill logs from industry contains information about various process variables such as temperature, roll speed, dimensions of the mill strip and forces applied to it during the hot mill rolling process. The strain, strain rates and stresses on the mill strip can be calculated from the mill logs. An understanding of the metallurgical changes during rolling process can be gained by analysing the mean flow stress trends that evolve during rolling. Microstructural examination of the strip in different regions allows us to evaluate the property variations in the strip. This was done with microhardness testing, conventional optical microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction. The middle section of the strip demonstrated full recrystallization whereas the head and tail sections demonstrated no signs of recrystallization. The property differences through thickness proved to be negligible. Laboratory simulation was done in uniaxial compression testing on a Cam Plastometer. It {{was found that the}} temperature has a profound influence on the flow stress and the microstructure. The strain rates experienced in hot rolling does not {{have a significant effect on}} the flow stress and no measurable effect on the hardness. Heat treatments were done on the deformed uniaxial compression samples. The results of these heat treatments were analysed by two different methods: to deform the sample again after the heat treatment and to compare the yield stress from the first and second deformation and to measure the changes in room temperature hardness with the heat treatment time. The latter led to the development of a time to 50 % recrystallization equation that allows the prediction of a direct annealing time for complete softening at the conclusion of the hot rolling process...|$|E
