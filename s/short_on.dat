By now, Nuño de Guzmán was {{governor}} in Mexico, and he despatched Juan Enríquez de Guzmán to Chiapa as end-of-term judge over Mazariegos, and as alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor). He occupied his post for a year, during which time he attempted to reestablish Spanish control over the province, especially the northern and eastern regions, {{but was unable to}} make much headway.|$|E

Homer keeps his money troubles secret from Marge. Meanwhile, Patty and Selma have received a promotion at the DMV.

Marge finds out about the loan after she sees the IOU note, and her sisters tell her what happened.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Great Britain was {{waging war}} against Italian forces in North Africa and their allies, Rommel's Afrika Korps. Malta was {{critical}} to this campaign During {{this stage of the}} war, Malta was critically <b>short</b> <b>on</b> munitions, food and aviation fuel. Attempts to run the blockade and resupply Malta proved to be a failure; previous convoys such as Harpoon (from Gibraltar) and Vigorous (from Alexandria, Egypt) had lost most of their merchantmen and their escorts had been damaged. A new convoy was hence planned for mid-August, and named Pedestal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the success, the Massachusetts {{provisional}} government agreed to organize an expedition on a larger scale against Quebec, the capital of New France, and gave its command to Phips. Originally intending to coordinate with a simultaneous overland attack on Montreal launched from Albany, New York, the expedition's departure was delayed in the vain hope that needed munitions would arrive from England. The expedition, counting 34 ships and more than 2,000 soldiers, finally sailed on August 20. It was <b>short</b> <b>on</b> ammunition, had no pilots familiar with the Saint Lawrence River, and carried what {{would turn out to be}} inadequate provisions.|$|E

5|$|Jim Reardon {{directed}} the episode and has noted {{he remembers the}} episode for several scenes in which the action is viewed through windows, such as when Homer prank calls the dean. The animators were <b>short</b> <b>on</b> time, so {{for the design of}} Benjamin they took an earlier drawing of director Rich Moore and made it African-American.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, Election Day for Indianapolis {{political}} offices, {{bands of}} pro-union men roved {{the city and}} vandalized property, burnt streetcars, harassed public officials, and effectively shut down {{much of the city}} in the worst violence of the strike. Sheriff Porttens again ordered the police to protect the streetcars, but another twenty-nine officers resigned; because the force was so <b>short</b> <b>on</b> men, the sheriff refused their resignation and put them on other duties.|$|E
5|$|Peter Milner, in {{a review}} in the Canadian Journal of Psychology, noted the book was <b>short</b> <b>on</b> {{concrete}} details on implementing the TOTE strategy. He also critically viewed the book as {{not being able to}} tie its model to details from neurophysiology at a molecular level. Per him, the book covered only the brain at the gross level of lesion studies, showing that some of its regions could possibly implement some TOTE strategies, without giving a reader an indication as to how the region could implement the strategy.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{units in}} the area also defended strongly, but they too were <b>short</b> <b>on</b> {{supplies}} {{and in the end}} they were forced to withdraw further north. Wareo subsequently fell to the Allies on 8 December, who then established a line east from Wareo to Gusika on the coast. From there they carried out further advances north later in the month and into early January 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{arranged}} to outsource {{part of the}} coin-making process, and pledged to flood the nation with coins by 1965. Despite an increased need for coins in an improving economy, merchants made it past the 1964 holiday season without severe shortages, though the half dollar had stopped circulating. Most Fed facilities reported sufficient supplies of cents and nickels, with some still <b>short</b> <b>on</b> dimes and quarters, and shortages of half dollars everywhere—one Fed official wrote that his branch had not seen a half dollar deposited by a bank in eight months.|$|E
5|$|The Projector, 2.5inchmore {{commonly}} known as the Northover Projectorwas an ad hoc anti-tank weapon used by the British Army and Home Guard during the Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard <b>short</b> <b>on</b> supplies, particularly anti-tank weaponry. The Northover Projector was designed by a Home Guard officer named Robert Harry Northover to act as a makeshift anti-tank weapon, and was put into production in 1940 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E

The Smith Gun was designed by a retired Army Major named William H. Smith as a makeshift anti-tank weapon, and was put into production in 1941 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} of Quetzaltepeque, Villa Real was still <b>short</b> <b>on</b> food and Mazariegos was ill.

5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were <b>short</b> <b>on</b> tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within {{the first few days of}} combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
