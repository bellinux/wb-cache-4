5|$|Susan Eloise Hinton (better {{known as}} S. E. Hinton) is an American author who {{is best known}} for writing young adult fiction. The Outsiders was Hinton's first {{published}} book in 1967; Hinton wrote the book at the age of seventeen. Hinton based the characters, the Greasers and the Socs, off of teenage gangs and alienated youth in her hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma during the 1960s. The Outsiders has sold over fourteen million copies since it was published. In 1983, The Outsiders became a movie, and was later released onto DVD. After experiencing a writer's block and going into a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> Hinton met somebody in her freshmen biology class, who inspired her to continue writing.|$|E

30|$|The current {{intervention}} {{consisted of}} a smartphone application and a web-based psychoeducation. The intervention aimed to target the variables of valued actions, psychological flexibility, global satisfaction, as well as <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety and stress, using the ACT principles values and committed actions. The design of the study {{makes it impossible to}} draw the conclusion that the results are attributable to the intervention itself. The group analyses show that participants significantly increased their valued action, measured with BEVS during the intervention. In addition, participants increased their psychological flexibility, measured with AAQ-II significantly when comparing pretest and posttest measurement. Furthermore, value-based actions and psychological flexibility showed small effect sizes when comparing pretest and posttest score. The dependent variables of global satisfaction, measured by SWLS, and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety and stress, measured by DASS- 21, showed neither significant differences, nor effect sizes. However, these measurements might have been insensible for the population in the current study, and floor effects might have occurred. More rigorous studies are needed to establish if the current treatment approach is effective.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the possible relationship between maternal psychological state in the perinatal period and the child’s temperament at 3 months postpartum. Background: The perinatal period is a phase of intense psychological complexity which may {{increase the risk of}} the development, or a recurrence of psychological disturbances in parents. The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in adolescence. Methods: A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant’s temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant’s temperament. Results: Higher scores <b>of</b> antenatal <b>depression</b> and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers. This therefore supports the need for prevention-treatment programmes from the early stages of pregnancy. © 2014, © 2014 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology...|$|R
25|$|In 202 BCE, Han armies led by Liu Bang, Han Xin and Peng Yue {{attacked}} Western Chu {{from three}} sides and trapped Xiang Yu's army, which was low on supplies, at Gaixia (垓下; in present-day Lingbi County, Anhui). Liu Bang ordered his troops to sing folk {{songs from the}} Chu region to create a false impression that Xiang Yu's native land had been conquered by Han forces. The morale of the Chu army plummeted and many of Xiang Yu's troops deserted in despair. Xiang Yu sank into a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and he composed the Song of Gaixia. His concubine Consort Yu committed suicide.

25|$|In early August 1881 Addams {{decided to}} take his family on a {{vacation}} in northwestern Michigan, where he planned to inspect some of the iron and copper ore mines as potential investments; they left on August 4. A week later John Addams became ill while climbing in an ore mine and the family decided to return home by train. They made it to Green Bay, Wisconsin before Addams was too sick to travel any further and the family booked a hotel room. John H. Addams died suddenly of acute appendicitis on August 17, 1881 in the hotel in Green Bay {{at the age of}} 59.

25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E

It was investigated whether depression is associated with lower right posterior activation during performance of spatial tasks. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from 31 university students during the performance of two verbal and two spatial tasks. As expected, individual differences in depression were associated with a relative right hypoactivation during spatial task performance. The findings imply that individual differences in right posterior activation are not specific to clinical <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> but are also evident in healthy subjects with depressive symptoms...|$|R

A total of 108 undergraduate students from intact families completed self-report measures <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety, hostility and psychological separation. A non-significant relationship was found between the way students relate to their parents and level <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> However, subjects reporting angry or guilty feelings toward parents had significantly greater depression and hostility scores.

30|$|The DASS is a 42 -item scale {{measuring}} the negative emotional <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety and stress with each sub-scale having 14 items (Lovibond and Lovibond 1995 a).

Another reason for this stylistic choice was because Morgan feared putting too much comedy into the episode, like his previous effort [...] "Humbug". As such, he purposely tried to make it as serious and dark as possible, only to end up adding more jokes by the time the final draft was completed.|$|E
