500|$|Robert Baer, {{a former}} CIA officer, {{said that the}} agency would be {{outsourcing}} intelligence {{and would have to}} go to the Jordanians [...] "because we simply cannot, as blond haired blue eyed Americans, cannot get into these camps." [...] He said the attack would make the CIA more reluctant to engage with informants. He added that the attack would have been a huge setback for the CIA's intelligence collection in Afghanistan. [...] "You're talking about an institutional nightmare," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Tim</b> Weiner, author of the book [...] Former 9/11 Commission chairman Lee H.

500|$|Wellington {{was a fan}} of George Washington University's Alphonse [...] "Tuffy" [...] Leemans, and one of {{the first}} major {{personnel}} decisions he made was selecting the obscure running back in the second round of the NFL's first draft in 1936. The draft helped reduce player salaries as a drafted player could no longer negotiate with other teams. The Maras were fans of the reduced payouts. [...] "We found out that it didn't work to pay one star eight hundred dollars a game and the rest about one hundred," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Tim</b> Mara. [...] "The majority of players resented it and their resentment showed in their play." [...] The Giants began to standardize pay, which they felt avoided player jealousy. The team paid all of their backs $150 a game, and all of their lineman $100 a game in 1936, while Danowski, their quarterback, made $350 a contest. Strong was asked to take a pay cut from $6,000 a season to $3,200, but he left for the new American Football League instead. The team finished in the black in 1936.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, {{the founder}} of Pandora stated that the company {{may be on the}} verge of collapse. Royalty fees account for a {{majority}} portion of Pandora's revenues.

2500|$|A {{joint report}} from the UK Royal Society and the US National Academy of Sciences in February 2014 said {{that there is no}} [...] "pause" [...] in climate change and that the {{temporary}} and short-term slowdown in the rate of increase in average global surface temperatures in the non-polar regions is likely to start accelerating again in the near future.
