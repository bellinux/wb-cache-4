25|$|The major {{innovation}} {{was that}} the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard's punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations. The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including <b>sequential</b> <b>control,</b> branching and looping.

25|$|An early {{development}} of <b>sequential</b> <b>control</b> was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|E

The research uses quasi-experimental method with pre and post test design. The material is limited to <b>sequential</b> motion <b>control</b> using two actuators for objects transfer. Control class uses instructional media training kit, while experimental class uses development-result trainer.

25|$|Computers {{can perform}} both <b>sequential</b> <b>control</b> and {{feedback}} control, and typically a single computer will do both {{in an industrial}} application. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logic type systems. General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments and controllers in order to implement typical (such as PID) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers and management.|$|E

40|$|Orthodontic {{management}} of a buccally blocked-out canine requires {{a substantial amount}} of bodily movement, which is difficult to perform because of its long and bulbous root. Even when orthodontic forces are applied in a desired direction, large hyalinized areas are created which impede the root movement. Palatal root torque is needed for the canine to increase the buccal bone thickness, decrease the risk of bone dehiscence and gingival recession. Closing loops generate a distal force along with an extrusive component which retracts the canine into the extraction space but lacks control on the torque of the canine. To overcome this limitation, this simultaneous torquing, aligning, and retraction spring was designed. It can be easily fabricated, activated at chairside for either simultaneous or <b>sequential</b> <b>controlled</b> three-dimensional tooth movements...|$|R

50|$|Use of a PC that {{normally}} increments assumes that what a computer does is execute a usually linear sequence of instructions. Such a PC {{is central to}} the von Neumann architecture. Thus programmers write a <b>sequential</b> <b>control</b> flow even for algorithms that {{do not have to be}} sequential. The resulting “von Neumann bottleneck” led to research into parallel computing, including non-von Neumann or dataflow models that did not use a PC; for example, rather than specifying sequential steps, the high-level programmer might specify desired function and the low-level programmer might specify this using combinatory logic.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} form of sequential (although not proportional) actuator {{for radio}} control was the escapement. Like the device used in clocks, this escapement controls {{the release of}} stored energy from a spring or rubber band. Each signal from the transmitter operates a small solenoid that then allows a two- or four-lobed pawl to rotate. The pawl, like a clock, has two pallets so that the pawl can only rotate by one lobe's position, per signal pulse. This mechanism allows a simple keyed transmitter to give <b>sequential</b> <b>control,</b> i.e. selection between a number of defined positions at the model.|$|E
5000|$|The {{motivation}} for representing <b>sequential</b> <b>control</b> logic in a ladder diagram was to allow factory engineers and technicians to develop software without additional training {{to learn a}} language such as FORTRAN or other general purpose computer language. Development, and maintenance, was simplified because of the resemblance to familiar relay hardware systems. [...] Implementations of ladder logic have characteristics, such as sequential execution and support for control flow features, that make the analogy to hardware somewhat inaccurate. This argument has become less relevant given that most ladder logic programmers have a software background in more conventional programming languages.|$|E

The polymerization of n-BuA has been first {{initiated by the}} difunctional (diethyl meso- 2, 5 -dibromoadipate) initiator {{in the presence of}} the NiBr 2 (PPh 3) 2 catalyst. After isolation, the α,ω-dibromo poly(n-butyl acrylate) chains have been used as macroinitiators for the polymerization of either n-BuA or MMA leading to chain extension or to the desired triblock copolymers, respectively. The kinetic study of the two-step process has shown that the initiation of the MMA polymerization by the poly(n-BuA) macroinitiator is slow and leads to PMMA outer blocks of broad polydispersity. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA) have confirmed the two-phase morphology of the triblocks. Finally, DMA and tensile testing of these copolymers have emphasized poor mechanical properties in possible relation to the broad polydispersity of the PMMA outer blocks. Peer reviewe...|$|R
