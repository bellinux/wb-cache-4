40|$|The unacceptably high {{injury rate}} during the escape {{sequence}} (including the ejection and ground impact) {{of the crew}} module for F/FB- 111 aircraft is reviewed. A program {{to determine if the}} injury potential could be reduced by replacing the existing crewseats with energy absorbing crewseats is presented. An energy absorbing test seat is designed using much of the existing seat hardware. An extensive dynamic seat test series, designed to duplicate various crew module ground impact conditions is conducted at a sled test facility. Comparative tests with operational F- 111 crewseats are also conducted. After successful dynamic testing of the seat, more testing is conducted with the seats mounted in an F- 111 crew module. Both swing tests and vertical drop tests are conducted. The vertical drop tests are used to obtain comparative data between the energy absorbing and operational <b>seats.</b> <b>Volume</b> 1 describes the energy absorbing test seat and testing conducted, and evaluates the data from both test series. Volume 2 presents the data obtained during the seat test series, while Volume 3 presents the data from the crew module test series...|$|R

This paper analyzes the information content of NYSE seat prices using: (1) annual seat prices from 1869 to 1998, and (2) the complete record of trades, {{bids and offers}} for the seat market from 1973 to 1994. <b>Seat</b> market <b>volumes</b> have predictive power regarding future stock market returns, consistent with a model where seat market activity is a proxy for unobserved factors affecting expected returns. We find abnormally large price movements in seats prior to October 1987, consistent with the hypothesis that seat prices capture market sentiment.

5000|$|Like other {{pressure}} relief valves (PRV), pilot operated relief valves (PORV) are used for emergency relief during overpressure events (e.g., a tank gets too hot and the expanding fluid increases the pressure to dangerous levels). The difference between PORV and conventional PRV is that pilot valves use system pressure to seal the valve. A PRV typically uses a spring to hold the disc or piston on seat. The essential parts of a PORV are a pilot valve (or control pilot), a main valve, a pilot tube, the dome, a disc or piston, and a <b>seat.</b> The <b>volume</b> above the piston is called the dome.|$|R

5000|$|With the {{completion}} of the new Marion Junior High School in 2009, the unofficially named [...] "Patriot Arena" [...] opened for basketball games for both MJHS and MHS. The front lobby of the facility is surrounded by glass panes and the facility itself has many aesthetic touches that make it unique. The arena can <b>seat</b> multiple <b>volumes</b> of people including 1600, 1900 in 2 different configurations, and 2200. This new capacity, state-of-the-art sound system, and the building's design and aesthetics marked a huge upgrade from the 1,000 seat gym on the campus of MHS and made it a state-wide destination to play basketball. Marion High School hosted the 2011 6A State Basketball Tournament in the arena and the 2011 6A State Baseball Tournament at adjacent John Robbins Field.|$|R
40|$|Accelerators play a {{key role}} in the {{delivery}} of radiotherapy for treatment of cancer and other medical conditions. Proton therapy has the benefit of more localised delivery of dose to deep <b>seated</b> tumour <b>volumes</b> in comparison to treatment using x-rays or electrons. The accelerators currently used for proton therapy are cyclotrons and synchrotrons, which each have certain advantages and disadvantages. It has been proposed that accelerators of a fixed field alternating gradient (FFAG) design may combine some of the advantages and avoid some of the disadvantages of the existing machines. This thesis looks at the use of synchrotrons as a benchmark for the delivery of proton therapy, and then at how FFAGs may improve upon treatment delivery. Particular attention is paid to the beam dynamics issues, including comparisons between simulations and experimental data taken with the EMMA non-scaling FFAG at Daresbury. The results of the comparisons show that simulation is able to predict the behaviour of a particle bunch in a real machine. The simulation tools are then used to evaluate the design of FFAGs incorporating resonant extraction techniques. In principle, resonant extraction could overcome some problems of kicker based extraction methods. The design study highlights technical challenges that would need to be overcome before resonant extraction could be implemented as a beneficial method for a proton therapy FFAG...|$|R
40|$|Since {{occupational}} accidents {{often occur}} in farm tractor drivers, {{it is extremely}} important to focus the attention on specific devices {{in order to avoid}} risks from tractor overturning. This phenomenon is actually considered as the leading cause of deaths or injuries related to agricultural work. The system adopted to reduce the above-mentioned risk consists of passive protection devices aimed at preventing the hazardous event which may affect workers’ health. More precisely, the tractor chassis (i. e. ROPS) and the proper seat belt define a “safety volume” around the worker. The aim of the present research is to carry out tests on narrow-track wheeled tractors with fixed roll over protective structures in those areas – such as hazel and olive groves and vineyards - where problems related to under–tree activities occur. This is to implement planting layout and/or cultivation techniques which can be considered suitable for tractors with roll over protective structures. According to that, their project parameters – i. e. safety <b>volume,</b> <b>seat</b> position and typology, test methods - can be successfully modified and improved. The results show that nowadays only a few agricultural vehicles are provided with specific fixed devices able to work under tree without damaging orchards...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the validity and reliability of a hydrostatic weighing method using total lung capacity (measuring vital capacity with a respirometer at the time of weighing) the prone position, and a small oblong tank. The validity of the method was established by comparing the TLC prone (tank) method against three hydrostatic weighing methods administered in a pool. The three methods included residual <b>volume</b> <b>seated,</b> TLC seated and TLC prone. Eighty male and female subjects were underwater weighed using each of the four methods. Validity coefficients for per cent body fat between the TLC prone (tank) method and the RV seated (pool), TLC seated (pool) and TLC prone (pool) methods were. 98,. 99 and. 99, respectively. A randomised complete block ANOVA found significant differences between the RV seated (pool) method and each of the three TLC methods with respect to both body density and per cent body fat. The differences were negligible with respect to HW error. Reliability of the TLC prone (tank) method was established by weighing twenty subjects three different times with ten-minute time intervals between testing. Multiple correlations yielded reliability coefficients for body density and per cent body fat values of. 99 and. 99, respectively. It was concluded that the TLC prone (tank) method is valid, reliable and a favourable method of hydrostatic weighing...|$|R
60|$|We {{crossed the}} church and entered a cloister on the {{opposite}} side, in quest of the Laurentian Library. Ascending a staircase we found an old man blowing the bellows of the organ, which was in full blast in the church; nevertheless he found time to direct us to the library door. We entered a lofty vestibule, of ancient aspect and stately architecture, and thence were admitted into the library itself; a long and wide gallery or hall, lighted by a row of windows on which were painted {{the arms of the}} Medici. The ceiling was inlaid with dark wood, in an elaborate pattern, which was exactly repeated in terra-cotta on the pavement beneath our feet. Long desks, much like the old-fashioned ones in schools, were ranged {{on each side of the}} mid aisle, in a series from end to end, with seats for the convenience of students; and on these desks were rare manuscripts, carefully preserved under glass; and books, fastened to the desks by iron chains, as the custom of studious antiquity used to be. Along the centre of the hall, between the two ranges of desks, were tables and chairs, at which two or three scholarly persons were <b>seated,</b> diligently consulting <b>volumes</b> in manuscript or old type. It was a very quiet place, imbued with a cloistered sanctity, and remote from all street-cries and rumble of the city,--odorous of old literature,--a spot where the commonest ideas ought not to be expressed in less than Latin.|$|R
40|$|Reducing the sac volume size of medium-/heavy-duty {{diesel engine}} {{injector}} nozzles can minimise the fuel dripping into the combustion chamber {{at the end}} of injection events, which has been linked to reduced engine-out emissions. This study demonstrates the effect of reduction in the sac volume of diesel fuel injectors utilised in medium-/heavy-duty applications on the internal nozzle flow. This is realised by comparison of two heavy-duty diesel nozzles that feature a large difference in sac volume size of almost three times. For visualisation purposes, the nozzles have been enlarged by six times, and replicas were manufactured from a transparent material. High-speed digital imaging was used to capture the instantaneous spatial and temporal characteristics of geometric as well as dynamic vortex cavitation structures. The investigation was conducted in a steady-state flow test rig for three different needle valve lifts. For all tested conditions, the flow behaviour was analysed at three distinct areas of the nozzle, these being the needle <b>seat,</b> the sac <b>volume</b> and the injection hole. Interpretation of experimental observations was supported by parallel computational fluid dynamics simulations of the exact conditions measured during the experiments. Post-processing of the captured images has revealed the ensemble – average cavitation location, its standard deviation and the cavitation structures life – time inside the sac volume. Results showed a significant dependency of the internal nozzle flow on the sac volume size and identified clear differences {{in the structure of the}} cavitation pockets inside the sac volume under certain operating conditions...|$|R
