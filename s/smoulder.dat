25|$|Although {{humans have}} many uses for peat, it {{presents}} severe problems at times. Wet or dry, {{it can be}} a major fire hazard; peat fires may burn for great lengths of time, or <b>smoulder</b> underground and reignite after the winter if an oxygen source is present. Because they are easily compressed under minimal weight, peat deposits pose major difficulties to builders of structures, roads, and railways.

50|$|The {{fundamental}} difference between <b>smouldering</b> and flaming combustion is that <b>smouldering</b> occurs {{on the surface of}} the solid rather than in the gas phase. <b>Smouldering</b> is a surface phenomenon but can propagate to the interior of a porous fuel if it is permeable to flow. The characteristic temperature and heat released during <b>smouldering</b> are low compared to those in the flaming combustion (i.e., ~600 C vs. ~1500 C). <b>Smouldering</b> propagates in a creeping fashion, around , which is about ten times slower than flames spread over a solid. In spite of its weak combustion characteristics, <b>smouldering</b> is a significant fire hazard. <b>Smouldering</b> emits toxic gases (e.g., carbon monoxide) at a higher yield than flaming fires and leaves behind a significant amount of solid residue. The emitted gases are flammable and could later be ignited in the gas phase, triggering the transition to flaming combustion.|$|R
50|$|Fire safety: The main hazards {{posed by}} <b>smouldering</b> {{arise from the}} fact that it can be easily {{initiated}} (by heat sources too weak to ignite flames) and is difficult to detect. Fire statistics draw attention to the magnitude of <b>smouldering</b> combustion as the leading cause of fire deaths in residential areas (i.e., more than 25% of the fire deaths in the United States are attributed to smoulder-initiated fires, with similar figures in other developed countries). A particularly common fire scenario is a cigarette igniting a piece of upholstered furniture. This ignition leads to a <b>smouldering</b> fire that lasts for a long period of time (in the order of hours), spreading slowly and silently until critical conditions are attained and flames suddenly erupt; fire-resistant cigarettes have been developed to reduce the risk of fire due to <b>smouldering.</b> <b>Smouldering</b> combustion is also a fire-safety concern aboard space facilities (e.g., International Space Station), because the absence of gravity is thought to promote <b>smouldering</b> ignition and propagation.|$|R
40|$|Oats {{are a new}} biofuel {{possible}} to use in modified residential wood pellet combustion appliances. The emissions of organic compounds from five sequential combustion stages; initial <b>smouldering,</b> early flaming, late flaming, after-flame <b>smouldering</b> and final glowing, for incomplete burning of oats on a laboratory scale were determined by gas chromatography and compared to those of softwood pellets. High concentrations of 1, 6 -anhydroglucose and furan-related compounds were released from the initial <b>smouldering</b> of oats, while high concentrations of methoxyphenols were released during the initial <b>smouldering</b> of wood pellets. The results indicate that oats are a biofuel with relatively low emissions during combustion, almost as low as those from wood pellets. After-flame <b>smouldering</b> of oats released lower concentrations of methane, alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons than the after-flame <b>smouldering</b> of wood pellets. The large differences in emissions from the various combustion stages should be considered when evaluating the environmental aspects and health effects of residential burning of oats and wood pellets...|$|R
25|$|Beside {{the danger}} of people {{receiving}} burns from the fire or embers, campfires may spread into a larger fire. A campfire may burn {{out of control in}} two basic ways: on the ground or in the trees. Dead leaves or pine needles on the ground may ignite from direct contact with burning wood, or from thermal radiation. If a root, particularly a dead one, is exposed to fire, it may <b>smoulder</b> underground and ignite the parent tree long after the original fire is doused and the campers have left the area. Alternatively, airborne embers (or their smaller kin, sparks) may ignite dead material in overhanging branches. This latter threat is less likely, but a fire in a branch is extremely difficult to put out without firefighting equipment, and may spread more quickly than a ground fire.|$|E

500|$|On 31 May 1916, Princess Royal was the {{flagship}} of the 1st BCS, {{under the command}} of Rear-Admiral Osmond Brock. The squadron had put to sea {{with the rest of the}} Battlecruiser Fleet, led by Beatty in Lion, to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the British ships to their west by mid-afternoon and turned about to fall back on the German battleships, then about [...] behind him. Beatty turned to cut him off, but was out of position to do that and had to settle for a pursuit. This began what was to be called the [...] "Run to the South" [...] as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper's course. The Germans opened fire first, three minutes later, followed almost immediately afterward by the British. The sisters were in the lead and were engaged by their opposite numbers, the battlecruisers, [...] and Derfflinger. Fire from both German ships was very accurate, and both Lion and Princess Royal were hit twice within three minutes of the Germans' opening fire. Lion scored her first hit on Lützow two minutes later, but one of Lützows 305mm (12in) shells hit 'Q' turret at 16:00. It blew the front roof and the centre face plates off the turret, killed or wounded everyone inside, and started a fire that continued to <b>smoulder</b> despite efforts to put it out. Accounts of subsequent events differ, but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the smouldering fire ignited the propellant charges in the turret working room at 4:28. They burnt violently, with the flames reaching as high as the masthead, and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting. The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors, and it is probable that the magazine would have exploded, sinking the ship, if it had not already been flooded. At 16:30 the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. After confirming the sighting himself, Beatty ordered his ships to turn around and fall back upon the oncoming Grand Fleet. During the Run to the South Princess Royal was hit a total of six times by Derfflinger, but none of them were serious.|$|E

This experimental study was conducted to improve our understanding of how moisture and mineral content constrain <b>smouldering</b> in organic soil. Laboratory burning was conducted with root mat and muck soil samples from pocosin and pond pine woodland wetlands common on the North Carolina coastal plain. The results of laboratory and prescribed burning were compared. Laboratory results showed that moisture and mineral content influenced sustained <b>smouldering</b> in root mat soils. Predictions based on logistic regression analysis show that root mat soils with an average mineral content of 4. 5 % had an estimated 50 % probability of sustained <b>smouldering</b> at a moisture content of 93 %, whereas at moisture contents above 145 % the estimated probability was less than 10 %. The odds that root mat soil will sustain <b>smouldering</b> decrease by 19. 3 % for each 5 % increase in moisture content. Root mat soils with an average mineral content of 5. 5 % and a moisture content of 93 % had an estimated 61 % probability of sustained <b>smouldering.</b> The odds that root mat soil will sustain <b>smouldering</b> combustion increased by 155. 9 % with each 1 % increase in mineral content. Root mat and muck soils differ in physical and chemical characteristics expected to influence <b>smouldering</b> behaviour.

40|$|<b>Smouldering</b> Technology for Aquifer Remediation (STAR) {{is a novel}} {{technology}} for the remediation of contamination by non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) in the subsurface. <b>Smouldering</b> {{is a form of}} combustion that is flameless. Generally, <b>smouldering</b> is slower and less energetic than flaming combustion. Familiar examples of <b>smouldering</b> involve solid fuels that are destroyed by the reaction (e. g., a <b>smouldering</b> cigarette or peat <b>smouldering</b> after a wildfire). In STAR, the NAPL serves as the fuel within an inert, porous soil medium. Once the NAPL fuel is ignited in the subsurface, the hot gases emitted from the exothermic NAPL <b>smouldering</b> heat the porous media ahead of the reaction, increasing the both reaction efficiency and the flammability limits of many liquid fuels. STAR {{has the potential to be}} both self-sustaining and self-targeting. If the energy released by the <b>smouldering</b> reaction, stored and recirculated ahead of the reaction is sufficient to allow the <b>smouldering</b> front to propagate forward, the ignition source may be removed and the <b>smouldering</b> reaction may become self-sustaining. The distribution of NAPL fuel in the subsurface is the path the <b>smouldering</b> front will follow. Because the soil is inert, the <b>smouldering</b> front follows the path of the fuel within the soil and does not spread beyond this path, making the reaction self-targeting. The <b>smouldering</b> reaction is controlled by the delivery of air or oxidant to the subsurface. Once the air or oxidant supply is removed, the reaction stops, making the reaction self-terminating. Results from laboratory and field experiments are very promising. At the laboratory scale, nine NAPL fuels have been tested. NAPLs including petrochemicals, chlorinated solvents and coal tar have been remediated successfully by STAR. Physical and chemical analysis of soils after treatment by STAR suggested little to no residual NAPL contamination remained. More extensive characterisation work has been carried out on coal tar, the most energetic of the NAPL fuels. Parameters such as air flow rate, initial NAPL saturation, soil type and ignition method have been varied to study their impact on the <b>smouldering</b> reaction. Larger scale studies have been carried out in the development of this technology toward field-deployable configurations. Field scenarios for STAR include both in situ and ex situ configurations. The laboratory experiments scale directly to the ex situ field configuration where excavated, NAPL-contaminated soil is placed in a reactor vessel and treated by STAR. For the in situ configuration, the STAR process is initiated in the NAPL pool in the subsurface. Air or oxidant is supplied to support the reaction and force it to follow the NAPL fuel through the subsurface. Successful application of the in situ STAR method has the potential for leaving the treated soil in place, avoiding the costly excavation and disposal processes while protecting the aquifer. Because the contaminant is destroyed in place, treatment costs of recovered NAPL are avoided as well. Field trials are underway for ex situ STAR. This paper presents laboratory, small-scale field experiments and pilot ex situ field trials that have been conducted. Discussion focuses on the key parameters required for successful application of STAR as well as emissions characterisation for combustion byproducts...|$|R

An {{increase in the}} quality of the building envelope with more and better insulation is therefore an initiative to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. <b>Smouldering</b> fire is a hazard in combustible insulation. A material can decompose and undergo a <b>smouldering</b> combustion at lower temperatures than needed to initiate a flaming fire, and cellulose insulation in combination with inadequate separation from electrical appliances and heat-producing equipment has led to <b>smouldering</b> combustions and building fires. The purpose of this thesis was to find the conditions necessary for combustible building insulation materials to undergo a self-sustained <b>smouldering</b> combustion. The main goal was to find the temperature exposure needed to initiate a self-sustained <b>smouldering</b> combustion. If <b>smouldering</b> was obtained, the differences and similarities in the combustion of the different test materials was studied and connected to the chemical and physical properties of the materials. The thesis is based on experimental tests. A literature study was used as a foundation for the discussion of test results. Four different types wood fibre insulation was tested. The samples were placed in an insulated steel chimney above a hotplate, and heated from underneath. Temperature development and mass loss was registered during the testing. The results show that one of the four test materials obtained a <b>smouldering</b> combustion at temperatures much lower than the rest. Two different types of <b>smouldering</b> behaviours were observed in the test samples. The distinction was made based on the registered mass losses and maximum temperatures. The one with highest maximum temperature and mass loss was found to be typical for materials undergoing a secondary oxidation of the char. The temperatures needed from external heating to obtain a self-sustained <b>smouldering</b> behaviour in the tested materials are: 275 °C for material T, 280 °C for material U, 225 °C for material V and 290 °C for material W. This indicated that an onset of a self-sustained <b>smouldering</b> combustion occurs at lower temperature in insulation material with smaller fibre size than in a material with larger fibre size, when the materials have the same added level of fire retardant. A higher level of added fire retardant gave an onset of a <b>smouldering</b> combustion at lower temperatures, when the fibre size of the material is the same. The testing and results in this thesis is only indicative. Future work should include more tests with each material, but narrow down the factors to be studied. The existing test results can also be analysed with other methods than the ones used in this thesis, to look for more information...|$|R
