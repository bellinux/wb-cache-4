The visibility of the tip vortices using the <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>method</b> was documented for advance ratios up to 0. 175. It was demonstrated that shadowgraphs of the rotor wake in forward flight can be used to obtain qualitative and quantitative information about wake geometry, wake/body interactions, and blade/vortex interactions.

Quantitative measurements were made of the wake trajectories as functions of wake age, as well as estimates of the tip vortex core radius. The results have provided many details of the rotor wake structure that are useful for validating rotor wake and rotor/body interactional models in forward flight.

Although never matured to the point of replacing existing lower throughput optical microscopy <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>methods,</b> the system was successfully applied to automating the counting of large particle samples for increased accuracy in calculating mean particle properties based on measurements of multiparticle samples. The measurement of particle size with the PSA was compared to current shadowgraph techniques and found to result in considerably greater throughput at the cost of larger measurement uncertainty. The current algorithm used by the PSA is more sensitive to particle shape and this is a likely cause of the greater uncertainty when attempting to measure average particle diameter. The use of the PSA to measure particle shape will require further development. Particle transport through the PSA and stability of the light source/detector are key elements in the successful application of this technique. A number of system pitfalls were studied and addressed...|$|R
40|$|Background {{oriented}} schlieren (BOS) is {{a recent}} development of the schlieren and <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>methods.</b> The BOS technique {{has the ability to}} provide visualizations of the density gradient in both the axial and radial directions. The resultant magnitude of the density gradients allows for comparison with shadowgraph images. This paper first compares data obtained by the BOS and shadowgraph techniques at identical conditions in a free jet. The patterns and spacing of the shock trains obtained by the two techniques are found to be consistent with one another. This provides confidence in the shock spacing measurement by the BOS technique. Due to its simpler setup, BOS is then applied to investigate the shock spacing associated with the screech phenomenon, especially during stage jumps. Screech frequencies from a 37. 6 mm convergent nozzle, as a function of jet Mach number (M(sub j)), are shown to exhibit various stages. As many as eight stages are identified with the present nozzle over the range 1. 0 < M(sub j) < 1. 7.

We tested 18 ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene acetabular components revised for wear and aseptic loosening, of which 13 had pre-revision radiographs, {{from which the}} wear volume was calculated based upon the linear wear. We used a shadowgraph technique on silicone casts {{of all of the}} retrievals and a coordinate measuring method on the components directly. For these techniques, the wear vector was calculated for each component and the wear volume extrapolated using mathematical equations. The volumetric wear was also measured directly using a fluid-displacement method. The results of each technique were compared. The series had high wear volumes (mean 1385 mm(3); 730 to 1850) and high wear rates (mean 205 mm(3) /year; 92 to 363). There were wide variations in the measurements of wear volume between the radiological and the other techniques. Radiograph-derived wear volume correlated poorly with that of the fluid-displacement method, co-ordinate measuring <b>method</b> and <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>methods,</b> becoming less accurate as the wear increased. The mean overestimation in radiological wear volume was 47. 7 % of the fluid-displacement method wear volume. Fluid-displacement method, coordinate measuring <b>method</b> and <b>shadowgraph</b> determinations of wear volume were all better than that of the radiograph-derived linear measurements since they took into account the direction of wear. However, only radiological techniques can be used in vivo and remain useful for monitoring linear wear in the clinical setting. Interpretation of radiological measurements of acetabular wear must be done judiciously in the clinical setting.

The discharge may initiate without density reduction due to electrostrictive force. While shock wave Mach number was little affected by the voltage rise rate, it increased by increasing the negative voltage peak.

The small-scale vortex structure appears in the ethanol-water droplet at the very beginning, and then vortex structure develops and merges to form larger vortex flow. At the interface of acetone-water binary droplet, symmetrical circular flow appears at first, and then vortex flow arises in the circular flow. For the quiescent single binary droplet composed of ethanol-water and acetone-water separately, the mass transfer coefficient is measured to compare with theoretical prediction while N 2 gas purges the gas-liquid interface. Experimental results show that the large-scale symmetrical circular inside the droplet can promote mass transfer process much better than the small-scale vortex near the interface of droplet. ?

40|$|Water surface {{features}} {{induced by}} the impact of raindrops on a deep water pool are studied experimentally in an artificial rain facility. Artificial rain is produced by a rain generator that consists of a rectangular tank {{with an array of}} 738 hypodermic needles attached to its bottom and that is mounted at various heights above a deep water pool. In this thesis, three rain intensities and four raindrop impact velocities are used while the diameters of raindrops remain approximately the same. For comparison with some {{of the results of the}} rain experiments, a set of single drop impacts on a quiescent water surface were also performed. In the single drop impact experiments, cinematic <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>methods</b> were used to measure the drop diameter (D) and velocity (V) just before impact, to observe qualitatively the water surface response and to measure the height of the vertical water jet (stalk) that is typically part of the water surface response. It is found that the stalk height varies with impact Froude number (Fr = V^ 2 /(gD), where g is the acceleration of gravity) in three different ways depending on the Froude number range. In the rain experiments, the drop diameters and velocities are measured with a cinematic shadowgraph technique while the temporal evolution of the surface profile along the center plane of the target water pool is measured with a cinematic Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) technique. The history of rain-induced stalk height and the profiles of the rain-induced surface waves are extracted at each instant in time. It is found that the stalk height varies considerably in the rain field and the average stalk heights are less than in cases with single drop impacting a quiescent surface at the same Froude number (Fr). The stalk height distribution correlates with the rain intensities rather than the impact velocity. Occasional bubble en- trainment was observed at the lowest raindrop impact velocity (Fr = 500) while bubble entrainment only occurred for Froude numbers greater than 1800 in single drop experiments. Furthermore, surface waves outside of the rain field propagate faster than that inside the rain field. Radar backscattering powers from raindrops, surface waves in front of the rain field and the water surface features inside a rain field are measured. The measurement results show that strong radar return signals are observed from the water surface inside the rain field while the radar return signals from both raindrops and the surface waves in front of the rain field are weak. The experimental results also show that the radar return intensity increases as the rain intensity increases from 85 to 300 mm/hr. In addition, it is found that the attenuation of the radar backscattering from the rain field is likely correlated with a high-water-content layer of secondary droplets generated in the rain field...|$|R

In contrast to a large amount of experimental work on Marangoni convection in pure liquids, such experiments in binary mixtures are not available in the literature, to our knowledge. Using binary mixtures of sodium chloride/water, we have systematically investigated the pattern formation for a set of substrate temperatures and solute concentrations in an open system. The flow patterns evolve with time, driven by surface-tension fluctuations due to evaporation and the Soret effect, while the air-liquid interface does not deform. A <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>method</b> is used to follow the pattern formation in time. The patterns are mainly composed of polygons and rolls. The mean pattern size first decreases slightly, and then gradually increases during the evolution. Evaporation affects the pattern formation mainly at the early stage and the local evaporation rate tends to become spatially uniform at the film surface. The Soret effect becomes important at the later stage and affects the mixture for a large mean solute concentration where the Soret number is significantly above zero. The strength of convection increases with the initial solute concentration and the substrate temperature. Our findings differ from the theoretical predictions in which evaporation is neglected.

The high-speed liquid jets are generated by the impact of a projectile, which known as impact acceleration method, launched in a horizontal single-stage power gun (HSSPG). The conical nozzle of 30 ° angle with the orifice diameter of 0. 7 mm was used to generate the jets.

A detailed study of this mechanism which encompasses the motion analysis of the whip-tip as well as the determination of the local origin of the shock emission requires a sophisticated recording technique. A pre-trigger framing high-speed video camera system was used which was triggered by an acoustical sensor and synchronized with a pulsed copper-vapour laser.

One part of the analysis is the experimental simulation of a flight point at an altitude of approximately 20 km in the High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel Göttingen (HEG). To conduct these experiments a very complex wind tunnel model of the SHEFEX-I configuration has been designed, machined and instrumented by DLR. The experimental campaign performed in HEG included the measurement of surface pressure and surface heat fluxes on the wind tunnel model.

40|$|The flow {{downstream}} of a grid in a {{wind tunnel}} is of considerable interest for two reasons. Theoretically, {{it represents a}} good approximation to the idealized concept of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, and therefore provides a benchmark to evaluate various analytical theories of turbulence. On the practical side, grids and screens are used extensively {{in the management of}} turbulence in a variety of applications. Experimental studies of grid turbulence are numerous in incompressible flow but far scarcer in compressible flow. The present study considers the characteristics of grid turbulence over a range of Mach numbers, M, ranging from the essentially incompressible (M = 0. 16), through the moderate subsonic ($ 0. 16 M 0. 7) $ and high subsonic $(0. 7 M 1. 0),$ to the supersonic (M = 1. 55). The experiments comprise flow visualization, performed with the <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>method,</b> and mean and fluctuating velocity measurements, made with a laser-Doppler velocimeter. Characteristics of the flow near the grid were visualized in a demonstration nozzle using the schlieren technique. In the moderate subsonic regime, flow visualization indicated that the flow near the grid underwent major changes as M increased. The turbulence intensity and decay characteristics were also found to be influenced, which was attributed to the changes in the flow near the grid. In the high subsonic regime, an unsteady quasi-normal shock was present in the test section. This induced relatively large velocity fluctuations and anisotropic turbulence. In the supersonic regime, stationary oblique shocks generated by the grid were present throughout the test section, which interfered with the turbulence and introduced errors in the measurement technique...|$|E

In this study, real-time, non-invasive shadowgraph imaging was applied to obtain additional analyses of cough airflows produced by healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 women, mean age 32. 2 ± 12. 9 years; 10 men, mean age 25. 3 ± 2. 5 years) were asked to cough freely, then into their sleeves (as per current US CDC recommendations) in this study to analyze cough airflow dynamics. For the 10 females (cases 1 - 10), their maximum detectable cough propagation distances ranged from 0. 16 - 0. 55 m, with maximum derived velocities of 2. 2 - 5. 0 m/s, and their maximum detectable 2 -D projected areas ranged from 0. 010 - 0. 11 m(2), with maximum derived expansion rates of 0. 15 - 0. 55 m(2) /s. For the 10 males (cases 11 - 20), their maximum detectable cough propagation distances ranged from 0. 31 - 0. 64 m, with maximum derived velocities of 3. 2 - 14 m/s, and their maximum detectable 2 -D projected areas ranged from 0. 04 - 0. 14 m(2), with maximum derived expansion rates of 0. 25 - 1. 4 m(2) /s. These peak velocities were measured when the visibility of the exhaled airflows was optimal and compare favorably with those reported previously using other methods, and may be seen as a validation of these previous approaches in a more natural setting. However, the propagation distances can only represent a lower limit due to the inability of the <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>method</b> to visualize these cough airflows once their temperature cools to that of the ambient air, which is an important limitation of this methodology. The qualitative high-speed video footage of these volunteers coughing into their sleeves demonstrates that although this method rarely completely blocks the cough airflow, it decelerates, splits and redirects the airflow, eventually reducing its propagation. The effectiveness of this intervention depends on optimum positioning of the arm over the nose and mouth during coughing, though unsightly stains on sleeves may make it unacceptable to some...|$|E

The difficulty created by the use of JP 8 is that its combustion temperature is higher than other conventional fuels, and preheating is necessary, {{especially in the case of}} cold start. Thus, the question posed was, could a more appropriate and efficient method of fuel delivery be devised? This thesis presents the design and construction of a fluid spray visualisation system for investigating the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of fuel sprays using low injection pressure up to 10 bar (1 MPa). Laser imaging techniques have been used for data acquisition. The thesis has been divided into several aspects. Firstly, a background study of fluid sprays and fuel injection strategies was carried out. This has centred on the relationship between droplet size and the combustion process. It further investigated what differentiated the fuel delivery approach to Wankle from that to other engines. Secondly, two families of fuel injector were tested and evaluated within the optical engineering laboratory using deionised water (DI) water for safety reasons. The first family involved conventional gasoline injectors with several nozzle arrangements. The second family involved medical nebulisers with several nozzle diameters. The evaluation of the fuel injectors required developing a fluid delivery circuit, and a specific ECU (Electronic Control Unit) for controlling pulse delivery and imaging instrument. The company associated with the project then set up a test cell for performing experiments on JP 8 fuel. The initial global visualisation of the jet spray was made using a conventional digital camera. This gave a measurement of the spray angle and penetration length. However, as the study moved to the more precise determination of the fuel spray particulate size, a specialised Nd:YAG laser based diagnostic was created combined with a long range diffraction limited microscope. Microscopic characterisation of the fuel sprays was carried out using a backlight <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>method.</b> The microscopic shadowgraphy method was applied successfully to resolve droplets larger than 4 microns in diameter. The spray development process during an individual fuel injection cycle was investigated, presenting the frequency response effect of electronic fuel injectors (EFI) on the spray characteristics when operating at high injection frequencies (0. 25 -­‐ 3. 3 kHz). The velocity distribution during the different stages of an injection cycle was investigated using PIV. The influence of the injection pressure on the spray pattern and droplet size was also presented. Novel fluid atomisation systems were investigated for the capability of generating an optimum particulate distribution under low pressure. Finally, it was found that a new electronic medical nebuliser (micro-­‐dispenser) could be used to deliver the fuel supply with the relevant particle size distribution at low flow rate and high injection frequency. However, as yet it has not been possible to apply this approach to the engine; it is hoped that it will yield a more efficient method of cold starting the engine. The characteristics of this atomiser can be applied to provide a controllable fuel supply approach for all rotary engines to improve their fuel efficiency. The second part of this research discusses the droplets-­‐light interaction using Mie scattering for fluid droplets smaller than the microscope visualisation limit (4 microns). Mie scattering theory was implemented into Three-­‐Components Particle Image Velocimetry (3 C-­‐ PIV) tests to address a number of problems associated with flow seeding using oil smoke. Mie curves were used to generate the scattering profile of the oil sub-­‐micron droplets, and therefore the scattering efficiency can be calculated at different angles of observation. The results were used in jet flow PIV system for the determination of the optimum position of the two cameras to generate balanced brightness between the images pairs. The brightness balance between images is important for improving the correlation quality in the PIV calculations. The scattering efficiency and the correlation quality were investigated for different seeding materials and using different interrogation window sizes...|$|E
