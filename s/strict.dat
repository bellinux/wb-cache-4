5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to the <b>strict</b> scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of <b>strict</b> scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the <b>strict</b> scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of <b>stricter</b> {{screening}} of disability insurance applications. A large-scale experiment was set up wherein two of the 26 Dutch regions caseworkers of the disability insurance administration were instructed to screen applications more stringently. The empirical results show that <b>stricter</b> screening reduces long-term sickness absenteeism and disability insurance applications. We find evidence for direct effects of <b>stricter</b> screening on work resumption {{during the period of}} sickness absence and for self-screening by potential disability insurance applicants. Furthermore, <b>stricter</b> screening improves targeting efficiency without inducing negative spillover effects on the inflow into unemployment insurance. © 2010 by the European Economic Association...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} financial constraints in {{a theoretical}} analysis of illegal immigration. Intermediaries finance the migration costs of wealth-constrained migrants, who enter temporary servitude contracts {{to pay back}} the debt. These debt/labor contracts are more easily enforceable in the illegal than in the legal sector of the host country. Hence, when moving from the illegal to the legal sector becomes more costly, for instance, because of <b>stricter</b> deportation policies, fewer immigrants default on debt. This reduces the risks for intermediaries, who are then more willing to finance illegal migration. <b>Stricter</b> deportation policies may thus increase rather than decrease the ex ante flow of illegal migrants. We also show that <b>stricter</b> deportation policies worsen the skill composition of immigrants. While <b>stricter</b> border controls decrease overall immigration, they may also result in an increase of debt-financed migration...|$|R
