5|$|News {{sources have}} {{referred}} to the George Washington Memorial Bridge as a suicide bridge and, in December 2006, six emergency phones and 18 signs were installed on the bridge {{to encourage people to}} <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> instead of jumping.

40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of effective means for dealing with mental health issues, the majority of high school youth do not seek needed treatment. Research has shown that {{one reason for this}} is the internalization of public stigma, or self-stigma (Corrigan, 2004), however the nature of this barrier to help-seeking is not well understood. This study examined two potentially related factors, which have not been studied to date, namely perceived mattering (others are interested in me) and anti-mattering (others do not care about me) to determine possible links to self-stigma. Self report measures of mattering, anti-mattering, and self-stigma of <b>seeking</b> <b>help</b> were administered to Grade 12 students at three public high schools in a large metropolitan Canadian city (n = 134). A significant negative correlation was found between levels of perceived mattering and the self-stigma of <b>seeking</b> <b>help,</b> but no significant correlation was found between levels of perceived anti-mattering and the self-stigma of <b>seeking</b> <b>help.</b> A key finding was that gender was determined to be a significant moderator between perceived mattering and anti-mattering and the self-stigma of <b>seeking</b> psychological <b>help,</b> with perceived mattering predicting self-stigma of <b>seeking</b> <b>help</b> for female students and perceived anti-mattering as a negative predictor of self-stigma of <b>seeking</b> <b>help</b> for male students. This is the first study to explore the relationships between perceived mattering and the self-stigma of <b>seeking</b> <b>help,</b> perceived anti-mattering and the self-stigma of <b>seeking</b> <b>help,</b> and the influence of gender on these relationships. This study highlights factors involved in high school students experiences of self-stigma of <b>seeking</b> psychological <b>help,</b> and suggests that there may be differences in the way male and female youth process feelings of whether or not they matter, and the impacts these feelings on the likelihood of them <b>seeking</b> <b>help</b> should it be needed. Implications for stigma reduction interventions and mental health promotion in high schools are discussed...|$|R

5|$|After the French {{defeat at}} Waterloo, the works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works {{in their private}} collections.

In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.|$|E

Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return.

5|$|Despite {{sovereign}} debt having risen substantially {{in only a}} few eurozone countries, with the three most affected countries Greece, Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), it has become a perceived problem for the area as a whole, leading to speculation of further contagion of other European countries and a possible break-up of the eurozone. In total, the debt crisis forced five out of 17 eurozone countries to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from other nations by the end of 2012.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of academic <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> studies worldwide have predominantly used the quantitative paradigm {{and have been}} undertaken in the secondary and primary sector. This project addresses a perceived gap in the research as it was conducted in a tertiary institution‟s learning centre in Aotearoa, New Zealand using Constructivist Grounded Theory {{in order to gain}} a deeper understanding of tertiary students‟ academic <b>help</b> <b>seeking.</b> <b>Help</b> <b>seeking</b> theory was reconceptualised in order to provide a more descriptive model of the process, than had previously occurred because of the quantitative nature of the {{majority of}} the previous <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> studies. Eight participants from a tertiary institute‟s learning centre were interviewed about their motivation to seek academic help; were videoed during a learning support session; and then interviewed regarding this session. Grounded theory was used to analyse the data from both interviews and the videoed learning support session. Four aspects were indentified that motivated participants to seek academic help: the recognition of the need for help; views of help seeking; participants‟ views of themselves as help seekers; and confidence. Two previously theorised types of <b>help</b> <b>seeking,</b> executive and instrumental <b>help</b> <b>seeking,</b> were confirmed in the videoed learning support sessions. Two new types were also identified, executive/instrumental and instrumental/executive <b>help</b> <b>seeking,</b> which were combinations of previously identified <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> types. <b>Help</b> <b>seeking</b> approach was also discerned as different from <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> type. <b>Help</b> <b>seeking</b> approach was theorised as a state that seemed to be a background against which the four <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> types occurred. Behavioural precipitators of academic <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> were identified as either tutor or student initiated and were further categorised as prompts, pressures, permissions and provocations. A tentative overall model of tertiary <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> was developed. iv The findings of this study indicate that external pressures or permissions precipitated executive or instrumental <b>help</b> <b>seeking,</b> whereas external prompts precipitated executive/instrumental or instrumental/executive <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> and provocation precipitators led to executive/instrumental, instrumental/executive or instrumental <b>help</b> <b>seeking.</b> Recommendations for practitioners include being aware of the four different <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> types used by tertiary students, and that tutor actions can precipitate any of the four <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> types dependent on the <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> approach displayed by students. Recommendations also highlight that tutors need to be aware that student confidence is an important element in <b>seeking</b> <b>help,</b> and that students may not always see <b>help</b> <b>seeking</b> as positive. Suggestions for further research were outlined...|$|R

After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was cancelled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first manned Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director Flight Operations, and <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from NASA's doctors.|$|E
