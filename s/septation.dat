25|$|Follow-up imaging {{in women}} of {{reproductive}} age for incidentally discovered simple cysts on ultrasound {{is not needed}} until 5cm, as these are usually normal ovarian follicles. Simple cysts 5to 7cm in premenopausal females should be followed yearly. Simple cysts larger than 7cm require further imaging with MRI or surgical assessment. Because they are large, they cannot be reliably assessed by ultrasound alone because {{it may be difficult}} to see the soft tissue nodularity or thickened <b>septation</b> at their posterior wall due to limited penetrance of the ultrasound beam. For the corpus luteum, a dominant ovulating follicle that typically appears as a cyst with circumferentially thickened walls and crenulated inner margins, follow up is not needed if the cyst is less than 3cm in diameter. In postmenopausal patients, any simple cyst greater than 1cm but less than 7cm needs yearly follow-up, while those greater than 7cm need MRI or surgical evaluation, similar to reproductive age females.|$|E

30|$|The {{presence}} of <b>septations</b> and/or fibrinous strands usually suggests an exudate and/or a loculated collection. A loculated effusion may appear as multiple pockets of fluid separated by <b>septations.</b> It {{will not be}} mobile and, therefore, may not be dependent.|$|R

[...] Also, while the protein regulates the Cdk1 ortholog of S. pombe, this occurs through a process unlike that of S. cerevisiae; it does not dephosphorylate the Sic1 or Cdh1 orthologs, but promotes the inactivation of Cdc2 by down-regulating Cdc25 phosphatase.

40|$|Biliary cystadenocarcinoma is a {{very rare}} {{malignant}} cystic tumor of the liver, which is often misdiagnosed due to a poor recognition of it. We report {{a case of a}} 60 -year-old man with biliary cystadenocarcinoma with his real time contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) characteristics compared to those of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which were correlated with the surgical and pathologic findings. Cystic wall enhancement, internal <b>septations</b> and intra-cystic solid portions in the arterial phase were observed on CEUS after contrast agent injection. The enhancement was washed out progressively and depicted as hypo-enhancement in the portal and late phases. CT revealed a large irregular cystic lesion in the left liver lobe with no clear <b>septations</b> and solid components. MRI showed an irregular cystic occupying lesion with <b>septations...</b>|$|R

50|$|The genome of C. albicans encodes homologues to all S. cerevisiae septins. Without Cdc3 and Cdc12 genes Candida albicans cannot proliferate, other septins affect {{morphology}} and chitin deposition, {{but are not}} essential. Candida albicans {{can display}} different morphologies of vegetative growth, which determines the appearance of septin structures. Newly forming hyphae form a septin ring at the base, Double rings form at sites of hyphal <b>septation,</b> and a septin cap forms at hyphal tips. Elongated septin-filaments encircle the spherical chlamydospores. Double rings of septins at the <b>septation</b> site also bear growth polarity, with the growing tip ring disassembling, while the basal ring remaining intact.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} <b>septations</b> in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT) thick-ness, and to investigate {{the relationship between the}} length and thickness of the translucency and whether the length or <b>septations</b> provide useful information concern-ing the fetal karyotype in addition to that provided by the NT thickness alone. METHODS: We examined 386 fetuses with NT thickness equal to or above the 95 th percentile for crown-rump length (CRL). A transverse suboccipitobregmatic section of the fetal head was taken to determine whether the sonolucency was septated, and a midsagittal longitudinal section was used to measure NT thickness, CRL, the longi-tudinal distance between the occiput and {{the lower end of the}} sonolucency toward the fetal sacrum (NT length) and the length between the occiput and the sacral tip (spinal length). Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the effect on abnormal karyotype of CRL, NT thickness, and percentage of NT length to spinal length. RESULTS: <b>Septations</b> within the translucency were ob-served in all fetuses. The fetal karyotype was abnormal in 83 (21. 5 %) pregnancies, and multiple regression showed that the only significant independent predictor of abnor-mal karyotype was fetal NT thickness. CONCLUSION: <b>Septations</b> within the translucency can be seen in all fetuses, and therefore this feature cannot be used to distinguish between increased NT and cystic hygromas. The length of the translucency is related to its thickness and does not give useful information concerning the fetal karyo-type in addition to that provided by the NT thickness alone...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, pineal cysts are {{a commonplace}} and {{incidental}} finding (11 %) {{in children with}} no neurological signs. The frequent presence of <b>septations</b> with high-resolution MRI (74 %) should be recognised to avoid superfluous controls or IV contrast media.|$|R
30|$|A {{foreign body}} {{can easily be}} {{confused}} with normal soft tissue structures, such as fibrous <b>septations,</b> muscle fascia, bones, and cartilage, especially in the hands and feet. As with foreign bodies, these structures appear hyperechoic and may cause shadowing [308].|$|R
50|$|The actual {{mechanism}} of <b>septation</b> of the outflow tract is poorly understood, but {{is recognized as}} a dynamic process with contributions from contractile, hemodynamic, and extracellular matrix interactions. Misalignment of the septum can cause the congenital heart conditions tetralogy of Fallot, persistent truncus arteriosus, dextro-Transposition of the great arteries, tricuspid atresia, and anomalous pulmonary venous connection.|$|E
50|$|Kutzneria are non-motile, aerobic, mesophilic, thermotolerant, Gram positive, chemo-organotrophs. They have stable, branched, cottony aerial mycelium. Their cell walls contain N-acetylated muramic {{acid and}} meso-diaminopimelic acid. They produce spores which are either cocci, bacilli or oval. They are long sporangiophores {{measuring}} up to 50 micrometres which are formed by <b>septation</b> of coiled, unbranched hyphae within the sporangiophores.|$|E
50|$|Because of the viscous, lumpy {{nature of}} {{infected}} pleural fluid, {{in combination with}} possible <b>septation</b> and loculation, it has been proposed that intrapleural fibrinolytic or mucolytic therapy might improve drainage and therefore might {{have a positive effect}} on the clinical outcome. Intrapleural fibrinolysis with urokinase decreased the need for surgery but there is a trend to increased serious side effects.|$|E

50|$|The arcuate uterus {{is a form}} of a uterine anomaly or {{variation}} {{where the}} uterine cavity displays a concave contour towards the fundus. Normally the uterine cavity is straight or convex towards the fundus on anterior-posterior imaging, but in the arcuate uterus the myometrium of the fundus dips into the cavity and may form a small <b>septation.</b> The distinction between an arcuate uterus and a septate uterus is not standardized.|$|E
