He then would broadcast his intel from Brooklyn and in shortwaves in Haiti that became known Radio Vonvon, in which anti-communist associates from California and Ronald Reagan played a role in its formation. In an attempt to uncover the leaks inside of the palace, François Duvalier murdered 19 members of its guard and sent an assassin to New York to dispose of Joseph. However during a flight to New York, one of Joseph's sources was on the same plane and managed to tip him off.

25|$|Paine was an {{enthusiastic}} {{supporter of the}} French Revolution, and was granted honorary French citizenship alongside prominent contemporaries such as Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and others. Paine's honorary citizenship was {{in recognition of the}} publishing of his Rights of Man, Part II and the sensation it created within France. Despite his inability to speak French, {{he was elected to the}} National Convention, representing the district of Pas-de-Calais. A few weeks after being elected to the National Convention, Paine was selected as one of nine deputies to be part of the Convention's Constitutional Committee, who were charged to draft a suitable constitution for the French Republic. He <b>subsequentially</b> participated in the Constitutional Committee in drafting the Girondin constitutional project. He voted for the French Republic; but argued against the execution of Louis XVI, saying that he should instead be exiled to the United States: firstly, because of the way royalist France had come to the aid of the American Revolution; and secondly because of a moral objection to capital punishment in general and to revenge killings in particular. However, Paine’s speech in defense of Louis XVI was interrupted by Jean-Paul Marat, who claimed that as a Quaker, Paine’s religious beliefs ran counter to inflicting capital punishment, and thus he should be ineligible to vote. Marat interrupted a second time, stating that the translator was deceiving the convention by distorting the meanings of Paine’s words, prompting Paine to provide a copy of the speech as proof that he was being correctly translated.|$|E

50|$|Since 2010 {{the lake}} has shrunk {{significantly}} and by September 2013 {{the lake was}} reduced to a mere puddle with less than 2% of its original surface size. The exact causes for the water loss are unknown. The suspects are drought conditions and the thawing of an assumed permafrost layer under the lake leading to increased seepage. After particularly wet winter in 2013/2014 however the lake recovered to around 75% of its original size in May 2014 and <b>subsequentially</b> returned to its normal size. Therefore, it is currently assumed that primary reason for the water loss were the drought conditions on Mauna Kea from 2010 to 2013.|$|E

5000|$|T. naphthophila was {{originally}} discovered by Takahata et.al. in the subterranean Kubiki oil reservoir of Niigata, Japan. This organism {{was found with}} another bacterium called Thermotoga petrophila, RKU-1''''. In order to transport the species samples, they were placed into sterile glass bottles in cooler boxes with ice. After arriving to the lab, the species were isolated on a medium of 0.2% yeast extract (YE) in artificial seawater at a pH of 7.

Containers of liquid medium were placed into 30 milliliter (mL) tubes and <b>subsequentially</b> exposed to H2 reduced copper furnace heat with oxygen free nitrogen. Then, sodium sulfide brought the pH of the medium to a range of 6.9-7.1 and the species were purified with Gelrite plating, an agar substitute. Thermotoga naphthophila naturally has a growth pH range of 5.4-9.0, but optimally prefers a pH of 7.0.|$|E
50|$|The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), {{maintained}} by the World Health Organization, does not recognize multiple chemical sensitivity or environmental sensitivity as a valid diagnosis. The Australian Department of Health recognizes that sometimes debilitating symptoms are attributed to MCS but notes that diagnosis, treatment, and any underlying mechanism remain uncertain. The German Institute for Medical Documentation and Information recognizes MCS as a physical disease and is <b>subsequentially</b> recognized in Austria. The American Medical Association does not recognize MCS as an organic disease {{because of the lack}} of scientific evidence supporting a cause-and-effect relationship between very low level exposure and the symptoms of MCS. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, the California Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, and the International Society of Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology also do not recognize MCS. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) indicates that MCS is highly controversial and that there is insufficient scientific evidence to explain the relationship between the suggested causes of MCS and its symptoms. OSHA recommends evaluation by a physician knowledgeable of the symptoms presented.|$|E
5000|$|After being {{hailed by}} reviewers from the NY Times to the SF Chronicle for his thrilling and unique piano playing, White chose to devote himself to {{making his first}} album and <b>subsequentially,</b> “hitting the road.” His work in the studio enabled him to {{assemble}} an A-list team of players for that release, 2002′s Uninvited Guest. He traveled and opened shows for many mainstays, including Shawn Colvin, Cowboy Junkies, Peter Wolf, Cheryl Wheeler and Jonathan Edwards, quickly gaining {{a reputation as a}} ‘dazzling’ and ‘not-to-be-missed’ performer. An early copy of his follow-up record, Symphony in 16 Bars landed in the hands of folk legend Judy Collins who then signed White to her own Wildflower Records and released the CD in the winter of 2005. Showcasing another remarkable ensemble of talent, Symphony in 16 Bars picked up where Uninvited Guest left off, following the main character whose story, set in New York City, navigates the heart’s complexities through an ever-changing urban landscape. In 2006, he compiled a politically-tinged, 5 song EP entitled, Never Like This.In early 2008, White's [...] "How Long" [...] from that record, won in The 7th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Social Action Song.
