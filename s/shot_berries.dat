50|$|Millerandage (or <b>shot</b> <b>berries,</b> hens and chicks and {{pumpkins}} and peas) is {{a potential}} viticultural hazard problem in which grape bunches contain berries that differ greatly in size and, most importantly, maturity. Its most common cause is cold, rainy or otherwise bad weather during the flowering stage of the vines though other factors, such as boron deficiency or fanleaf degeneration, may also play a role.|$|E
5000|$|However, the small, {{seedless}} berries {{may never}} fully ripen and stay hard and green (with high acid) throughout the growing season. Some growers {{may choose to}} remove clusters with high preponderance of millerandge through green harvesting or choose to harvest {{the entirety of the}} crop later at higher ripeness levels to balance the high acid and potentially [...] "green flavors" [...] of the <b>shot</b> <b>berries.</b> Other growers will remove the grape post-harvest at a sorting table along with other MOG.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Green pruning {{or summer}} pruning completes winter pruning, {{and it is}} {{conducted}} during the growing season. The purpose of green pruning is to maximize yield of high quality grapes. Green pruning in fruit trees improves light penetration and increases the quality of fruits. The objectives of this research were to {{determine the influence of}} green pruning on fruit quantitative and qualitative attributes in grapevine cultivar 'keshmeshi'. Materials and Methods: The present research was undertaken in Shirvan, Northern Khorasan province. The vines were highly uniform, 17 years old and all had equal vegetative growth strength. The planting distances were 3 × 3 m. The present study was conducted on cultivar 'Keshmeshi' that is considered {{to be one of the}} best grapevine cultivars mostly used for raisin production as well as table fresh fruits. In order to evaluate the effect of green pruning on different quantitative and qualitative attributes of fruits in cultivar "keshmeshi", the experiment was carried out in two way randomized complete block design with 12 treatments and three replications. Vines were pruned three times including full bloom, two weeks after full bloom and veraison (eight weeks after full bloom). Pruning was carried out in three levels including tipping after two, four or six nodes above the final cluster. The characteristics studied were cluster weight, berry weight, cluster length and width, berry length and width, number of cluster and berry, vine yield, leaf area, soluble solid, total acidity, pH, berry color, berry sunscald and number of <b>shot</b> <b>berry.</b> The SAS software (SAS, version 9. 1) was used for statistical analysis of the recorded data. The mean comparison was performed based on Duncan's multiple range tests at...|$|R

Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as leitmotifs for the show's establishing <b>shots.</b> After <b>Berry</b> left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original {{music for the}} next seven seasons. Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer. Dunlap's contributions to the show {{are one of the few}} that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.|$|R
40|$|Boron {{deficiency}} of grapevines occurs occasionally {{on the east}} side of the San Joaquin Valley. Its symp-toms include <b>shot</b> <b>berries,</b> shoot-tip dieback and leaves with yellowish mottling between veins. Boron must be applied carefully because the range between deficiency and toxic-ity is narrow. Our research evaluated the safety and efficacy of boron fertigation of grapevines using drip irrigation.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and growth of}} grape berries was studied in Canterbury, New Zealand on Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot. Experimentation {{was set up to}} examine: changes in yield components, the development of individual flowers, and the growth and cellular makeup of seeded, seedless, and <b>shot</b> <b>berries.</b> Vine yield components were manipulated by altering vine phenology using delayed winter spur pruning and alginate gel encapsulation. Flower development was studied by tagging flowers at capfall and describing the resulting berries at véraison. The set and development of the tagged flowers was altered with girdling and leaf area removal treatments to change carbohydrate availability. Finally the growth curves and cellular makeup of the different types of berries were described from a separate sample of berries. The timing of phenological growth stages may have an important role in determining components of yield. Bunch weight increased (38 %) with delayed winter spur pruning, due to a larger average berry weight. The increase in average berry weight resulted from changes in the berry population, with the proportion of large seeded berries increasing within bunches, associated with a possible reduction in the proportion of smaller seedless berries. Treatments that delayed bud break also delayed flowering date, perhaps to a time when weather conditions were more favourable for berry development. A weak relationship between the warmth of the bud break period and yield, as well as bunch weight, was found; this may be an indirect relationship. Studying individual flowers showed that berry set and development could be altered by manipulating carbohydrate availability. Girdling changed the development of some flowers. The proportion of seeded berries that formed was unaffected by girdling, while the proportion of seedless berries increased. The response of <b>shot</b> <b>berries</b> and flowers that abscised differed between 1999 and 2000. In 1999 the proportion of <b>shot</b> <b>berries</b> decreased, while in 2000 it was the proportion of abscised flowers that decreased after girdling. Leaf area reduction on girdled shoots had an opposite effect to girdling, with extreme levels of leaf removal (75 %) reducing the proportion of shot and seeded berries that formed. The percentage of abscised flowers increases dramatically with leaf area removal, while the proportion of seedless berries was unaffected. However, a weak positive relationship between total shoot leaf area and seedless berry development exists. The data from yield components and of individual flowers suggest that the population of berries are fluid in nature. <b>Shot</b> <b>berries</b> and flowers that abscise appear to be a pool from which seedless berries can form, when carbohydrate availability allows. The antibiotic spectinomycin was applied to alter fruit set and seed development of berries, though no effect was identified. The lack of a spectinomycin effect may have been the result of incorrect timing of treatment application. The mean overall fruit set differed between the 1999 (41 %) and 2000 (71 %) seasons. The greater fruit set and different behaviour of abscised flowers (c. f. <b>shot</b> <b>berries</b> in 1999) in 2000 might be a reflection of the warmer than average flowering period compared to the cooler flowering period of 1999 : This suggests that environmental conditions at flowering may influence fruit set. Flowers were found to vary in size at capfall, but neither flower size (ovary diameter) nor the time of capfall of individual flowers had any influence on berry set and development. Flower size and environmental conditions affected the progression of capfall. Smaller flowers tend to undergo capfall after larger flowers, and the progression of flowering is disrupted when rainfall and associated low temperatures occur. Temperatures above 15 °C were found to advance capfall in the 1999 and 2001 seasons. With flowers undergoing capfall {{over an extended period of}} time (about 20 days), individual flowers will experience quite different environmental conditions. However, no strong relationships between daily assessments of temperature at capfall and berry set or berry development were found. The strong effect of carbohydrate availability on berry development (as found with girdling and leaf area removal) suggests that light intensity (due to its impact on current photoassimilate supply) may be more valid an environmental index than temperature. The extent of berry growth is determined by the seed. A strong relationship between berry size and seed content was found. A minimum level of seed development (> 0. 5 mg fresh weight at harvest) is required for double sigmoid berry growth, which occurs as a consequence of cell division and expansion. Both seeded and seedless berries exhibit double sigmoid growth curves, however when seedless berries have less than 0. 5 mg seed content they show a single sigmoid growth curve. Seedless berries grow only as a result of cell expansion. Failure of the ovules to develop mean that <b>shot</b> <b>berries</b> only show a small amount of growth immediately post-capfall then halt all growth. A model of berry formation has been proposed, where flower abscission and fruit set are considered as contrasting processes and the formation of shot and seedless berries occurs when the normal process of seeded berry development fails. Once abscission has been prevented (i. e. the flower is set), the extent to which the flower develops is determined by what stage during pollination (shot berry) and fertilisation (seedless berry) that seed formation fails...|$|E
40|$|A shading {{experiment}} in ‘Black Magic’ cv {{was conducted in}} Sicily to test a new thinning method, aiming to reduce the no. berries/cluster, maximising quality and value of the production. A reduction of intercepted light was imposed at the 65 stage of the BBCH scale (50 % cap fall) for 12 days. The soilless greenhouse conditions allowed two growing cycles occurring under different climate conditions, an early (end of March flowering) and a late production cycle (beginning of August flowering). During the shade treatment, net photosynthetic rate was significantly reduced by 82 % and 96 % in the late and early production cycles, respectively. The sum of flowers and berries dropped in the untreated vines was about 80 % in the late and 17 % in the early cycle, increasing to 96 % and 49 % in the shaded vines. This supports the hypothesis that C-starvation during bloom induces berries abscission. As {{a consequence of the}} berry number reduction (46. 2 and 93. 4 berries/bunch obtained in the treatment versus 96. 8 and 173. 0 berries/bunch in the control, in late and early cycles), the yield dropped to 47. 4 % and 64. 0 % of control vines in the late and early cycle. Bunch compactness was also reduced, 5. 1 and 10. 5 berries/cm of rachis in shaded vines while 8. 0 and 15. 1 berries/cm of rachis in the control, in late and early production cycle. The no. <b>shot</b> <b>berries</b> was reduced 62. 5 % in shaded vines in the early cycle. TSS in shaded vines was higher than control in both cycles. Under the viticulture viewpoint, control vines in the late production cycle had already an adequate fruit set, so thinning practice is not economical advantageous. In contrast, in the early cycle control vines produced an excessive no. berries/bunch and a high incidence of <b>shot</b> <b>berries,</b> so, in this case, shading stands for a clear agronomic benefit. The fruit set in ‘Black Magic’ cv can be considered sensitive to incident light reduction at bloom, making shading an effective and successful non-chemical method...|$|E

5000|$|Licensing {{became an}} issue when Wenders tried to include footage he had <b>shot</b> of Chuck <b>Berry</b> in Frankfurt (presumably in late July 1973).

6000|$|Meantime Nelson {{received}} a severe wound {{on the head}} from a piece of langridge <b>shot.</b> Captain <b>Berry</b> caught him in his arms as he was falling. The great effusion of blood occasioned an apprehension that the wound was mortal: Nelson himself thought so; a large flap of {{the skin of the}} forehead, cut from the bone, had fallen over one eye; and the other being blind, he was in total darkness. When he was carried down, the surgeon--in the midst of a scene scarcely to be conceived by those who have never seen a cockpit in time of action, and the heroism which is displayed amid its horrors,--with a natural and pardonable eagerness, quitted the poor fellow then under his hands, that he might instantly attend the admiral. [...] "No!" [...] said Nelson, [...] "I will take my turn with my brave fellows." [...] Nor would he suffer his own wound to be examined till every man who had been previously wounded was properly attended to. Fully believing that the wound was mortal, and {{that he was about to}} die, as he had ever desired, in battle, and in victory, he called the chaplain, and desired him to deliver what he supposed to be his dying remembrance to lady Nelson; he then sent for Captain Louis on board from the MINOTAUR, that he might thank him personally for the great assistance which he had rendered to the VANGUARD; and ever mindful of those who deserved to be his friends, appointed Captain Hardy from the brig to the command of his own ship, Captain Berry having to go home with the news of the victory. When the surgeon came in due time to examine his wound (for it was in vain to entreat him to let it be examined sooner), the most anxious silence prevailed; and the joy of the wounded men, and of the whole crew, when they heard that the hurt was merely superficial, gave Nelson deeper pleasure than the unexpected assurance that his life was in no danger. The surgeon requested, and as far as he could, ordered him to remain quiet; but Nelson could not rest. He called for his secretary, Mr. Campbell, to write the despatches. Campbell had himself been wounded, and was so affected at the blind and suffering state of the admiral that he was unable to write. The chaplain was then sent for; but before he came, Nelson with his characteristic eagerness took the pen, and contrived to trace a few words, marking his devout sense of the success which had already been obtained. He was now left alone; when suddenly a cry was heard on the deck that the ORIENT was on fire. In the confusion he found his way up, unassisted and unnoticed; and, to the astonishment of every one, appeared on the quarter-decks where he immediately gave order that the boats should be sent to the relief of the enemy.|$|R
