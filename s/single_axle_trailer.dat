50|$|Utility Trailer Manufacturing Company {{was founded}} in 1914 by E.W. Bennett and H.C. Bennett, {{and was one of}} the first truck trailer {{manufacturers}} in the United States. The first product was a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> designed to accommodate 60 bales of cotton.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} KB-45, the A-45 {{also has a}} version with Nemo {{hydraulic}} system that enables pulling of trailers with hydraulically driven axles. These vehicles were called AH-45. The hydraulic system increases the hauling capacity so that the maximum weight for a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> is 8 000 kg and 12 000 kg for a two-axle trailer.|$|E
50|$|The M-63 Plamen {{consists}} of 32 Ø128mm tubes, which can fire original Plamen-A and Plamen B rockets {{with a range}} of 8,600m. The effect of each rocket on the target is equivalent to the effect of a 105mm artillery shell. All 32 rockets can be fired in either 6.4, 12.5 or 19.2 seconds. The launcher is mounted on a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> which can be towed by vehicles with an 800mm high tow hitch. The towing vehicle carries reserve rockets, so the battle complement is 64 missiles.|$|E

50|$|A {{tandem axle}} {{is a group}} of two or more axles {{situated}} close together. Truck designs use such a configuration to provide a greater weight capacity than a <b>single</b> <b>axle.</b> Semi <b>trailers</b> usually have a tandem axle at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The Saurer 5 DUK is a left-steered bus and Post bus type of {{the former}} PTT {{operations}} and various regional bus / transport companies in Switzerland. DUK stands for Diesel-Unterflur-Kompressor (diesel underfloor compressor). At the post office, these Saurer 5 DUKs were used as postbus busses or as postbus busses with a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> luggage <b>trailer.</b> The Saurer 5 DUK was built from 1953 on. It has a driver's seat, 39 passenger seats, 33 standing places and a luggage compartment. The luggage compartment is directly behind the rear exit door and has a partition with sliding door with glass panes. There are also seats in the luggage compartment. The passenger compartment is divided in the middle by a partition with a door, because {{in the past the}} rear part of the bus was designed as a smoking compartment. With the prohibition of smoking in public buses only the door of the smoking compartment where removed, the rest of the partition remained. For PTT operations , these Saurer 5 DUKs were used as single postbus busses or as postbus busses with a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> luggage <b>trailer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{bottom half}} was a {{conventional}} <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> small <b>trailer</b> made from fibreglass. For the exhibit, {{it was shown}} with one inflatable tent next to it and another tent packed inside. The {{top half of the}} trailer was a small boat mounted upside-down, with {{the bottom half of the}} trailer matching the boat shape along their joining edges. The boat used an outboard motor that could be disconnected and stowed in the bottom half when the halves were reassembled for towing. The exterior was painted white with a black stripe and the interior was painted bright orange.|$|R
50|$|These were {{developed}} in the late 1930s, with a 60 cm diameter parabolic glass reflector and was powered by an 8 kilowatt generator. The lamp output was rated at 135 million candelas, {{and it had a}} detection range of about 5 km for targets travelling at an altitude of 1500 m. With the beam dispersed, this reduced to about 3.2 km. It required a crew of three and could be transported using a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> Special <b>trailer</b> 51. One of the crew operated the searchlight, another operated the generator, and the third was the section commander. Naval versions of the searchlight included a shutter, to allow them to be used for Morse signaling.|$|R

50|$|Tractor {{trucks were}} used to tow {{semi-trailers}} up to 37,500 lb with 15,000 lb on their fifth wheel. Semi-tractor/trailers have to stay on relatively flat ground, and are not rated for full off-road use. On improved roads they could tow up to 55,000 lb with 25,000 lb on their fifth wheel.

40|$|Within {{this article}} a novel two DOF control system for train-like {{guidance}} of general multiple articulated vehicles with all wheel steering is presented. The model based control scheme {{consists of a}} feed forward and a feedback part designed separately. Within the nonlinear feed forward part the steering angles are calculated that theoretically cause every <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> to follow a desired path exactly. Thus in the nonlinear feedback part only model uncertainties and disturbances have to be compensated. Finally the control scheme is adapted to a semi automatic mode, where a driver steers the tractor conventionally while all <b>trailer</b> <b>axles</b> follow {{the path of the}} tractors rear axle...|$|R

50|$|In the EU and U.S. legal {{maximum load}} {{restrictions}} {{are placed on}} weight, independent of manufacturer’s rating. In the EU a tractor can generally have 10 tonne lb on a <b>single</b> <b>axle,</b> with suspension type and number of tires often allowing slightly higher loads. In the U.S. weight restrictions are generally 20,000 lb on a <b>single</b> <b>axle,</b> and 34,000 lb (less than two <b>single</b> <b>axles)</b> on a tandem. The primary factor is distance between axle centerlines, also used to measure bridge formulas. A bridge formula does not reduce axle load allowances, rather Gross Vehicle Weights (GVW), which can affect load distribution and actual axle weights.|$|R

40|$|In 1997 the Indiana Department of Transportation {{adopted the}} Superpave mixture design method and {{attendant}} specifications for hot-mix asphalt pavements. Prior to Superpave, the Indiana Department of Transportation aggregate frictional requirements {{were based on}} average daily traffic volumes and were divided into low, medium, and high volume categories. With the implementation of Superpave in Indiana, aggregate frictional requirements were reassigned to categories based on equivalent <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> load values. The purpose of the research is to determine whether average daily traffic or equivalent <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> load has a greater effect on the frictional resistance of a hot-mix asphalt pavement, to confirm and update, if necessary, the current equivalent <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> load based breakpoints for aggregate frictional requirements, and to evaluate the effects of aggregate physical properties on frictional resistance. Statistical analyses were conducted on inventory skid data to observe the effects of average daily traffic and equivalent <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> loads. It was determined that average daily traffic may have a greater effect on frictional resistance than equivalent <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> load. Additional statistical {{analyses were conducted to}} verify categorical breakpoints which indicated that the former average daily traffic breakpoints are correct and that the upper bound equivalent <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> load breakpoint may need some modification. Aggregates were tested for acid insolubility, differential wear, and frictional resistance. Acid insolubility results and physical property data obtained from quality assurance files were correlated to aggregate frictional resistance. Collected quality assurance data included bulk specific gravity, percent absorption, percent loss from impact, and percent loss from brine freeze/thaw. It was observed that the aggregates used in this study had a negligible amount of insoluble material and therefore had an insignificant effect on the frictional resistance. Terminal frictional resistance increased with decreasing bulk specific gravity, and increased with increasing percent absorption and percent loss from impact. Correlation between terminal frictional resistance and brine loss was very weak. Differential wear measurements were taken on stone-slag aggregate blends to determine the effectiveness of blends used in pavement mixtures. Differential wear results indicated that the high friction component of each blend could be improved by blending with softer carbonate aggregates, which also may be more cost effective...|$|R
