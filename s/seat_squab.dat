2500|$|The {{estate cars}} (chassis {{designation}} S124) came in 5- or 7-seat models, the 7-seater having a rear-facing bench seat that folded flush luggage compartment cover and an optional (in the US until 1994) retractable cargo net. [...] To provide a flat loading {{floor with the}} seat folded down, the T-model's rear <b>seat</b> <b>squab</b> was mounted about [...] higher than in saloons, robbing rear seat passengers of some head room. The S124 estate continued in production alongside the new W210 until the S210 estate launched {{more than a year}} later. A two-door coupé version was also built, with the chassis designation C124.|$|E
50|$|Now rarely used, but {{for many}} years {{the only way to}} move a {{disabled}} vehicle without using a low loader or trailer. Chains were attached, usually around the casualty's suspension, and some form of packing (often a <b>seat</b> <b>squab</b> or tyre) was inserted between the lifting frame and the casualty. This frame was lifted by means of a pulley until the casualty’s wheels were clear of the ground. An 'A' frame was normally used to keep the casualty from running into the tow vehicle on braking.|$|E
50|$|Syncromesh was {{provided}} on all ratios but first and reverse. Previously {{it had been}} provided on just third and fourth speeds. This proved a very welcome refinement adding greatly to the pleasure of driving the car. The gear change lever was moved backwards closer to the driver by the <b>seat</b> <b>squab,</b> cutting back on the chances of finding cold steel up the trouser leg as the driver tried to get in or out. The clutch employed an improved design. A new divided transmission shaft eased potential vibration problems.|$|E
40|$|This {{intellectual}} property concerns an innovative new seating arrangement for passenger cars in which rearward facing passenger(s) sit beside and {{slightly to the}} rear of the centrally positioned forward facing driver. A forward facing passenger sits directly behind the driver between and slightly rearward of the two rear facing passengers (Figures 1 to 4). This arrangement overcomes the access/egress problems normally associated with all-forward-facing diamond seating configurations. The reverse diamond seating configuration allows conventional vehicle architecture and all rear passengers can alight from the conventional rear doors. When used for adults but particularly children, the rear facing <b>seat</b> <b>squabs</b> and head restraints retard the forward movement of occupants under rapid deceleration or collision. This reduces the concentrated loading and whiplash effect imparted by seatbelts on forward facing seats. The rearward facing <b>seat</b> cushions and <b>squabs</b> fold away in unit to allow the centre rear passenger to alight and to create luggage space alongside the centre rear passenger (Fig. 5). In addition the centre rear seat cushion can be raised to create a large transverse luggage space. The rear seat can also be folded to the floor or removed entirely to further increase the luggage space (Fig. 6). The ‘reverse diamond’ seating arrangement permits a wide range of seating and cargo configurations and also reduces frontal projected area of the vehicle which is beneficial to the reduction of aerodynamic drag...|$|R
50|$|The {{estate cars}} (chassis {{designation}} S124) came in 5- or 7-seat models, the 7-seater having a rear-facing bench seat that folded flush luggage compartment cover and an optional (in the US until 1994) retractable cargo net. To provide a flat loading {{floor with the}} seat folded down, the T-model's rear <b>seat</b> <b>squab</b> was mounted about 10 cm higher than in saloons, robbing rear seat passengers of some head room. The S124 estate continued in production alongside the new W210 until the S210 estate launched {{more than a year}} later. A two-door coupé version was also built, with the chassis designation C124.|$|E
5000|$|In the front, buyers {{could choose}} between two single seats and the {{optional}} full width bench seat, {{with the front}} corner of the <b>seat</b> <b>squab</b> contoured so as to accommodate the gear lever and allow seating for three. The rear seat had a fold down centre armrest and leather covers were used. A heater was fitted as standard. The car was available in black, maroon, green, blue or grey finish. The gear lever was floor mounted by the driver's door, so drivers in right hand drive markets had to change gear with their right hand. [...] The handbrake was operated by a lever under the dashboard in both bench and individual front seat versions.|$|E
5000|$|Loading access was by a {{vertical}} top-hinged rear tailgate {{with the bottom}} of the opening level with the floor, making it easy to load without stooping down. Sliding windows gave ventilation and a view out from the rear bench seat. The top part of the back <b>seat</b> <b>squab</b> folded forward forming a useful horizontal loading platform with a ribbed rubber surface, and [...] of capacity. To take the increased load, this was the first Hillman derivative to have radial-ply tyres. It also had uprated rear shock absorbers and rear springs were fitted along with a strengthened rear suspension. These gave the Husky more sporty handling that the standard Imp, and looked surprising when this tall vehicle went quickly round a corner with very little roll.|$|E
50|$|The 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander (second generation) is {{also built}} around Mitsubishi’s {{next-generation}} RISE unibody design (GS platform). The RISE body features collision energy absorbing joints {{designed to reduce}} {{the force of the}} impact that is transferred to the passenger cell. These are constructed with improved thickness and strength engineered into the vehicle frame’s structure. Inner sides of the pillars and roof have impact absorbing rib structures to mitigate head injuries in a collision. A cross frame under the front <b>seat</b> <b>squab</b> restricts forward movement of the occupantin in a frontal impact. It uses more high-tensile steel sheeting to increase stiffness and employs octagonal-section straight front side members and a reinforced cabin environment. An aluminum roof panel lowers the center of gravity and reduces roll inertia. Compared to the previous Outlander, torsional rigidity has been increased by 18 percent, and bending rigidity is up by 39 percent. The Outlander received a four star rating from the EuroNCAP test.|$|E
40|$|Strategies fur {{reducing}} seat dip attenuation {{in concert}} halls are considered. It is {{shown that the}} dip is established 4 ms after the direct sound from the stage arrives at the listener. Sound scattered from the seats and floor is {{the main cause of}} the dip. By controlling these very early reflections the attenuation can be reduced to below its subjective threshold. With this in mind, changes to the shape and impedance of the seats and floor are trialed using a boundary element model and a physical scale model. It is found that the seat dip effect can be rendered inaudible by introducing a l-m pit under the seats. Smaller improvements are produced by changing the impedance of the <b>seat</b> <b>squab.</b> (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of car seat has been {{designed}} in which the back-rest is able to move freely in the vertical direction. The design allows the back-rest to follow the vertical vibration {{of the back of}} an occupant of the seat. This is intended to decrease any strain on the lumbar part of the spinal column caused by a different vertical motion at the <b>seat</b> <b>squab</b> and the seat back. The transmission of vertical (z axis) vibration from the base of this seat to the seat surface, to the back-rest and to the backs and heads of seat occupants has been measured. Measurements were made with the seat back fixed, to prevent vertical motion relative to the seat frame, and with the seat back free to move. Vibration transmissibilities from the seat base to the seat surface were characterized by a resonance at frequencies in the region of 4 Hz. The resonance frequencies were slightly higher with the fixed back-rest than with the moving back-rest. The transmissibilities at frequencies above 4 Hz -were generally higher with the fixed back-rest. Measurements with no contact between the seat occupants and the seat back indicated that the dynamic properties of the human body and the seat cushion were less influenced by the moving seat back than by the fixed seat back. Differential motion between the seat surface and seat back was smaller with the moving seat back than with the fixed back. © IMechE 1996. </p...|$|E
