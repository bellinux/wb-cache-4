The <b>Soft</b> Tissue <b>Arc</b> changed the pictures differently than the orthodontic experts, however, there was no statistical difference in the final placement of soft tissue pogonion. These pairs of images (expert morphing vs <b>Soft</b> Tissue <b>Arc</b> changes) were then rated as more attractive or less attractive on a visual analogue scale by 5 orthodontic residents, 5 dental school faculty and 5 laypersons.

40|$|Abstract. While most of search-based {{algorithms}} {{for optimal}} DCOP solving as-sume a single variable per agent, many DCOP instances {{could be more}} appropri-ately modeled with several variables per agent. There are several approaches to transform a DCOP instance with several variables per agent into another instance with one variable per agent, on which existing algorithms could be applied. We present a hybrid approach that combines two of these transformations. Interest-ingly, our method can be connected with enforcing <b>soft</b> <b>arc</b> consistency during search, a technique that has been shown beneficial for search-based DCOP algo-rithms. Using BnB-ADOPT+ as the solving algorithm, preliminary experimental results on DCOP random instances indicate that this hybrid approach provides clear advantages over the two transformation approaches taken in isolation, and confirm also the benefits of <b>soft</b> <b>arc</b> consistency enforcement in this context. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWCSP is an {{optimization}} problem for which {{many forms of}} <b>soft</b> local (<b>arc)</b> consistencies have been proposed such as, for example, existential directional arc consistency (EDAC) and virtual arc consistency (VAC). In this paper, we adopt a different perspective by revisiting the well-known property of (soft) substitutability. First, we provide {{a clear picture of}} the relationships existing between soft neighborhood substitutability (SNS) and a tractable property called pcost which allows us to compare the cost of two values (through the use of so-called cost pairs). We prove that under certain assumptions, pcost is equivalent to SNS but weaker than SNS in the general case since we show that SNS is coNP-hard. We also show that SNS preserves the property VAC but not the property EDAC. Finally, we introduce an algorithm to enforce pcost that benefits from several optimizations (early breaks, residues, timestamping). The practical interest of maintaining pcost together with AC*, FDAC or EDAC, during search. is shown on various series of WCSP instance...|$|R
40|$|We report our 110 ks Chandra {{observations}} of the supernova remnant (SNR) 0104 - 72. 3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The X-ray morphology shows two prominent lobes along the northwest-southeast direction and a <b>soft</b> faint <b>arc</b> in the east. Previous low resolution X-ray images attributed the unresolved emission from the southeastern lobe to a Be/X-ray star. Our high resolution Chandra data clearly shows that this emission is diffuse, shock-heated plasma, with negligible X-ray emission from the Be star. The eastern arc is positionally coincident with a filament seen in optical and infrared observations. Its X-ray spectrum is well fit by plasma of normal SMC abundances, suggesting that it is from shocked ambient gas. The X-ray spectra of the lobes show overabundant Fe, which is interpreted as emission from the reverse-shocked Fe-rich ejecta. The overall spectral characteristics of the lobes and the arc {{are similar to those}} of Type Ia SNRs, and we propose that SNR 0104 - 72. 3 is the first case for a robust candidate Type Ia SNR in the SMC. On the other hand, the remnant appears to be interacting with dense clouds toward the east and to be associated with a nearby star-forming region. These features are unusual for a standard Type Ia SNR. Our results suggest an intriguing possibility that the progenitor of SNR 0104 - 72. 3 might have been a white dwarf of a relatively young population. Comment: 5 pages with emulateapj. sty, 3 figures.

40|$|The Valued (VCSP) {{framework}} is a generic optimization framework {{with a wide}} range of applications. <b>Soft</b> <b>arc</b> consistency operations transform a VCSP into an equivalent problem by shifting weights between cost functions. The principal aim is to produce a good lower bound on the cost of solutions, an essential ingredient of a branch and bound search. But soft AC is much more complex than traditional AC: there may be several closures (fixpoints) and finding the closure with a maximum lower bound has been shown to be NP-hard for integer costs [Cooper and Schiex, 2004]. We introduce a relaxed variant of <b>soft</b> <b>arc</b> consistency using rational costs. In this case, an optimal closure can be found in polynomial time. Furthermore, for finite rational costs, the associated lower bound is shown to provide an optimal arc consistent reformulation of the initial problem. Preliminary experiments on random and structured problems are reported, showing the strength of the lower bound produced. ...|$|E

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of XML as a standard for data representation, particularly on the web, the need for intelligent query languages that can operate on XML documents with structural heterogeneity has recently gained a lot of popularity. Traditional Information Retrieval and Database approaches have limitations when dealing with such scenarios. Therefore, fuzzy (flexible) approaches have become the predominant. In this thesis, we propose a new approach for approximate XML query matching and rewriting which aims at achieving soft matching of XML queries with XML data sources following different schemas. Unlike traditional querying approaches, which require exact matching, the proposed approach makes use of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Trees to achieve approximate (soft) query matching. Through this new approach, not only the exact answer of a query, but also approximate answers are retrieved. Furthermore, partial results {{can be obtained from}} multiple data sources and merged together to produce a single answer to a query. The proposed approach introduced a new tree similarity measure that considers the minimum and maximum degrees of similarity/inclusion of trees that are based on arc matching. New techniques for <b>soft</b> node and <b>arc</b> matching were presented for matching queries against data sources with highly varied structures. A prototype was developed to test the proposed ideas and it proved the ability to achieve approximate matching for pattern queries with a number of XML schemas and rewrite the original query so that it obtain results from the underlying data sources. This has been achieved through several novel algorithms which were tested and proved efficiency and low CPU/Memory cost even for big number of data sources...|$|R

We then generalize the method to deal with inference in general hybrid Bayesian networks consisting of deterministic equations and arbitrary probability distributions. Using a novel technique called <b>soft</b> <b>arc</b> reversal, the new algorithm can also handle evidential reasoning with observed deterministic variables...|$|E
40|$|The Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP) {{framework}} allows representing {{and solving}} problems involving both hard constraints and cost functions. It has been ap- plied to various problems, including resource allocation, bioinformatics, scheduling, etc. To solve such problems, solvers usually rely on branch-and-bound algorithms equipped with local consistency filtering, mostly <b>soft</b> <b>arc</b> consistency. However, these techniques {{are not well}} suited to solve problems with very large domains. Motivated by the resolution of an RNA gene localization problem inside large genomic sequences, and {{in the spirit of}} bounds consistency for large domains in crisp CSPs, we introduce soft bounds arc consistency, a new weighted local consistency specifically designed for WCSP with very large domains. Compared to <b>soft</b> <b>arc</b> consistency, BAC provides significantly improved time and space asymptotic complexity. In this paper, we show how the semantics of cost functions can be exploited to further improve the time complexity of BAC. We also compare both in theory and in practice the efficiency of BAC on a WCSP with bounds consistency enforced on a crisp CSP using cost variables. On two different real problems modeled as WCSP, including our RNA gene localization problem, we observe that maintaining bounds arc con- sistency outperforms arc consistency and also improves over bounds consistency enforced on a constraint model with cost variables...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problem (VCSP) is {{a generic}} {{optimization}} problem {{defined by a}} network of local cost functions defined over discrete variables. It has applications in Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, Bioinformatics and {{has been used to}} tackle optimization problems in other graphical models (including discrete Markov Random Fields and Bayesian Networks). The incremental lower bounds produced by local consistency filtering are used for pruning inside Branch and Bound search. In this paper, we extend the notion of arc consistency by allowing fractional weights and by allowing several arc consistency operations to be applied simultaneously. Over the rationals and allowing simultaneous operations, we show that an optimal arc consistency closure can theoretically be determined in polynomial time by reduction to linear programming. This defines Optimal <b>Soft</b> <b>Arc</b> Consistency (OSAC). To reach a more practical algorithm, we show that the existence of a sequence of arc consistency operations which increases the lower bound can be detected by establishing arc consistency in a classical Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) derived from the original cost function network. This leads to a new <b>soft</b> <b>arc</b> consistency method, called, Virtual Arc Consistency which produces improved lower bounds compared with previous techniques and which can solve submodular cost functions. These algorithms have been implemented and evaluated on a variety of problems, including two difficult frequency assignment problems which are solved to optimality for the first time.

A pseudo-tree is a graph structure for a constraint network that represents a partial ordering of variables. Most pseudo-tree-based search algorithms perform optimistic searches using explicit/implicit backtracking in parallel.
