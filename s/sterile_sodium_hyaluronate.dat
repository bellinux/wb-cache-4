The influence of addition of native or modified <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> on resonance energy transfer was also investigated. The addition of native <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> supports energy transfer at lower fluorescein concentrations {{and the addition}} of modified <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> influences the maximal value of energy transfer effectivity. Strong influence on the critical micelle concentration (CMC) values with the addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> during CMC of TTAB determination was investigated. The data indicates not only micelles formation, but also formation of aggregates of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> with TTAB. Aggregation numbers of TTAB with addition of native and modified <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> by the quenching of pyrene by cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) was investigated. The addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> into the solution of TTAB changes the average mean aggregation number.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> {{has been}} used intraperitoneally to prevent {{postoperative}} adhesions. However, the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> on tumour growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo is still unknown. METHODS: Human colorectal tumour cell lines SW 480, SW 620 and SW 707 were treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> (10 - 500 microg/ml) and carboxymethylcellulose (0. 125 - 1 per cent), and tumour cell proliferation and motility were determined in vitro. For the in vivo experiments male BD IX rats were randomized to a <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> group (n = 11; intraperitoneal administration of 0. 5 x 10 (6) DHD/K 12 tumour cells and 5 ml 0. 4 per cent <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate)</b> or a phosphate-buffered saline group (n = 11; 0. 5 x 10 (6) DHD/K 12 tumour cells and 5 ml phosphate-buffered saline intraperitoneally). Four weeks later the intraperitoneal tumour load was visualized directly. RESULTS: In vitro <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> increased tumour cell proliferation and motility significantly. Sodium hyaluronate-induced tumour cell motility appeared to be CD 44 receptor dependent, whereas sodium hyaluronate-induced tumour cell proliferation was CD 44 receptor independent. In vivo there was a significantly higher total tumour nodule count in the peritoneal cavity of the sodium hyaluronate-treated group compared with the control (P = 0. 016). CONCLUSION: <b>Sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> enhances tumour metastatic potential in vitro and in vivo, which suggests that use of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> to prevent adhesions in colorectal cancer surgery may also potentiate intraperitoneal tumour growth.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rhinitis is an {{extremely}} common medical problem characterized by nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching. Hyaluronate is an endogenous compound that has {{an important role in}} mucociliary clearance by the epithelial surface of the nasal passages and in mucosal surface healing and repair. The objective of this work was {{to determine the effects of}} intranasal administration of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> on nasal cytology in patients with allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. METHODS: In a single-center, randomized, blinded trial, 78 patients received intranasal mometasone and oral desloratadine plus either intranasal <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> or saline for 1 month. Nasal cytology was performed and the change from baseline in the numbers of neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, and infective species was determined. Other outcomes included changes in symptoms and the endoscopic appearance of the nasal mucosa, and tolerability. RESULTS: Patients receiving <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> experienced a significant decrease in the median neutrophil count seen on nasal cytology compared with controls (p = 0. 001). <b>Sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> was associated with significant improvements in sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion, and on exudate seen on endoscopy at 1 month compared with baseline.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> (hyaluronic acid) {{is known}} to promote corneal {{epithelial}} wound healing in vivo and in vitro, in animal experiments. <b>Sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> is the ligand for CD 44, a cell surface adhesion molecule which has been found on normal human corneal epithelial cells. {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> on human corneal epithelial cell migration, proliferation, and CD 44 receptor expression. Methods: Human corneal epithelial cell cultures were established from 32 donor corneoscleral rims and maintained separately in three different culture conditions: (1) culture medium only, (2) <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> enriched (0. 6 mg/ml) medium, and (3) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose enriched (2. 5 mg/ml) medium. the total area of migrating epithelial cell sheets in each case was measured by planimetry on days 4, 8, 12, and 16. Cytospin preparations of cells cultured in the different culture conditions were examined immunohistochemically for proliferation and CD 44 receptor expression using antibodies directed against Ki 67 and CD 44 respectively. Results: Cells cultured in the presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> showed significantly increased migration at days 12 and 16 (Friedmen test: p= 0. 0012, day 16; p=< 0. 001, day 12) compared with cells cultured in the other media. There was no difference in cell proliferation (Ki 67) or CD 44 expression on cells cultured in the different culture conditions. Conclusions: <b>Sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> promotes migration but not proliferation or CD 44 expression on human corneal epithelial cells in vitro. the beneficial effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> in corneal wound healing is likely to be related to rapid migration of cells leading to rapid wound closure.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of periarticular {{injection}} of hyaluronate into shoulders with supraspinatus tendinosis under echographic guide. Methods and materials. The subjects were 56 patients with clinical, echographic and magnetic resonance diagnosis of supraspinatus tendinosis. They were divided in two groups by random sampling; 28 patients were assigned in SH group (<b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate)</b> and 28 patients in SC group (sodium chloride). The test drug was 20 mg <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> (2 ml, Hyalgan®, Fidia SpA, Abano T., P. M. 500 – 700. 000, 20 mg/ 2 ml). Results. Preliminary results showed that <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> presented the highest efficacy in the improvement of clinical symptoms and recovery of functional status in patients with supraspinatus tendinosis in fact the mean V. A. S. score (Visual Analogue Scale) at 1 month after the end of the infiltrative cycle was 8. 0 in the SC group vs. 2. 8 in SH group and these numerical data were substantially unchanged also after 3 and 4 months. Conclusion. Hyaluronate injection under echographic guide should be use not only as a lubricant but also to prevent articular cartilage degeneration and cover and protect the articular cartilage; indeed <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> can decrease inflammatory joint process. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Sodium</b> <b>Hyaluronate</b> (500 - 730 kilodalton (kDa); Hyalgan®) is {{recommended}} to administer intra-articularly {{once a week}} for 3 - 5 weeks in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee which its efficacy has been shown, from many clinical studies, to persist for at least 6 months. However, only a few studies were done in Thai patients. Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of intra-articular <b>Sodium</b> <b>Hyaluronate,</b> administered {{once a week for}} four weeks (four injections) in Thai patients with painful Tibio-Femoral osteoarthritis of the knee over a six-month period. Material and Method: Thirty-one patients with painful knee osteoarthritis in grade I (32. 3 %) and grade II (67. 7 %) severity on Ahlback radiological criteria from Orthopedic Clinic in Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital were included in this study. All patients were administered with 4 -weekly injections of intra-articular <b>Sodium</b> <b>Hyaluronate</b> (500 - 730 kDa; Hyalgan®; 20 mg/ 2 ml). Only paracetamol was permitted for escape analgesia. The efficacy parameters were the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) for pain, stiffness and physical function, intake of paracetamol, and overall efficacy judgment by investigators and patients.

This study compared the efficacy and safety of two preservative-free formulations of artificial tears, carboxymethylcellulose 0. 5 %/glycerin 0. 9 % (CMC/glycerin) and <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> 0. 18 % (<b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate),</b> in patients with mild to moderate dry eye symptoms. Methods: This multicenter, investigator-masked, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, clinical study enrolled patients with mild to moderate dry eye symptoms. At baseline, patients received both treatments (one in each eye) and completed an Acute Preference Questionnaire. Patients were then randomized 1 : 1 to treatment with one drop of CMC/glycerin or <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> {{at least three times}} per day for 2 weeks. Efficacy outcomes included Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal staining, conjunctival staining, conjunctival hyperemia, Dry Eye Symptom and Bothersomeness Survey, Patient Acceptability Questionnaire, and Patient Global Assessment of Change. Safety outcomes included the number and frequency of adverse events. Results: CMC/glycerin and <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> produced statistically significant improvements in OSDI (P &lt; 0. 0001), TBUT (P &lt; 0. 0001), corneal staining (P &lt; 0. 0001), conjunctival staining (P &lt; 0. 0001 at Week 1; P &lt; 0. 01 at Week 2), and conjunctival hyperemia (P &lt; 0. 0001 at Week 1; P &lt; 0. 05 at Week 2) relative to baseline. No statistically significant between-group differences in any evaluated variable, including clinical and patient-reported outcomes, were observed. Following a single-drop instillation, there was a trend in favor of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> for which each drop produced less blurring (P = 0. 055). At Day 14, there were trends in favor of CMC/glycerin for questions about how many hours the eyedrops controlled symptoms (P = 0. 057), whether the eyedrops effectively relieved dryness (P = 0. 053), and which drop provided a cushion of moisture on eyes (P = 0. 052). No treatment-related adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Both CMC/glycerin and <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> effectively relieved dry eye symptoms. Scores were consistently similar across all measures, and both artificial tears were highly acceptable to patients.
