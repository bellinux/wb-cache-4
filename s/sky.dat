5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the <b>sky)</b> are covered by cloud. A <b>sky</b> half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating <b>sky</b> cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the <b>sky</b> is covered by clouds.|$|E

5|$|In 561, {{the king}} {{now known as}} <b>Sky</b> Witness {{installed}} a ruler {{at the site of}} Los Alacranes. <b>Sky</b> Witness played a major part in the political events of the Maya region. He became the overlord of the city of Caracol, to the south of Naranjo, which had previously been a vassal of Tikal. In 562, according to a damaged text at Caracol, <b>Sky</b> Witness defeated Tikal itself and sacrificed its king Wak Chan K'awiil, thus ending his branch of the royal dynasty at Tikal. This catastrophic defeat began a 130-year hiatus for Tikal, reflecting an extended period of dominance by Calakmul. This event is used as a marker to divide the Early Classic from the Late Classic. <b>Sky</b> Witness is also mentioned at Okop, a site much further north in Quintana Roo. The last reference to <b>Sky</b> Witness occurs at Caracol and is dated to AD 572. The text is damaged but probably records the death of this powerful king.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, <b>Sky</b> Sports and the BBC's Grandstand {{programme}} {{covered the}} British Hockey League and Superleague and their important games and competitions regularly. However, in 2001 the Superleague sold its broadcasting rights to 'Premium TV Ltd' {{who planned to}} set up a new sports channel, which never materialised. British ice hockey was left without coverage from any television network. This situation continued through the final seasons of the Superleague and into the first seasons of the Elite League. In 2005, Elite League officials concluded an agreement with the North American Sports Network to provide a weekly highlights and news programme. These usually provide highlights from a game recorded the previous weekend and are an hour in length. In September 2007 the Elite League announced a deal with <b>Sky</b> Sports for a weekly show of Elite League highlights. In 2010 <b>Sky</b> Sports showed the playoff final between the Belfast Giants and Cardiff Devils live, {{this was the first time}} <b>Sky</b> had shown a live game for several years. <b>Sky</b> Sports have recently announced plans to show 8 live games along with a weekly highlight show during the 2010–11 season.
