40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to report the death of a Boa constrictor amarali after ingestion of a <b>tree</b> <b>porcupine.</b> The animal was donated to the Center for the Study of Venoms and Venomous Animals (CEVAP/UNESP) - and died in captivity. At necropsy, spine-like structures were observed in the stomach serosa and vicinity, and the stomach mucosa showed an intense reddish area, suggesting inflammation. The analysis of the spine-like structure revealed that they were <b>tree</b> <b>porcupine</b> spines. The feeding habits and inexperience of this Boa constrictor amarali in selecting its prey may have been be responsible for its death...|$|R

50|$|Many {{arboreal}} species, such as <b>tree</b> <b>porcupines,</b> chameleons, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails {{to grasp}} branches.

Two other {{formerly}} recognized Neotropical <b>tree</b> <b>porcupine</b> genera, Echinoprocta and Sphiggurus, have been subsumed into Coendou, since Sphiggurus was shown by genetic studies to be polyphyletic, while Echinoprocta nested within Coendou.|$|R

50|$|At this point, <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> {{was little}} more than a joke and a private amusement, as Wilson was concentrating on his other project, No-Man, an {{endeavour}} with UK based singer and songwriter Tim Bowness. However, by 1989 he began to consider some of the <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> music as potentially marketable. Wilson created an 80-minute-long cassette titled Tarquin's Seaweed Farm under the name of <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree.</b> Still showing the spirit of his joke, Wilson included an 8-page inlay which further revealed the hoaxed <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> backstory, including references to fictitious band members such as Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones.|$|R

25|$|The species used {{to produce}} dyes include the following: Logwood Haematoxylon campechianum; a large <b>spiny</b> <b>tree</b> that can grow up to 15m tall. Its cork is thin and soft and its wood is hard. The {{heartwood}} is {{used to produce}} dyes that are red and purple. The histological stain called haematoxylin is produced from this species. Brazilwood tree (Caesalpinia echinata) {{is similar to the}} previous tree but smaller and with red or purple flowers. The wood is also used to produce a red or purple dye. The Madras thorn (Pithecallobium dulce) is another <b>spiny</b> <b>tree</b> native to Latin America, it grows up to 4m high and has yellow or green flowers that grow in florets. Its fruit is reddish and is used to produce a yellow dye. Indigo dye is extracted from the True indigo plant Indigofera tinctoria that is native to Asia. In Central and South America dyes are produced from two species related to this species, indigo from Indigofera suffruticosa and Natal indigo from Indigofera arrecta.yellow dye is extracted from Butea monosperma commonly called as flame of the forest.|$|R

50|$|In the trees, Coquerel's sifaka {{moves by}} {{vertical}} clinging and leaping. It maintains an upright posture when at rest or when propelling itself between branches or trunks. This style of arboreal locomotion {{is characteristic of}} most, if not all, lemurs. This particular lemur can leap {{from tree to tree}} anywhere up to 35 feet. They have the extraordinary ability to leap to <b>spiny</b> <b>trees</b> and precisely place their hands and feet so that they will not hurt themselves.|$|R

50|$|The {{edges of}} the desert in some {{sections}} have subterranean aquifers that have permitted the development of forests made up mainly of tamarugos, <b>spiny</b> <b>trees</b> native to the area that grow to a height of about twenty-five meters. Most of those forests were cut down to fuel the fires of the many foundries established since colonial times to exploit the abundant deposits of copper, silver, and nitrate found in the area. The result {{was the creation of}} even drier surface conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{profile of}} <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Tree</b> had now grown {{to the extent}} that Wilson wanted to expand into live performances.
