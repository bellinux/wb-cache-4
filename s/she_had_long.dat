She assured Sofia that she could rely on her animal friends' to help just <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> ago.|$|E
5|$|Again {{disappointed}} with Hollywood, Wong returned to Britain, where she stayed {{for nearly three}} years. In addition to appearing in four films she toured Scotland and Ireland {{as part of a}} vaudeville show. She also appeared in the King George Silver Jubilee program in 1935. Her film Java Head (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong kissed the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites. While in London, Wong met Mei Lanfang, {{one of the most famous}} stars of the Beijing Opera. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been interested in Chinese opera and Mei offered to instruct Wong if she ever visited China.|$|E
5|$|Brodie died {{nine months}} before {{publication}} of the book. As death neared, the cancer spread to her brain and bones, and Brodie experienced intense pain. During this period, she was visited in the hospital by her brother Thomas, who had remained a practicing Latter-day Saint. Brodie asked him to “give me a blessing,” although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been estranged from both her brother and the LDS Church. A few days later, Brodie released a note saying that her request for a priesthood blessing should not be misinterpreted as a request {{to return to the}} Church. It was Brodie’s last signed statement. In accordance with her wishes, friends spread her ashes over the Santa Monica Mountains, which she loved and had successfully helped to protect from real estate development.|$|E

Several years after Simba's uncle Scar has killed Simba's father Mufasa and usurped the throne, Nala desperately ventures into the jungle to find help. Upon unexpectedly reuniting with a grown Simba, who <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been tricked by Scar into presuming dead, Nala encourages him to return to Pride Rock, overthrow his uncle and ultimately become king. As Simba's queen, Nala has a daughter, Kiara, whose story is explored in The Lion King: Simba's Pride.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> {{broken her}} formal {{ties with the}} British Communist Party, Wilkinson {{retained}} strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she {{was not prepared to}} risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1867, Booth {{undertook}} another enterprise of an entirely opposite {{but no less}} important nature, in assuming the management of Harper's Bazaar, a weekly journal devoted to the pleasure and improvement of the domestic circle. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been in pleasant relations with the Messrs. Harper, the four brothers who founded the great house which bears their name, and who conducted its business to such splendid results; and when they resolved upon issuing a family newspaper of this description they immediately asked her to take its editorial control.|$|E

25|$|Byron's confidante {{and close}} friend was William Lamb's own mother, the {{colourful}} Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne. Lady Melbourne had {{been instrumental in}} bringing about the politically advantageous marriage of her son to Lady Caroline, despite disliking both her and her mother. However, once Lady Caroline began her affair with Byron, her mother-in-law began a long and blatant campaign to rid her son of his wife; as Lord David Cecil remarks, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> since concluded that Caroline deserved all her misfortunes. William Lamb refused to submit and regretted {{that his mother had}} conspired against his wife with Byron. Calling Byron treacherous, William Lamb was supportive of his wife to her death.|$|E
25|$|Marie Louise's son William married Anne, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of George II of Great Britain, on 25 March 1734 at St. James' Palace in London. Upon {{return of the}} wedding party to the Netherlands, William had written his mother, warning her that Anne was allowed precedence over Marie Louise because she was his wife and a king's daughter. This warning was hardly needed, as Marie Louise had eagerly exited Prinsenhof as soon as her son came of age, opting {{to live in an}} elegant but unpretentious house in Harlingen. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> displayed her disinterest in royal technicalities and the royal lifestyle. She welcomed her son and his new wife upon their arrival, but then returned to her quiet house, taking no part in their ceremonious entry.|$|E
25|$|Hla Wun {{remained}} {{loyal to}} the end but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> lost respect for the king. In 1285, she accompanied the king who had decided to flee to Lower Burma from the latest Mongol invasion rather than fight. There, she reportedly had to console her immature, gluttonous husband who dejectedly sobbed after learning {{that he would have}} to make do with just 150-dish dinners. In 1287, the king officially became a Mongol vassal in exchange for a Mongol withdrawal from northern Burma, and planned to return to Pagan. The queen advised him not to return to the upcountry without having first raised a substantial army for much of the country was in revolt, and to avoid the Prome route for she believed Thihathu, the viceroy of Prome, was not trustworthy. The king discarded her advice on both counts. He replied that he would raise an army at Prome with the help of his son Thihathu. The royal family sailed up the Irrawaddy with a small group of guards.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{evidence}} entered against her was from events that had happened {{five or ten years}} previous. Phillip and Sarah Nelson testified that Robert Shilleto (by then deceased, so he could not affirm or deny the story) had repeatedly complained that Margaret was a witch, afflicting him until he died. Jonathan Burbank, Captain Daniel Wycomb and Frances Wycomb testified that Margaret had come to Burbank's house, asking for corn from his field. (By this time, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been widowed.) Burbank initially asked her to wait until he retrieved it from his field, but when she persisted, his wife gave her some. Later, when he went to get some more corn out of the field, his oxen refused to move, which he attributed to Margaret's bewitching of them. Similarly, Thomas Nelson testified that Margaret repeatedly came to him for wood, for payment of a debt he owed to her. After he denied her, two of his cows died, which he and his neighbors considered unnatural, causing him to conclude Margaret was a witch.|$|E

500|$|In 1926, Radclyffe Hall was at {{the height}} of her career. Her novel Adam's Breed, about the spiritual {{awakening}} of an Italian headwaiter, had become a bestseller; it would soon win the Prix Femina and the James Tait Black Prize. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> thought of writing a novel about sexual inversion; now, she believed, her literary reputation would allow such a work to be given a hearing. Since she knew she was risking scandal and [...] "the shipwreck of her whole career", she sought and received the blessing of her partner, Una Troubridge, before she began work. Her goals were social and political; she wanted to end public silence about homosexuality and bring about [...] "a more tolerant understanding"– as well as to [...] "spur all classes of inverts to make good through hard work...and sober and useful living".|$|E
500|$|Under {{orders from}} Cuddy to recruit a new team, House {{considers}} 40 doctors. Season four's early episodes {{focus on his}} selection process, structured as a reality TV–style elimination contest (Jacobs {{referred to it as}} a [...] "version of Survivor"). House assigns each applicant a number between one and 40, and pares them down to seven finalists. He assesses their performance in diagnostic cases, assisted by Foreman, who returns to the department after his dismissal from another hospital for House-like behavior. While Foreman's return means only two slots are open, House tricks Cuddy into allowing him to hire three new assistants. He ultimately selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), a former plastic surgeon; Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), a sports medicine specialist; and Dr. Remy [...] "Thirteen" [...] Hadley (Olivia Wilde), an internist (nicknamed for her number in the elimination contest). In the season finale, Thirteen discovers she has, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> dreaded, inherited Huntington's disease from her mother, which is incurable.|$|E
500|$|Jolie has had {{a lifelong}} {{dysfunctional}} relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter {{was less than a}} year old. She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried {{out in front of the}} press. They reconciled when they appeared together in [...] (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated. Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname [...] "Voight" [...] in favor of her middle name, which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002. Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had [...] "serious mental problems." [...] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight. They did not speak for six-and-a-half years, but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007, before going public with their reconciliation three years later.|$|E

500|$|In 1944, Manning became pregnant; {{the couple}} were overjoyed and Manning relaxed, {{becoming}} less critical of others, including her own mother, with whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> had a difficult relationship. Uncharacteristically, she rested, walked, painted and even knitted. In the seventh month, however, the baby died in utero, and as was the practice at the time, Manning was obliged to wait two difficult months to deliver her dead child. [...] "I am like a walking cemetery", she sorrowfully repeated during this period. Grief-stricken, Manning became paranoid, constantly afraid that Reggie would be assassinated. Reggie decided {{that she was having}} a nervous breakdown, and in October 1944 accompanied her to Cyprus for a month's holiday. Returning to Jerusalem, she was still far from well, and the poet Louis Lawler noticed the discontent of this [...] "strange and difficult woman", and Reggie's [...] "wonderfully patient" [...] behaviour, despite Manning calling her husband by his last name throughout the period. Manning never fully recovered from her loss, and was rarely to talk or write of it. She was unable to have further children and in the future directed her maternal feelings towards animals, especially cats.|$|E
500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls.

500|$|Almost all {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that Chamorro could not win. She was depicted as rich {{with no real}} experience. There were rumors that she received millions from the United States via their embassy {{and that she was}} a US lackey; that she was too religious; and that her coalition was too disorganized, had no money, and was plagued by in-fighting. In reality, her humility and provincial roots worked for her; she had run a family, a business and been part of the original Junta; the Sandinistas blocked payment of funds to her from the US while simultaneously claiming she received them; and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been vocal about her displeasure of US involvement in Nicaragua. According to Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa; Humberto Belli, an editor of La Prensa and later Minister of Education; and other writers such as Edward Sheehan and Shirley Christian who have written about the country, Nicaragua {{is one of the most}} religious countries in Latin America. Chamorro's faith and support for free expression united those who had felt alienated by the Sandinistas. Her chief appeal though was that she promised peace to a country tired of war.
