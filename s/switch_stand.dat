40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Optical burst {{switching}} (OBS) {{is a new}} transport architecture {{for the next generation}} optical internet infrastructure which is necessary for the increasing demand of high speed data traffic. Optical burst <b>switching</b> <b>stands</b> between optical packet switching, which is technologically difficult, and optical circuit switching, which is not capable of efficiently transporting bursty internet traffic. Apart from its promising features, optical burst switching suffers from high traffic blocking probabilities. Wavelength conversion coupled with fiber delay lines (FDL) provide one of the best means of contention resolution in optical burst switching networks. In this thesis, we examine the relation between burst loss probability and burst sizes for void filling scheduling algorithms. Simulations are performed for various values of the processing and switching times and for different values of wavelengths per fiber and FDL granularity. The main contribution of this thesis is the analysis of the relationship between burst sizes and processing time and FDL induced voids. This in turn creates {{a better understanding of the}} burstification and contention resolution mechanisms in OBS networks. We show that voids generated during scheduling are governed by the FDL granularity and the product of the per-hop processing delay and residual number of hops until the destination. We also show that differentiation between bursts with different sizes is achieved for different network parameters and a differentiation mechanism based on burst lengths is proposed for OBS networks.

50|$|Of {{importance}} {{is that while}} the <b>stand</b> <b>switches</b> from one tree community to another, the stand will not necessarily go through old-growth stage between those stages. Some tree species have relatively open canopy. That allows more shade-tolerant tree species to establish below even before Understory Reinitiation stage.

Therefore, the dominant tree species will change, but the forest will still be in Stem-Exclusion stage.|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{scaling up}} of modern {{avionics}} is forcing its communication infrastructure to evolve from shared medium toward multi-hop switched real-time networks. This prompts the proposal of avionics full-duplex switched Ethernet (AFDX) standard. Since its publication, AFDX has been well-received, and is deployed or to-be-deployed in state-of-the-art aircrafts, such as Airbus A 380 /A 400 M/A 350, Boeing 787, Bombardier CSeries etc. On the other hand, AFDX standard only specifies the behavior that an underlying switch must follow, but leaves the architecture design open. This creates an open market for switch vendors. Among the different candidate designs for this market, the TDMA crossbar real-time <b>switch</b> architecture <b>stands</b> out as it complies with and even simplifies many mainstream switch architectures, hence lays a smooth evolution path toward AFDX.

40|$|Birch (Betula pendula Roth) growth {{within the}} Western Siberia forest-steppe was {{analyzed}} based on long-term (1897 - 2006) inventory data (height, diameter at breast height [dbh], and stand volume). Analysis of biometry parameters showed increased growth {{at the beginning}} of twenty-first century compared to similar stands (stands age = 40 - 60 years) at the end of nineteenth century. Mean height, dbh, and stem volume increased from 14 to 20 m, from 16 to 22 cm, and from approx. 63 to approx. 220 cu m/ha, respectively. Significant correlations were found between the stands mean height, dbh, and volume on the one hand, and vegetation period length (r(sub s) = 0. 71 to 0. 74), atmospheric CO 2 concentration (r(sub s) = 0. 71 to 0. 76), and drought index (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, r(sub s) = 0. 33 to 0. 51) on the other hand. The results obtained have revealed apparent climate-induced impacts (e. g. increase of vegetation period length and birch habitat drying due to drought increase) on the stands growth.

40|$|International audienceBistable {{switches}} {{are widely}} used in synthetic biology to trigger cellular functions in response to environmental signals. All bistable switches developed so far, however, control the expression of target genes without access to other layers of the cellular machinery. Here, we propose a bistable switch to control {{the rate at which}} cells take up a metabolite from the environment. An uptake switch provides a new interface to command metabolic activity from the extracellular space and has great potential as a building block in more complex circuits that coordinate pathway activity across cell cultures, allocate metabolic tasks among different strains or require cell-to-cell communication with metabolic signals. Inspired by uptake systems found in nature, we propose to couple metabolite import and utilization with a genetic circuit under feedback regulation. Using mathematical models and analysis, we determined the circuit architectures that produce bistability and obtained their design space for bistability in terms of experimentally tuneable parameters. We found an activationârepression architecture to be the most robust switch because it displays bistability for the largest range of design parameters and requires little fine-tuning of the promoters' response curves. Our analytic results are based on onâoff approximations of promoter activity and are in excellent qualitative agreement with simulations of more realistic models. With further analysis and simulation, we established conditions to maximize the parameter design space and to produce bimodal phenotypes via hysteresis and cell-to-cell variability. Our results highlight how mathematical analysis can drive the discovery of new circuits for synthetic biology, as the proposed circuit has all the hallmarks of a toggle <b>switch</b> and <b>stands</b> as a promising design to control metabolic phenotypes across cell cultures...|$|R

500|$|During {{the course}} of the {{occupation}} of Estonia by Nazi Germany, Estonian expectations of regaining their independence began to diminish. Pursuant to the Constitution of Estonia, formally still in force, Estonian politicians formed an underground National Committee of the Republic of Estonia which convened on 14 February 1944. As President Konstantin PÃ¤ts was currently imprisoned by the Soviet authorities, the acting head of state according to the Constitution was the former Prime Minister JÃ¼ri Uluots. The German-appointed Estonian Self-Administration had previously attempted several unsuccessful general mobilisation calls, which were illegal under the Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907) and opposed by Uluots. In February 1944 when the Leningrad Front reached the vicinity of Narva and the Soviet return became a real threat, Uluots <b>switched</b> his <b>stand</b> on the German draft. In a radio speech on 7 February, Uluots reasoned that armed Estonians could become useful against both Germans and Soviets. He also hinted that Estonian troops on Estonian soil would have: [...] "... a significance much wider than what I could and would be able to disclose here." [...] Along with other Estonian politicians, Uluots saw resistance against the Soviet Armed Forces as a means of preventing the restoration of Soviet power and restoring Estoniaâs independence once the war was over. The conscription call was received with popular support and the mobilisation brought together 38,000 men who were formed into seven border guard regiments and the fictitiously named 20th Estonian SS-Volunteer Division, commonly referred to among the German Armed Forces as the Estonian Division.
