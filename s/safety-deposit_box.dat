In non-monetary terms, a medical license is worth {{the difference between life and}} death for thousands of people. That value and control is something that many people want having worked for it.

Anything worth more than a few thousand dollars is typically secured by placing it in a <b>safety-deposit</b> <b>box</b> under lock and key, and even protected by a bank vault and armed guards. Actually, the high value of a medical license vastly understates the real money that is at stake. Lab testing, hospital stays, and prescriptions cost far more than visits to the doctor.
