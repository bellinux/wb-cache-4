40|$|The {{servovalve}} {{includes a}} primary jet of fluid. A variable control signal {{is adapted to}} vary the angular position of the primary jet from its maximum recovery position. A first fluid path is adapted to supply fluid to a <b>servopiston</b> at a variable pressure determined {{at least in part}} by the control signal. A second fluid path is adapted to receive a predetermined portion of the primary jet fluid when the control signal reaches a predetermined value. The second fluid path terminates {{in the vicinity of the}} primary jet and is adapted to direct a secondary jet of fluid at the primary jet to deflect the primary jet toward the input orifice of the second fluid path. The resultant positive fluid feedback in the second fluid path causes the primary jet to latch in a first angular position relative to the maximum recovery position when the control signal reaches a predetermined value. The servovalve may further include a means to discharge the fluid and a means to block the first fluid path to the <b>servopiston</b> when the control signal falls below a second predetermined value. A method of operating a fail-fixed servovalve is also described...|$|E
