The conical region is bounded by a surface generated by curvilinear ti surfaces. The <b>spherical</b> <b>mean</b> {{is the average}} of u over a constant ti surface.

For an arbitrary dimension we present a general construction for obtaining discrete <b>spherical</b> <b>means</b> of directional derivatives. The construction is based on using the Minkowski's existence theorem and Veronese maps. Approximating the directional derivatives by appropriate finite differences allows one to obtain finite difference operators with good rotation invariance properties. In particular, we use discrete circular and <b>spherical</b> <b>means</b> to derive discrete approximations of various linear and nonlinear first- and second-order differential operators, including discrete Laplacians.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 73 - 74) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishix, 78 leavesThe {{method of}} <b>spherical</b> <b>means</b> is the {{well known and}} elegant method of solving initial value problems for multidimensional PDE. By this method the problem reduced to the 1 + 1 dimensional one, which can be solved easily. But this method is restricted by only linear PDE {{and can not be}} applied to the nonlinear PDE. In the present thesis we study properties of the <b>spherical</b> <b>means</b> and nonlinear PDE for them. First we briefly review the main definitions and applications of the <b>spherical</b> <b>means</b> for the linear heat and the wave equations. Then we study operator representation for the <b>spherical</b> <b>means,</b> especially in two and three dimensional spaces. We find that the <b>spherical</b> <b>means</b> in complex space are determined by modified exponential function. We study properties of these functions and several applications to the heat equation with variable diffusion coefficient. Then nonlinear wave equations {{in the form of the}} Liouville equation, the Sine-Gordon equation and the hyperbolic Sinh-Gordon equations in odd space dimensions are introduced. By some combinations of functions we show that models are reducible to the 1 + 1 dimensional one on the half line. The Backlund transformations and exact particular solutions in the form of progressive waves are constructed. Then the initial value problem for the nonlinear Burgers equation and the Liouville equations are solved. Application of our solutions to spherical symmetric multidimensional problems is discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>spherical</b> <b>mean</b> {{transform}} on ^n. The transform {{is characterized by}} the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation. By looking at the spherical harmonic expansions, we obtain a system of 1 + 1 -dimension hyperbolic equations, which provide a good machinery to attack problems of <b>spherical</b> <b>mean</b> transform. As showcases, we discuss two known problems. The first one is a local uniqueness problem investigated by M. Agranovsky and P. Kuchment, [Memoirs on Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics, 52 : 1 [...] 16, 2011]. We present a simple proof which works even under a weaker condition. The second problem is to characterize the kernel of <b>spherical</b> <b>mean</b> transform on annular regions, which was studied by C. Epstein and B. Kleiner [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 46 (3) : 441 [...] 451, 1993]. We present a short proof that simultaneously obtains the necessity and sufficiency for the characterization. As a consequence, we derive a reconstruction procedure for the transform with additional interior (or exterior) information. We also discuss how the approach works for the hyperbolic and spherical spaces. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
