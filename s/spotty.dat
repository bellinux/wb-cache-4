5|$|Males {{entering}} {{their second}} or third year may develop <b>spotty</b> blue and white plumage during the breeding season. By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial plumage, where the scapulars, secondary wing coverts, and secondary flight feathers are white {{while the rest of}} their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue. All sexually mature males moult twice a year, once before the breeding season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; rarely, a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage. The breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E

Distribution of the bats is <b>spotty</b> within their entire range, and they {{are considered to be}} very uncommon. These bats prefer to reside in deciduous or coniferous forests. They are active in mountain ranges from 240–1125 meters in height. During the spring, summer, and autumn they prefer to roost at emergent rock-outcrops such as cliffs, bluffs, shale barrens, and talus slopes, as well as man-made structures, including buildings, joints between segments of cement guard rails, turnpike tunnels, road-cuts, and scree covered dams. The largest populations of Myotis leibii have been found in New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Western Virginia. (red list) The total count of individuals in all hibernacula in which they have been found is 3,000, with roughly 60% of the total number from just two sites in New York. Unfortunately, 90% of their habitat is on private land which makes it difficult to protect them.|$|E

5|$|Despite losing {{much of its}} {{convection}} over land, Hudah {{maintained a}} well-organized cloud structure once in the Mozambique Channel on April3. As a result of moving back over warm waters, the system began to re-intensify, and attained moderate tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on April4. Meanwhile, a large central dense overcast developed, and Hudah began to track west-southwestward as opposed to its previous westward trajectory. Despite computer forecast models suggesting that Hudah would continue westward, the storm instead turn to a southward drift, giving it time to strengthen in the Mozambique Channel. This {{was the result of}} a mid-latitude trough weakening the nearby subtropical ridge. By 1800UTC on April5, Hudah was upgraded back to tropical cyclone intensity. A banding eye began to appear on satellite imagery, though it remained generally unstable, and a large banding feature formed over the western half of Hudah. The nearby trough later weakened in intensity, causing the tropical cyclone to move north-northwestward towards the Mozambique coast on April7. It was at this time that Hudah reached a tertiary peak intensity with winds of 160km/h (100mph). The tropical cyclone accelerated northwards throughout the day, eventually making its final landfall near Pebane, Mozambique at 0600UTC on April8 as a slightly weaker storm. Once inland, Hudah rapidly weakened, and was no longer tracked by the MFR by 0000UTC on April9. The JTWC issued its final warning on the system six hours later, as the remnants of Hudah moved through northeastern Mozambique, producing <b>spotty</b> convection.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage. All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or <b>spotty</b> appearance, {{with a mixture of}} blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{mechanism}} underlying {{the expression of}} melanin-based sex-traits may help us to understand their signalling function. Potential sources of inter-individual variation are {{the total amount of}} melanins produced but also how biochemical precursors are allocated into the eumelanin and phaeomelanin pigments responsible for black and reddish-brown colours, respectively. In the barn owl (Tyto alba), a eumelanin trait (referred to as ‘plumage spottiness’) signals immunocompetence towards an artificially administrated antigen and parasite resistance in females, whereas a phaeomelanin trait (‘plumage coloration’) signals investment in reproduction in males. This raises the question whether plumage coloration and spottiness are expressed independent of each other. To investigate this question, we have studied the genetics of these two plumage traits. Crossfostering experiments showed that, for each trait, phenotypic variation has a strong genetic component, whereas no environmental component could be detected. Plumage coloration is autosomally inherited, as suggested by the similar paternal-to-maternal contribution to offspring coloration. In contrast, plumage spottiness may be sex-linked inherited (in birds, females are heterogametic). That proposition arises from the observation that sons resembled their mother more than their father and that daughters resembled only their father. Despite plumage coloration and spottiness signalling different qualities, these two traits are not inherited independent of each other, darker birds being <b>spottier.</b> This suggests that the extent to which coloration and spottiness are expressed depends on the total amount of melanin produced (with more melanin leading to a both darker and <b>spottier</b> plumage) rather than on differential allocation of melanin into plumage coloration and spottiness (in such a case, darker birds should have been less spotted). A gene controlling the production of melanin pigments may be located on sex-chromosomes, since the phenotypic correlation between coloration and spottiness was stronger in males than in females. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{fossil record}} of early {{porpoises}} is <b>spottier</b> {{than that of}} other odontocetes. The earliest known species, Derpacetus, lived in the late Oligocene. Its distinctive spatulate teeth, a synapomorphy of the taxa, likely evolved for better prey handling of Percoid fishes, which possessed more spines than basal groups.Ancient sperm whales differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count and {{the shape of the}} face and jaws. For example, Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum. Genera from the Oligocene and Miocene had teeth in their upper jaws. These anatomical differences suggest that these ancient species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid hunters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Contrary to modern sperm whales, most ancient sperm whales were built to hunt whales. Livyatan had a short and wide rostrum measuring 10 ft across, which gave the whale the ability to inflict major damage on large struggling prey, such as other early whales. Species like these are collectively known as killer sperm whales.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort was to validate in flight, data that has been gathered in the NASA Lewis Research Center's Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) {{over the past several}} years. All data was acquired in flight on the NASA Lewis Research Center's Twin Otter Icing Research Aircraft. A faired 3. 5 in. diameter metal-clad cylinder exposed to the natural icing environment was observed by a close-up video camera. The grazing angle video footage was recorded to S-VHS video tape and after the icing encounter, the resultant ice shape was documented by 35 mm photography and pencil tracings. The feather growth area was of primary interest; however, all regions of the ice accretion, from the stagnation line to the aft edge of run back were observed and recorded. After analysis of the recorded data several interesting points became evident: (1) the measured flight feather growth rate is consistent with IRT values, (2) the feather growth rate appears to be influenced by droplet size, (3) the feathers were straighter in the lower, <b>spottier</b> LWC of flight in comparison to those observed in the IRT, (4) feather shedding and ice sublimation may be significant to the final ice shape, and (5) the snow encountered on these flights appeared to have little influence on ice growth...|$|R

40|$|String-pulling {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular tests in animal {{cognition}} because of its apparent complexity, and of its potential to be applied to very different taxa. In birds, the basic procedure involves a food reward, suspended from a perch by a string, which can be reached by a series of coordinated pulling actions with the beak and holding actions of the pulled lengths of string with the foot. The taxonomic distribution of species that pass the test includes several corvids, parrots and parids, but in other families, data are much <b>spottier</b> and the number of individuals per species that succeed is often low. To date, the association between string-pulling ability and other cognitive traits was never tested. It is generally assumed that string-pulling is a complex form of problem-solving, suggesting that performance on string-pulling and other problem-solving tasks should be correlated. Here, we show that individuals of two innovative species from Barbados, the bullfinch Loxigilla barbadensis and the Carib grackle Quiscalus lugubris fortirostris, pass the string-pulling test. Eighteen of the 42 bullfinches tested succeeded, allowing us to correlate performance on this test to that on several other behavioral measurements. Surprisingly, string-pulling in bullfinches was unrelated to shyness, neophobia, problem-solving, discrimination and reversal learning performance. Only two of 31 grackles tested succeeded, precluding correlational analyses with other measures but still, the two successful birds largely differed in their other behavioral traits...|$|R
