While working in another barbers shop a customer told him about Blackfriars karate club where there were Japanese instructors. In August 1969 he went to watch his first session, with Keinosuke Enoeda teaching assisted by Kato, and {{decided he wanted to}} become as good as a yellow belt he watched there. In 1972 Dave passed his first Dan grading.

40|$|Construction {{productivity}} {{is one of}} the most frequently researched topics due to its importance to the viability of the industry. It is regarded as a true reflection of the efficiency and economic success of the operations. Despite the plethora of research into construction productivity reported over the years, a thorough examination of the literature revealed a dearth of research into the influence of buildability factors, i. e. design variables, on the labour productivity of one of the most important materials in the construction industry; in situ reinforced concrete. According to the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA), buildability is defined as "the extent to which the design of a building facilitates ease of construction, subject to the overall requirements for the completed building". Apart from the Singaporean Buildable Design Appraisal System (BOAS), which suffers from major shortcomings, to date, no comprehensive study was conducted to investigate and quantify the effects and relative influence of architectural and structural buildability factors on the labour productivity of in situ reinforced concrete buildings. In this project, the major buildability factors hypothesised to influence the labour productivity of the main trades, i. e. formwork, reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>fixing,</b> concreting and finishing, included grid patterns of footings and columns, type of structural framing system, geometry and dimensions of elements,height of floors, the degree of design rationalisation, standardisation and repetition of elements, reinforcing steel quantity and diameters, location and congestion of reinforcement, volume and workability of concrete as well as surface finish. In addition, and due to its importance to the productivity of the construction industry, the effect of the learning curve theory has been the subject of several previous studies. However, a comprehensive investigation of the impact of the learning phenomenon on the major trades associated with in situ reinforced concrete buildings has not been carried out. The raw data were collected from thirty-nine different construction sites in the State of Kuwait, using specifically designed data collection forms for a total period of nineteen months. In order to triangulate the results, productivity data were collected and analysed at both levels; macro and micro. Since several sites were monitored simultaneously, the intermittent observation technique was selected to form the basis for the observation method. Several relevant buildability factors impact the labour productivity simultaneously. Therefore, to isolate the net effects and quantify the relative influence of these factors on labour productivity, linear regression was used for the statistical analysis throughout this research project. As a result, it was possible to quantify the relationship between labour productivity and the following buildability factors: a) footings and columns grid pattern; b) formwork area; c) variability of elements size; d) geometry of elements, i. e. circular versus rectangular columns, curved versus linear beams, non-rectangular versus rectangular slabs, and number of angles around the perimeter of slabs and walls; e) number of beams used to support the floor area; n number of beam intersections in the framing system; g) dimension of elements; h) reinforcing steel bar diameter; i) quantity of reinforcement fixed; j) location and congestion of reinforcement; k) volume and workability of concrete; I) height of floors above the ground level; and m) power- trowelled floor finish. The applicability of learning curve theory to formwork, reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>fixing</b> and pumped concrete was investigated using the unit straight-line model. Due to the negative impact of height on pumped concrete productivity, the effect of learning on this trade could not be determined. On the other hand,the effect of the learning phenomenon on formwork and reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>fixing</b> labour productivity was insignificant suggesting no potential context for the theory to be used as a useful tool to quantify the productivity improvement, allocate resources or schedule activity durations. This research project has quantified the relationship between the principal design characteristics of in situ reinforced concrete construction and labour productivity of the various trades involved. It can provide practical guidance to architects and structural designers who seek to optimise their designs. In addition, it can give a feedback on how well the designed building considers the requirements of the basic buildability principles and provides for tangible consequences of their design decisions on the construction labour productivity.

40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} the use of fibre {{reinforced}} concrete in load-carrying structures, with an emphasis on shear capacity of beams with openings. The main focus has been the design and testing of four full-scale beams. Two beams with plain concrete and conventional reinforcement and two beams with steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC), both with and without conventional reinforcement. The beams were tested until failure and then compared to each other in order to establish the effect of fibres. Theoretically calculated capacities have also been carried out according to current guidelines and compared to the test results. The properties of both the fresh and the hardened concrete were studied and tested in accordance with current standards and regulations. Self compacting SFRC with 1 vol-% steel fibres were used, which corresponds to about 80 kg/m 3. The idea was to simplify the reinforcement work, where the use of SFRC could serve as an adequate and cheaper alternative to the conventional shear reinforcement. A combination of both SFRC and conventional reinforcement would increase the total load-carrying capacity {{and at the same time}} lead to toughening and stiffening of the structure. The full-scale tests showed that by using 1 vol-% steel fibres the beam achieved the same capacity as the beams with conventional shear reinforcement. This suggests that SFRC is a promising alternative to conventional reinforcement. SFRC would simplify the reinforcement work, and ultimately lead to a reduction of man-hours involved in <b>steel</b> <b>fixing.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The Tore Supra tokamak {{is being}} {{transformed}} in an x-point divertor fusion device {{in the frame}} of the WEST (W-for tungsten-Environment in Steady-state Tokamak) project, launched in support to the ITER tungsten divertor strategy. The WEST project aims to test W monoblock Plasma Facing Units (PFU) under long plasma discharge (up to 1000 s), with thermal loads of the same magnitude as those expected for ITER. Therefore the divertor is a key component of the WEST project, and so is its support structure, which has to handle strong mechanical loads. The WEST upper and lower divertor are made of 12 30 ° sectors, each one composed of 38 PFU that can be made of tungsten, CuCrZr or graphite. A generic 316 L stainless steel 30 ° conic support plate is used to hold the 38 PFU together, regardless of their material. The PFUs are fixed on the support plate thanks to 152 Xm 19 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>fixing</b> elements (4 per PFU), and in each of this fixing element an Aluminium-Nickel-Bronze alloy (Al-Ni-Br) pin is engaged in a slotted hole, in order to allow thermal expansion in the length direction of the PFU. The support plate is fixed on the divertor coil casing thanks to 10 M 10 screws. Mechanicals loads which act on the PFUs are transmitted to the support plate through the fixing elements. These loads are due to Vertical Displacement Event (VDE), disruptions and thermal expansion of the PFU. First the different load cases, PFU configurations and scenario are presented. Then an ANSYS plastic mechanical simulation is performed in order to validate the number of cycles of the support plate for each scenario: 30 000 cycles in steady-state and 3000 cycles in VDE. Finally reactions forces from the previous ANSYS simulation are used in order to calculate the stress in the M 10 screws...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis reports on a CAD-based integrated model developed to aid the planning {{of the construction of}} in-situ concrete structures. The main aim of this model is to automate the planning process of in-situ concrete structures using data generated by CAD systems. In order to achieve this goal, the integration of a CAD system (AutoCAD 10) and a computerised planning system (Artemis 2000) via a database program (dBase IV) has been achieved on an IBM PS 2 Model 70 microcomputer. This enables the generation of network plans in the AutoCAD system which are then automatically transferred to the Artemis system for time and cost analyses. Currently, the system can handle concreting, <b>steel</b> <b>fixing</b> and formwork activities associated with in-situ concrete design elements. However, further enhancement of the model is possible in order to automate the generation of most construction activities. In order to develop this CAD-based integrated planning model, it was necessary to undertake a questionnaire survey on the current status of planning techniques and information technology uses amongst the main UK and US contractors. This survey reveals that many of these contractors are now aware of the benefits that a CAD system can offer to the management and planning of in-situ concrete structures. It was also found that many aspects of information technology such as computer aided design and project management are well within the reach of most of the companies surveyed, and that many recent developments could be used to develop integrated systems as an aid to the planning of construction projects. These findings indicate that the application of such systems could soon become a reality. However, the practicality of these techniques has to be assessed on real life projects which could be the subject of a further research. The CAD-based integrated model described in this thesis offers many facilities for: modeling, drafting, materials and quantities scheduling, time and cost analyses and reporting which were all integrated and incorporated within such a single system. These facilities which have been fully customised within the developed package are easy to be run as the software is user friendly with pull-down and pop-up menus, and help facilities provided at almost all levels. This thesis demonstrates that current software and hardware technologies are more than sufficient to establish new approaches to the planning and management of in-situ concrete structures, particularly in the area of computer aided design. Such approaches can rectify many of the deficiencies found in traditional planning systems. For instance, a CAD-based system could eliminate the re-extraction of information from conventional drawings and documents which could be error prone as an access to the original electronic building model is provided within such a system. In addition, accurate quantities associated with sets of design elements and relevant to the planning process are automatically generated within the system...|$|E

The highest CO conversion was obtained for the catalyst with Fe-loading of 15 wt% whereas it decreased at higher Fe loadings. The decrease ofthe activity is explained in terms ofthe drop ofthe active sites due to the formation of large Femetallic aggregates. The Fe/SiO 2 catalysts presented a wide distribution of liquid hydrocarbons (C 6 to C 18) and high methane formation.

40|$|A {{detailed}} characterisation of {{the quick}} clay underlying the NTNU research site at Tiller, Trondheim is presented. The {{objective of the}} work is to provide guidance on quick clay parameters to engineers and researchers working with similar clays in Scandinavia and North America especially on landslide hazard assessment. The material is lightly overconsolidated and is characterised by its high degree of structure and very high sensitivity (quick clay). Clay and water contents are both about 40 %. The plasticity index is low (5 %). This relates to the low active minerals of the clay and silt fractions (illite/chlorite and quartz/feldspars respectively). Undrained shear strength is of the order of 30 kPa to 50 kPa (medium stiff) and increases with depth. The deposit is consistent across the site and its properties are similar to other Norwegian quick clays. Significant efforts have been made into examining sample disturbance effects on the material.

Underneath this is a button between the pipes that opens or closes the top of this egg, a large radio dish, and a coordinate plaque arch meant for the Balloon to approach here.|$|R
