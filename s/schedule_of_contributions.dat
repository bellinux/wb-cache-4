40|$|The paper {{considers}} various possible means, mooted as alternatives or supplements to {{a simple}} <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> governmental <b>contributions,</b> <b>of</b> paying for global public goods and common purposes: use of IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs); the United Kingdom's International Finance Facility (IFF); globally coordinated taxes (on arms exports, deep-ocean mineral rents, international air transport, greenhouse-gas emissions, or currency transactions) and the tapping of private fortunes. There is discussion of whether the various possible methods might have political advantages over a <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> governmental contributions; of their revenue possibilities and of equity considerations. Promising, the paper argues, provided what are essentially prejudices can eventually be overcome, are first a global tax on currency transactions, and second the regular issue of SDRs, with those that would according to the allocation formula go to the rich countries recycled for development purposes. There is more doubt about the IFF, {{even if it were}} to receive sufficient support from the donor countries. It would probably need to be modified if it were to have much chance of being both workable and acceptable. Private fortunes {{on the face of it}} offer a huge potential; attention needs to be given to providing the right incentives; and it may be that they can be increasingly tapped for international development with the help of the new 'global funds'.

Objectives: To determine the predictive capacity of the entering requirements and the PSU process, for the academic performance of the students of first year in the Odontology career. Material and Method: Descriptive observational study, of transversal cut with students that went through first year between 2004 and 2008. The entering <b>schedules</b> <b>of</b> de Unity of Admission and Academic Student Register (UDARAE), were checked, obtaining information about the gender, entering year, average notes of senior year (NEM), selection score (PSU-SEL) and the score of the language (PSU-L), math (PSU-M) and science (PSU-C) exams.

40|$|Command-and-control {{regulations}} are generally {{thought to be}} inferior to incentive-based alternatives. This essay proposes an incentive-based approach for regulating campaign finance. In place of our current regime <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> ceilings, the essay calls for a graduated system <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> taxes. Rather than capping the size of political donations at a specified dollar level, we should tax donations based on a <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> graduated rates - the larger the size <b>of</b> a <b>contribution,</b> the higher the level <b>of</b> taxation. <b>Contribution</b> taxes generate two primary advantages over contribution ceilings. First, contribution taxes preserve more total surplus. This surplus can be shared by the donors and by society as a whole, with society benefiting from the tax revenue. Second, contribution taxes lead fewer donors to divert their contributions through loopholes. We cannot possibly prevent all diversions of this sort under our current constitutional precedents, and these diversions serve to undermine our system of campaign finance. This essay also refutes the arguments that contribution taxes would engender greater inequality or corruption; that contribution taxes would be found unconstitutional; and that contribution taxes would be defeated by our inability to quantify the harms caused by political donations...|$|R

40|$|The {{complexity}} of embedded application design is increasing with growing user demands. In particular, automotive embedded systems are highly complex in nature, and their functionality is realized {{by a set}} of periodic tasks. These tasks may have hard real-time requirements and communicate over an interconnect. The problem is to efficiently co-schedule task execution on cores and message transmission on the interconnect so that timing constraints are satisfied. Contemporary works typically deal with zero-jitter scheduling, which results in lower resource utilization, but has lower memory requirements. This article focuses on jitter-constrained scheduling that puts constraints on the tasks jitter, increasing schedulability over zero- jitter <b>scheduling.</b> The <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> this article are: 1) Integer Linear Programming and Satisfiability Modulo Theory model exploiting problem-specific information to reduce the formulations complexity to schedule small applications. 2) A heuristic approach, employing three levels <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> scaling to real-world use-cases with 10000 tasks and messages. 3) An experimental evaluation of the proposed approaches on a case-study and on synthetic data sets showing the efficiency of both zero-jitter and jitter- constrained scheduling.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. Involving multiple-purchasers in a PES scheme {{has the potential to}} deliver numerous benefits including cost-sharing, expanded financing and broadened scope. That few such schemes exist is evidence of a classic market failure resulting from incentives to free-ride on the payments of other purchasers. In the context of an experimental investigation, this paper explores the role of negotiation and binding pre-commitments to payments in solving that collective action problem. Our novel experimental setup involves two purchasers seeking a level of payment acceptable to a single provider while also agreeing their own individual contributions to that payment. Contrasting treatments are used to explore complexities of the conditions under which negotiations might take place including asymmetries between the purchasers, treatments with incomplete information and treatments with uncertainty over the levels of benefit. We find that those complexities change the ease with which a negotiated agreement is achieved as well as the relative size of the payoffs enjoyed by the different parties to the negotiations Our findings are generally positive, showing that under many circumstances parties to a multiple-purchaser PES can successfully negotiate a mutually agreeable <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> payments and <b>contributions.</b> This project was carried out as part of the Defra Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) Pilot Research Projects: River Fowey Improvement Scheme [NE 0131].
