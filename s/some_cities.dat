5|$|Achaea {{was now in}} turmoil, and <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> {{were close}} to revolt; many {{residents}} were angered at Aratus' decision to invite the Macedonians into the Peloponnese. Some also hoped that Cleomenes would introduce constitutional changes in their cities. Encouraged by this development, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus and Penteleium, effectively splitting the Achaean League in half. The Achaeans, concerned about developing treachery in Corinth and Sicyon, dispatched their mercenaries to garrison the cities {{and then went to}} Argos to celebrate the Nemean Games.|$|E
5|$|Anarchy Onlines story, {{from the}} player's point of view, began in 29,475, after {{the most recent}} peace treaty had been signed between Omni-Tek and the Clans. ICC {{peacekeeping}} troops later moved into <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> to protect neutral observers of the war who had rejected their contractual obligations with Omni-Tek, but did not align themselves with the Clans. Omni-Tek, the Clans, and the neutral observers make up the game's three playable factions and control much of Rubi-Ka's terraformed surface.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution in 1789, most countries and even <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> had their own system of measurement. Although different countries might have used units of measure with the same name, such as the foot, or local language equivalents such as pied, Fuß, and voet, there was no consistency in the magnitude of those units, nor in the relationships with their multiples and submultiples, much like the modern-day differences between the US and the UK pints and gallons.|$|E

Under Bernard’s influence, almost all European monarchs and episcopates {{recognized}} the exiled Innocent II. Anacletus II, although he controlled Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter, received the support only of the Normans of southern Italy, Scotland, Aquitaine, <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> in northern Italy (incl.

5|$|India is tenth in {{the world}} in factory output. Manufacturing sector in {{addition}} to mining, quarrying, electricity and gas together account for 27.6% of the GDP and employ 17% of the total workforce. Economic reforms introduced after 1991 brought foreign competition, led to privatisation of certain public sector industries, opened up sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving consumer goods. In recent years, Indian cities have continued to liberalise, but excessive and burdensome business regulations remain a problem in <b>some</b> <b>cities,</b> like Kochi and Kolkata.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space for open pit garbage disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of garbage bags at traffic intersections and public areas. In <b>some</b> <b>cities,</b> stickers need to be purchased that allow for identification of disposable garbage.|$|E

5|$|The Macedonians {{had been}} {{defeated}} in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC which left the Spartans in control of Argos. This Spartan gain was a setback for the Achaean League who {{had been trying to}} incorporate Sparta into their league for many years. The Romans had won the Second Macedonian War and it left them in control of Greek affairs. However, they decided not to occupy Greece but to garrison <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> for five years. The tyrant of Sparta, Nabis, who had declared himself king, was troubling the Achaean League and was also threatening to destroy the peace in Greece.|$|E
5|$|The {{apex of the}} Counter-Reformation {{activity}} {{had fallen}} on {{the turn of the}} 17th century, the earlier years of the reign of Sigismund III Vasa (Zygmunt III Waza), who in cooperation with the Jesuits and some other Church circles attempted to strengthen the power of his monarchy. The King tried to limit access to higher offices to Catholics. Anti-Protestant riots took place in <b>some</b> <b>cities.</b> During the Sandomierz Rebellion of 1606 the Protestants supported the anti-King opposition in large numbers. Nevertheless, the massive wave of szlachta's return to Catholicism could not have been stopped.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Greek slaves {{was a constant}} source of discomfort for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the Spartans Agesilaus II and Callicratidas. <b>Some</b> <b>cities</b> passed accords to forbid the practice: {{in the middle of the}} 3rd century BC, Miletus agreed not to reduce any free Knossian to slavery, and vice versa. Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city that had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: Cassander, in 316 BC, restored Thebes. Before him, Philip II of Macedon enslaved and then emancipated Stageira.|$|E

Seattle {{is one of the}} five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states, along with <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> in the Northeast, Ohio and Michigan. Thunderstorms are rare, as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year. By comparison, Fort Myers, Florida, reports thunder on 93 days per year, Kansas City on 52, and New York City on 25.|$|E

That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{finally began}} his {{campaign}} against the Chalkidian league in 349 BC, probably in July, when the Etesian winds would prevent Athens sending aid. Diodorus says that he started by besieging, capturing and razing the fortress of Zereia (possibly Stageira; otherwise unknown). Philip seems to have methodically worked {{his way around the}} 32 cities of the League, leaving Olynthos to the end. At least <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> submitted to him, including Toroni and Mecyberna—a small town which acted as the harbour of Olynthos—having seen the fate of the cities which resisted Philip. By the spring of 348 BC, the western part of Chalkidiki had been lost, and the Olynthians resorted to ravaging their former territory.|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{political}} landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain {{economic and social}} advantage over neighbours. In the Late Classic, <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> established {{a long period of}} dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of Caracol over Naranjo for half a century. In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city. Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently. Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres. Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture. An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities.|$|E
5|$|With the Eastern Front {{entering}} Polish territories in 1944, the Home Army {{established an}} uneasy truce with the Soviets. Even so, the main Red Army and NKVD forces conducted operations against Home Army partisans, including during or directly after Poland's Operation Tempest, which the Poles had envisioned to be a joint Polish-Soviet operation against the retreating Germans which would also establish Polish claims to those territories. The Home Army helped Soviet units with scouting assistance, uprisings, and assistance in liberating <b>some</b> <b>cities</b> (e.g., Operation Ostra Brama in Vilnius, and the Lwów Uprising), {{only to find}} that immediately afterwards Home Army troops were arrested, imprisoned–even executed. Unknown to the Poles, their Operation Tempest had been fatally flawed from the start due to Joseph Stalin's intention of ensuring that an independent Poland would never re-emerge after the war.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Athens, the Athenian {{democracy}} was restored on three separate occasions following the initial {{conquest of the}} city by Antipater in 322 BC. However, when it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state, their membership determined by {{the value of their}} property. Yet other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of autonomy. After Philip II conquered Amphipolis in 357 BC, the city was allowed to retain its democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (boule), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (epistates) to monitor the city's political affairs. However, Philippi, the city founded by Philip II, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly (ecclesia) of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice. <b>Some</b> <b>cities</b> also maintained their own municipal revenues, although evidence is lacking as to whether this was derived from local taxation or grants from the royal court. The Macedonian king and central government otherwise sustained strict control over the finances administered by other cities, especially in regards to the revenues generated by temples and cultic priesthoods.|$|E
