40|$|The {{allocation}} of tradable emissions permits has important efficiency {{as well as}} distributional effects when tax and trade distortions are taken into account. We compare different rules for allocating carbon allowances within sectors (lump-sum grandfathering, output-based allocation (OBA), auctioning) and among sectors (historical emissions or value-added shares). The output subsidies implicit in OBA mitigate tax interactions, unlike grandfathering. OBA with <b>sectoral</b> <b>distributions</b> based on value added is similar to revenue recycling with auctioning. OBA based on historical emissions supports heavier polluters, more effectively counteracting carbon leakage, but at higher welfare costs.

40|$|This article aims {{to analyse}} {{self-employment}} in Belgium {{through the prism}} of gender inequalities that characterize this form of labour market participation. Belgium is no exception in the European landscape regarding the lack of statistical data for analysing self-employment. We use data from the National Institute of Social Insurance for the Self-employed (INASTI) and the Crossroads Bank for Social Security (CBSS). These administrative data (covering the entire population of the self-employed) allow to shed light on two major gender inequalities that characterize self-employment: in terms of both access to this form of employment and the income it yields. We find that women are significantly underrepresented among self-employed workers - and that this cannot be explained by their <b>sectoral</b> <b>distribution.</b> Female self-employed workers are also found to perceive much lower incomes than self-employed men, and here too <b>sectoral</b> <b>distribution</b> cannot explain this inequality.

40|$|This paper uses a two-sector general {{equilibrium}} {{model to}} analyse both steady-state and stochastic dynamic effects of two real exchange rate targeting policies: a constant-target, and a band-target rule. In the model, targeting is implemented by imposing a stochastic fully-rebatable tax on the consumption of non-traded goods. The first result is that when comparing only steady states, a real exchange rate appreciation favours labour and capital in the non-traded sector, while factors in the traded sector are favoured by depreciations. A second result is that both rules reduce the volatility of investment and the trade balance. The third key result {{is that in the}} stochastic economy <b>sectoral</b> income <b>distribution</b> outcomes depend on the design of the constant and band-target rules.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the long-run effects of public capital on private capital and tests the null of Granger non-causality {{between public and}} private capital in India. Both single-equation and system estimates of the model consistently suggest the long-run crowding-in effects of public capital. The error-correction as well as over-parameterized level-VAR models consistently suggest uni-directional Granger-causality from public to private capital. The support for the significant crowding-in effects of public capital has important implications for the formulation of long-term growth and development strategies. It underlines the need to accelerate public infrastructure to induce the distortions-free and market-driven increases in private capital and to attract the inflow of foreign direct investment. The inflows of foreign capital have witnessed perceptible increases {{since the beginning of the}} 1990 s.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} real estate prices on productive investment. We build a simple theoretical framework of firms’ investment with credit rationing and real estate collateral. We show that real estate prices affect firms’ borrowing capacities through two channels. An increase in real estate prices raises {{the value of the}} firms’ pledgeable assets and mitigates the agency problem characterizing the creditor-entrepreneur relationship. It simultaneously cuts the expected profit due to the increase in the cost of inputs. While the literature only focuses on the first channel, the identification of the second channel allows for heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on investment across firms. We test our theoretical predictions using a large French database. We do find heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on productive investment depending on the position of the firms in the <b>sectoral</b> <b>distributions</b> of real estate holdings.

40|$|Abstract: An {{extensive}} literature {{concerned with}} optimal depletion of an exhaustible resource, {{with only a}} few exceptions, ignores the economy-wide and <b>sectoral</b> <b>distribution</b> effects of resource depletion. This paper presents a dynamic computable general equilibrium model to link the underlying natural resource base to economic performance. The model consists of an intra-temporal price endogenous model of a market economy, embedded in an inter-temporal optimal growth and development model. It is an optimization model that determines the optimal development path of the economy, hence, the inter-temporal depletion problem subject to workings of a multi-sector market economy. This general equilibrium approach captures the economy-wide and <b>sectoral</b> <b>distribution</b> effects of resource depletion. The model, benchmarked to Iranian data, is used to examine the issues related to optimal extraction of an exhaustible resource, optimal savings in the economy, and the allocation of investment funds.

40|$|Italy ranked last {{in terms}} of {{manufacturing}} productivity growth according to OECD estimates {{over the last decade}} with a flat, if not declining, trend. In this work we investigate the underlying firm-level dynamics of enterprises on the grounds of a database developed by the Italian Statistical Office (ISTAT) covering the period 1989 - 2004 and containing information on more than 100, 000 firms. Over the period not only the indicators of central tendency of the distribution of labour productivities have not significantly changed, but also the whole <b>sectoral</b> <b>distributions</b> have remained relatively stable over time, with their support at least not shrinking or even possibly widening over time. This is even more surprising if one takes into consideration the 'Euro' shock that occurred during the period of investigation. On the contrary we observe that inter-decile differences in productivity have been increasing. Further, heterogeneous firms' characteristics (i. e. export activity and innovativeness) appear to have contributed to boost such intra-industry differences. Given such wide heterogeneities we resort to quantile regressions to identify the impact of a set of regressors at different levels of the conditional distribution of labor productivity. One phenomenon that we observe is what we call a tendency toward 'neo-dualism' involving the co-existence {{of a small group of}} dynamic firms with a bigger ensemble of much less technologically progressive ones. productivity; firm dynamics; market selection; trade; euro shock; quantile regressions...|$|R
