5|$|Operation Clambake {{was founded}} in 1996 by Andreas Heldal-Lund, an {{information}} technology manager in Stavanger, Norway, who administers the site at www.xenu.net. This domain name {{has been described as}} provocative, because it is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> as a caricature of the character Xenu from Scientology cosmogony. Operation Clambake is registered in Norway as a non-profit organization.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes to}} {{characters}} such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Arwen, Denethor, Faramir, Gimli, and Frodo, when considered together, were <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> {{to alter the}} tone and themes found in the books. Several critics contend that the portrayal of women, especially Arwen, in the films is thematically faithful to (or compatible with) Tolkien's writings despite some differences.|$|E
5|$|Despite the IAU's declaration, {{a number}} of critics remain unconvinced. The {{definition}} is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> as arbitrary and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.|$|E

5|$|Manning is a trans woman who, in a {{statement}} the day after sentencing, {{said she had a}} female gender identity since childhood, wanted to be known as Chelsea, and desired to begin hormone replacement therapy. Reaction to Manning's disclosures, arrest, and sentence was mixed. Her biographer, Denver Nicks, writes that the leaked diplomatic cables were <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> (but disputed by others) as a catalyst for the Arab Spring that began in December 2010, and that she was viewed by some as a 21st-century Tiananmen Square Tank Man and by others as an embittered traitor.|$|E
5|$|Orisini's {{election}} was notable {{at the time}} because it was unusual for the cardinals to elect friars, since they were <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> as too rigid. Members of religious orders {{at the time were}} often respected by the cardinals, but rarely elected, with Benedict XIII being only the fourth since the Council of Trent. Unlike the other mendicants elected to the papacy in this period, he was of noble birth, being the eldest son of the Duke of Gravina, but had forfeited his rights to his father's title in order to enter the Dominicans.|$|E
5|$|President Mutharika was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> as {{increasingly}} autocratic and {{dismissive of}} human rights, and in July 2011 protests over {{high costs of}} living, devolving foreign relations, poor governance {{and a lack of}} foreign exchange reserves erupted. The protests left 18 people dead and at least 44 others suffering from gunshot wounds. In April 2012, Mutharika died of a heart attack; the presidential title was taken over by former Vice-President Joyce Banda.|$|E

5|$|The Amina Bokhary {{controversy}} {{occurred in}} Hong Kong in 2010 involving the assault conviction {{of a wealthy}} woman from a well-connected political family. Amina Mariam Bokhary, 32, received a non-custodial sentence and a one-year driving ban following an incident {{in the aftermath of}} a road traffic accident when she struck several police officers. As she had committed similar offences in 2001 and 2008, her resulting probation was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> commentators as too lenient.|$|E
5|$|The Elves of the Third Clan, or Teleri, {{who reached}} Eldamar {{later than the}} Noldor and the Vanyar, spoke a {{different}} but closely related tongue, usually called Telerin. It was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> Elves to be just another dialect of Quenya. This {{was not the case}} with the Teleri for whom their tongue was distinct from Quenya. After the Vanyar left the city of Túna, Telerin and Noldorin Quenya grew closer.|$|E
5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> {{as a sign}} of divine anger and punishment, and by others as the result of magic. Modern historians speculate that he may have suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E

In Iceland, slapping {{of children is}} viewed as an extreme form of physical abuse, whereas in the United Kingdom it is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> only <b>some</b> parents as abusive, and even then only moderately so.

5|$|The {{genocide}} in Lithuania is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> historians {{as one of}} the earliest large-scale implementations of the Final Solution, leading some scholars to express an opinion that the Holocaust began in Lithuania in the summer of 1941. Other scholars say the Holocaust started in September 1939 with the onset of the Second World War, or even earlier, on Kristallnacht in 1938, or, according to the Jewish Virtual Library, when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{trial was}} <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> as a {{political}} trial, inspired by the Belgian establishment. The federal parliament had notably amended the Constitution {{in order to create}} legal possibilities to condemn the party. The Vlaams Blok also pointed at the problem of political nomination of judges, and again claimed that the lawsuit had been a political process coordinated with the Belgian Ministry of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|Washington's defeat {{revealed}} his deficiencies as a strategist who split his forces, his inexperienced generals who misunderstood the situation, and his raw troops that fled in disorder {{at the first}} shots. However, his daring nighttime retreat has been <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> historians {{as one of his}} greatest military feats. Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|First World {{commentators}} {{had already}} speculated that Brezhnev had {{died when he}} failed to sign a message of congratulations to José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him. Konstantin Chernenko {{was seen as the}} most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev.|$|E
5|$|In the inter-war years (1918–39) Jesus was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> {{as a small}} {{college and}} {{something}} of a backwater; it attracted relatively few pupils from the public schools traditionally seen as the most prestigious. The college did, however, attract many academically able entrants from the grammar schools (particularly those in northern England and Scotland). Among these grammar-school boys was Harold Wilson, who would later become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. During the Second World War, many of the fellows served {{in the armed forces}} or carried out war work in Oxford. The college remained full of students, though, as it provided lodgings for students from other colleges whose buildings had been requisitioned, and also housed officers on military courses.|$|E
5|$|Nine cities {{submitting}} bids to {{host the}} 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics were recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The Committee shortlisted five of them—London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, and Paris—from which London eventually prevailed; thus becoming the first city {{to host the}} Olympic Games for a third time. The bidding process for the 2012 Olympics {{was considered one of}} the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC. Paris was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> as the front-runner for much of the campaign, but skillful lobbying by London's supporters and an inspirational final presentation by Sebastian Coe led to the success of its bid.|$|E
