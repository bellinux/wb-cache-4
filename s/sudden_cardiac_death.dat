25|$|Billman's {{research}} has focused on cardiovascular function, in particular its role in the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF). He developed non-invasive methods to study autonomic neural regulation of the heart, using a canine model of <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> (SCD). These techniques have subsequently been used in human patients to identify people at high risk for VF. Billman has used his <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> models to study the effects of exercise training on susceptibility to SCD and the effects of omega-3 fatty acids, among other things. Due to his use of live animals in experiments, Billman has been criticized by animal rights activists; a 2009 regulatory investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sudden</b> and <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> {{rates in}} {{hemodialysis}} patients. BackgroundSudden and <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> (including death from congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and sudden death) are common occurrences in hemodialysis patients. The intermittent nature of hemodialysis {{may lead to}} an uneven distribution of <b>sudden</b> and <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> throughout the week. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the septadian rhythm of <b>sudden</b> and <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> in hemodialysis patients. MethodsData from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) were obtained to examine the day of death for United States hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients from 1977 through 1997. The days of death were also determined for patients in the Case Mix Adequacy Study of the USRDS. ResultsThere was an even distribution of <b>sudden</b> and <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths</b> for patients on peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis patients dying of noncardiac deaths also had an even distribution. For all hemodialysis patients, Monday and Tuesday were the most common days of <b>sudden</b> and <b>cardiac</b> <b>death.</b> For patients in the Case Mix Adequacy Study designated as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday dialysis patients, 20. 8 % of sudden deaths occurred on Monday compared with the 14. 3 % expected (P = 0. 002). Similarly, 20. 2 % of <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths</b> occurred on Monday compared with the 14. 3 % expected (P = 0. 0005). Similar trends were found on Tuesday for Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday dialysis patients. ConclusionsThe intermittent nature of hemodialysis may contribute to an increased <b>sudden</b> and <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> rate on Monday and Tuesday for patients enrolled in the USRDS...|$|R
25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{invasive}} risk stratification (with PES) is necessary in the asymptomatic individual. While some groups advocate PES for risk stratification in all individuals under 35 years old, others only offer it to individuals who have history suggestive of a tachydysrhythmia, since the incidence of <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> is so low (less than 0.6% in some reports).|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{is based}} on risk {{stratification}} of the individual, which is performed to determine which individuals with WPW {{are at risk for}} <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> (SCD). The medical history may infrequently point to previous episodes of unexplained syncope (fainting) or, more commonly, palpitations (sudden awareness of one's own, usually irregular, heartbeat). These may have been due to earlier episodes of a tachycardia associated with the accessory pathway.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia nervosa {{increases}} the risk of <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>death,</b> though the precise cause is unknown.

25|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{the most}} common cause of sudden death in young people, including trained athletes, and is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere. Mutations in the Troponin C gene (TNNC1) are a rare genetic cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A recent study has indicated that a frameshift mutation (c.363dupG or p.Gln122AlafsX30) in Troponin C was the cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>death)</b> in a 19-year-old male.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{a battery}} of extracardiac effects were {{discovered}} in Kcne2-/- mice that may contribute to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in Kcne2-/- mice and could potentially contribute to human cardiac arrhythmias if similar effects are observed in human populations.

25|$|Statins are {{effective}} in decreasing mortality in people with pre-existing CVD. They are also advocated for use in patients {{at high risk of}} developing heart disease. On average, statins can lower LDL cholesterol by 1.8mmol/l (70mg/dl), which translates into an estimated 60% {{decrease in the number of}} cardiac events (heart attack, <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>death)</b> and a 17% reduced risk of stroke after long-term treatment. They have less effect than the fibrates or niacin in reducing triglycerides and raising HDL-cholesterol ("good cholesterol").|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} {{of the body to}} vigorous physical activity is a multiorgan system phenomenon.

Also it is very important to distinguish physiological changes of the body due to physical activity and pathological changes due to some cardiac diseases. In order to prevent <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths</b> in sport, it is very important to distinguish athletes heart syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, dilatative cardiomiopathy, aritmogenic cardiomiopathy of the right ventricle and myocarditis.

25|$|Earlier {{case reports}} on sudden death {{prompted}} {{a study on}} a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, is also contraindicated.|$|E

25|$|Other {{side-effects}} {{can include}} alterations {{in the structure}} of the heart, such as enlargement and thickening of the left ventricle, which impairs its contraction and relaxation.

25|$|Sometimes devices {{resembling}} pacemakers, called implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted. These {{devices are}} often used {{in the treatment of}} patients at risk from <b>sudden</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>death.</b> An ICD has the ability to treat many types of heart rhythm disturbances by means of pacing, cardioversion, or defibrillation. Some ICD devices can distinguish between ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to ventricular fibrillation. This is known as fast-pacing, overdrive pacing, or anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). ATP is only effective if the underlying rhythm is ventricular tachycardia, and is never effective if the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
