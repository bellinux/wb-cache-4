5000|$|Cape horse {{mackerel}} is a bycatch {{species in the}} offshore demersal trawl, which operates mainly off {{the waters of the}} Western Cape at depths of 110m and deeper. The offshore demersal trawl fishery operates using trawl nets which are dragged behind the boat along the ocean floor at depths from 110 - 800 m. Cape {{horse mackerel}} caught in the midwater trawl fishery are considered to be more sustainable than those caught in the offshore trawl fishery (see Cape horse mackerel assessment for midwater trawl). This fishery primarily targets deepwater hake (Merluccius paradoxus) on soft, sandy bottoms, as well as commercially valuable bycatch species such as kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monkfish (Lophius vomerinus). Although trawling is a highly unselective fishing method, offshore fishing grounds are not generally very biodiverse (i.e. they are only inhabited by a few species) and the discard rate for this fishery is estimated to be 10% of the total catch. However, this fishing method is likely to have significant impacts on bottom habitats and concerns are expressed around the number of seabird mortalities caused during trawling (estimated at 8000 per year). The hake component of the offshore demersal trawl fishery has been certified by the Marine Stewardship Council since 2004, and the current management system for this fishery employs a number of ecosystem-based management measures which address issues such as bycatch, closed areas and benthic habitat impacts. The Cape horse mackerel is managed in terms of a maximum precautionary catch Limit (MPCL). The MPCL has been maintained at 44 000 tonnes in recent years and accommodates both mid-water-directed and bycatch in the hake-directed demersal trawl sector. Juvenile horse mackerel are occasionally targeted on the West Coast where a 5 000 tonnes precautionary catch limit is enforced (the whole small pelagic sector is closed if the limit is exceeded). Despite the absence of direct evidence of ecosystem change, a potential for ecosystem impact exists, as this is an important <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>species,</b> and fills a similar ecosystem niche to other <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> such as sardine and anchovy.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} the total catches of the Dutch pelagic fleet in the Mauritanian Exclusive Economic Zone {{during the year}} 2003. Data have been obtained by the 'Scientific Observer Program', which monitors the catch (both landings and discards) of the Dutch fishery for small pelagics in Mauritania. The Dutch pelagic fleet in Mauritania focuses mainly on the group of sardinella (Sardinella aurita and Sardinella maderensis). Additional target species are pilchard (Sardina pilchardus) and chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus). The landings by weight in 2003 consisted for 95 % of these 4 species, S. aurita being the dominant species (58 % of the landings). In the year 2003, 91. 6 % of the estimated total catch by weight has been landed and 8. 4 % was discarded, which is reasonably comparable to previous years (1999 - 2002). The total estimated catch of the Dutch fleet has remained about the same, approximately 170 thousand tons per year. The dominance of S. aurita in the total estimated catch has gradually diminished throughout the years 1999 - 2003. Pilchard (S. pilchardus) and chub mackerel (S. japonicus) gradually replaced the round sardinella in the catches of the Dutch fleet since 1999. As in previous years, the catch of round sardinella mainly {{took place during the}} summer from June to September and the pilchard S. pilchardus appeared to be the dominant species in wintertime. The number of observer days has reduced slightly throughout the period 1999 - 2003.
