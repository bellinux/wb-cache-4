[...] The defendants-appellees had argued that the law [...] "is rationally related to Florida's interest in furthering the best interests of adopted children by placing them in families with married mothers and fathers" [...] and that [...] "disallowing adoption into homosexual households, which are necessarily motherless or fatherless and lack the stability that comes with marriage, is a rational means of furthering Florida's interest in promoting adoption by marital families." [...] Plaintiffs-appellants had argued that [...] "the statute is not rationally related to this interest", being [...] "overinclusive and underinclusive." [...] The Court rejected appellants' arguments, holding that [...] "The Florida legislature could rationally conclude that homosexuals and heterosexual singles are not [...] "similarly situated in relevant respects." [...] It is not irrational to think that heterosexual singles have a markedly greater probability of eventually establishing a married household and, thus, providing their adopted children with a stable, dual-gender parenting environment. Moreover, as the state noted, the legislature could rationally act on the theory that heterosexual singles, even if they never marry, are better positioned than homosexual individuals to provide adopted children with education and guidance relative to their sexual development throughout pubescence and adolescence." [...] The Court rejected a comparison with Romer v. Evans noting that [...] "Florida's statute is not so [...] "weeping and comprehensive" [...] as to render Florida's rationales for the statute [...] "inexplicable by anything but animus" [...] toward its homosexual residents. Amendment 2 deprived homosexual persons of [...] "protections against exclusion from an almost limitless number of transactions and endeavors that constitute ordinary civic life in a free society." [...] In contrast to this [...] "broad and undifferentiated disability," [...] the Florida classification is limited to the narrow and discrete context of access to the <b>statutory</b> <b>privilege</b> of adoption27 and, more importantly, has a plausible connection with the state's asserted interest. Moreover, not only is the effect of Florida's classification dramatically smaller, but the classification itself is narrower.

5000|$|There {{had been}} calls by many groups {{to abolish the}} Wheat Board. Many of these groups took their fight to the {{internet}} to spread their message and gain support for their cause. While many were focused on the Canadian Wheat Board, others concentrated on international wheat boards, the other primary target being the Australian Wheat Board, before the AWB itself converted to a private firm, leaving the CWB as the only significant agricultural State Trading Enterprise (STE) exporter worldwide, if one ignores Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOE). On 7 December 2008, CWB permit book holders voted in favour of maintaining the wheat board by electing four pro-board candidates with one marketing choice candidate being elected.

Nonetheless, postal services throughout the world are receiving critical reexamination, not only because of the technological developments that appear to be changing the essential character of communications, but also because of a growing body of experience and scholarly research concerning the regulation and public ownership of enterprise. Such experience and research now provides policymakers with a better understanding than they had a generation or more ago of the costs and benefits of the existing way in which postal services are produced. This Article builds on that experience and research by examining the following questions concerning the business activities of Canada Post Corporation (Canada Post) in a competitive environment: What should be the appropriate mandate of Canada Post? In particular, is Canada Post a natural monopoly and, if so, what form of regulation would best serve Canadian consumers? If the delivery of letter mail is not a natural monopoly, what basis exists for retaining Canada Post 2 ̆ 7 s current statutory monopoly? What potential exists for Canada Post to abuse its statutory monopoly-and other <b>statutory</b> <b>privileges</b> and immunities - to compete unfairly against efficient private suppliers of postal services...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a ‘work in progress’ report on some {{initiatives}} emerging from local government practice in New Zealand which should help us consider how we think about the role of local government in a world which is undergoing dramatic change. The starting point is work which the writer undertook with the support of Local Government New Zealand (the national association) and a number of New Zealand councils considering the ‘proper role’ of local government. The context is an ongoing public debate driven substantially by the New Zealand business community from a perspective that this ‘proper role’ should be restricted to the delivery of local public goods, narrowly defined. This has included argument that local governments themselves should be structured substantially to promote the efficient delivery of services generally within the now well understood prescriptions of the ‘new public management’. One implication which the business sector in particular drew in looking at the workings of local government was that there should be economies of scale through further amalgamation of councils (the local government sector having been through a major amalgamation process in 1989 which eliminated a large number of special purpose authorities and reduced the number of territorial local authorities from more than 200 to 73). Debate continues, with the latest manifestation being the National Party led government's proposals for the restructuring of local government within the Auckland region, New Zealand's major metropolitan area. The initiatives discussed in this paper are partly a response, but more significantly a result of selected local authorities reflecting on the nature of their role, and the opportunities for being proactive in using their <b>statutory</b> <b>privileges</b> in ways that could produce benefits for their communities without any associated increase in the cost of local government itself...|$|R

At the present time an effort of this kind is being made in the Michigan legislature, and the introduction of the bill drew quite a little storm of protest from the State press as a dangerous inroad upon our ancient guarantees of personal liberty and security.

40|$|This thesis investigates three exemplars of uxorial {{substantive}} privileges in {{the criminal}} law: the marital coercion doctrine, the intraspousal conspiracy exemption, and the uxorial post-offence accessorial immunity. Their history, choreography and variations are comparatively investigated across the common law jurisdictions including the impact of statutory interventions. The principal argument is that the judicial and legislative treatment of these uxorial privileges has been inconsistent or erratic {{so that they are}} not the products of any systematic, modern development {{in the criminal}} law. This thesis proposes that there is no justification for their continued retention in common law legal systems. Archival, Parliamentary, and other sources have been used to identify the factors impinging upon the creation of specific <b>statutory</b> uxorial <b>privileges.</b> The diaspora of these laws throughout the other common law jurisdictions is investigated. The discussion is illustrated by examination of the particular issues raised by polygamy, customary law concubinage as well as by gender-reassignment. This thesis examines whether both gender-specific and marriage-specific criteria are valid constituents within the parameters of substantive criminal law. It traces the genesis of these special defences within the criminal law available exclusively to women, from the time of King Ine of the West Saxons c 712, to examine the current status of such laws throughout common law jurisdictions. The investigation explores factors shaping the creation of a statutory defence of marital coercion by the British Parliament in 1925 and outlines the challenges generated by that law and its extraordinary resilience. This thesis demonstrates the failure of the criminal law to provide an overarching construct to implement emergent gender equality...|$|R
40|$|Courts {{interpret}} statutes in hard cases. Statutes {{are frequently}} ambiguous, and an enacting legislature cannot foresee all future applications of a statute. The Supreme Court {{in these cases}} often chooses <b>statutory</b> interpretations that <b>privilege</b> the values that it has emphasized in its recent constitutional jurisprudence. In doing so, the Court rejects alternative interpretations that are more consistent with the values embodied in more recently enacted statutes. This is constitutional mainstreaming—an interpretive practice that molds statutes toward the Court 2 ̆ 7 s own preferred values and away from values favored by legislative majorities. In addition to providing a novel descriptive framework for what the Court is doing in these hard cases, this Article offers two normative contributions. The first is a critique of constitutional mainstreaming. Challenging the prevailing view that constitutional norms should have primary influence on the interpretation of statutes in hard cases, I argue that the Court should not engage in constitutional mainstreaming because it implicitly undermines a central principle of statutory interpretation: legislative supremacy. The Article 2 ̆ 7 s second normative contribution is an alternative to constitutional mainstreaming. I suggest that in hard cases the Court should prioritize the values reflected in more recently enacted statutes rather than the values emphasized in its own constitutional jurisprudence. These evolving statute-based values {{are more likely to}} reflect evolving democratic preferences than are judicially emphasized constitutional norms...|$|R
