2500|$|Through the 1980s, {{conflict}} between the users and the city officials flared up. The users complained that about the city officials not keeping to their part of the agreement by demanding that the house live up to all kind of standards set by the city council. The city officials claimed that the users {{had no right to}} interfere with their work and said that Ungdomshuset had {{to live up to the}} standards set by the city council regarding public meeting places and daytime projects. The users replied by refusing to pay rent and retaliated by stating that Ungdomshuset was an autonomous social experiment and not a publicly run youth club or kindergarten. This made the city officials <b>shut</b> <b>of</b> the house supply of oil used for [...] central heating. The users managed by installing wood fueled heating ovens in the major rooms of the house.|$|E
2500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a rated mean out of 100 from {{mainstream}} critics, the album received {{a score of}} 77, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Andy Kellman of Allmusic rated Two Eleven {{four out of five}} stars. He felt that Norwood [...] "took something of a risk by breaking from her norm and working with numerous songwriters and producers" [...] and remarked that the strategy [...] "paid off", adding that [...] "months after scores of music fans went bananas over an opportunistic resuscitation of a deceased peer's studio scraps, Brandy, a superior vocalist ignored or disregarded by many of those same people, released one of her best albums. She should not be taken for granted." [...] Steve Jones, writing for USA Today, considered Two Eleven Norwood's [...] "most impassioned album in years. Whether she's overjoyed with a new love or ready to be <b>shut</b> <b>of</b> an old one, her heart seems like an open book." [...] Mesfin Fekadu from San Francisco Chronicle stated, [...] "Not many singers have released six consistently amazing albums. Brandy has. Her newest is a collection of R songs that are personal, flavored and fantastic. The album doesn't miss a beat, as Brandy's raspy-yet-earthy tone weaves into each song's beat nicely to create outstanding tracks that will have you listening again and again." [...] People declared Two Eleven [...] "her best work since 2004's career high Afrodisiac" [...] and wrote, [...] "full of subtle, sensual pleasures, the album unfolds at a slow-to-midtempo pace and stays there for most of the time, even when incorporating hip-hop or electronica beats." [...] The magazine gave the album three and a half out of four stars.|$|E
2500|$|Refugee management: European Union is {{presently}} facing the humanitarian consequences of NATO-led 'democracy' promotion agenda which severely destabilized Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan. Abject living conditions and unsafe security situation has driven civilians to vote with their feet, resulting in mass exodus from Europe's periphery. The massive inflow of migrants fleeing civil wars has exposed fundamentally discordant perspectives on an unified EU approach and {{course of action}} to manage the crisis. Eastern and Northern European countries show no urgency to increase their intake of refugees to alleviate the burden on crisis response services in southern EU member states (especially Italy & Greece) who are overburdened with the relentless arrival of refugees. The United Nations demanded that European Union countries {{live up to their}} responsibilities to accept migrant outflows. NGOs have expressed shock at the treatment of refugees in Europe. Northern European and former Communist EU member states like Poland, Slovakia and Hungary whose populations are less multi-ethnic than most Western European countries are reluctant to accept migrants. Radical steps were taken to secure internal borders against migrants : Hungary and Bulgaria opted for razor-wire fences [...] while Austria deployed its army. Far-right political parties and neo-fascist movements (Austria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden) have opposed the arrival and resettlement of refugees. Poland's Janusz Korwin-Mikke, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), claimed that EU migrants were: [...] "people coming to Poland and the whole Europe just to live off handouts. People willing to work are valuable, but they are being sent back to their countries and we take in those unwilling to work. This is a ridiculous policy that results in Europe being flooded with human garbage. Let's state this clear: human garbage that doesn't want to work". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country hosts the most number of refugees fleeing Syria was scathing in his assessment of the European Union's management of refugees and migrants: [...] "European countries, which turned the Mediterranean Sea -- the cradle of ancient civilisations -- into a migrant cemetery are party to the crime that takes place when each refugee loses their life,". UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that he was [...] "shocked" [...] that tear gas and water cannons were used by Hungarian police to force migrants away from its border and declared that such treatment of asylum seekers was [...] "unacceptable". The mass exodus, provoked by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's unilateral announcement that Germany will accept Syrian refugees irrespective of where they entered the European Union, and the subsequent slamming <b>shut</b> <b>of</b> Germany's borders to refugees, left many to wonder if the crisis was a political stunt to shift global media attention away from the adverse publicity to the German Chancellor following the debt default by Greece. By March 2016, a significant number of EU countries flatly rejected Germany's plans for a quota based EU-wide refugee redistribution and resettlement scheme besides refusing to bear the consequences of Angela Merkel's unilateral actions. Eastern European countries shoved-away the refugee crisis as Germany's problem and threatened to defy Germany through legal and electoral challenges. The refugee crisis has left Angela Merkel politically isolated in Europe. Amid economic decline, European citizens are increasingly concerned about their living standards and care less about ideology and moral discourses.|$|E
