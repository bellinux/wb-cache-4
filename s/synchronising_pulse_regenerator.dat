25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular <b>synchronising</b> <b>pulses.</b> The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies.

50|$|In the {{original}} system, {{as applied to}} 625 line analogue TV, the audio signal was sampled twice during each television line and each sample converted to 10-bit PCM. Two such samples were inserted into the next line <b>synchronising</b> <b>pulse.</b> At the destination, the audio samples were converted back to analogue form and the video waveform restored to normal. Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the compandor only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components. A pilot tone at half the sampling frequency was transmitted to enable the expander to track the gain adjustment applied by the compressor, even when the latter was limiting.|$|R
30|$|Our method {{not only}} {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} generating accurately synchronised video signals in a simple and very economical way, but also avoids the need for transferring frame or line <b>synchronising</b> <b>pulses</b> between cameras. This avoids the delays associated with the transmission of such pulses making it applicable to systems requiring ultra-high speed operation without posing any serious restrictions on the relative positioning of the cameras. Much higher frames rates can be realistically achieved this way. In addition, the high precision synchronisation afforded by our method allows the aggregation of multivision cameras into a system that mimics a multi-tap camera. This allows the combined and faithful transmission of the outputs of several cameras over a single Camera-Link® connection over substantial distances. The method presented here extends, without violating, the provisions for multi-tap video, as {{laid out in the}} Camera-Link® specification. This method also avoids the need for a “store and forward” mechanism and hence does not incur any of the cost, complexity and latency associated with the internal buffering used in other methods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There is {{a growing}} need to {{introduce}} and develop computa-tional models capable of faithfully modelling systems whose behaviour combines synchrony with asynchrony {{in a variety of}} complicated ways. Examples of such real-life systems can be found from VLSI hardware GALS systems to systems of cells within which biochemical reactions happen in <b>synchronised</b> <b>pulses.</b> One way of capturing the resulting intri-cate behaviours is to use Petri nets with localities where transitions are partitioned into disjoint groups within which execution is synchronous and maximally concurrent. In this paper, we generalise this type of nets by allowing each transition to belong to several localities. Moreover, we define this extension in a generic way for all classes of nets defined by net-types. We show that Petri nets with overlapping localities are an in-stance of the general model of nets with policies. Thanks to this fact, it is possible to automatically construct nets with localities from behavioural specifications given in terms of finite step transition systems. After that we outline our initial ideas concerning net synthesis when the association of transition to localities is not given and has to be determined by the synthesis algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Multistage {{pulse tube}} cryocoolers require {{separate}} phase shifters for each stage. For sufficiently high frequency and acoustic power, the inertance tube {{is commonly used}} for such phase shifting. For Stirling-type, multistage pulse tube cryocoolers, the warm end of the coldest pulse tube is often heat sunk to the cold end of a warmer stage rather than at room temperature to improve the figure of merit for the pulse tube and/or to achieve a larger phase shift with a cold inertance tube. The use of a secondary <b>pulse</b> tube or <b>regenerator</b> between the main pulse tube and a phase shifter allows the phase shifter to operate at room temperature where space is more readily available. It also allows {{for the use of}} commercially available pressure oscillators as expanders. The secondary regenerator amplifies the acoustic power, so a room temperature inertance tube may perform as well as a cold one. A secondary pulse tube transfers acoustic power to room temperature without amplification, so a rather small warm expander or displacer can provide the optimum phase shift even in a low-power cryocooler. In this paper, we model the behavior of these secondary <b>pulse</b> tubes and <b>regenerators</b> using REGEN 3. 3 and present results to assist in selecting the optimum geometry and the optimum characteristics for the expander. We show that acoustic power flows from cold to hot in such systems can be modeled with REGEN 3. 3 by changing the flow phase by 180 degrees...|$|R
40|$|Mass-vaccination {{campaigns are}} an {{important}} strategy in the global fight against poliomyelitis and measles. The large-scale logistics required for these mass immunisation campaigns magnifies the need for research into the effectiveness and optimal deployment of pulse vaccination. In order to better understand this control strategy, we propose a mathematical model accounting for the disease dynamics in connected regions, incorporating seasonality, environmental reservoirs and independent periodic pulse vaccination schedules in each region. The effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is defined and {{proved to be a}} global threshold for persistence of the disease. Analytical and numerical calculations show the importance of <b>synchronising</b> the <b>pulse</b> vaccinations in connected regions and the timing of the pulses with respect to the pathogen circulation seasonality. Our results indicate that it may be crucial for mass-vaccination programs, such as national immunisation days, to be synchronised across different regions. In addition, simulations show that a migration imbalance can increase $R_e$ and alter how pulse vaccination should be optimally distributed among the patches, similar to results found with constant-rate vaccination. Furthermore, contrary to the case of constant-rate vaccination, the fraction of environmental transmission affects the value of $R_e$ when pulse vaccination is present.

40|$|Two LHC beam dumping systems (LBDS) will fast-extract the {{counter-rotating}} beams safely {{from the}} LHC collider during setting-up of the accelerator, {{at the end}} of a physics run and in case of emergencies. They consist of 15 fast pulsed magnets per ring for beam extraction from the accelerator combined with 10 fast pulsed magnets for horizontal and vertical beam dilution.

40|$|The {{development}} of solid-state switches for pulsed power applications {{has been of}} considerable interest since high-power semiconductor devices became available. However, the use of solid-state devices in the pulsed power environment has usually been restricted by device limitations in either their voltage/current ratings or their switching speed. The stacking of fast medium-voltage devices, such as IGBTs, to improve the voitage rating, makes solid-state switches a potential substitute for conventional switches such as hard glass tubes, thyratrons and spark gaps. Previous. studies into stacking IGBTs have been concerned with specific devices, designed or modified particularly fcir a specific application. The present study is concerned with stacking. fast and commercially available IGBTs and their application to the generation of pulsed electric field and the switching of a high intensity Xenon flashlamp. The aim ofthe first section {{of the present study}} was to investigate different solid-state switching devices with a stacking capability and this led to the choice of the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT). It was found that the collector-emitter voltage decreases in two stages in most of the available IGBTs. Experiments and simulation showed that a reason for this behaviour could be fast variations in device parasitic parameters particularly gate-collector capacitance. Choosing theÃ‚Â· proper IGBT, as well as dealing with problems such as unbalanced voltage and current sharing, are important aspects of stacking and these were reported in this study. Dynamic and steady state voltage imbalances caused by gate driver delay was controlled using an array of <b>synchronised</b> <b>pulses,</b> isolated with magnetic and optical coupling. The design procedure for pulse transformers, optical' modules, the drive circuits required to minimise possible jitter and time delays, and over-voltage protection ofIGBT modules are also important aspects of stacking, and were reported in this study. The second purpose of this study was to investigate the switching performance of both magnetically coupled and optically coupled stacks, in pulse power applications such as Pulse Electric Field (PEF). inactivation of microorganisms and UV light inactivation of food-related pathogenic bacteria. The stack, consisting of 50. 1. 2 kV !GBTs with the voltage and current capabilities of 10 kV, 400 A, was incorporated into a coaxial cable Blumlein type pulse generator and its performance was successfully tested with both magnetic and optical coupling. As a second application of the switch, a fully integrated solid-state Marx generator was designed and assembled to drive a UV flashlamp for the purpose of microbiological inactivation. The generator has an output voltage rating of 3 kV and a peak current rating of 2 kA, although the modular approach taken allows for a number of voltage and current ratings to be achieved. The performance of the switch was successfully tested over a period of more than 106 pulses when it was applied to pulse a xenon flashlamp.
