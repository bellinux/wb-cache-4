5|$|The <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> {{were used}} {{for more than just}} {{circumventing}} accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities.</b> However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|R

500|$|Enron used <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities—limited {{partnerships}} or companies {{created to}} fulfill a temporary or specific purpose to fund or manage risks associated with specific assets. The company elected to disclose minimal details on its use of [...] "special purpose entities". These shell companies were created by a sponsor, but funded by independent equity investors and debt financing.

In total, by 2001, Enron had used hundreds of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> to hide its debt. Enron used a number of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities,</b> such as partnerships in its Thomas and Condor tax shelters, financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs) in the Apache deal, real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) in the Steele deal, and REMICs and {{real estate investment trusts}} (REITs) in the Cochise deal.|$|R

Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities.</b> By hedging its risks with <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions.

50|$|When FASB {{first began}} working on FIN 46, it focused on <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>{{entities}}</b> such as the entities Enron used.

Also, in a securitization, if a party selling assets to a VIE maintains an ongoing involvement with those assets (for example as a swap counterparty to the VIE with respect to asset cashflows) then Financial Accounting Standard 140 (FAS 140), which deals with de-recognition of assets upon transfer to a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entity,</b> will also be relevant.|$|R

40|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{downfall}} of the Enron Corporation in 2001 extraordinary attention has been focused on the use of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> (SPEs), structured finance and other methods of managing earnings for the purpose of artificially inflating stock prices of American companies.

Understanding these structures is essential to understanding the allocation and transfer of risk among the different parties in an asset-backed transaction – the originator, the special-purpose entity, investors, and related parties such as insurance guarantors. Understanding these structures is also essential in proposing potential solutions to regulatory and accounting concerns about the transfer of risks in asset-backed securities.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade Mauritius has emerged as an {{international}} financial centre, and has recently attracted global attention. Studies on the architecture of cross-border financial interconnectedness categorize Mauritius as an important node for emerging G 20 countries. In response to a request of the Mauritian Authorities {{to adhere to the}} SDDS data initiative, the IMF recommended that the central bank extend the coverage of the external sector statistics to include the cross-border transactions and positions of <b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> <b>Entities</b> (SPEs) in the offshore sector. Results of the 2011 survey of global business corporations holding a category 1 licence (GBC 1 s) domiciled in Mauritius indicate foreign assets holdings of above USD 360 billion. Because GBC 1 s are considered residents of the Mauritian economy for statistical purposes, their foreign debt liabilities have been accounted for as private external debt of the country. However for a small country with a domestic GDP of roughly US$ 12 billion, having such a disproportionate private external debt ratio to GDP distorts its gross external debt indicators and overstates its external vulnerability. These entities, though they do have real activity in Mauritius, are mostly engaged in financial intermediation between non-residents. The paper shares the view that the global statistical standard-setters may have inadequately treated <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> (SPEs) and understated their special role in the global financial network.
