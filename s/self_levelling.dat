50|$|Pressure {{flows from}} the {{hydraulic}} circuit to the suspension cylinders, pressurizing the bottom part of the spheres and suspension cylinders. Suspension works {{by means of a}} piston forcing LHM into the sphere, compacting the nitrogen in {{the upper part of the}} sphere; damping is provided by a two-way 'leaf valve' in the opening of the sphere. LHM has to squeeze back and forth through this valve which causes resistance and controls the suspension movements. It is the simplest damper and one of the most efficient. Ride height correction (<b>self</b> <b>levelling)</b> is achieved by height corrector valves connected to the anti-roll bar, front and rear. When the car is too low, the height corrector valve opens to allow more fluid into the suspension cylinder (e.g., the car is loaded). When the car is too high (e.g. after unloading) fluid is returned to the system reservoir via low-pressure return lines. Height correctors act with some delay in order not to correct regular suspension movements. The rear brakes are powered from the rear suspension circuit. Because the pressure there is proportional to the load, so is the braking power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{many cases}} cement based {{materials}} demand a higher flowability and workability and this conventionally can’t {{be done without}} loss of its strength, {{due to the fact}} that the common practice to increase the workability is the addition of water. But, nowadays using a third generation superplasticizer (SP) we can achieve the desire flowability without loss of its strength. The action of superplastisizers is to spread efficiently the cement grains and so to wetting better the cement grains giving a more homogeneous mixture with higher strength. Nine different mixtures were prepared adding a small percentage of SP (1 %). The conditions to get a <b>self</b> <b>levelling</b> mortar, have to do not only with rheological but also with mechanical demands. The bending and compression test gave the achieving mechanical strength whereas their rheological response came through slump flow and v-funnel flow tests. With the help of a small amount of stabilizer we obtain a robust mixture that deserves the desire response at the field too. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{were two}} {{principal}} objectives for this thesis. The first {{was to develop}} a methodology and evaluation model of moisture redistribution {{in order to make the}} future relative humidity in a screeded concrete slab predictable. The second objective {{was to develop a}} method to determine the critical humidity for ion transport in concrete. Residual moisture in screeded concrete slabs may be redistributed to the top screed surface under a semi-permeable flooring, thus elevating the relative humidity, RH, and possibly exceeding the critical humidity level. Passing the critical humidity level may result in material damage to the flooring and adhesive. In order to avoid such damage there is a need of a methodology to estimate the maximum humidity obtained underneath flooring. The redistribution of residual moisture may increase the concentration of alkali at the contact area between the adhesive and concrete. This alkali increase may initiate and sustain adhesive deterioration, which is a common moisture related damage. Several screeded concrete slabs with PVC flooring were prepared to reproduce and monitor moisture distribution and the subsequent redistribution. The moisture distribution before flooring and after a certain period of redistribution is presented. In addition, sorption isotherms including scanning curves were determined in a sorption balance for materials used in the floor constructions, viz, w/c 0. 65 concrete, w/c 0. 4 concrete, w/c 0. 55 cement mortar, and Floor 4310 Fibre Flow, a <b>self</b> <b>levelling</b> flooring compound. Repeated absorption and desorption scanning curves starting from the desorption isotherm were also investigated. The measurements performed made it possible to develop both a qualitative and quantitative model of moisture redistribution and to quantify the humidity achieved under the flooring. The hysteresis phenomenon of the sorption isotherm is considered in the model. The model is well suited for estimations of the future RH underneath flooring in a screeded concrete slab and may also be used on homogeneous slabs. Results from previous research suggested that early drying of the concrete slab can mitigate the increase in relative humidity that occurs when an impermeable floor covering is installed. A study was conducted to verify these results. The results of this new study of the effects of early drying could not demonstrate any significant difference between an early and late dehydration. The redistribution of ions under different moisture conditions was investigated with a newly developed method. The method is divided into a preconditioning of test specimens and also a method to determine the redistribution of potassium ions. This preconditioning provides a well defined moisture condition of the specimen, which is important for determining the critical humidity for the transport of ions. The redistribution is detected by examining the ion content distribution before and after the preconditioning of ion species already present in the concrete. Previous research in this area has been conducted through adding chloride ions to the specimens. However, redistribution of chloride ions is impeded in that they bind to the inner pore surfaces, which poses a risk that the critical moisture level may be affected/misjudged...|$|E

Ratings can be performed at the supervisor, peer, or <b>self</b> <b>levels.</b> In 1990, Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, and Fetter conducted an important study using the five dimensions of OCB: altruism, conscientiousness, sportsmanship, courtesy, and civic virtue. This prevalent study {{was one of the}} first where civic virtue was analyzed independently of other OCBs and where the construct was given its own scale items. Civic virtue was specifically defined as “behavior on the part of an individual that indicates that he/she responsibly participates in, is involved in, or is concerned about the life of the company” (Podsakoff et al., 1990, p. 115). These researchers developed a 24-item scale by having 10 of their colleagues sort generated scale items into one of the five OCB dimensions or an “other” category if they felt the item did not fit any of the five defined conceptual definitions. The final version of the scale included only items for which at least 80% of the judges agreed on the items categorization. The four civic virtue items outlined in Podsakoff and colleagues’ (1990) scale include: ...|$|R

One of the major difficulties {{on the field of}} metacognition has been to develop and put into practice valid surveys or inventories to measure metacognitive skills. Accordingly, this research aimed to determine the level of metacognitive awareness gained by the teacher candidates studying different subject areas. The study was carried out on various departments of a faculty of education. In the plot phase, 30 -item-scale was applied to 200 students and Cronbach's alpha was 0. 71. In the main phase, 92 students took part and the final version of MAS (Metacognitive Awareness Scale) was used with 24 items under 3 dimensions. Cronbach's alpha was 0. 71. With regard to MAS total scores, no difference was found according to gender, high school type graduated, type of education whether it was day or evening and grade point averages. Results indicate that MAS scale yields profound information about student's <b>self,</b> <b>level</b> of metacognitive strategies usage and evaluation of their performance as well as effectiveness of strategies they use. This study also illustrates the need of training students to use metacognitive strategies in the learning environments...|$|R
