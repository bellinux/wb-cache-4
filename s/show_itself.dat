5|$|Competition {{between the}} French and the Portuguese began to <b>show</b> <b>itself</b> {{in the region}} during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading posts in Cacheu and Farim asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and Sédhiou, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French. This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was {{negotiated}} in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Fey {{received}} an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series. The <b>show</b> <b>itself</b> won the 2007 Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series (and did so again for two subsequent years). In 2008, {{she won the}} Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and Emmy awards all in the category for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. The following year, Fey again won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award in the same categories, and was nominated for an Emmy Award. In early 2010, Fey received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Lead Actress. 30 Rock returned for the 2011–2012 season, though due to Fey's pregnancy with her second child, the season premiere was delayed until midseason.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure Time {{crew was}} {{satisfied}} with the episode on its completion. In spite of that, Muto described the reaction from fans on the Internet as largely negative, much to their surprise. It earned an A− grade from Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club, who compared Cinnamon Bun's evolution from a simple-minded character to one of complexity with the progression of the <b>show</b> <b>itself.</b> Sava opined that the theme of life following a broken romance benefits from this complexity. Sava saw the physical cooling of Flame Princess as a crafty metaphor for the personal changes an individual from a former relationship might experience, {{as well as the}} nostalgia felt over such a relationship. Separate from romance, Sava interpreted the battle between the Flame Lord and the Flame King as to demonstrate Flame Princess is a more sensible ruler.|$|E
5|$|The film tackles {{issues of}} {{censorship}} and bad parenting, and parodies the animated {{films of the}} Disney Renaissance as well as musicals such as the West End's Les Misérables, and satirizes the controversy surrounding the <b>show</b> <b>itself.</b> The film also heavily lampoons the Motion Picture Association of America; Parker and Stone battled the MPAA throughout the production process and the film received an R rating just two weeks prior to its release. A writing team consisting of Parker, Stone, and Pam Brady was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Parker and Stone's being the one developed into a film. The film features twelve original songs by Parker and Marc Shaiman, with additional lyrics by Stone.|$|E

25|$|After a year's inactivity, Barris revived Treasure Hunt {{again in}} 1981 in {{partnership}} with the original 1950s version's producer, Budd Granoff, who had become his business partner (the <b>show</b> <b>itself</b> was created by its original host, Jan Murray). Unlike with the 1970s version of Treasure Hunt, Barris did not have direct involvement with the production of the <b>show</b> <b>itself.</b> This revival, a five-day-a-week strip, lasted only one year.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Orthodox Church {{collaborated with}} the White Army in the Russian Civil War (see White movement) after the October Revolution.
