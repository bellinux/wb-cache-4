40|$|One of {{the fatigue}} design {{processes}} {{of a car}} body is stress-based sheet metal fatigue near <b>nuts</b> <b>welded</b> to thin sheets (<b>weld</b> <b>nuts).</b> In this investigation, the influence from nut geometry and dimension, as well as sheet material and thickness on sheet metal fatigue life was studied by fatigue experiments and numerical analyses. The fatigue experiments were force-controlled and carried out on a <b>weld</b> <b>nut</b> specimen which, during the reversed loading that was applied, was designed to result in bending fatigue loading conditions of the sheet metal near the <b>weld</b> <b>nut.</b> The results from the experiments were Fa–N curves for various combinations of nut geometry and dimension, sheet material and thickness. Numerical analyses of the experiments were carried out by linear elastic finite element (FE) analyses, in order to transform the Fa–N curves to Wöhler (sig_a–N) curves. A simplified FE model of the <b>weld</b> <b>nut,</b> which is suitable for structural analysis of car body structures, was used. The structural stresses calculated using the FE model showed good agreement with the structural stresses calculated using an analytical model {{that is based on}} plate theory. The conclusion was that the simplified representation of the <b>weld</b> <b>nut,</b> and the mesh density used in the FE model, was appropriate for computation of the stress response near a <b>weld</b> <b>nut</b> subjected to bending fatigue loading conditions. Finally, ra–N curves were computed for each <b>weld</b> <b>nut</b> configuration using its experimental data set. A sig_a–N curve fitted to all data sets resulted in the relation sig_a = 9888 N^ 0. 312. The sig_a–N curves for the 21 <b>weld</b> <b>nut</b> configurations tested were gathered within a factor of three in fatigue life from this curve...|$|R

The aim of this research was to analyze the implementation of supply chain management of diesel muffler components. Supply chain performance was measured by the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model. Performance factors of supply chain consist of master schedule, quality, and price. The criteria and sub criteria for supplier selection include the master schedule (timeliness, capacity, and distance), quality (quality certification, practice, and the percentage of disability); price (bid, the potential savings, and costs of purchase). The weighting process produce five main suppliers of many major component suppliers for steel plate, pipe, and CKD components such as pipes, <b>welding</b> <b>nut,</b> and bracket and ring. Performance level was summarized from several metrics using gap analysis. In this case, the best in class performance level consists of delivery performance, fill rate, perfect order fulfillment, order fulfillment lead time, supply chain management cost, warranty cost of return processing cost, cash to cash cycle time, inventory days of supply, asset turns. Advantage performances level consist of supply chain response time, production flexibility, cost of goods sold, and value added productivity. Based on these metrics can be concluded that supply chain performance of PT X is in the best in class position and the company capable to maintain its further improvement and development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProjection <b>welding</b> of <b>nuts</b> to sheets is {{a widely}} {{utilized}} manufacturing process in the automotive industry. The process entails challenges due the necessity of joining different sheet thicknesses and nut sizes made from dissimilar materials, and {{due to the fact}} of experiencing large local deformations ranging from room temperature to above the melting point. Heating is facilitated by resistance heating and is highly influenced by the contact area resulting from the amount of deformation, which is also temperature dependent due to material softening and frictional conditions. Resort to new materials and applications require a new level of understanding of the process by combining finite element modelling and experimentation. This paper draws from the challenge of developing a three-dimensional computer program for electro-thermo-mechanical modeling of resistance welding and presents, as far as the authors are aware, the first ever three-dimensional simulation of the projection <b>welding</b> of <b>square</b> <b>nuts</b> to sheets by means of finite element analysis. Results are compared with experimental observations and measurements produced by the authors with the aim and objective of assessing the accuracy, reliability and validity of the theoretical and numerical developments.
