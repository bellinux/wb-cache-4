We aimed to evaluate the potential prognostic significance of SII in patients with advanced gastric cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Subjects and methods: The retrospective analysis included data from 107 patients with advanced gastric cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 185 patients with pathology-proven gastric cancer. The optimal cutoff value of SII by receiver operating characteristic curve stratified patients into low SII (< 600 × 109 /L) and high SII (SII ≥ 600 × 109 /L) groups. The clinical outcomes of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated by Kaplan–Meier survival curves and compared using log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the prognostic value of SII. Results: The results indicated that SII had prognostic significance using the cutoff value of 600 × 109 /L on DFS and OS in univariate and multivariate Cox regression survival analyses. Low SII was associated with prolonged DFS and OS, and the mean DFS and OS for patients with low SII were longer than for those with high SII (57. 22 vs 41. 56 months and 62. 25 vs 45. 60 months, respectively). Furthermore, we found that patients with low SII had better 1 -, 3 - and 5 -year rates of DFS and OS than those with high SII. In addition, patients with low SII were likely to receive DFS and OS benefits from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy. Conclusion: SII may qualify as a noninvasive, cost-effective, convenient and reproducible prognostic indicator for patients with advanced gastric cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It may help clinicians to identify those patients who will benefit from treatment strategy decisions.

40|$|High-dose {{interferon}} alfa- 2 b (IFN-α- 2 b) {{improves the}} survival of patients with high-risk melanoma. We aimed to identify baseline peripheral blood biomarkers to predict the outcome of acral melanoma patients treated with IFN-α- 2 b. Pretreatment baseline parameters and clinical data were assessed in 226 patients with acral melanoma. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied after adjusting for stage, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ulceration. Univariate analysis showed that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≥ 2. 35, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ≥ 129, <b>systemic</b> <b>immune-inflammation</b> <b>index</b> (SII) ≥ 615 × 109 /l, and elevated LDH {{were significantly associated with}} poor RFS and OS. The SII is calculated as follows: platelet count × neutrophil count/lymphocyte count. On multivariate analysis, the SII was associated with RFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1. 661, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 066 - 2. 586, P=. 025] and OS (HR= 2. 071, 95 % CI: 1. 204 - 3. 564, P=. 009). Additionally, we developed a novel circulating T-cell immune index (CTII) calculated as follows: cytotoxic T lymphocytes/(CD 4 + regulatory T cells × CD 8 + regulatory T cells). On univariate analysis, the CTII was associated with OS (HR= 1. 73, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 2. 94, P=. 044). The SII and CTII might serve as prognostic indicators in acral melanoma patients treated with IFN-α- 2 b. The indexes are easily obtainable via routine tests in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} of a different response to treatment {{with regard to the}} primary tumor localization (right-sided or left-sided) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We analyzed the different outcomes and biomolecular characteristics in relation to tumor localization in 122 of the 370 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer enrolled onto the phase III prospective multicenter “Italian Trial in Advanced Colorectal Cancer (ITACa) ”, randomized to receive first-line chemotherapy (CT) or CT plus bevacizumab (CT + B). RAS and BRAF mutations; baseline expression levels of circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX 2), ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EPHB 4), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 -alpha (HIF- 1 α), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP); and inflammatory indexes such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte rate and <b>systemic</b> <b>immune-inflammation</b> <b>index</b> were evaluated. Patients with right-sided tumors showed a longer median progression-free survival in the CT + B arm than in the CT group (12. 6 vs. 9. 0 months, respectively, p = 0. 017). Baseline inflammatory indexes were significantly higher in left-sided tumors, whereas eNOS and EPHB 4 expression was significantly higher and BRAF mutation more frequent in right-sided tumors. Our data suggest a greater efficacy of the CT + B combination in right-sided mCRC, which might be attributable to the lower inflammatory status and higher expression of pro-angiogenic factors that appear to characterize these tumors...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We have {{developed}} a systemic hepatic-damage index (SHI) based on serum total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein levels (HDL) and determined its prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing resection. Experimental Design: The SHI was analyzed in the training cohort of 188 HCC patients and in the validation cohort of 177 HCC patients. The <b>systemic</b> <b>immune-inflammation</b> <b>index</b> (SII) scores in the validation cohorts were also measured. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to explore the prediction accuracy in HCC patients. Results: An optimal cutoff point for the SHI of 2. 84 stratified the HCC patients into high SHI (> 2. 84) and low SHI (≤ 2. 84) groups in the training cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed the SHI was an independent predictor for overall survival and relapse-free survival, and prognostic for patients with negative α-fetoprotein and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 +A. The AUCs of the SHI for survival and recurrence were higher than other conventional clinical indices. Low SHI significantly correlated with vascular invasion. The SII scores were significantly higher in patients with low SHI compared with those with high SHI. HCC patients in SHI ≤ 2. 84 group had shorter recurrence time and lower survival rate than HCC patients in SHI > 2. 84 group. Conclusions: The SHI was a potential biomarker for assessing HCC prognosis, and improving SHI level in HCC patients may be a promising therapeutic strategy decision. The poor outcome in HCC patients with low SHI scores might increase SII scores, increasing the possibility of recurrence and metastasis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{elevated}} preoperative C-reactive protein/albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio {{has been}} reported to be associated with a poor prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the prognostic value of the preoperative CRP/Alb ratio and compare it with other systemic inflammatory response markers in patients with gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 455 patients with GC undergoing curative resection. We investigated the correlations between the preoperative CRP/Alb ratio and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to assess independent prognostic factors. The area under the curve was used to compare the prognostic value of different markers. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, the CRP/Alb ratio were independently associated with OS in patients with GC (hazard ratio: 1. 626; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 191 - 2. 219; P =. 002), along with age (P =. 003), preoperative body weight loss (P =. 001), tumor location (P =. 008), metastatic lymph node ratio (P <. 001), and seventh tumor-nodes-metastasis stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer) (P =. 007). However, several other systemic inflammation–based prognostic scores (neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, platelet lymphocyte ratio and <b>systemic</b> <b>immune-inflammation</b> <b>index,</b> Glasgow Prognostic Score, modified Glasgow prognostic score, and high-sensitivity modified Glasgow prognostic score) were not. In addition, the CRP/Alb ratio had a higher area under the curve value (0. 625) compared with several other systemic inflammation–based prognostic scores (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: The preoperative CRP/Alb ratio, a system inflammation-based prognostic score, is a superior predictor of OS in patients undergoing curative resection for GC and may help to identify the high-risk patients for treatment decisions...|$|E
40|$|Background: In this {{retrospective}} analysis, {{we explored}} the prognostic and predictive {{value of the}} <b>systemic</b> <b>immune-inflammation</b> <b>index</b> (SII), based on lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, at baseline and changes at week 6 during first-line sunitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC). Results: Patients were stratified into high SII (? 730) and low SII (< 730) groups. SII was associated with objective response, p < 0. 0001. The median PFS was 6. 3 months (95 % CI 5. 5 – 8. 9) in patients with SII ? 730 and 18. 7 months (95 % CI 14. 7 – 22. 8) in those with SII < 730, p < 0. 0001. The median OS was 43. 6 months (95 % CI 35. 3 – 52. 1) in patients with SII < 730, and 13. 5 months (95 % CI 9. 8 – 18. 5) in those with SII ? 730, p < 0. 0001. In multivariate analysis, performance status, IMDC score and SII were able to predict OS (HR = 3. 29, HR = 1. 71 and HR = 1. 79, respectively). Materials and Methods: We included 335 consecutive RCC patients treated with first-line sunitinib. The X-tile 3. 6. 1 software (Yale University, New Haven, CT) was used for bioinformatic {{analysis of the data}} to determine the cutoff value of SII. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and their 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared with logrank test. The impact of SII conversion at week 6 of treatment on PFS and OS was evaluated by Cox regression analyses. Conclusions: The SII and its changes during treatment represent a powerful prognostic indicator of clinical outcome in patients with metastatic RCC...|$|E
40|$|Background: A <b>systemic</b> <b>immune-inflammation</b> <b>index</b> (SII) {{based on}} {{neutrophil}} (N), lymphocyte (L), and platelet (P) counts {{has shown a}} prognostic impact in several solid tumors. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the prognostic role of SII in mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone post docetaxel. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone after docetaxel in our Institutions. X-tile 3. 6. 1 software, cut-off values of SII, NLR defined as N/L and PLR as P/L. Overall survival (OS) and their 95 % Confidence Intervals (95 % CI) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The impact of SII, PLR and NLR on OS was evaluated by Cox regression analyses and on PSA response rates were evaluated by binary logistic regression. Results: A total of 230 mCRPC patients treated abiraterone were included. SII ≥ 535, NLR ≥ 3 and PLR ≥ 210 were considered as elevated levels (high risk groups. The median OS was 17. 3 months, 21. 8 months in SII < 535 group and 14. 7 months in SII ≥ 535 (p < 0. 0001). At univariate analysis ECOG performance status, previous enzalutamide, visceral metastases, SII, NLR and PLR predicted OS. In multivariate analysis, ECOG performance status, previous enzalutamide, visceral metastases, SII and NLR remained significant predictors of OS (HR = 5. 08, p < 0. 0001; HR = 2. 12, p = 0. 009, HR = 1. 77, 95 % p = 0. 012; HR = 1. 80, p = 0. 002; and HR = 1. 90, p = 0. 001, respectively), whereas, PLR showed a borderline ability only (HR = 1. 41, p = 0. 068). Conclusion: SII and NLR might represent an early and easy prognostic marker in mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone. Further studies are needed to better define their impact and role in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There is {{increasing}} {{evidence that the}} existence of systemic inflammation response is correlated with poor prognosis in several solid tumors. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the association between <b>systemic</b> <b>immune-inflammation</b> <b>index</b> (SII) and therapy response and overall survival in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The prognostic values of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were also evaluated. Methods In total, 332 patients with new diagnosis of stage III NSCLC were included in this retrospective analysis. SII was defined as platelet counts × neutrophil counts/lymphocyte counts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the optimal cut-off value for SII, NLR, PLR and PNI. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis were performed to identify the factors correlated with overall survival. Results Applying cut-offs of ≥  660 (SII), ≥  3. 57 (NLR), ≥  147 (PLR), ≤  52. 95 (PNI), SII ≥  660 was significantly correlated with worse ECOG PS (<  0. 001), higher T stage (<  0. 001), advanced clinical stage (p =  0. 019), and lower response rate (p =  0. 018). In univariate analysis, SII ≥  660, NLR ≥  3. 57, PLR ≥  147, and PNI ≤  52. 95 were significantly associated with worse overall survival (p all <  0. 001). Patients with SII ≥  660 had a median overall survival of 10  months, and patients with SII <  660 showed a median overall survival of 30  months. In multivariate analysis only ECOG PS (HR, 1. 744; 95 % CI 1. 158 – 2. 626; p =  0. 008), T stage (HR, 1. 332; 95 % CI 1. 032 – 1. 718; p =  0. 028), N stage (HR, 1. 848; 95 % CI 1. 113 – 3. 068; p =  0. 018), SII (HR, 2. 105; 95 % CI 1. 481 – 2. 741; p <  0. 001) and NLR ≥  3. 57 (HR, 1. 934; 95 % CI 1. 448 – 2. 585; p <  0. 001) were independently correlated with overall survival. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the SII is an independent prognostic indicator of poor outcomes for patients with stage III NSCLC and is superior to other inflammation-based factors in terms of prognostic ability...|$|E
