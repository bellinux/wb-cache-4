50|$|There {{are three}} basic methods walls control water intrusion: {{moisture}} storage, drained cladding, or face-sealed cladding. Moisture storage {{is typical of}} stone and brick mass-wall buildings where moisture is absorbed and released by {{the walls of the}} structure itself. Drained cladding also known as screened walls acknowledges moisture will penetrate the cladding so a moisture barrier such as housewrap or felt paper inside the cladding provides a second line of defense and sometimes a drainage plane or air gap allows a path for the moisture to drain down through and exit the wall. Sometimes ventilation is provided in addition to the drainage plane such as in rainscreen construction. Face-sealed also called barrier wall or perfect barrier cladding relies on maintaining a leak-free surface of the cladding. Examples of face sealed cladding are the early exterior insulation finishing systems, <b>structural</b> <b>glazing,</b> metal clad panels, and corrugated metal.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{is one of}} the greatest sources of pollution because of the high level of energy consumption during its life cycle. In addition to using energy while constructing a building, several systems also use power while the building is operating, especially the air-conditioning system. Energy consumption for this system is related, among other issues, to external air temperature and the required internal temperature of the building. The facades are elements which present the highest level of ambient heat transfer from the outside to the inside of tall buildings. Thus, the type of facade has an influence on energy consumption during the building life cycle and, consequently, contributes to buildings' CO 2 emissions, because these emissions are directly connected to energy consumption. Therefore, the aim is to help develop a methodology for evaluating CO 2 emissions generated during the life cycle of office building facades. The results, based on the parameters used in this study, show that facades using <b>structural</b> <b>glazing</b> and uncolored glass emit the most CO 2 throughout their life cycle, followed by brick facades covered with compound aluminum panels or ACM (Aluminum Composite Material), facades using <b>structural</b> <b>glazing</b> and reflective glass and brick facades with plaster coating. On the other hand, the typology of facade that emits less CO 2 is brickwork and mortar because its thermal barrier is better than <b>structural</b> <b>glazing</b> facade and materials used to produce this facade are better than brickwork and ACM. Finally, an uncertainty analysis was conducted to verify the accuracy of the results attained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. FAPESPFAPES...|$|E

The design focuses on the replacement of the glass floors of the Acropolis Museum in Athens with an aim to a) reduce material consumption, b) eliminate the supporting substructure and c) propose an optimised design. 7 different core topologies are designed and tested by means of a 4 -point bending test in a way to assess the optical quality of such structures, showcase their potential and finally assess which configuration is the most suitable to be used in the aforementioned application. The topology that fulfills the structural and aesthetical requirements is furtherly investigated and its structural behaviour is “deconstructed”.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, {{there was a}} quiet {{revolution}} {{in the way that}} glass was employed in architecture as a structural material. This increased experimentation in the application of glass was not limited to the building skin, but increasingly extended to frameless glazing and, ultimately, to <b>structural</b> <b>glazing</b> with no support at all other than the assembled laminations of glass itself held in place with structural silicone. At the forefront of these innovative approaches to the use of glass as a structural element was the structural engineer Tim Macfarlane. The evolution of Macfarlane’s work with structural glass can be understood through a series of key projects built at variety of scales {{with some of the most}} technically challenging projects the seemingly ‘modest’ architectural set pieces of a staircase, lean-to or entrance canopy. Macfarlane was not working from a code of practice, which did not exist and innovation was incremental, with each project exploring and pushing at the known limits of glass as a structural material. Macfarlane wanted to establish “… An engineering practice that set out to realize architectural ideas … to facilitate an architects composition, structurally so that it fitted and suited what could be made. ” The paper will explore the key technical innovations made through the production of prototypes and projects in partnership with architects and specialist fabricators (1990 – 1999). Macfarlane’s work has been documented through individual published projects with one of the few comprehensive accounts of this work presented by Macfarlane himself at the ‘Glass in Buildings’ conference in 1999. I have recently interviewed Tim Macfarlane and I will be drawing on those discussions to identify the specific technical innovations, which enabled such incredible structural developments in the use of glass.

40|$|In {{structural}} design, ductile {{materials are}} usually preferred, because failure is rarely sudden and catastrophic. Once the material has yielded, large observable strains will occur before total {{collapse of a}} structure. This thesis is about the structural use of glass. Glass {{is probably the most}} perfectly brittle material that exists. It demonstrates linear elastic behaviour right up to the point of failure. When a piece of glass fails, this always happens suddenly, by the high-speed propagation of a crack through the entire element. If glass is so different from the most common primary structural materials namely steel and reinforced concrete, then should we be using the same basic design approach for both? This thesis reviews current design methods tracing their development through this century. Current code formers are keen to bring all materials under the umbrella of Limit State Design. This philosophy has been developed for ductile materials and is shown to be somewhat inappropriate for materials where the main design criterion is not ultimate strength. A further chapter looks as the statistical behaviour of multi-ply beams. This was highlighted, at the recent Glass in Buildings conference, as being an important area for further research. It has been shown that statistically two or more beams are always better than one of equivalent thickness. A method of reducing the thickness of a glass beam, without affecting its probability of failure, has been described. This could have significant cost implications in the design of glass beams. It should be noted that this thesis is not about face-loaded glass elements such as windowpanes or <b>structural</b> <b>glazing,</b> where designs are governed by deflection and generally executed using rules of thumb, but about edge-loaded elements where strength governs and more rigorous design rules are required...|$|E

First floor therefore builds up the smallest possible surface area of the ring and each higher floor is increased according to the need of the philharmonic, especially so the floor area suffises to the big amount of dressing rooms and rehearsal. The total cubic capacity of the object is almost minimalist, a concert hall and other necessary equipment is designed in the lower limit of the minimum dimensions.

The {{aim is to}} accomplish an optimal development of designed area, especially {{the best use of}} new structures located in newly established visitors sector (visitors centre, exhibition centre, show- and sales room, coffee house with platform, related horticulture, technical and sanitary background, labyrinth, water basins). The first way to optimal use of designed area is closing the current entry to Garden and creating new entries to foreground and Gardens, together with a primary segmentation of the area with the aid of two major axes, which form leading paths and concur to possible access roads to foreground. Polygonal rendering of new horizontal structures connects green roofs of buildings to surrounding areas and opens the green roofs to visitors, simplifies their orientation in the Garden and offers them an all-around view. The main elements of designed area are polygonal segmentation of territory as a counterpart to the Garden on the one hand, and creation of new modern garden on grassed area, which is completed with above mentioned water basins, on the other hand. In the visitors sector, there are located necessary facilities for visitors (foyer, salesroom for tickets, WC, information centre with bookstore, technical background for employees).

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The {{increase}} of explosions threats toward civilian targets has {{raised concerns about}} a building's safety. Laminated glass (LG) {{is one of the}} widely used structural elements in building envelope where safety performance is highly required where the major threat of death and injuries comes from the flying glass fragments. Laminated glass can greatly reduce the hazard of flying shards by holding the fragments of the glass bonded to the polymeric interlayer which works as continuous membrane attached to the supporting frame and dissipates a great amount of cracking energy when the glass cracks due to blast loads. Recently, the blast-resistant glazing research has been improved broadly, but still few areas remain unexplored related to resistance function and blast response of the window system including new interlayer materials such as UVEKOL-S. This research develops finite element (FE) modeling using LS-DYNA software to study the response of LG windows and curtain walls to blast loads, the effect of the negative phase of the blast wave, and the dynamic reactions transmitted to the window frame and supporting structure. The dynamic response in terms of center deflection and dynamic reactions of the model were compared against those measured in blast testing and showed good agreement. But, after the point of glass failure, a difference in frequency response between the experimental results and LS-DYNA model were seen. This {{can be attributed to the}} random crack patterns and the lack of the exact dynamic properties of the post-cracked phase of the laminated glass panel. The static behavior of the polymer interlayer before and after breakage of the glass layers was investigated under quasi-static loading. Constitutive relations of virgin and extracted polyvinyl butyral (PVB) and UVEKOL-S extracted from laminated glass panels were evaluated, including the energy absorption capabilities for each material. Also, the post-breakage behavior of laminated glass was investigated. The experimental results of scored tensile samples carried out on UVEKOL-S glass laminates using different numbers of scores are presented, discussed, and compared with the results of the PVB glass laminates. The energy absorption of the PVB glass interlayer was found to be larger than that of the UVEKOL-S interlayer. From the scored tensile tests, it was concluded that the adhesion of PVB to glass panes is stronger compared with the adhesion of UVEKOL-S to glass panes. Conversely, it was found that this stronger bond led to premature tearing of the PVB interlayer when compared with UVEKOL-S, which allowed relative slip, leading to reduced tearing initiation. In this research, the dynamic constitutive behavior of virgin PVB and PVB and UVEKOL-S extracted from laminated glass panels were evaluated at an average strain rate of 30 - 40 s- 1 using an impact drop-weight apparatus. A new technique was used to investigate the exact mechanical proprieties of PVB and UVEKOL-S before and after the breakage of the laminated glass, including the energy absorption capabilities for each material. The results show that both PVB and UVEKOL-S, at strain rates of 30 - 40 s- 1 had an initial rise in strength, but after the maximum stress point both materials followed a noticeable difference in their response to failure. Comparing the high strain results with the static ones, they show that the dynamic loading significantly affects the material response and the energy absorption characteristics of the interlayer materials. Sufficient data was obtained from the tests to evaluate alternative approaches to modeling PVB and UVEKOL-S materials in a real blast event. In this research, experimental studies have been carried out to investigate the stress wave generation using a piston impact on fluid inside a tube attached to a fluid chamber to produce impulsive loads which are uniformly distributed over the test panels. Experimental shock wave simulation results for laminated glass panels validated the effectiveness of the system to produce a blast impulse with specific characteristics. Different blast wave and impulsive profiles were obtained using this blast simulator apparatus, which is neither expensive nor complex, to test small scale samples including laminated glass panels and aluminum cladding. Also this apparatus was used to investigate the initial speed of the glass splinters flying from the tested laminated glass samples using a high speed camera. Additionally, this research focuses on numerically and experimentally evaluating the resistance function of UVEKOL-S and PVB LG panes, including the <b>structural</b> <b>glazing</b> tape (SGT), silicon, or non-structural glazing tape (NSGT) as a glazing support to the surrounding frame. The resistance function must be obtained under uniform pressure (since the blast load is generally uniform). In this research, finite element program, LS-DYNA, was used to stablish and investigate the resistance function of cracked LG panes, which is contributed by the membrane resistance of the polymeric interlayer, which will be used in the SDOF idealization and dynamic analysis of window systems. A full-scale vacuum chamber and a small-scale water chamber were used to apply static uniform pressure on the LG panes to develop load-deformation failure relationships for LG panes. The results were used to improve the existing SDOF systems used for the design of blast resistant windows. The dynamic responses for two blast experiments using a shock tube were compared to the SDOF and WINGARD results to identify the accuracy of this method in designing LG window systems. Findings indicate that the SDOF results compared well with those obtained from the shock tube blast tests, and hence it can improve the abilities of engineers to better design LG panes under blast loads...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an advanced engineering evaluation using nonlinear analysis of hyperelastic material that provides significant improvement to <b>structural</b> silicone <b>glazing</b> (SSG) design in high performance curtain wall systems. Very high cladding wind pressures required in hurricane zones often result in bulky SSG profile dimensions. Architectural desire for aesthetically slender curtain wall framing sight-lines {{in combination with}} a desire to reduce aluminum usage led to optimization of silicone material geometry for better stress distribution. To accomplish accurate simulation of predicted behavior under structural load, robust stress-strain curves of the silicone material are essential. Physical property testing was provided by the silicone manufacturer via specialized laboratory protocol. A series of rigorous curve fit techniques were then made to closely model test data in the finite element computer analysis that accounts for nonlinear strain of hyperelastic silicone...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany {{substrates}} do {{not sustain}} the conventional glazing process (i. e., vitreous glazing) {{due to the}} relatively high temperature required by this treatment (i. e., up to 1400 °C in some cases) to fuse glazes after their application on the surface to be covered. Thermal spraying could appear {{as a solution to}} circumvent this limitation and to avoid the thermal decomposition of the substrates. This contribution describes some <b>structural</b> attributes of <b>glaze</b> coatings manufactured by flame spraying. It also discusses the influence of the feedstock powder morphology and some of its physical properties on the coating characteristics...|$|R

[...] They spread their school buildings out into multiple wings with large aluminum awning windows for light and ventilation [...] And they used such [...] "cool" [...] structural elements as pre-stressed concrete beams and interior walls of <b>glazed</b> <b>structural</b> clay tile—novel and inexpensive applications at the time, especially in Texas. The name of the school, stated in Neutra's iconic aluminum letters floating on a plain brick wall, was typically the only architectural decoration.|$|R
