25|$|People with A-T have {{a highly}} {{increased}} incidence (approximately 25% lifetime risk) of cancers, particularly lymphomas and leukemia, but other cancers can occur. When possible, treatment should avoid {{the use of}} radiation therapy and chemotherapy drugs that work {{in a way that}} is similar to radiation therapy (radiomimetic drugs), as these are particularly toxic for people with A-T. The special problems of managing cancer are sufficiently complicated that treatment should be done only in academic oncology centers and after consultation with physicians who have <b>specific</b> <b>expertise</b> in A-T. Unfortunately, there is no way to predict which individuals will develop cancer. Because leukemia and lymphomas differ from solid tumors in not progressing from solitary to metastatic stages, there is less need to diagnose them early in their appearance. Surveillance for leukemia and lymphoma is thus not helpful, other than considering cancer as a diagnostic possibility whenever possible symptoms of cancer (e.g. persistent swollen lymph glands, unexplained fever) arise.|$|E

2500|$|Citywide {{budget cuts}} in the early 1990s, however, {{resulted}} in attrition of the park's routine maintenance staff, and the conservancy began hiring staff to replace these workers. Management of the restored landscapes by the conservancy's [...] "zone gardeners" [...] proved so successful that core maintenance and operations staff were reorganized in 1996. The zone-based system of management was implemented throughout the park, which was divided into 49 zones. Zone gardeners supervise volunteers assigned to them; these volunteers commit to a consistent work schedule and are supported by specialized crews in areas of maintenance requiring <b>specific</b> <b>expertise</b> or equipment, or more effectively conducted on a park-wide basis.

2500|$|In January 1989 Robert Hood was {{appointed}} to lead McDonnell Douglas, replacing retiring Worsham.

TQMS ended the functional setup where engineers with <b>specific</b> <b>expertise</b> in aerodynamics, structural mechanics, materials, and other technical areas worked on several different aircraft. This {{was replaced by a}} product-oriented system where they focus on one specific airplane. As part of reorganization, 5,000 managerial and supervisory positions were eliminated at Douglas. The former managers could apply for 2,800 newly created posts; the remaining 2,200 would lose their managerial responsibilities. [...] The reorganization reportedly led to widespread loss of morale at the company and TQMS was nicknamed [...] "Time to [...] Quit and Move to Seattle" [...] by employees referring to the competitor Boeing headquartered in Seattle, WA.|$|E
2500|$|Hedge funds {{share many}} of the same types of risk as other {{investment}} classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk. Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money. Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds. As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager [...] "drifting" [...] away from an area of <b>specific</b> <b>expertise,</b> manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk. Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate; capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds. These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, restrictions on allocation of funds, and set exposure limits for strategies.|$|E

40|$|Integrating {{multiple}} fuzzy {{expert systems}} under restricting requirements Integrace mnohonásobných fuzzy expertních systémů za omezujících podmínek S. ALY, I. VRANA Czech University of Agriculture, Prague, Czech Republic Abstract: The multiple, different and <b>specific</b> <b>expertises</b> are often needed in making YES-or-NO (YES/NO) decisions for treating {{a variety of}} business, economic, and agricultural decision problems. This {{is due to the}} nature of such problems in which decisions are influenced by multiple factors, and accordingly multiple corresponding expertises are required. Fuzzy expert systems (FESs) are widely used to model expertise due to its capability to model real world values which are not always exact, but frequently vague, or uncertain. In addition, they are able to incorporate qualitative factors. The problem of integrating multiple fuzzy expert systems involves several independent and autonomous fuzzy expert systems arranged synergistically to suit a varying problem context. Every expert system participates in judging the problem based on a predefined match between problem context and the required <b>specific</b> <b>expertises.</b> In this research, multiple FESs are integrated through combining their crisp numerical outputs, which reflect the degree of bias to the Yes/No subjective answers. The reasons for independency can be related to maintainability, decision responsibility, analyzability, knowledge cohesion and modularity, context flexibility, sensitivity of aggregate knowledge, decision consistency, etc. This article presents simple algorithms to integrate multiple parallel FES under specific requirements: preserving the extreme crisp output values, providing for null or non-participating expertises, and considering decision-related expert systems, which are true requirements of a currently held project. The presented results provides a theoretical framework, which can bring advantage to decision making is many disciplines, as e. g. new product launching decision, food quality tracking, monitoring of suspicious deviation of the business processes from the standard performance, tax and customs declaration issues, control and logistic of food chains/networks, etc...|$|R

The aporetic yet indispensable opposition and ambivalence of beauty and ugliness, youth and old age, smile and tears, permeates his figurative language, both in his writings and drawings, giving his reflections on the ethical and political problems and contradictions of Renaissance society a mocking and bitter outcome...|$|R
