Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Scott.</b> [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way I was ever going to learn to surf – no way!

[...] "Archbishop King," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Scott,</b> [...] "would have hardly otherwise ventured {{to mention it}} to Swift in his letter of Jan. 9, 1710, as 'a wound given in the dark.'"

5000|$|Meggett and Scott again {{split time}} as the number-one back during the 2010 season. Head coach Friedgen said, [...] "At this point in time, I would <b>say</b> <b>Scott</b> and Meggett are 1A and 1B." [...] He saw action in all 13 games and {{recorded}} 720 yards on 126 carries and four touchdowns. In the season opener against Navy, Meggett rushed eight times for a career-high 105 yards, including a career-long 67-yard run, and one touchdown. Meggett extended his career-long against Florida International with a 76-yard touchdown run to ensure a Maryland victory. Against Duke, Meggett had 18 carries for 57 yards, including a three-yard touchdown run. Against Wake Forest, Meggett rushed for 94 yards and a touchdown.|$|R
6000|$|Your note arrived; little profit, I must <b>say.</b> <b>Scott</b> {{has already}} put his nose in, in St. Ives, sir; but his {{appearance}} {{is not yet}} complete; nothing is in that romance, except the story.

My hand is a thing that was, and in the meanwhile so are my brains. And here, in the very midst, comes a plausible scheme to make Vailima pay, which will perhaps let me into considerable expense just when I don't want it.

6000|$|Concerning these heroes, Scotland has {{a vision}} of her own, and no man must undo it; no man must tell, about Knox, facts ignored by Professors of Church History. Indeed, to study Knox afresh demands {{research}} for which Stevenson had not the opportunity. The Covenanting side of his nature appeared {{in his study of}} the moral aspect of Burns; his feet of clay. It is agreed that we must veil the feet of clay. As Lockhart <b>says,</b> <b>Scott</b> infuriated Mr. Alexander Peterkin by remarking that Burns [...] "was not chivalrous." [...] Stevenson went further, and annoyed the Peterkins of his day. His task required courage: it was not found wanting.|$|E

In various places in his correspondence Swift criticises the failings of Dr. Anthony Raymond, who was, <b>says</b> <b>Scott,</b> [...] "a particular friend." [...] His unreliability in money matters, the improvidence of his large family, his peculiarities in grammar, his {{pride in his}} good manners, all these points are noticed in the journal and elsewhere. But when Dr. Raymond returned to Ireland after a visit to London, Swift felt a little melancholy, and regretted {{that he had not}} seen more of him. In July 1713 Raymond was presented to the Crown living of Moyenet.|$|E

By about 1574 his descendant, Sir Richard Maitland, was consoled for his family misfortunes (his famous son, Lethington, having died after the long siege of Edinburgh Castle, which he and Kirkcaldy of Grange held for Queen Mary), by a poet who reminded him that his ancestor, in the thirteenth century, lost all his sons--"peerless pearls"--save one, [...] "Burdallane."

6000|$|Several {{authentic}} stone crannogs in Scotland, as {{to which}} we have information, possessed no central pole, but had a stone causeway, still extant, leading, e.g. from the crannog to {{the shore of the}} Ashgrove loch, [...] "a causeway of rough blocks of sandstone slabs." [...] {47b} If one stone crannog had a stone causeway, why should this ancient inhabited cairn or round tower not possess a stone causeway? Though useless at high water, at low water it would afford better going. In a note to Ivanhoe, and in his Northern tour of 1814, Scott describes a stone causeway to a broch on an artificial island in Loch Cleik-him-in, near Lerwick. Now this loch, <b>says</b> <b>Scott,</b> was, at the time when the broch was inhabited, open to the flow of tide water.|$|E

6000|$|In {{spite of}} all these {{attempts}} to bolster up a tottering throne and an effete faith, the Revolution came, and Dryden's hopes and prospects sank like {{a vision of the}} night. And now came the hour of his enemies' revenge! How the Settles, the Shadwells, and the Ravenscrofts, rejoiced at the downfall of their great foe! and what ironical condolence, or bitter satirical exultation, they poured over his humiliation! And, worst of all, he durst not reply. [...] "His powers of satire," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Scott,</b> [...] "at this period, were of no more use to Dryden than a sword to a man who cannot draw it." [...] The fate of Milton in miniature had now befallen him; and it says much for the strength of his mind, that, as in Milton's case, Dryden's purest and best titles to fame date from his discomfiture and degradation. Antæus-like, he had now reached the ground, and the touch of the ground to him, as to all giants, was inspiration.|$|E
6000|$|Such is the [...] "Romance of the Forest," [...] {{a fiction}} in which {{character}} is subordinate to plot and incident. There {{is an attempt}} at character drawing in La Motte, and in his wife; the hero and heroine are not distinguishable from Julia and Hippolytus. But Mrs. Radcliffe does not aim at psychological niceties, and we must not blame her for withholding what it was no part of her purpose to give. [...] "The Romance of the Forest" [...] was, so far, infinitely the most thrilling of modern English works of fiction. [...] "Every reader felt the force," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Scott,</b> [...] "from the sage in his study, to the family group in middle life," [...] and nobody felt it more than Scott himself, then a young gentleman of nineteen, who, when asked how his time was employed, answered, [...] "I read no Civil Law."

6000|$|Shortly after, Dryden {{obtained}} a Westminster scholarship, {{and on the}} 11th of May 1650, entered on Trinity College, Cambridge. His tutor was one John Templer, famous then {{as one of the}} many who had attempted to put a hook in the jaws of old Hobbes, the Leviathan of his time, but whose reply, as well as Hobbes' own book (like a whale disappearing from a Shetland [...] "voe" [...] into the deep, with all the hooks and harpoons of his enemies along with him) has been almost entirely forgotten. At Cambridge, Dryden was noted for regularity and diligence, and took the degree of B.A. in January 1653-4, and in 1657 was made A.M. by a dispensation from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Once, indeed, he was rusticated for a fortnight on account of some disobedience to the vice-master. He resided, however, at his university three years after the usual term; and although he did not become a Fellow, and made no secret, in after days, of preferring Oxford to Cambridge, yet the reason of this seems to have lain, not in any personal disgust, but in some other cause, which, <b>says</b> <b>Scott,</b> [...] "we may now search for in vain." ...|$|E
