40|$|Imidacloprid is a {{systemic}} insecticide effective in controlling the exotic pest Adelges tsugae (hemlock woolly adelgid) in eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) trees. Concerns o ver imidacloprid impacts on nontarget species hav e {{limited its application}} in southern Appalachian ecosystems. We quantified the movement and adsorption of imidacloprid in forest soils after soil injection in two sites at Co weeta Hydrologic Laboratory in w estern North Carolina. Soils differed in profile depth, total carbon and nitrogen content, and eff ective cation ex change capacity. We injected imidacloprid 5 cm into mineral soil, 1. 5 m from infested trees, using a Kioritz <b>soil</b> <b>injector.</b> We tracked the horizontal and vertical movement of imidacloprid b y collecting soil solution and soil samples at 1 m, 2 m, and at the drip line from each tree periodically for 1 yr. Soil solution was collected 20 cm below the surface and just above the saprolite, and acetonitrile-extractable imidacloprid was determined thr ough the profile. Soil solution and extractable imidacloprid concentrations w ere determined by high-performance liquid chr omatography. Soil solution and extractable imidacloprid concentrations w ere greater in the site with greater soil organic matter. Imidacloprid moved vertically and horizontally in both sites; concentrations generally declined downward in the soil profile, but preferential flow paths allowed rapid v ertical movement. Horizontal movement was limited, and imidacloprid did not mo ve to the tr ee drip line. We found a negative relationship between adsorbed imidacloprid concentrations and soil micr oarthropod populations largely in the low-organic-matter site; ho wever, population counts w ere similar to other studies at Coweeta...|$|E
40|$|Two {{groups of}} hemlock trees {{were treated with}} {{imidacloprid}} using Kioritz ® <b>soil</b> <b>injectors</b> and one group of trees with Mauget stem injection capsules from 2001 to 2003. In one group of soil injected trees the density of HWA was reduced by 35 %, 14 months after the first application and {{two months after the}} second application. Tree health declined in all years {{but not as much as}} for treated trees in this group. HWA density was reduced by 52 % in a second group of soil injected trees, three months after the first treatment and 93 % one year after the second treatment. Tree health remained unchanged for three years for all trees, treated and untreated. Stem-injected trees showed a 52 % reduction in HWA three months after the first treatment and an 87 % reduction one year after the second injection. Tree health of these trees did not change and were no different that the untreated trees. Both groups of trees (soil injected and stem injected) had similar health indices, and both treatment methods are providing a similar protection from HWA. Treated trees were located more than 50 m from a stream or the lake. Imidacloprid was detected in lake and spring water in concentrations ranging from less than 0. 02 ppb to 1. 7 ppb in lake water and 3. 5 ppb in spring water. The density of invertebrates in the springs did not change from 2001 – 2003. However, caution must be used when applying imidacloprid near waterways, especially in rocky well-drained soil.

40|$|Inadequate oxygen {{concentration}} in the root zone is a constraint to plant performance. The air injection in the soil throughout an irrigation system {{is an attempt to}} improve the crop yield capacity of the soils with problems of anoxia, such as heavy and/or saline <b>soils.</b> A particular <b>injector</b> (a venturi), the AirJection® Mazzei, injects micro bubbles of air in a subsurface drip irrigation SDI system. To verify the applicability of this technology to the asparagus plants, cultivated in heavy soils, a subsurface drip irrigation systems has been installed in a field with two years old asparagus crops. The first data observed in 2004 - 2005 show that the positive effect on the asparagus crop production may be found especially in lack oxygen condition (compacted and crusted soils), more evident in the experimental fields with air injector placed {{at the beginning of the}} tapes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate, at various soil water contents, the tillage effects of two {{different}} types of <b>injectors</b> on <b>soil</b> hydraulic properties of a loamy clay soil located in Winchester, Ontario, Canada. The two injectors considered are the AerWay SSD (A) and the Kongskilde Vibro-Flex (K). The soil-properties changes associated with the injectors were assessed at ten different soil water contents for both injectors. The first part of this research involves the evaluation of field saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs), matrix flux potential (&phis;m), bulk density (rhob) and volumetric water content (theta) for undisturbed soil (U) and for <b>soil</b> disturbed by <b>injector</b> (D). The field saturated hydraulic conductivities measured on disturbed soil for the Kongskilde (DK) were in 80 % of the cases lower than those measured on undisturbed soil (UK). In contrast, Kfs measured on disturbed soil for the AerWay (DA) were higher in 90 % of the cases. These results indicate that the Kongskilde reduces the infiltration capacity of the soil, which may be the result of reduced effective porosity via the smearing of the soil surface. They also indicate that the AerWay is facilitating infiltration, most likely by fracturing the soil surface. The second part of this study involves a dye tracer experiment conducted on disturbed soil to evaluate the movement pathways of water through soil. In contrast to the AerWay, no relation could be established between liquid transport variables and the water content at which the Kongskilde was run. Greatest depths of penetration observed for the AerWay treatment occurred at run average water contents above 29. 7 % vol. and below 19. 7 % vol. Sorptive capacity of the upper layers was maximized when soil water contents were between 21. 7 % vol. and 31. 3 % vol...|$|R
