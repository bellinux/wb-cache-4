50|$|The <b>speckled</b> <b>sandperch</b> is a {{predator}} and feeds on small crustaceans and other invertebrates, also taking small fish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>speckled</b> <b>sandperch</b> {{is found}} in shallow waters {{on the east coast}} of Africa as far south as Natal, the Red Sea and the western Indo-Pacific. Its range extends as far east as Sumatra, and {{includes}} the Maldives, the Laccadives and Sri Lanka. The type location is the Red Sea. Although its range was originally thought to extend as far east as Fiji, three new species of Parapercis were recognised in 2007 based on their number of fin rays, their colouration and markings, and the location and number of spots on their anal fins; Parapercis pacifica occurs from southern Japan to the Timor Sea, Parapercis queenslandica from northern Australia, and Parapercis xanthogramma from Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa. The <b>speckled</b> <b>sandperch</b> generally occurs on sandy or rubble substrates in areas sheltered by reefs.|$|E
50|$|Parapercis hexophtalma, the <b>speckled</b> <b>sandperch,</b> is {{a species}} of marine bony fish in the family Pinguipedidae, found in the western Indo-Pacific Ocean. It was first {{described}} by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1829. There are several synonyms, some of which represent misspellings of the original name, and others which were given to female fish, at the time {{thought to be a}} separate species.|$|E
50|$|Several {{members of}} the Pinguipedidae family are protogynous hermaphrodites, {{starting}} their adult life as females and changing sex to males later, {{and this is the}} case with the <b>speckled</b> <b>sandperch.</b> Not only do the fish change sex, but they also change their markings at the same time. The sexual inversion occurs at a length of about 18 cm. Male fish are territorial and defend a harem of females. The eggs are planktonic and larval development takes place during one to two months.|$|E
50|$|The <b>speckled</b> <b>sandperch</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} around 28 cm and is about five times {{as long as the}} body is deep. The {{anterior}} (front) end of the body is cylindrical and the posterior end is somewhat flattened. The eyes are rather close together {{on the top of the}} head and the fish rests on the seabed, propping itself up with its widely separated pelvic fins.The dorsal fin has five spines and 21 or 22 soft rays, and the anal fin has a single spine and 17 or 18 soft rays.|$|E
