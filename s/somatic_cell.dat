5|$|Various {{specific}} cases of animal testing have drawn attention, including both instances of beneficial scientific research, and instances of alleged ethical violations by those performing the tests. The fundamental properties of muscle physiology were determined with work done using frog muscles (including the force generating mechanism of all muscle, the length-tension relationship, and the force-velocity curve), and frogs {{are still the}} preferred model organism due to the long survival of muscles in vitro {{and the possibility of}} isolating intact single-fiber preparations (not possible in other organisms). Modern physical therapy and the understanding and treatment of muscular disorders is based on this work and subsequent work in mice (often engineered to express disease states such as muscular dystrophy). In February 1997 a team at the Roslin Institute in Scotland announced the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult <b>somatic</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} {{and distribution}} of gonial and <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in the ovary of Dermatobia hominis was studied during the 3 rd larval instar. In larvae weighing between 400 and 500 mg, the ovary is partially divided into basal and apical regions by oblong <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> that penetrate from the periphery; these cells show ovoid nucleus and cytoplasm full of microtubules. In both regions, gonial cells with regular outlines, large nucleus and low electron-density cytoplasm are scattered among the interstitial <b>somatic</b> <b>cells.</b> These later cells have small nucleus and electrodense cytoplasm. Clear <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> with small nucleus and cytoplasm of very low electron-density are restrict to the apical region of the gonad.

25|$|In <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear {{transfer}} ("SCNT"), {{the nucleus of}} a <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> is taken from a donor and transplanted into a host egg cell, which had its own genetic material removed previously, making it an enucleated egg. After the donor <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> genetic material is transferred into the host oocyte with a micropipette, the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> genetic material is fused with the egg using an electric current. Once the two cells have fused, the new cell can be permitted to grow in a surrogate or artificially.

25|$|The {{process of}} <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (<b>Somatic</b> <b>Cell</b> Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a <b>somatic</b> <b>cell,</b> referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> and an unnucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning {{or in the case of}} reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason why}} SCNT {{is used for}} cloning is because somatic cells can be easily {{acquired}} and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point {{to remember is that}} cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor’s <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> nucleus.

40|$|The {{germline}} of Caenorhabditis elegans is {{a well-established}} model for DNA damage response (DDR) studies. However, the molecular {{basis of the}} observed cell death resistance in the soma of these animals remains unknown. We established a set of techniques to study ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage generation and DDR activation in a whole intact worm. Our single-cell analyses reveal that, although germline and <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> show similar levels of inflicted DNA damage, <b>somatic</b> <b>cells,</b> differently from germline cells, do not activate the crucial apical DDR kinase ataxia-telengiectasia mutated (ATM). We also show that DDR signaling proteins are undetectable in all <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> and {{this is due to}} transcriptional repression. However, DNA repair genes are expressed and <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> retain the ability to efficiently repair DNA damage. Finally, we demonstrate that germline cells, when induced to transdifferentiate into <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> within the gonad, lose the ability to activate ATM. Overall, these observations provide a molecular mechanism for the known, but hitherto unexplained, resistance to DNA damage-induced cell death in C. elegans <b>somatic</b> <b>cells.</b> We propose that the observed lack of signaling and cell death but retention of DNA repair functions in the soma is a Caenorhabditis-specific evolutionary-selected strategy to cope with its lack of adult <b>somatic</b> stem <b>cell</b> pools and regenerative capacity.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} oocyte develops {{within a}} complex of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> known as a follicle, within which signals from the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> regulate the oocyte, and signals from the oocyte regulate the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells.</b> Because isolation of the oocyte from the follicle disrupts these communication pathways, oocyte physiology is best studied within an intact follicle.

40|$|Mammalian oocytes {{are arrested}} in meiotic {{prophase}} by an inhibitory {{signal from the}} surrounding <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in the ovarian follicle. In response to luteinizing hormone (LH), which binds to receptors on the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells,</b> the oocyte proceeds to second metaphase, {{where it can be}} fertilized. Here we investigate how the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> regulate the prophase-to-metaphase transition in the oocyte, and show that the inhibitory signal from the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> is cGMP. Using FRET-based cyclic nucleotide sensors in follicle-enclosed mouse oocytes, we find that cGMP passes through gap junctions into the oocyte, where it inhibits the hydrolysis of cAMP by the phosphodiesterase PDE 3 A. This inhibition maintains a high concentration of cAMP and thus blocks meiotic progression. LH reverses the inhibitory signal by lowering cGMP levels in the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> (from ∼ 2 μM to ∼ 80 nM at 1 hour after LH stimulation) and by closing gap junctions between the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells.</b> The resulting decrease in oocyte cGMP (from ∼ 1 μM to ∼ 40 nM) relieves the inhibition of PDE 3 A, increasing its activity by ∼ 5 -fold.

The detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) revealed a differentiated distribution of ROS in the different cell types.
