40|$|Introduction Anisotropic {{diffusion}} is {{a common}} physical phenomenon describing processes where the diffusion of some scalar quantity is directionally dependent. Anisotropic diffusive processes include Darcy’s flow for porous media, large scale turbulence where turbulence scales are anisotropic in size and heat conduction and momentum dissipation in fusion plasmas. Given {{the high level of}} anisotropy in tokamak plasmas, a numerical approximation may introduce large perpendicular errors if the magnetic field direction is strongly misaligned with the grid. Here, misaligned means that the directions of diffusion are not aligned with the grid points. Problems that may arise with highly anisotropic diffusion problems on non-aligned meshes are in general; significant numerical diffusion perpendicular to the magnetic field lines due to grid misalignment (<b>see</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Umansky et al[1]), non-positivity near high gradients (<b>see</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Sharma et al[2]), mesh locking, stagnation of convergence dependent on anisotropy (<b>see</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Babuška and Suri[3]), convergence loss in case of variable diffusion tensor (<b>see</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Günter et al[4]).

40|$|One of {{the common}} aims of {{behavioral}} research is to reveal the pattern present in three-way three-mode data. Research in emotion psychology, for example, tries to account systematically for individual differences in the emotions that people experience in specific situations (<b>see,</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Kuppens, Van Mechelen, & Rijmen, 2008). In the field of behavioral decision making and consumer psychology, researchers aim to disclose how the profile of different purchasing behaviors over brands may differ between individuals (<b>see,</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Wood, 2004) or how per-sonal characteristics may influence situation-dependent buyer behavior (<b>see,</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Belk, 1974). In many fields outside psychology, such as chemical research, three-way three-mode data are also gathered and analyzed (<b>see,</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Smilde, Bro, & Geladi, 2004). Three-mode component analysis techniques can be very useful for analyzing three-way three-mode data (for an introduction and some applications, see Kroonenberg, 2008). As three-mode generalizations of standard princi-pal component analysis (PCA; Hotelling, 1933; Pearson, 1901), these techniques summarize the data by reducing its three modes to a few components and defining a linking structure among the three sets of components. A popular and well-known three-mode component analysis technique is PARAFAC (Carroll & Chang, 1970; Harshman, 1970).

This problem has been analyzed by many authors in some special cases; in particular if the crisp measure is a possibility (Sugeno; <b>see</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> [6]) or an archimedean decomposable measure [7]. Here we present an approach which permits us to construct such a fuzzy measure in the case where the crisp one has an arbitrary continuous composition law. The main results and the detailed proofs are contained in [4]. Finally, the original information problem can be solved by a symmetrization of the obtained results. ~) 1997 Elsevie...|$|R
