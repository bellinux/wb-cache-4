40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{development}} of a separable, pressurized and linerless CFRP vessel (carbon fibre reinforced polymer) for DLR’s Eu:Cropis satellite mis-sion. Due to a biological payload, an internal pressure of one earth atmosphere is required. The Satellite will operate in low earth orbit (LEO) for a mission duration of two years. Special emphasis is set on the pressure-tightness of the whole vessel. Therefore, a shielding concept is neces-sary to avoid leakage after space debris impact. Fur-thermore, the manufacturing process has a significant influence to the permeability of the vessel’s CFRP shell. So, the present paper investigates the novel design of a CFRP pressure vessel without a <b>sealing</b> <b>liner</b> to be used in a space environment as well as its manufacturing and testing...|$|E
40|$|A {{cost-effective}} way {{of producing}} all-weather surfaces for cattle {{is to use}} a combined geotextile-gravel pad construction, which allows pavement depth to be reduced. This study sought to determine the pavement construction that would offer the least runoff, best drainage effect and highest quality runoff and drainage effluent after exposure to heavy precipitation under different manure loads in high animal density areas. The study also examined whether any pavement construction gave acceptable sealing to the underlying soil surface. Three different combinations of non-woven and woven geotextile together with two gravel fractions of 200 mm were exposed to 50 mm precipitation for 30 minutes and 15 kg of cattle manure under two manure regimes (manure removal and manure accumulation). Runoff, drainage effluent and leachate were flow measured and sampled in buckets as they exited their respective pipes for both regimes. The pad surface layer reduced runoff flow rate and stabilised drain flow throughout the experiments, confirming pad stability. Manure removal reduced total N, total P, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solid (TS) concentrations in drainage effluent. One pad construction proved better at oxidising NO 2 -N and another at trapping TS. One pad construction met the <b>sealing</b> <b>liner</b> norm to the underlying soil. The drainage effluent produced was acceptable for wetland treatment. The results show that geotextile and gravel pad constructions not only have a supporting and draining function, but also a filtering, aerating and sealing effect...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} for monitoring in fractured rock was demonstrated in a contaminated (trichloroethylene and metola-chlor) dolostone aquifer used for municipal water supply. The system {{consists of two}} related technologies: a continuous packer for temporary borehole <b>seals</b> (Flexible <b>Liner</b> Underground Technologies Ltd. [FLUTe] blank liner) and a depth-discrete multilevel monitoring system (MLS) (the Water FLUTe) for temporary or permanent monitoring. The continuous borehole liner consists of a urethane-coated nylon fabric tube custom sized to each hole. The FLUTe MLS consists of the same liner material with many depth-discrete intervals for monitoring hydraulic head and/or ground water quality. The FLUTe blank <b>liner</b> <b>seals</b> the entire borehole, prior to FLUTe multilevel installation, to prevent vertical cross connection while allow-ing borehole logging and testing. The FLUTe multilevel system also seals the entire borehole {{with the exception of}} each monitoring interval where the formation water has direct hydraulic connection to the pumping system via a thin permeable mesh sandwiched between the liner and the formation. The blank <b>sealing</b> <b>liners</b> and the multilevel systems were used in five boreholes ranging in diameter between 9. 6 and 14. 5 cm in the dolostone aquifer to depths of 150 m. The systems were cus-tom designed for each borehole and included between 12 and 15 monitoring intervals. The application demonstrated the ease of installation and removability and facilitated obtaining large data sets with minimal labor.

Favourable environmental conditions for microbiological reduction of perchlorate were sought by infiltrating an electron donor-enriched water solution using drip irrigation underlying an airtight <b>sealing</b> <b>liner.</b> A vadose zone monitoring system (VMS) was used for real-time tracking of the percolation process, the penetration depth of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the variation in perchlorate concentration across the entire soil depth. The experimental conditions for each infiltration event were adjusted according to insight gained from data obtained by the VMS in previous stages. Continuous monitoring of the vadose zone indicated that in the top 13  m of the cross section, perchlorate concentration is dramatically reduced from thousands of milligrams per litre to near-detection limits with a concurrent increase in chloride concentration. Nevertheless, in the deeper parts of the vadose zone (<  17  m), perchlorate concentration increased, suggesting its mobilization down through the cross section. Breakthrough of DOC and bromide at different depths across the unsaturated zone showed limited migration capacity of biologically consumable carbon and energy sources due to their enhanced biodegradation in the upper soil layers. Nevertheless, the increased DOC concentration with concurrent reduction in perchlorate and increase in the chloride-to-perchlorate ratio in the top 13  m indicate partial degradation of perchlorate in this zone. There was no evidence of improved degradation conditions in the deeper parts where the initial concentrations of perchlorate were significantly higher...|$|E
40|$|The EC {{landfill}} directive defines {{in article}} 1 (1) a gen-eral aim ‘to reduce {{as far as}} possible negative effects on the environment, in particular the pollution of surface water, groundwater, soil and air, and on the global envi-ronment [ [...] . ] from landfilling of waste, during the whole life-cycle of the landfill. ’ The surface sealing has special importance as a long-term barrier in the realisa-tion of this ambitious goal. The surface sealing of a landfill serves as a long-last-ing barrier between the body of waste and the atmos-phere and biosphere. Its main tasks are to minimise infiltration of water into the landfill, to prevent the escape of landfill gas and dust, to facilitate landscaping and sustaining cultivation of the surface. According to German waste disposal and landfill regulations (TA Siedlungsabfall 1993), untreated municipal waste may only be deposited in landfills until the year 2005. Land-fills, which do not meet the standards of the EC landfill directive and its German counterpart, will have to stop operation by the year 2009. Therefore, during this dec-ade, a large number of landfills will have to be closed and will eventually have to be covered with an adequate surface sealing system. The basis for the design of surface sealing systems is given in the EC landfill directive and – for Germany – in the German ‘Deponieverordnung ’ of 2002. The ‘Deponieverordnung ’ gives specific regulations for a standard surface sealing system consisting of (for municipal solid waste landfills) from bottom to top: • artificial <b>sealing</b> <b>liner</b> (geomembrane; d> 2. 5 mm); • mineral sealing layer (d> 0. 5 m; k 0. 3 m; k> 1 × 10 – 3 m/s); • top soil cover (d> 1. 0 m).

These included 32 open wells and 14 ‘boreholes’ hereafter termed groundwater, 14 streams, 4 rivers, 5 dam waters, and 3 lakes (Lakes Bambili, Oku and Ber) hereafter called surface water. Surface water sources were collected under base flow conditions (no run-off influence) since the sampling was in the dry season. The locations and altitudes of the selected sampling points were identified in the field using a Garmin Vista CX GPS. New narrow mouth low-density polyethylene bottles (100  ml) and Duran glass bottles (500  ml) were used for stable isotopes and tritium (3 H) water sampling, respectively.

40|$|An {{experimental}} programme {{is presented}} {{with the aim of}} characterising –from physical, microstructural and geotechnical perspectives– the main properties of compacted clay phyllites. These clay phyllites are widely used as waterproofing material for roofs in the Alpujarras (Andalusia, Spain), as <b>sealing</b> <b>liners</b> in irrigation ponds, and as core material of small earthen zoned dams. An exhaustive physical-characterisation programme on the powder fraction has been followed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chemical analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), thermal analysis, particle-size distribution analysis, consistency limits, and density of solid particles. From a microstructural standpoint, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests, as well as nitrogen-adsorption tests, were carried out to characterise the pore network and surface area of the material in both natural and compacted states. The geotechnical characterisation programme on the compacted material was focused on the water-permeability and water-retention properties, the volume change on soaking (swelling or collapse), the compressibility on loading, the shearstrength properties, and the mechanical-penetration properties. In this way, an important physical and hydro-mechanical data base is provided, which could help in evaluating the suitability for using this material {{in a wide range of}} earthen constructions (liners, road subgrades, embankments, core material in zoned dams). It has been found that the material contains illite, chlorite and quartz as the main components, and feldspar, iron oxide and interstratified illite–smectite as minor ones. Despite the presence of active clay minerals, the compacted material did not display an important swelling on soaking at low stresses, as a consequence of its low specific surface and low water-retention ability. The material exhibited good compaction properties and, consequently, low water permeability plus a stiff response on loading. Nevertheless, despite the low porosity attained on the dry-side compaction, the material underwent some collapse on soaking at stresses greater than 100 kPa.

40|$|The {{clogging}} of fine-porosity geotextiles by {{soil particles}} {{is considered to}} be a problem in applications of these fabrics to filtering of municipal and industrial effluents. However, the clogging phenomenon can be an advantage for certain purposes, such as the creation of near-watertight membranes for sealing manure holding tanks. The conceived advantages of non-woven needle-punctured geotextiles are that they are less expensive due to lower material quantity, they are more resistant to tensile stresses compared to impermeable plastics and concrete, and they are easily installed. This thesis describes experimental work on the permeability and clogging characteristics of a Non-woven Polyester Geotextile with three different porosities (13. 4, 19. 5 and 26. 0 mum) but the same hydraulic conductivity (Kw = 10 - 5 m/s), when subjected to different heads of cattle slurry at 1, 2 and 4 % total solids (TS) concentrations. The resulting infiltration rates were used to establish the effect of geotextile pore size and manure TS on geotextile sealing and to find the location of the seal, whether at the surface or within the geotextile. After 100 days of experimentation, the lowest infiltration rate of 1. 1 L/m 2 /d was reached with the 13. 4 mum geotextile. Manure TS had a significant effect on the sealing and at least 4 % TS was required to minimize the geotextile's infiltration rate. Clogging occurred within the pores, suggesting that the seal remains even after removing the manure. This advantage can be translated into economic benefit when fun cost comparisons with <b>sealing</b> <b>liners</b> such as geomembranes and concrete are undertaken. This research also reviews and analyzes the physical, chemical and biological processes leading to clogging of geotextiles as well as a cost-benefit comparison with the other sealing materials.

Geomembrane liners installed in surface industrial impoundment may be impaired due to physical damage, improper installation, abnormal materials, construction cracks, or human mistakes during operation. Conventional repair methods, which involve finding, repairing and testing the leaks, are tedious, expensive, and dangerous to workers. Electrophoretic repair technique is an innovative, economic, and safe method to repair the leakage of impoundments. A suspension of clay particles is induced to the impoundment. The cathode is placed inside and the anode is placed outside the impoundment. An electric field is imposed externally across the leaks of geomembrane liner. The negative charged clay particles are repelled by the cathode and attracted by the anode toward the leak. Thus, clay accumulates in and near the leaks, thereby <b>sealing</b> the <b>liner.</b> This thesis presents the results of cake formation tests conducted to induce electrolyte (NaCl), four organic compounds (methanol, phenol, chloroform, and toluene) and mixture into the clay suspension. The effect of the presence of NaCl and four different organic compounds was investigated. The results of cake formation tests indicate that the cake decreasing rate was dictated by: (1) additions of NaCl which reduced the height and diameter of clay cake due to rapid flocculation; and (2) polar organic liquids with high dielectric constants, such as methanol and phenol, which affected the size of clay cake less than non-polar organic liquids with low dielectric constants...|$|R

Infiltration rates decreased from 5 X 10 ^- 5 m/s to less than 1 X 10 ^- 7 m/s and 2 X 10 ^- 8 m/s within 150 and 1000 hours, respectively and all demonstrated minimum seepage rates of 1. 3 to 1. 8 X 10 ^- 8 m/s after 1000 to 1400 hours; these rates are slightly greater than the 10 ^- 8 m/s guideline established by the Quebec government. Field <b>sealing</b> of geotextiles <b>liners</b> was confirmed using a 20 micrometers fabric subjected to swine slurries of various total solids (TS) concentrations ranging from 1 % to 10 %.

40|$|According to the California Energy Commission (CEC 1998 a), California {{commercial}} buildings account for 35 % of statewide electricity consumption, and 16 % of statewide gas consumption. Space conditioning accounts for roughly 16, 000 GWh {{of electricity and}} 800 million therms of natural gas annually, {{and the vast majority}} of this space conditioning energy passes through thermal distribution systems in these buildings. In addition, 8600 GWh per year is consumed by fans and pumps in {{commercial buildings}}, most of which is used to move the thermal energy through these systems. Research work at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has been ongoing over the past five years to investigate the energy efficiency of these thermal distribution systems, and to explore possibilities for improving that energy efficiency. Based upon that work, annual savings estimates of 1 kWh/ft{sup 2 } for light commercial buildings, and 1 - 2 kWh/ft{sup 2 } in large commercial buildings have been developed for the particular aspects of thermal distribution system performance being addressed by this project. Those savings estimates, combined with a distribution of the building stock based upon an extensive stock characterization study (Modera et al. 1999 a), and technical penetration estimates, translate into statewide saving potentials of 2000 GWh/year and 75 million thermal/year, as well as an electricity peak reduction potential of 0. 7 GW. The overall goal of this research program is to provide new technology and application knowledge that will allow the design, construction, and energy services industries to reduce the energy waste associated with thermal distribution systems in California commercial buildings. The specific goals of the LBNL efforts over the past year were: (1) to advance the state of knowledge about system performance and energy losses in commercial-building thermal distribution systems; (2) to evaluate the potential of reducing thermal losses through duct sealing, duct insulation, and improved equipment sizing; and (3) to develop and evaluate innovative techniques applicable to large buildings for sealing ducts and encapsulating internal duct insulation. In the UCB fan project, the goals were: (1) to develop a protocol for testing, analyzing and diagnosing problems in large commercial building built-up air handling systems, and (2) to develop low-cost measurement techniques to improve short term monitoring practices. To meet our stated goals and objectives, this project: (1) continued to investigate and characterize the performance of thermal distribution systems in commercial buildings; (2) performed energy analyses and evaluation for duct-performance improvements for both small and large commercial buildings; (3) developed aerosol injection technologies for both duct <b>sealing</b> and <b>liner</b> encapsulation in commercial buildings; and (4) designed energy-related diagnostic protocols based on short term measurement and used a benchmarking database to compare subject systems with other measured systems for certain performance metrics. This year's efforts consisted of the following distinct tasks: performing characterization measurements for five light commercial building systems and five large-commercial-building systems; analyzing the potential for including duct performance in California's Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Non-Residential Buildings (Title 24), including performing energy and equipment sizing analyses of air distribution systems using DOE 2. 1 E for non-residential buildings; conducting laboratory experiments, field experiments, and modeling of new aerosol injection technologies concepts for sealing and coating, including field testing aerosol-based sealing in two large commercial buildings; improving low-cost fan monitoring techniques measurements, and disseminating fan tools by working with energy practitioners directly where possible and publishing the results of this research and the tools developed on a web-site.
