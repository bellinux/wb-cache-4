40|$|<b>SUMMARY</b> Skin <b>punch</b> biopsies of six {{children}} suffering from infantile or late onset Tay-Sachs disease, juvenile Sandhoff disease, or GM gangliosidosis type I, contained axons which, when viewed with the electron microscope, were distended by large amorphous black deposits. These are nonspecific residual bodies. Their large numbers indicate severe disturbance of the nerve cell and {{may be part of}} the dying back process. The three cases with Tay-Sachs disease had also axonal zebra or complex membranous bodies which appeared to be specific. Cytoplasmic vacuolation of other cells was a feature in the patient with GM 1 gangliosidosis. Biopsies of three parents were negative. The usefulness of skin biopsies in the diagnosis of the neurovisceral ceroid lipofuscinoses was pointed out by Carpenter et al., in 1972. This method was later investigated in other storage diseases (Dol-man et al., 1975, O'Brien et al., 1975). Ander-mann et al. (1975) reported negative skin and nerve biopsies in two Lebanese brothers with lat...|$|R
40|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) {{is established}} as {{the method of}} choice to investigate the biliary tree when obstruction is suspected. On rare occasions, the papilla cannot be entered because of anatomical or pathological abnormalities. This report describes endoscopic fistulotomy or the suprapapillary punch that {{has been carried out}} at the Foothills Hospital in Calgary, Alberta, on 30 of 623 patients referred for ERCP for conditions causing obstruction of the common bile duct or suspected obstruction of the common bile duct. The following communication also describes the method of suprapapillary punch or endoscopic fistulotomy. Results have been excellent with only one complication, a minor attack of pancreatitis after the procedure. In <b>summary,</b> the suprapapillary <b>punch</b> or fistulotomy is a safe and useful method for entering the common bile duct when access by the usual method is impossible...|$|R
