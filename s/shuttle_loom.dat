50|$|Mageba {{continues}} {{to develop new}} processes for traditional <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom</b> technology.|$|E
50|$|The fabric woven in {{two stages}} is made using loin loom or throw shuttle and fly shuttle loom; the throw <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom</b> is {{considered}} the most suitable.|$|E
50|$|Phumriang Silk - Hand-woven {{products}} of a Muslim village. The weavers here {{create their own}} patterns which are embossed on the silk by <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{products}} are manufactured using dobby looms, jacquard <b>looms,</b> and <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms,</b> which allow for state-of-the-art floral motifs, subtle shadows, and colour gradients. They hold ISO 9001-2000 certification by SGS.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shuttle</b> <b>looms</b> weave a {{narrower}} 30-inch fabric, {{which is on}} average half the width of modern shuttleless Sulzer looms. Consequently, a longer piece of fabric is required to make {{a pair of jeans}} from selvedge denim (approximately three yards).|$|R
5000|$|The weaving process {{involves}} {{two methods}} based {{on use of}} shuttles: fly <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom</b> and throw <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom.</b> In the first type it is made as a complete fabric in a single piece. In the second method, the fabric is made in twopieces and then joined by stitching {{to make it a}} full fabric. Additional motifs are woven in by hand. The fabric is [...] "porous, airy, see-through and thin", making it suitable for luxury items for women such as chadors and saris, and skirts and school uniforms for girls.|$|E
5000|$|The mill on {{the banks}} of the fast-flowing River Avoca survives from at least 1723. Travel to and from the remote village was {{difficult}} and a barter system was used. The mill was used for grinding corn for bread and spinning and weaving wool.In 1760 a Fly <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Loom,</b> capable of weaving up to 20 metres of cloth a day arrived. Workers, concerned about possible unemployment, resorted to burning some looms.|$|E
5000|$|Selvedge denim {{refers to}} a unique type of {{selvedge}} that is made by passing one continuous cross-yarn (the weft) {{back and forth through}} the vertical warp beams. This is traditionally finished at both edges with a contrasting warp (most commonly red); that is why this type of denim is sometimes referred to as [...] "red selvedge." [...] This method of weaving the selvage is possible only when using a <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{shuttles}} {{were passed}} {{back and forth}} by hand. However, John Kay invented a loom in 1733 that incorporated a flying shuttle. This shuttle could be thrown through the warp, which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler. Though Air Jet, and Water Jet Looms are common in large operations, many companies still use flying <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms.</b> This is {{due in large part}} to their being easier to maintain than the more modern Looms. In modern flying <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms,</b> the <b>shuttle</b> itself is made of rounded steel, with a hook in the back which carries the filler, or [...] "pick." ...|$|R
50|$|In August 1988, Springs {{announced}} that 200 jobs {{would be lost}} at its 93-year-old Lancaster complex. This would {{reduce the number of}} employees to 1300, down from 4500 in 1981. The number of fly <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms</b> was reduced during the same period from 7000 to 300.|$|R
50|$|Next {{process in}} the textile {{production}} is fabric manufacturing. Fabric Manufacturing laboratory has variety of weaving machines from hand loom to high speed air jet loom. This laboratory consist of dobby and jacquard hand looms, dobby and jacquard <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms,</b> terry towel looms, rapier dobby and jacquard looms, air jet loom, sectional warping machine and sizing machine.|$|R
50|$|C. Rajam {{was born}} in 1882 {{in the village of}} Swamimalai, (near Kumbakonam) in Thanjavur District of Madras State (now Tamil Nadu). After {{completing}} his high school education at the Town High School, Kumbakonam, he joined the Salem Government Weaving School in 1904 to master the art of weaving process. In the beginning he established a handloom factory (fly <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom)</b> to produce dhotis, towels, shirt material etc., but latter also started trading of consumer items. After not being so successful in those business, he became a volunteer in the congress party and learnt the hardship faced by the mankind. A meeting with Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, attracted him towards the philosophical aspects of life.|$|E
50|$|Picking. As the {{harnesses}} {{raise the}} heddles or healds, which raise the warp yarns, the shed is created. The filling yarn is inserted through the shed {{by a small}} carrier device called a shuttle. The shuttle is normally pointed at each end to allow passage through the shed. In a traditional <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom,</b> the filling yarn is wound onto a quill, {{which in turn is}} mounted in the shuttle. The filling yarn emerges {{through a hole in the}} shuttle as it moves across the loom. A single crossing of the shuttle from one side of the loom to the other is known as a pick. As the shuttle moves back and forth across the shed, it weaves an edge, or selvage, on each side of the fabric to prevent the fabric from raveling.|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} flexible reusable surface {{insulation material}} for future space shuttle flights was investigated. A conventional fly <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom</b> with special modifications to weave an integral double layer triangular core fabric from quartz yarn was used. Two types of insulating material were {{inserted into the}} cells of the fabric, and a procedure to accomplish this was developed. The program is follow up of a program in which single layer rectangular cell core fabrics are woven and a single type of insulating material was inserted into the cells...|$|E
50|$|Claudia Brahms and Noel Mount {{continue}} to work with the company, designing fabric and providing engineering consultancy. In 2012, Brahms Mount acquired four more antique <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms</b> of the same vintage to increase production capacity. In 2013, having outgrown its original premises, the factory moved to a larger facility in Monmouth, Maine. The factory store was moved into a historic building in Freeport, Maine.|$|R
50|$|Linear motors {{are widely}} used. One {{of the major}} uses of linear motors is for {{propelling}} the <b>shuttle</b> in <b>looms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Battening. As {{the shuttle}} {{moves across the}} loom laying down the fill yarn, it also passes through {{openings}} in another frame called a reed (which resembles a comb). With each picking operation, the reed presses or battens each filling yarn against {{the portion of the}} fabric that has already been formed. The point where the fabric is formed is called the fell. Conventional <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms</b> can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of the shuttleless loom, a major {{innovation in the}} textile industry, has been relatively slow {{in spite of the}} undisputed improvement with respect to the conventional <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom</b> used for weaving textiles. The {{diffusion of}} shuttleless looms in industrialized countries is analysed in the framework of an epidemic diffusion model where the diffusion speed parameter is allowed to vary. Of the various factors affecting the speed of diffusion, trade liberalization seems to have the most potent impact in accelerating diffusion. This finding is consistent with the idea that trade liberalization is conducive to speeding up the diffusion of innovations. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{extraordinary}} {{progress in the}} technology of weaving, the majority of weavers, particularly in the developing world, use shuttle looms. These looms suffer from various deficiencies, one of them being the severe abrasion between warp threads and shuttle, particularly when the shuttle leaves the shed. This can be avoided or reduced by allowing the sley to dwell near the back centre. Changing the drive of the sley from the currently used four-bar mechanism to a cam-driven mechanism will easily achieve this objective. However, weavers currently using shuttle looms are reluctant to accept this modification because of the significant increase in cost that it entails. A compromise would be a six-bar mechanism that can give a dwell or "near-dwell" condition, i. e. very slow motion, near the back centre. Such a mechanism, based on the Watt chain, has been explored in this article. It gives 0. 06 degrees of maximum angular displacement of the output link for 95 degrees rotation of the input link. The suitability of the mechanism in satisfying the other requirements of sley movement of a <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom</b> has also been discussed...|$|E
30|$|Very few {{researchers}} {{have come forward}} and carried out research using woven fabrics {{in the case of}} cut resistant fabrics specifically, {{despite the fact that they}} possess superior mechanical properties in both in-plane and transverse directions compared to knitted fabrics. It has been reported that woven fabrics based on high strength and high modulus fibers with dense structures have the advantage of shear resistance (Tien et al. 2010). Also due to interlacement of tows or yarns, woven fabrics offer high resistance to damage, superior energy absorption (Karahan et al. 2008) and remarkably high values of strain at failure in tension, and loadings (Chou and Ko 1989; Dixit and Mali 2013). With the rapid advancement in the field of textiles, woven fabrics can be fabricated to near knit shape, which could exhibit high degree of flexibility. Therefore, in the present study the comparison of cut resistance behavior of high performance knitted and woven fabrics are analyzed. 100 % Kevlar, 100 % PE and 50 % PE/ 50 % Kevlar composite knitted and woven fabrics were produced on electronic flat knitting machine and <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom,</b> respectively and the cut resistance behavior is clearly highlighted with a comparative analysis between knitted and woven fabrics.|$|E
30|$|Case 1 : In 1986, {{after graduating}} from junior high school at 16  years old, WLC became a {{mechanic}} in a textile mill in town. After working for 2 to 3  years, WLC bought two <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms</b> to start weaving {{with his father and}} sisters. They sold their woven cloth on the road. In 1990, WLC became acquainted with mercers from Guangzhou and the northeast of China through his relative’s hotel because many foreign mercers stayed there. By age 23, WLC no longer sold cloth by the main road of the town and had instead started a workshop at home to collect cloth for mercers. He began to do business with mercers, selling his own clothes produced by his own <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms</b> and collecting cloth according to these mercers’ demands in order to make profits. This pattern lasted until the establishment of the textile market in Pu Town. During this period, WLC rented a store specifically to do business in material, fabrics as well as dyeing, and then went back into the fabric business. He rented machines from the mid- 1990 s until 2003.|$|R
50|$|Battening. Between the heddles and the takeup roll, {{the warp}} threads pass through another frame called the reed (which resembles a comb). The {{portion of the}} fabric {{that has already been}} formed but not yet rolled up on the takeup roll is called the fell. After the shuttle moves across the loom laying down the fill yarn, the weaver uses the reed to press (or batten) each filling yarn against the fell. Conventional <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms</b> can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.|$|R

40|$|Control of {{the warp}} and weft yarn tension is an {{important}} factor. In this research, effect of warp yarn tension variations {{on the quality of}} greige and dyed woven fabrics was investigated. Six fabric samples (three Plain and three Twill weaves) were woven on <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom</b> at varied warp yarn tension. The fabric samples were then pre-treated and dyed (Drimarene Red Cl 5 B, 3 % owf) using laboratory singeing machine and HT dyeing machine. Greige fabric quality such as fabric inspection, fabric length, fabric width, GSM (Gram per Square Meter), EPI (Ends per Inch), PPI (Picks per Inch), and dyed fabric quality such as L*, a*, b*, C, h o, (K/S) ?max and fastness properties were assessed according to the standard. It has been observed that fabric samples, both Plain and Twill weave; woven at improper warp yarns tension gives rejected greige fabric quality and 1 - 7 % lower (K/S) 550 nm values as compared to the fabric weave at requisite warp yarn tension such as 38 - 39 cN for Plain fabric and 78 cN for Twill fabric for 42 x 38 and 64 x 36 tex construction. Hence, among other weave faults, warp yarn tension variation has influence on the greige fabric quality as well as caused improper and uneven dyeing behavior...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Current global {{textiles}} and fashion industries have gradually shifted focus to high value-added, high sensibility, and multi-functional products based on new human-friendliness and sustainable growth technologies. Textile design CAD {{systems have been}} developed in conjunction with computer hardware and software sector advances. This study compares the patterns or images of actual woven fabrics and virtual fabrics prepared with a textile design CAD system. In this study, several weave structures (such as fancy yarn weave and patterns) were prepared with a <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom.</b> The woven textile images were taken using a CCD camera. The same weave structure data and yarn data were fed into a textile design CAD system in order to simulate fabric images as similarly as possible. Similarity Index analysis methods allowed for an anal-ysis of the index between the actual fabric specimen and the simulated image of the corresponding fabric. The results showed that repeated small pattern weaves provide superior similarity index values than those of a fancy yarn weave that indicate some irregularities due to fancy yarn attributes. A Complex Wavelet Structural Similarity(CW-SSIM) index resulted in a better index than other methods such as Multi-Scale(MS) SSIM, and Feature Similarity(FS) SSIM, across fabric specimen images. A correlation analysis of the similarity index based on an image analysis and a similarity eval-uation by panel members was also implemented.

50|$|The flying shuttle {{dominated}} commercial weaving {{through the}} middle of the twentieth century. By that time, other systems had begun to supplant it. The heavy shuttle was noisy and energy-inefficient (since the energy used to throw it was largely lost in the catching); also, its inertia limited the speed of the loom. Projectile and rapier looms eliminated the need to take the bobbin/pirn of thread through the shed; later, air- and water-jet looms reduced the weight of moving parts further. Flying <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms</b> are still used for some purposes, and old models remain in use.|$|R

40|$|In {{weaving mill}} {{departments}} equipped with <b>shuttle</b> <b>looms</b> {{there exists a}} high noise level that has a noxious effect on the human organism, a fact which affects a very great number of employees and has negative repercussions on productivity. Measurements were conducted in different weaving mills to determine the noise level {{as well as the}} influence of some factors that depend on the type of construction, the type, number and manner of operation of the looms, etc. Solutions for noise reduction were established that were applied experimentally in some weaving mills, and the results obtained are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) were {{predominantly}} developed for {{applications in the}} biomedical and engineering industry, and {{only a limited number}} of applications in textiles are known. Fabrics made of natural fibres (e. g. cotton, flax and their mixtures) present many advantages, such as wearing comfort, but they are subject to creasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of compensating for this disadvantage by using SMAs to create aesthetic low crease flax/cotton fabrics. Body Temperature SMAs (BT SMA) that regain their (straight) form when they are subject to human body temperature were used for this purpose. Clothing and bed sheeting are potential applications of these hybrid structures, which become wrinkle-free when they are exposed to the heat of the body, a hair dryer or that generated by an electrical current. The materials selected to achieve this purpose were the following: (1) textile yarns (e. g. single cotton or flax/cotton yarns, two-fold flax yarns and two types of loop fancy yarns) and (2) BT SMA wires of 300 mu m diameter. A power weaving loom and a hand-weaving <b>shuttle</b> <b>loom</b> were used to embed the SMA wires, and four types of hybrid fabrics were produced. The thickness, wrinkle recovery, dimensional stability as well as the cohesion of the SMA wires in the woven fabric were tested. All the tests were performed before and after a washing cycle for both the hybrid and reference fabrics. An increase in thickness was noticed after washing, and the recovery time after crushing varied according to the type of fabric. The slippage of SMA wires from the fabrics was noticed for all the samples, which was dependent on the type of yarns used, their linear density and the weaving process...|$|E
