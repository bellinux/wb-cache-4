25|$|This codec {{incorporated}} into a broadcasting system using COFDM modulation was demonstrated on air and on the field together with Radio Canada and CRC Canada during the NAB show (Las Vegas) in 1991. The implementation of the audio part of this broadcasting system {{was based on a}} two chips encoder (one for the subband transform, one for the psychoacoustic model designed by the team of G. Stoll (IRT Germany), later known as psychoacoustic model I) and a real time decoder using one Motorola 56001 DSP chip running an integer arithmetics software designed by Y.F. Dehery's team (CCETT, France). The simplicity of the corresponding decoder together with the high audio quality of this codec using {{for the first time a}} 48kHz sampling frequency, a 20 bits/sample input format (the highest available sampling standard in 1991, compatible with the AES/EBU professional digital input <b>studio</b> <b>standard)</b> were the main reasons to later adopt the characteristics of MUSICAM as the basic features for an advanced digital music compression codec.|$|E

This year began the <b>studio's</b> <b>standard</b> release pattern of two 12-chapter and two 15-chapter serials in every year. This pattern remained until 1944 with the exception of 1942, which had only one 15-chapter serial released instead of two.|$|R

5000|$|The early {{machines}} use the Ampex 2 inch {{quadruplex system}} in which the drum has 4 heads and rotates at 14,400 RPM perpendicular to the tape, so the recorded tracks were transverse to the tape axis. With 2-inch tape this requires 16 tracks for a single analog NTSC video frame, or 20 for a PAL frame. Since each track is only a fraction of a video frame, quadruplex is not capable of modern editing functions like freeze-frame or slow motion. (In fact, the quadruplex format can only reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape is playing at normal speed.) But in spite of its drawbacks it remained the broadcasting <b>studio</b> <b>standard</b> until about 1980.|$|E
50|$|By the mid-2010s, the Blu-ray Disc medium {{had become}} a common home media standard, and online video {{streaming}} sources such as Netflix and YouTube were offering a range of high definition content, including some 4K content (although various compression technologies are applied to make this streamed content feasible). The first 4K Blu-ray discs were released in 2016. By this point, 4K TVs and computer monitors were rapidly declining in price and increasing in prevalence, {{despite a lack of}} native 4K content. While many DSP systems existed, DTS-HD Master Audio remained the <b>studio</b> <b>standard</b> for lossless surround sound encoding on Blu-ray, with five or seven native discrete channels. High definition video projectors also continued to improve and decrease in price, relative to performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} a ticket office on {{platform}} 2, {{but this is}} only manned on a limited basis (mornings only, Mondays to Saturdays). At other times tickets must be purchased on board the train. The main building on platform 1 is now used as an art <b>studio.</b> <b>Standard</b> shelters are available on both platforms, along with a waiting room on platform 1. Train running information is provided via CIS displays, automatic announcements and customer help points. The station subway has steps and is not therefore accessible to wheelchair or mobility-impaired users, but there are step-free access routes to each side via public roads. All trains on the route to and from Perth use platform 1 in both directions, so this {{should be taken into}} account if changing trains here.|$|E

50|$|Ampex's {{first great}} success {{was a line}} of reel-to-reel tape {{recorders}} developed from the German wartime Magnetophon system {{at the behest of}} Bing Crosby. Ampex quickly became a leader in audio tape technology, developing many of the analog recording formats for both music and movies that remained in use into the 1990s. Starting in the 1950s the company began developing video tape recorders, which set the <b>studio</b> <b>standards</b> for decades, and later introduced the helical scan concept that make home video players possible. They also introduced multi-track recording, slow-motion and instant playback television, {{and a host of other}} advances.|$|R

The series was launched in 1925 and ran two years. Alternatively known as The Three Fatties, they were played in order of girth by Hilliard [...] "Fat" [...] Karr, Kewpie Ross and Frank [...] "Fatty" [...] Alexander. The films were Tailoring (1925), All Tied Up (1925), Three Wise Goofs (1925), Heavy Love (1926), The Heavy Parade (1926), Three of a Kind (1926), Old Tin Shoes (1927), Three Missing Links (1927), and Campus Romeos (1927).

5000|$|The next {{important}} {{development was}} 4-track recording. The advent of this improved system gave recording engineers and musicians vastly greater flexibility for recording and overdubbing, and 4-track was the <b>studio</b> <b>standard</b> {{for most of}} the later 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's Abbey Road Studios became particularly adept at a technique called [...] "reduction mixes" [...] in the UK and [...] "bouncing down" [...] in the United States, in which several tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Classification is a {{fundamental}} issue in quantitative studies of any phenomenon and has been known as a necessity {{for the advancement of}} science. Using a standard record system for diseases is critical for research purposes and also could improve the quality of medical health services. In this study, after evaluating current codding systems in oral medicine, we designed a software for systematic coding and registration of Oral and Maxillofacial diseases based on the latest update of the World Health Organization ICD- 10 classification system in 2010. Â  Materials and Methods: Based on the latest WHO ICD- 10 update in 2010 and by using software s as: vb. net, net framework, SQL Server and Microsoft Visual <b>Studio,</b> <b>standard</b> coding software for recording patient's data at the department of Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences was designed. Data from all patients were codded by standard ICD- 10 codes and registered by the software. Also an online portal for recording patient's data which could be used nationwide was designed. By d esigning this software the process of forming and registering patient's records, and their treatment process is facilitated. An archive of patient data was also stablished. Â  Conclusion: As a result, this software in addition to maintaining patient data, facilitate studies and research projects greatly. Itâs recommended that the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education as the concessioner of this software, improves codding and registration systems of oral diseases at the dental schools by developing this software...|$|E
