5000|$|In current {{artificial}} intelligence and philosophy of mind, intentionality is sometimes linked {{with questions of}} semantic inference, with both skeptical and supportive adherents. [...] John Searle argued for this position with the Chinese room thought experiment, according to which no syntactic operations that occurred in a computer would provide it with semantic content. Others are more skeptical of the human ability to make such an assertion, arguing {{that the kind of}} intentionality that emerges from self-organizing networks of automata will always be undecidable because it will never be possible to make our subjective introspective experience of intentionality and decision making coincide with our objective observation of the behavior of a <b>self-organizing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
40|$|With {{the current}} trend of {{increasing}} automation, leading to <b>self-organizing</b> <b>machine</b> tools and production machines (“Industry 4. 0 ”), data acquisition and processing {{becomes more and more}} important. Based on these data, new monitoring functions and identification methods can be implemented in the machine control. Depending on the algorithms, also drive internal data, such as the actual torque, or the power consumption of the machine axes are required, partially at high sample rates. State of the art computerized numerical controllers (e. g. SIEMENS 840 D sl) however, are characterized by a separation of drive system and controller. Drive data, which is not included in the standard bus-connection are difficult to access by the superordinated CNC. The paper addresses this problem, presents and compares various concepts of drive data transfer to a standard industrial CNC/PLC. Subsequently, the most convenient method, which utilizes a drive-internal data recorder is chosen for implementation. It offers flexible drive data acquisition through the PLC at high sample rates, carried out block wise. Experimental results are shown to prove the functionality. Finally, ideas for continuative monitoring and identification methods are discussed...|$|E

Kinesins are {{key members of}} these force-generating teams. Different kinesins walk directionally along dynamic microtubules, anchor, crosslink, align and sort microtubules into polarized bundles, and influence microtubule dynamics by interacting with microtubule tips. The mechanochemical mechanisms of these kinesins are specialized to enable each type to make a specific contribution to spindle self-organization and chromosome segregation...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{of fluid}} through a pipe is {{essential}} for the operation of macroscale machines and microfluidic devices. Conventional fluids only flow in response to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic fluid, comprised of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile and direction of the self-organized flows, and correlate these to the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near the surface, and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The non-equilibrium transition of confined isotropic active fluids can be used to engineer <b>self-organized</b> soft <b>machines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cell {{motility}} is {{a fascinating}} example of cell behavior which is fundamentally important {{to a number of}} biological and pathological processes. It is based on a complex <b>self-organized</b> mechano-chemical <b>machine</b> consisting of cytoskeletal filaments and molecular motors. In general, the cytoskeleton is responsible for the movement of the entire cell and for movements within the cell. The main challenge in the field of cell motility is to develop a complete physical description on how and why cells move. For this purpose new ways of modeling the properties of biological cells have to be found. This long term goal can only be achieved if new experimental techniques are developed to extract physical information from these living systems and if theoretical models are found which bridge the gap between molecular and mesoscopic length scales. Cell Motility gives an authoritative overview of the fundamental biological facts, theoretical models, and current experimental developments in this fascinating area...|$|R

The potency {{of the approach}} is demonstrated in a case study using gene expression data of more than 200 mature aggressive B-cell lymphoma patients. The method portrays each sample with individual resolution, characterizes the subtypes, disentangles the expression patterns into distinct modules, extracts their functional context using enrichment techniques and enables investigation of the similarity relations between the samples. The method also allows to detect and to correct outliers caused by contaminations. Based on our analysis, we propose a refined classification of B-cell Lymphoma into four molecular subtypes which are characterized by differential functional and clinical characteristics...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{application}} of the maximum entropy production principle for describing ecosystem biogeochemistry. Since ecosystems can be functionally stable despite changes in species composition, we use a distributed metabolic network for describing biogeochemistry, which synthesizes generic biological structures that catalyse reaction pathways, but is otherwise organism independent. Allocation of biological structure and regulation of biogeochemical reactions is determined via solution of an optimal control problem in which entropy production is maximized. However, because synthesis of biological structures cannot occur if entropy production is maximized instantaneously, we propose that information stored within the metagenome allows biological systems to maximize entropy production when averaged over time. This differs from abiotic systems that maximize entropy production at a point in space–time, which we refer to as the steepest descent pathway. It is the spatio-temporal averaging that allows biological systems to outperform abiotic processes in entropy production, at least in many situations. A simulation of a methanotrophic system is used to demonstrate the approach. We conclude with a brief discussion on the implications of viewing ecosystems as <b>self-organizing</b> molecular <b>machines</b> that function to maximize entropy production at the ecosystem level of organization...|$|R

We present several aspects which are at the interface of photometric surveys and variable stars. Fully automated analyses of photometric surveys are still not at an optimized level. We will take {{the example of a}} future survey, the Gaia mission project of the European Space Agency, to show different steps of a possible automated pipeline scheme.

40|$|Modern space {{tool design}} is {{the science of}} making a machine both massively complex {{while at the same}} time {{extremely}} robust and dependable. We propose a novel nonlinear control technique that produces capable, <b>self-organizing,</b> micron-scale space <b>machines</b> at low cost and in large numbers by parallel silicon assembly. Experiments using biomorphic architectures (with ideal space attributes) have produced a wide spectrum of survival-oriented machines that are reliably domesticated for work applications in specific environments. In particular, several one-chip satellite prototypes show interesting control properties that can be turned into numerous application-specific machines for autonomous, disposable space tasks. We believe that the real power of these architectures lies in their potential to self-assemble into larger, robust, loosely coupled structures. Assembly takes place at hierarchical space scales, with different attendant properties, allowing for inexpensive solutions to many daunting work tasks. The nature of biomorphic control, design, engineering options, and applications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Fokker-Planck {{equation}} {{with the}} velocity-dependent coefficients is considered for various isotropic systems {{on the basis}} of probability transition (PT) approach. This method provides the self-consistent and universal description of friction and diffusion for Brownian particles. Renormalization of the friction coefficient is shown to occur for two dimensional (2 -D) and three dimensional (3 -D) cases, due to the tensorial character of diffusion. The specific forms of PT are calculated for the Boltzmann-type of collisions and for the absorptiontype of collisions (the later are typical for dusty plasmas and some other systems). Validity of the Einstein’s relation for the Boltzmann-type collisions is analyzed for the velocity-dependent friction and diffusion coefficients. For the Boltzmann-type collisions in the region of very high grain velocity as well as it is always for non-Boltzmann collisions, such as, e. g., absorption collisions, the Einstein relation is violated, although some other relations (determined by the structure of PT) can exist. The generalized friction force is investigated in dusty plasma in the framework of the PT approach. The relation between this force, negative collecting friction force and scattering and collecting drag forces is established. The concept of probability transition is used to describe motion of active particles in an ambient medium. On basis of the physical arguments the PT for a simple model of the active particle is constructed and the coefficients of the relevant Fokker-Planck equation are found. The stationary solution of this equation is typical for the simplest <b>self-organized</b> molecular <b>machines.</b> PACS number(s) : 52. 27. Lw, 52. 20. Hv, 52. 25. Fi, 82. 70. -y I...|$|R

40|$|The {{fusion of}} {{predictions}} from disparate models {{has been used}} in several fields to obtain a more realistic and robust estimate of the “ground truth” by allowing the models to reinforce each other when consensus exists, or, conversely, negate each other when there is no consensus. Fusion {{has been shown to be}} most effective when the models have some complementary strengths arising from different approaches. In this work, we fuse the results from four common but methodologically different nonlinear multivariate models (Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector <b>Machines,</b> <b>Self-Organizing</b> Maps) that were trained to predict radiation-induced pneumonitis risk on a database of 219 lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy (34 with Grade 2 + postradiotherapy pneumonitis). Each model independently incorporated a small number of features from the available set of dose and nondose patient variables to predict pneumonitis; no two models had all features in common. Fusion was achieved by simple averaging of the predictions for each patient from all four models. Since a model’s prediction for a patient can be dependent on the patient training set used to build the model, the average of several different predictions from each model was used in the fusion (predictions were made by repeatedly testing each patient with a model built from different cross-validation training sets that excluded the patient being tested). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the fused cross-validated results was 0. 79, with lower variance than the individual component models. From the fusion, five features were extracted as the consensus among all four models in predicting radiation pneumonitis. Arranged in order of importance, the features are (1) chemotherapy; (2) equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for exponent a= 1. 2 to 3; (3) EUD for a= 0. 5 to 1. 2, lung volume receiving > 20 – 30 Gy; (4) female sex; and (5) squamous cell histology. To facilitate ease of interpretation and prospective use, the fused outcome results for the patients were fitted to a logistic probability function...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{property of}} living systems is {{their ability to}} consume resources from their environment in order to reproduce, heritably passing on their genetic program to their offspring. At the level of an individual cell, the irreducible unit of self-replicating life, this propagation occurs through cell division. While we have a relatively good grasp of nature's information storage mechanism, the DNA-encoded genome, the means for its distribution via the mechanics of a living cell remains mysterious. Eukaryotic cells entrust the partitioning of the duplicated genome to the mitotic spindle, a <b>self-organizing</b> supra-molecular <b>machine</b> primarily composed of dynamic microtubule filaments. The problem of delivering exactly one copy of each chromosome to each daughter cell must be solved {{an enormous number of}} times {{over the course of a}} human lifetime: errors result in aneuploidy, which can lead to birth defects and enhance the progression of cancer. The kinetochore is a network of protein complexes which assembles on centromeric chromatin to act as the connection point between chromosomes and the microtubules that segregate them into daughter cells. The kinetochore ensures proper bi-orientation of all chromosomes (i. e. that each sister chromatid is attached to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles) through the activity of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), and also couples chromosome movement to microtubule dynamics, most dramatically when microtubule depolymerization provides the driving force for pulling apart sister chromatids during anaphase. Thus, the kinetochore serves to generate and integrate both chemical and mechanical processes at the cellular scale; both functions are necessary for mitosis to succeed. The vertebrate kinetochore, the primary subject of this thesis, is composed of over one hundred different proteins, presenting a system of daunting complexity. Over the previous two decades genetic, biochemical, and cell biological analyses in multiple organisms have provided an almost complete parts list, demonstrating that most key kinetochore subunits are conserved in all eukaryotes and are also generally organized into the same sets of complexes, suggesting that the core functions and architecture of the kinetochore is conserved throughout the tree of life. Despite this triumph of biological analysis, physical, mechanistic explanations of how the kinetochore fulfills both its chemical and mechanical roles are absent, largely due to a lack of understanding of how kinetochore components are organized (and reorganized) in space and time as mitosis proceeds. This thesis addresses the core problem of how kinetochores engage dynamic microtubule filaments from a molecular mechanistic perspective. I focus my analysis on the Ndc 80 complex, which has been identified as the primary conserved direct interface between chromosomes and the microtubule surface. Through structural and biochemical experiments I uncovered the mechanism by which the human complex engages the microtubule and how this interaction can be regulated, with implications for coupling chromosome motions to microtubule dynamics and signaling proper chromosome bi-orientation. I also investigated the structure of the Mis 12 linker complex and its interaction with Ndc 80, demonstrating a conserved architecture of this interface between yeast and humans despite low sequence similarity. Finally, I probed how the Ndc 80 complex and the Dam 1 complex could coordinate their microtubule-binding activities in budding yeast using bioinformatics. I synthesize these results into scale three-dimensional models of the kinetochore, giving rise to precise hypotheses about kinetochore organization and function that can be tested in vivo, providing a step forward on the path towards a complete biophysical model of mitosis...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Companion robots {{are popular}} {{entities}} {{in the world}} of science fiction; however, in the real world no robot has been sufficiently programmed to act as a useful companion robot. There are still many issues to be resolved before this can be achieved, including the basic skills of walking, localisation and object recognition, and more difficult functions such as language, memory and human-robot interaction. Human emotions are shaped by cultural, genetic and environmental factors. Taking a wide-ranging approach to the context with respect to human-robot interactions, the surrounding environment has an effect on the way humans emotionally interact with each other. The focus of this is the extraction of environmental features (acoustic and visual) for use in human-robot interaction through an affective processing system on the robot. Applications of manifold learning were applied to acoustic and visual domains along with the design of an affective processing architecture. Manifold learning and alignment were applied to acoustic datasets to obtain `soundscapes'. With these soundscape manifolds it was possible to visualise angular and intensity relationships. In combination with standard classification methods, this allowed us to achieve high classification rates on a sound source classification example task. An application of soundscapes was then applied to localisation on a humanoid robot. Gaze direction of another pedestrian can influence the observer to re-focus their attention to another point. The visual perception of pedestrian gaze was explored with the use of humanoid robots and applied with manifold learning, which reveals the underlying low dimensional structure of a torus. Robots are ideal for this research because they allow for `actual' pedestrian data (parameter readings taken directly from their control systems) to be compared with the data collected through video recordings of their actions. This allowed the global structure of the set of real head/gaze images to be strengthened through alignment with an artificially generated torus-shaped head rotation dataset. In a step towards bridging the discomfort gap that must be overcome before integrating robots into everyday society, an affective processing system was implemented on a humanoid robot using visual features from the environment in an on-line learning process that allows the robot to adapt closely to the user's unique emotional status. The environmental emotion detection system allows the robot to predict the user's feelings, to help increase the user's level of comfort in interacting with the robot in various situations. Future works will also include the extension of the environmental emotion detection system, including comparisons and simulations with other learning techniques such as alignment of manifolds of different features. Gestalt psychology states that the brain is holistic, parallel, and analogue, with <b>self-organizing</b> tendencies. Hence <b>machine</b> learning techniques, specifically manifold learning and alignment parallels with these fundamental concepts of the brain. It is important for the robots to learn and adapt in a similar fashion, so robots one day can achieve cognition, {{in the same manner as}} human beings...|$|R
