International Journal of Remote Sensing, 31 (15), 4033 - 4047. A time series of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images (AST 08) have been processed to allow radiative heat flux estimations of the Nisyros volcano. ASTER night-time images were acquired on four different dates: 7 April 2001, 13 June 2002, 26 October 2002 and 23 July 2005. The results show a steady state energy release with heat fluxes ranging from 15 to 30 W m- 2 over the craters of Kaminakia, Polyvotis and Stefanos, respectively. It {{is suggested that}} this range of values indicates a background heat flux of this volcano following the unrest of 1995 - 1997, and that the volcano has entered again into the quiet phase. Also, {{on the basis of}} the average spatial extent of the thermal anomaly a total radiative heat flux of 36 MW was estimated at the moment of ASTER overpass. Heat flux values for Nisyros are in good agreement with other published estimates derived from low-temperature fumarolic volcanoes (Stromboli and Vulcano, Italy) using Landsat TM data. It is also evidenced that the ASTER radiometer can be used as an important imaging tool for the monitoring of geophysical properties associated to volcanic activity, as is the volcanic heat flux.

5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum).

5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, <b>sea</b> <b>aster</b> and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
