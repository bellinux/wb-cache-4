25|$|The {{story has}} also been adapted into film many times. The {{earliest}} is probably the 1909 French film Tristan et Yseult, an early, silent version of the story. This was followed by another French film {{of the same name}} two years later, which offered a unique addition to the <b>story.</b> <b>Here,</b> it is Tristan's jealous slave Rosen who tricks the lovers into drinking the love potion, then denounces them to Mark. Mark has pity on the two lovers, but they commit double suicide anyway. A third silent French version appeared in 1920, and follows the legend fairly closely.|$|E
25|$|The Medinah Athletic Club {{building}} {{was intended to}} combine elements of many architectural styles. At the eighth floor, its Indiana limestone facade was decorated by three large relief carvings in ancient Assyrian style. Each frieze depicted a different scene {{in the order of}} constructing a building, with Contribution on the south wall, Wisdom represented on the west wall and Consecration on the north. (According to an article in the Chicago Tribune from Sept 16, 1928 entitled “Building art inspires panels”:“The friezes were designed by George Unger, in collaboration with Walter Ahlschlager, and carved by Léon Hermant. The figures are costumed in the period of the building, which is that of an old fortress in Mesopotamia in Xerxes time, about 5th century BC. The theme of the panels as explained by Mr. Unger, was inspired by the history of construction of any building. The south panel starts the <b>story.</b> <b>Here</b> a magnificent cortege is displayed. This panel, termed Contribution, signifies the getting together of treasures for the construction of the building. In the west panel, facing Michigan Avenue, a ruler is shown with his counselors and an architect is shown bringing in a model of the building planned. The north panel shows the consecration of the building after it has been built. A priest is sacrificing a white bull whose blood will be mixed with crushed grapes and poured into the earth. A monkey trainer and his animals are shown. Since the animals represented bigotry in the ancient drawings, they are shown here in leash as symbolic belief that bigotry has no place in the Masonic order.”) The figures in all three scenes are said to be modeled after the faces of club members {{at the time of its}} design. Three Sumerian warriors were also carved into the facade at the twelfth-floor setback, directly above the Michigan Avenue entrance, and remain visible today.|$|E

500|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by television commentators. Bex Schwartz of Rolling Stone opined that the installment {{was an excellent}} and well-written episode, proclaiming that it [...] "balanced zombie action with human drama". In his B grade review for the episode, Zack Halden of The A.V. Club felt that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] {{was one of the}} second season's more solid attempts; [...] "While there's no question this is still serialized, the <b>story</b> <b>here</b> had a clear beginning, middle, and end, and we stay focused the whole time on two plot arcs: Rick and Shane deciding what to do with Randall [...] while Lori, Maggie, and Andrea deal in their own individual ways with Beth’s desire to kill herself." [...] Halden resumed that it made him hopeful of future installments of The Walking Dead. Matt Barone of Complex, Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun, and IGN's Eric Goldman asserted that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was one of the series' best episodes, while The Star-Ledger Mark Mauer thought that it was redundant, ultimately concluding that [...] "it indulged in another subplot centered on a petty argument". Goldman professed that the episodic direction was more focused than previous installments. Concluding his review, he gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. SFX journalist Ian Berriman echoed analogous sentiments, inevitably issuing [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] a four-and-a-half star rating. He called it the season's best episode, and wrote that it was filled with [...] "action, explosive arguments, [...] difficult decisions".|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{selected}} as [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] in the Sunday Age, where Michael Gordon wrote: [...] "This is not the whole story, {{but it is a}} well-researched and superbly presented summary of the story so far – a kind of companion to the John Lennon book, 'Imagine' – including the temper tantrums. Fans may, however, disagree with the closing assessment that Morrison may be running out of themes and ideas to express." [...] Publishers Weekly was critical of the book's tone, commenting: [...] "Turner is more adulatory than probing." [...] The review noted: [...] "A complete discography makes this book a necessity for fans of the Irish Rover." [...] Writing for The Boston Globe, Thomas C. Palmer Jr. called the book [...] "a coffee-table biography that fills an extensive void, both for those hungry for gossip and for those who have wondered at the source of the creativity in this prolific producer of often stunningly original – if difficult to categorize – music". Palmer commented on the book's value: [...] "The value of the book is that it has at its heart the same subjects that most of Morrison's music has featured, subtly or otherwise (but never as blatantly as Dylan in his [...] "Saved" [...] period): religion and spirituality." [...] Robert Sandall reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Steve Turner has performed his task as a biographer diligently enough in Too Late To Stop Now, but the really interesting <b>story</b> <b>here</b> is told by the photographs." [...] Sandall commented: [...] "Thirty years of constant rowing with anybody who has ever tried to get close to him, and a fitful and irritable hankering after religion (any religion) have left him looking bloated, sad and, as Turner has the courage and decency to point out, not as great a musician now as his current reputation would suggest.

2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2013 that {{networks}} are challenging traditional hierarchies. Value chains {{may also be}} breaking up ("deconstructing") where information aspects can be separated from functional activity. Data that is readily available for free or very low cost {{makes it harder for}} information-based, vertically integrated businesses to remain intact. Evans said: [...] "The basic <b>story</b> <b>here</b> is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening? It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate." [...] He used Wikipedia {{as an example of a}} network that has challenged the traditional encyclopedia business model. Evans predicts the emergence of a new form of industrial organization called a [...] "stack", analogous to a technology stack, in which competitors rely on a common platform of inputs (services or information), essentially layering the remaining competing parts of their value chains on top of this common platform.|$|E
2500|$|Like many genre authors, Carl perfected her craft at {{the short}} fiction level.... I {{was delighted to}} find Carl's most {{important}} stories collected {{here for the first}} time.... Of the 11 stories contained here, all have some sort of underlying mythic/historical theme, which is Carl's forté.... Perhaps the most ambitious <b>story</b> <b>here</b> is [...] "From the Labyrinth of Night." [...] A Martian exploration setup is developed nicely with rich allusions to the Minotaur legends of ancient Crete, culminating in the [...] "sacrifice" [...] demanded by the beast in the maze. The interpersonal relationships are the real driving force to the narrative, as by this point, the astronauts' explorations are mechanical efforts done out of habit more than enthusiasm.... "Upon this Shoal of Time" [...] is another ambitious science fiction story cloaked in the trappings of mythology. This time, Carl takes the reader to a far-future archaeological dig, where real science is dependent upon the financial sponsorship of media conglomerates hopeful of unearthing exclusive rights to digs that capture the public fancy, King Tut-style. After unearthing an intact Pictish skull from a Scottish burial site in Cawdor, Dr. James Henderson subjects it to a series of elaborate processes, each one designed to unlock lost memories from the subject at the sub-atomic level. His experiment is far more successful than he'd ever dreamed. At turns disturbing and impressive, with MacBethian overtones, Carl crafts a moving tale around the strength and impact memories can have on a person. One of the strongest stories presented here — the fuzzy science of the premise is presented smoothly and logically, detracting nothing from the narrative.|$|E
