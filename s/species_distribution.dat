5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the summer {{roosting}} locations of this species, as well as where maternal colonies are formed, which makes a proper <b>species</b> <b>distribution</b> estimate difficult to obtain. The first study into the summer roosting habits was only done in 2011 so information is scarce. This study performed by Johnson, Kiser and Peterson discovered that these bats most commonly use ground level rock roosts in talus slopes, rock fields and vertical cliff faces for their summer roosts. On average they change their roosts every 1.1 days, males travel about 41 meters between consecutive roosts and females around 67 meters. They also found that females roosting sites were closer to ephemeral water sources than male’s roosts. Females who have young require roost sites that receive a lot of sunlight in order to keep the pups warm while the mother is away from the nesting site. Summer roosting habitats are very difficult to find, and may be threatened by mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, sprawl highway construction, wind energy and other forms of agricultural, industrial and residential development. However, it is also likely that some of the above disturbances could also create roosting sites for the species.|$|E

We investigated the role of edaphic variation in explaining the distributions of three native bunchgrass species (Bromus carinatus, Elymus glaucus and Nassella pulchra) among central California mainland and island grasslands. The relative contribution of soil properties and spatial variation to native grass species abundance was estimated using canonical redundancy analysis, with subsequent testing of individual variables identified in ordination. Soil variables predicted a significant proportion (22 - 27 %) {{of the variation in}} <b>species</b> <b>distributions.</b> Abiotic soil properties that drive <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> included serpentine substrates and soil texture. Biotic properties that correlated with <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> were ammonium and nitrogen mineralization rates.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{there has been a}} rapid {{proliferation}} of statistical methods that infer evolutionary and ecological processes from data on <b>species</b> <b>distributions.</b> These methods have led to considerable new insights, but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day <b>species</b> <b>distributions.</b> Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the <b>distributions</b> of <b>species</b> within a clade, this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity. In this opinion article, we discuss ways in which patterns of <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> driven by historical biogeography are often interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary or ecological processes. We focus on three areas that are especially prone to such misinterpretations: community phylogenetics, environmental niche modelling, and analyses of beta diversity (compositional turnover of biodiversity). 9 page(s...|$|R
25|$|The {{horizontal}} distribution of springtail species {{is affected by}} environmental factors which act at the landscape scale, such as soil acidity, moisture and light. Requirements for pH can be reconstructed experimentally. Altitudinal changes in <b>species</b> <b>distribution</b> can be at least partly explained by increased acidity at higher elevation. Moisture requirements, among other ecological and behavioural factors, explain why some species cannot live aboveground, or retreat in the soil during dry seasons, but also why some epigeal springtails are always found {{in the vicinity of}} ponds and lakes, such as the hygrophilous Isotomurus palustris. Adaptive features, such as the presence of a fan-like wettable mucro, allow some species to move at the surface of water (Sminthurides aquaticus, Sminthurides malmgreni). Podura aquatica, a unique representative of the family Poduridae (and one of the first springtails to have been described by Linnaeus), spends its entire life at the surface of water, its wettable eggs dropping in water until the non-wettable first instar hatches then surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The Cape Dwarf Chameleon is {{currently}} experiencing habitat loss and fragmentation of its natural habitat through causes such as urbanization and agriculture. The historical habitat of Bradypodion pumilum has recently become severely fragmented due to intense urbanization and agricultural transformation. This trend is continuing with approximately 6.5 square kilometers of undeveloped land becoming lost to {{transformation in the}} Cape Town municipal area per year. Additional losses are expected to occur because of rapid climatic changes near Cape town {{which is where the}} species is primarily distributed. In urban areas, Cape Dwarf Chameleons are limited to planted vegetation, usually nonindigenous species, and patches of highly disturbed habitat. Populations are often found living in the overgrowth of exotic vegetation on road verges, abandoned urban ground, riverine thickets, or residential areas. Part of the <b>species</b> <b>distribution</b> lies in habitats that are protected by provincial parks, national parks, and private reserves. This protected area only amounts to 40% of the total area of occupancy. Most of the shrubland found in these protected areas are fire-prone, and natural fires are known to be detrimental to dwarf chameleon populations.|$|E
25|$|Generally, American {{black bears}} are largely crepuscular in {{foraging}} activity, though may actively feed at any time. Up to 85% {{of the black}} bear's diet consists of vegetation, though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots, bulbs, corms and tubers than the latter species. When initially emerging from hibernation, they will seek to feed on carrion from winter-killed animals and newborn ungulates. As the spring temperature warms, black bears seek new shoots of many plant species, especially new grasses, wetland plants and forbs. Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are also especially important to black bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time. During summer, the diet largely comprises fruits, especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes. During the autumn hyperphagia, feeding becomes virtually the full-time task of black bears. Hard masts {{become the most important}} part of the black bear's diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the <b>species</b> <b>distribution.</b> Favored masts such as hazelnuts, oak acorns and whitebark pine nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single black bear during fall. During the fall period, American black bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels. Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries. Black bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often come to rely on foods inadvertently provided by humans, especially during summertime. These include refuse, birdseed, agricultural products and honey from apiaries.|$|E
40|$|Physiological {{responses}} to temperature {{are known to}} be a major determinant of <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> and can dictate the sensitivity of populations to global warming. In contrast, little is known about how other major global change drivers, such as ocean acidification (OA), will shape <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> in the future. Here, by integrating population genetics with experimental data for growth and mineralization, physiology and metabolomics, we demonstrate that the sensitivity of populations of the gastropod Littorina littorea to future OA is shaped by regional adaptation. Individuals from populations towards the edges of the natural latitudinal range in the Northeast Atlantic exhibit greater shell dissolution and the inability to upregulate their metabolism when exposed to low pH, thus appearing most sensitive to low seawater pH. Our results suggest that future levels of OA could mediate temperature-driven shifts in <b>species</b> <b>distributions,</b> thereby influencing future biogeography and the functioning of marine ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|<b>Species</b> <b>distributions</b> {{have often}} been assumed to {{represent}} climatic limitations, yet recent evidence has challenged these assumptions and emphasized the potential importance of biotic interactions, dispersal limitation, and disturbance. Despite significant investigation into these factors, an integrated understanding of where and when they may be important is lacking.

We further demonstrate that available evidence offers little indication of a significant, independent influence of biotic interactions or dispersal limitation on <b>species</b> <b>distributions.</b> Disturbance may provide important constraints on distributions in limited contexts. Overall, historic and contemporary evidence suggests that <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> are strongly influenced by climate, yet examples of disequilibrium with climate abound.

However, no study has quantitatively measured the effects of recent human impact on the effects of past <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> in Vietnam. We use locality data collected from multiple natural history collections, including several in Vietnam, to infer past <b>species</b> <b>distributions.</b> We assess habitat availability of five common babbler species (Aves: Timaliidae) using distribution models with data prior to rapid development that followed political reform. Overlaying the Global Human Influence Index with predicted distributions highlights the human impact on these distributions. Three important patterns emerge: (1) human impact influences common Timaliidae distributions similarly, (2) widespread <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> show higher fragmentation due to human influence compared to narrowly distributed species in Vietnam, and (3) less than 20 % of distributions overlap with nationally declared protected areas. We emphasize that conservation efforts should not only prioritize individual species, but also focus efforts on a regional scale, and that the use of museum data can be highly informative in conservation analyses. There are current obstacles to enforcing conservation of Vietnam’s already fragmented habitats, but our results suggest there is still time to reevaluate conservation approaches...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{interactions}} between mobile <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> and landcover characteristics remains an outstanding challenge in ecology. Multiple factors could explain <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> including endogenous evolutionary traits leading to conspecific clustering and endogenous habitat features that support life history requirements. Birds are a useful taxon for examining hypotheses {{about the relative}} importance of these factors among species in a community. We developed a hierarchical Bayes approach to model the relationships between bird species occupancy and local landcover variables accounting for spatial autocorrelation, species similarities, and partial observability. We fit alternative occupancy models to detections of 90 bird species observed during repeat visits to 316 point-counts forming a 400 -m grid throughout the Patuxent Wildlife Research Refuge in Maryland, USA. Models with landcover variables performed significantly better than our autologistic and null models, supporting the hypothesis that local landcover heterogeneity is important as an exogenous driver for <b>species</b> <b>distributions.</b> Conspecific clustering alone was a comparatively poor descriptor of local community composition, but there was evidence for spatial autocorrelation in all species. Considerable uncertainty remains whether landcover combined with spatial autocorrelation is most parsimonious for describing bird <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> at a local scale. Spatial structuring may be weaker at intermediate scales within which dispersal is less frequent, information flows are localized, and landcover types become spatially diversified and therefore exhibit little aggregation.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Climate change poses a {{significant}} threat to biodiversity. Increasing {{the number and}} size of protected areas {{is one of the}} most frequently cited approaches to addressing this threat. However, because climate change is already shifting <b>species</b> <b>distributions,</b> traditional reserve-selection strategies that rely on current patterns of biodiversity may be ineffective. One commonly suggested alternative is to protect geophysical diversity, or the various edaphic, topographic, elevational, and geographical features of a landscape. As climate change continues to drive changes in <b>species</b> <b>distributions,</b> geophysically diverse landscapes may have the potential to provide the habitat heterogeneity needed to accommodate new ranges of species. We use projected climate-driven shifts in <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> to compare the effectiveness of reserve networks designed to increase the representation of today’s <b>species</b> <b>distributions</b> to the effectiveness of reserve networks built to increase the protection of geophysical diversity. Reserve networks built with biological targets protected up to 18 % more species than reserve networks built with geophysical targets and geophysical networks protected few more species than did randomly selected networks. These patterns were consistent across future climate scenarios with varying levels of change. Our results indicate that prioritizing areas for protection based on current patterns of biodiversity is likely to be more effective at protecting future patterns of biodiversity than prioritizing areas based on geophysical diversity...|$|R
