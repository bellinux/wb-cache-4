To know {{the properties of}} the signal(s) for chloroplast accumulation movement, we examined the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> signal <b>transferred</b> from light-irradiated area to chloroplasts in gametophytes of Adiantum capillus-veneris. When dark-adapted gametophyte cells were irradiated with a microbeam of various light intensities of red or blue light for 1 min or continuously, the chloroplasts started to move towards the irradiated area. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> signal <b>transfer</b> was calculated from the relationship between the timing of start moving and the distance of chloroplasts from the microbeam and was found to be constant at any light conditions. In prothallial cells, the speed was about 1. 0 µm min− 1 and in protonemal cells about 0. 7 µm min− 1 towards base and about 2. 3 µm min− 1 towards the apex.

Connecting distributed computers to a powerful metacomputer via a network, sufficient power can be achieved.

One of the most powerful middleware tools which emerged in the recent years is the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA); CORBA is well suited for coarse grain problems on heterogeneous systems. But because of performance, many programmers prefer using more traditional middleware tools like the Message Passing Interface (MPI) or Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM).

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} state of {{thinking}} on the governance role of public ownership and control. We argue that the transfer of operational control over productive assets {{to the private sector}} represents the most desirable governance, due to the inherent difficulty for citizens to constrain political abuse relative to the ability of governments to regulate private activity. However in weak institutional environments the process needs to be structured so as to avoid capture of the regulatory process. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> should be timed on the progress in developing a strong regulatory governance system, to which certain residual rights of intervention must be vested. After all, what are “institutions” if not governance mechanisms with some degree of autonomy from both political and private interests? The gradual creation of institutions partially autonomous from political power must become central to the development of an optimal mode of regulatory governance. We advance some suggestions about creating accountability in regulatory governance, in particular creating an internal control system based on a rotating board representative of users, producers and civil society, to be elected by a process involving frequent reporting and disclosure.

40|$|The author {{reviews the}} state of {{thinking}} on the governance role of state ownership. He argues that a gradual transfer of operational control and financial claims over state assets remains the most desirable goal, but {{it needs to be}} paced to avoid regulatory capture, and the capture of the privatization process itself. In addition, the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> should be timed on the progress in developing a strong regulatory governance system, to which certain residual rights of intervention must be vested. In many countries institutional weakness limits regulatory capacity and reliability, yet the author's conclusion is that in such environments, maintaining state control undermines the very emergence of institutional capacity, and so the balance should tip toward progressively less direct state control. After all, what are"institutions"if not governance mechanisms with some degree of autonomy from both political and private interests? The gradual creation of institutions partially autonomous from political power must become central to the development of an optimal mode of regulatory governance.

The limiting factor for the frame rate and measurement duration in whole field laser Doppler perfusion imaging is the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> and analysis of data.

Our algorithm works in the time domain and estimates perfusion through simple time differentiations and multiplications of speckle image values. The algorithm is partly based on mathematical reasoning, and partly on a hypothesis that cannot be proven with rigorous mathematics. We will compare our algorithm with the frequency-domain counterpart for phantom studies involving static and dynamic media, and in vivo experiments on human skin. It is found that both algorithms, applied on the same dataset, approximately give the same perfusion estimations. The random differences {{are similar to the}} random variations found in tissue perfusion. Systematic differences between the algorithms smaller than 15 % are found. The algorithm is currently twice as fast as the FFT-counterpart. Another advantage is that our algorithm can be included in a moving average scheme, where a new perfusion value can be determined based on the previous value and a small number of new raw speckle image...|$|E

In a text file, redundant data can be frequently occurring characters or common vowels. This research involves a comparative performance analysis of Huffman and Delta Compression schemes. A compression program is used to convert data from an easy-to-use format (ASCII) to one optimized for compactness. Huffman and Delta algorithms were implemented using C#. Result was also presented on the efficiency of the former based on three parameters: the number of bit, compression ratio and percentage of compression. It was discovered that Huffman algorithm for data compression performs better, since it can store / transmit the least number of bits. The average compression percentage for Huffman and Delta algorithm was found to be 39 % and 45 % respectively. Which simply implies that for a large text file, Huffman algorithm will achieve a 39 % reduction in the file size and as such increase the capacity of the storage medium...|$|E

Three variables including handedness, time lagges, and skill complexity were studied. This study was a semi-empirical and applied research and a pretest-posttest plan with two experimental groups was used. Statistical sample included 28 volunteer girl students, {{with a mean age}} of 16 ± 0. 93 years old, who were all right-handed and had no experience of performing the tracking task. After initial familiarization with designed software, the subjects were randomly divided into two groups of right practice and left practice. The results revealed significant effects of time lags and skill complexity on bidirectional transfer (p≤ 0. 05), as at all stages of research more bidirectional transfer was observed in easy task compared with the hard one. The highest bilateral transfer in easy and hard tasks was found in the second and the seventh day, respectively. Possible reasons for these results include the differences in task processing in terms of skill complexity and the impact of special features of continuous task on retention. Transfer from non-dominant hand to dominant one occurred more frequently than the reverse mode in both groups, which is probably due to higher <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> of data from the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere in the right-handed...|$|E
