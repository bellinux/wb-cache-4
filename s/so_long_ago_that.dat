5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was not <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked in}} August 2017 about a {{possible}} reunion with a classic Savatage lineup (with Chris Caffery filling in for the late Criss Oliva on guitar), original drummer Steve [...] "Doc" [...] Wacholz mentioned a Savatage tour taking place in 2018. However, he stated, [...] "I really can't imagine them having TWO drummers on stage, so Jeff will be doing the drumming duties on his own (which he does a great job), although I would love to finish what I started with the Oliva's <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>That</b> {{would be a great}} accomplishment, but I do not see it happening." ...|$|E
2500|$|Strabo {{uses the}} astronomical cubit (pēchus, {{the length of}} the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the little finger) as a measure of the {{elevation}} of the sun. The term [...] "cubit" [...] in this context is obscure; {{it has nothing to do}} with distance along either a straight line or an arc, does not apply to celestial distances, and has nothing to do with the gnōmōn. Hipparchus borrowed this term from Babylonia, where it meant 2°. They in turn took it from ancient Sumer <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> if the connection between cubits and degrees was known in either Babylonia or Ionia it did not survive. Strabo states degrees in either cubits or as a proportion of a great circle. The Greeks also used the length of day at the summer solstice as a measure of latitude. It is stated in equinoctial hours (hōrai isēmerinai), one being 1/12 of the time between sunrise and sunset on an equinox.|$|E
60|$|Does {{all this}} seem to you mere truism, my dear reader? If so, I am {{sincerely}} {{glad to hear}} it. It was not <b>so</b> very <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> such arguments {{would have been considered}} not only no truisms, but not even common sense.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{it was not}} <b>so</b> very <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> Bella {{had been}} fluttered by the {{discovery}} that this same Secretary and lodger seem to like her. Ah! but the eminently aristocratic mansion and Mrs Boffin's dressmaker had not come into play then.|$|R

6000|$|... "Know it!" [...] exclaimed Joe, [...] "I {{should think}} we do. Why, it's not <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> I picked one up myself. But what were ye goin' to say, mate?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was all so}} remote, {{it seemed}} <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> {{he had wanted to}} find an excuse for meeting Claire again, that for a moment Bill hesitated in actual perplexity, and before he could speak Elizabeth had {{answered}} the question for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I {{told him}} nothing about it. He {{gave me the}} key, and desired me to fetch him all the papers. He {{wanted to find a}} letter which uncle Karil wrote him ever <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> In <b>that</b> letter uncle Karil {{acknowledges}} that he has the deed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see?" [...] Sherikov {{snapped the}} screen off. [...] "You were down there, not <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> All <b>that</b> noise and smoke--all for you. All for you, Mr. Variable Man from the past. Reinhart {{arranged}} that, to finish you off. I {{want you to}} understand that. It's very important that you realize that." ...|$|R
60|$|After we {{had left}} the {{sanctuary}} I asked Harût when this figure was brought to their land. He replied that it came when they came, at what date he could not tell us as it was <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> and <b>that</b> with it came the worship and the ceremonies of their religion.|$|R
6000|$|... “We {{must not}} forget,” replied Louise, “that {{of all our}} {{numerous}} states California has the most romantic history. It wasn’t <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> the Spanish don flourished in this section and even yet it is more Spanish than American except in the big cities.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{something}} of the sort," [...] mumbled Martin, [...] "but it is <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> it slips my mind. I was so often in broils and drunk in those days--may the dear Lord forgive me--that I can't quite remember things. And now, by your leave, I {{want to go to}} sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Scenes and Characters' was, however, {{published}} <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>that</b> {{the young}} {{readers of this}} generation certainly will only know it if it has {{had the good fortune}} to have been preserved by their mothers. It was only my second book, and in looking back at it so as to preserve consistency, I have been astonished at its crudeness.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{course they}} all knew that the {{sergeant}} knew that Nokes had been with them. [...] "Well, then, that wasn't all," [...] said old Brownbie. [...] "Bill Nokes was here, whom Heathcote dismissed ever <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> and <b>that</b> Chinese cook of his. He dismissed him too, I suppose. And he dismissed Boscobel here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He pretends he knew {{it three}} days ago!" [...] said Crocker, as he {{returned}} to his room. [...] "I don't believe a word of it. He'd have written to me had it been known <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> as <b>that.</b> I suppose he had too many things to think of, or he would have written to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 69. In {{the light}} and {{encouragement}} of this word I went a pretty while; and the comfort was the more, when I thought that the Lord Jesus should think on me <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> and <b>that</b> He should speak those words on purpose for my sake; for I did think verily, that He did on purpose speak them to encourage me withal.|$|R
6000|$|... "My name is Zikali, {{which means}} 'Weapons,' White Man. You {{know as much}} as that, don't you?" [...] he answered. [...] "My father 'went down' <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> his does not matter. I am a dwarf, very ugly, with some learning, as we of the Black House {{understand}} it, and very old. Is there anything else you would like to learn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "they cannot {{read them}} all; {{but they may}} wish to consult them. There are often {{particular}} reasons for seeing some particular book, which was published <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> it is not now {{to be found in}} common bookstores; in such cases, people come here, and they are pretty sure to find the book in this collection." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{from the}} skies that they look down, those eyes which once read the [...] "Voices of the Night" [...] from the same book with us, how long ago! <b>So</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> one was half-frightened by {{the legend of the}} [...] "Beleaguered City."

60|$|GENTLEMEN AND DOCTORS,--I {{am glad to}} {{be among}} my own kind to-night. I was once a sharpshooter, but now I {{practise}} a much higher and equally as deadly a profession.

6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{cried the}} girl, [...] "that {{must have been}} Lance Radcliffe. I was with him when the scar was made--ever <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> We heard <b>that</b> he was dead. But you said his name was Pattinson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel it, as {{you always}} {{make me feel}} everything, just as you do; so that I know ten miles off how you feel! But do you remember," [...] she asked, [...] "apropos of great gold cups, the {{beautiful}} one, the real one, that I offered you <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> and <b>that</b> you wouldn't have? Just before your marriage"--she brought it back to him: [...] "the gilded crystal bowl in the little Bloomsbury shop." ...|$|R
60|$|Were {{the heirs}} of George Fisher killed? No. They are back now {{at this very}} time (July, 1870), beseeching Congress through that {{blushing}} and diffident creature, Garrett Davis, to commence making payments again on their interminable and insatiable bill of damages for corn and whisky destroyed by a gang of irresponsible Indians, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> even government red-tape has failed to keep consistent and intelligent track of it.|$|E
60|$|And in Malaga, for me, {{the women}} are more lovely than in Seville; for their dark eyes glitter marvellously, and their lips, so red and soft, are ever {{trembling}} with a half-formed smile. They are more graceful than the daffodils, their hands are lovers' sighs, and their voice is a caressing song. (What was your voice like, Rosarito? Alas! it is <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> I forget.) The men are tall and slender, with strong, clear features and shining eyes, deep sunken in their sockets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lenore, it's {{not been}} <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> {{right here in}} this room Jim begged me to let him enlist. He wasn't of age. But would I let him go--to fight for the honor of our country--for the future safety of our home?... We all felt the boy's eagerness, his fire, his patriotism. Wayward as he's been, we {{suddenly}} were proud of him. We let him go. We gave him up. He was a part of our flesh an' blood--sent by us Andersons--to do our share." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{speak from}} experience; {{for it was}} not <b>so</b> very <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that,</b> {{in the north of}} Devon, I found sermons, not indeed in stones, but in a {{creature}} reputed among the most worthless of sea-vermin. I had been lounging about all the morning on the little pier, waiting, {{with the rest of the}} village, for a trawling breeze which would not come. Two o'clock was past, and still the red mainsails of the skiffs hung motionless, and their images quivered head downwards in the glassy swell, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{let me finish}} what I have got to say. I will be as brief as I can. That is my case as regards Bill. Now about myself. What do you think I am made of? I've stood it {{just as long as}} I could; you have tried me too hard. I'm through. Heaven knows why it should have come to this. It is not <b>so</b> very <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> Bill was half the world to you and I was the other half. Now, apparently, there is not room in your world for either of us." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh! for a {{refreshing}} glimpse of one blade of grass—for a snuff at {{the fragrance of}} a handful of the loamy earth! Is there nothing fresh around us? Is there no green thing to be seen? Yes, the inside of our bulwarks is painted green; but what a vile and sickly hue it is, as if nothing bearing even the semblance of verdure could flourish this weary way from land. Even the bark that once clung to the wood we use for fuel has been gnawed off and devoured by the captain’s pig; and <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> too, <b>that</b> the pig himself has in turn been devoured.|$|R
6000|$|She had never, she thought, been so {{addressed}} {{as a young}} lady, not even by Sir Claude the day, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>that</b> she found him with Mrs. Beale. It struck her as the way that at balls, by delightful partners, young ladies must be spoken to in the intervals of dances; {{and she tried to}} think of something that would meet it at the same high point. But this effort flurried her, and all she could produce was: [...] "At first, you know, I thought you were Lord Eric." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{house is}} old. Seventy years since, {{from the heart}} of the Hearth Stone Hills, they quarried the Kaaba, or Holy Stone, to which, each Thanksgiving, the social pilgrims used to come. <b>So</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>that,</b> in digging for the foundation, the workmen used both spade and axe, {{fighting}} the Troglodytes of those subterranean parts--sturdy roots of a sturdy wood, encamped upon what is now a long land-slide of sleeping meadow, sloping away off from my poppy-bed. Of that knit wood, but one survivor stands--an elm, lonely through steadfastness.|$|E
60|$|The last {{lava flow}} {{occurred}} here <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> {{there are none}} now living who witnessed it. In one place it enclosed and burned down a grove of cocoa-nut trees, and {{the holes in the}} lava where the trunks stood are still visible; their sides retain the impression of the bark; the trees fell upon the burning river, and becoming partly submerged, left in it the perfect counterpart of every knot and branch and leaf, and even nut, for curiosity seekers of a long distant day to gaze upon and wonder at.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] Amuba assented; [...] "but {{you must}} {{remember}} it is not <b>so</b> very <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> we were a people living in tents, and wandering at will in search of pasture, and we have not, I think, become effeminate because we have settled down and built towns. No one {{can say that the}} Egyptians are not brave; certainly it is not for us to say so, though I agree with you that physically they are not our equals. See how the people stare and point at us, Jethro. I should think they have never seen a race like ours with blue eyes and fair hair, though even among them there are varying shades of darkness. The nobles and upper classes are lighter in hue than the common people." ...|$|R
6000|$|Although it {{took place}} <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> I suppose <b>that</b> a good many people still {{remember}} the case of [...] "The Queen versus Therne," [...] which attracted {{a great deal of}} attention at the time. The prosecution, as I have said, was set on foot by the relations of the deceased Lady Colford, who, being very rich and powerful people, were able to secure the advocacy of one of the most eminent criminal lawyers of the day, with whom were briefed sundry almost equally eminent juniors. Indeed no trouble or expense was spared that could help to ensure my conviction.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{different}} with the Indians," [...] Harry continued. [...] "One fellow made a fish spear ever <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> and found <b>that</b> it wouldn't do. He made {{the next one}} different and was satisfied with it, but his son made it a little longer and thinner. Then his grandson altered the barb, and his son added another one. After that each fellow made it a little handier, until nothing more {{could be done to}} it, and they stuck to the pattern." [...] He turned and glanced at the spear. [...] "This thing is the product of the skill of ever so many generations." ...|$|R
