25|$|In {{the story}} of Daniel in the lions' den (Daniel 6), Daniel has {{continued}} to serve at the royal court under Darius, and has been raised to high office. His jealous rivals plot his downfall, tricking Darius into issuing a decree that no prayers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> any god or man but to Darius himself, on pain of death. Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and Darius, although deeply distressed, must condemn him to be thrown into the lions' den because the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and Daniel tells him that his God sent an angel to save him. Darius commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children.|$|E
500|$|At its introduction, The Woman's Bible {{was widely}} criticized in editorials {{and from the}} pulpit. Stanton wrote that [...] "the clergy denounced it {{as the work of}} Satan..." [...] Some were put off just by its prejudicial, sacrilegious title, {{especially}} those who did not take the time to read the book. Others countered the book's more extreme conclusions one by one in public fora such as letters to the editor. One female reader of The New York Times wrote to decry The Woman's Bible for its radical statements that the Trinity was composed of [...] "a Heavenly Mother, Father, and Son", and that prayers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> an [...] "ideal Heavenly Mother". Mary Seymour Howell, a member of the Revising Committee, wrote to The New York Times in defense of the book, saying that its title could be better understood as [...] "The Woman's Commentary on the Women of the Bible". Stanton countered attacks by women readers, writing [...] "the only difference between us is, we say that these degrading ideas of woman emanated from the brain of man, while the church says that they came from God." ...|$|E

I heard, with pity and compassion, the repentant man devise a thousand little plans for her comfort and support when he returned; but I knew that many months before he could reach his place of destination, his mother would be no longer of this world. 'He was removed by night. A few weeks afterwards the poor woman's soul took its flight, I confidently hope, and solemnly believe, {{to a place of}} eternal happiness and rest. I performed the burial service over her remains. She lies in our little churchyard. There is no stone at her grave's head. Her sorrows were known to man; her virtues to God.

6000|$|About {{two years}} ago I was called upon by the younger part of a [...] country family, by my mother's side related to me, to visit Mr. [...] Campbell, the dumb man; for {{they told me that}} was chiefly what [...] brought them to town, having heard wonders of him in Essex. I, [...] who always wanted faith in such matters, was not easily prevailed [...] on to go; but lest they should take it ill, I went with them, [...] when, to my own surprise, Mr. Campbell related all their past [...] life; in short, had he not been prevented, such a {{discovery}} would [...] have come out, as would have ruined their next design of coming [...] to town, viz., buying wedding clothes. Our names, though he had [...] never heard of us before, and we endeavoured to conceal, were as [...] familiar to him as to ourselves. To be sure, Mr. Spectator, he is [...] a very learned and wise man. Being impatient to know my fortune, [...] having paid my respects in a family Jacobus, he told me, after [...] his manner, among several other things, that in a year and nine [...] months I should fall ill of a new fever, be given over by my [...] physicians, but should with much difficulty recover; that the [...] first time I took the air afterwards, I <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> by [...] a young gentleman of a plentiful fortune, good sense, and a [...] generous spirit. Mr. Spectator, he is the purest man in the [...] world, for all he said is come to pass, and I am the happiest she [...] in Kent. I have been in quest of Mr. Campbell these three months, [...] and cannot find him out; now hearing you are a dumb man too, I [...] thought you might correspond and be able to tell me something; [...] for I think myself highly obliged to make his fortune, as he has [...] mine.

[...] But he turned that {{sentiment}} over in his mind, endeavouring to ascertain {{what he would do}} if the offer of the exchange were made to him. For Dick was very poor, and at this moment was in great want of money. Sir Francis went into the smoking-room, and sitting there alone with a cigar in his mouth, meditated the letter which he would have to write. The letter <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Western, and was one which could not be written without much forethought. He not only must tell his story, but must give some reason more or less plausible for the telling of it. He did not think that he could at once make his idea of justice plain to Mr. Western. He could not put forth his case so clearly as to make the husband understand that all was done in fair honour and honesty. But as he thought of it, he {{came to the conclusion that}} he did not much care what impression he might leave on the mind of Mr. Western;--and still less what impression he might leave on hers. He might probably succeed in creating a quarrel, and he was of opinion that Mr. Western was a man who would not quarrel lightly, but, when he did, would quarrel very earnestly. Having thought it all over with great deliberation, he went up-stairs, and in twenty minutes had his letter written. At a quarter past four he was at the Waterloo Station to see the departure of Miss Altifiorla. Even he could perceive that she was somewhat brighter in her attire than when he had met her early in the morning. He could not say what had been done, but something had been added to please his eyes. The gloves were not the same, nor the ribbons; and he thought that he perceived that even the bonnet had been altered. Her manner too was changed. There was a careless ease and freedom about her which he rather liked; and he took it in good part that Miss Altifiorla had prepared herself for the interview, though he were to be with her but for a few minutes, and that she should be different from the Miss Altifiorla as she had come away from the Western breakfast table. [...] "Now there is one thing I want you to promise me," [...] she said as she gave him her hand.|$|E
