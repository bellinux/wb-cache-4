40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} is to obtain a method for {{determining}} the <b>capacity</b> <b>surge</b> arrester nonlinear absorb energy without breaking the heat balance in modes of long-term application of operating voltage, which allows for analysis of their work in terms of violations as electricity. Methodology. For values of the energy passing through the arrester must be able to determine the current value for the voltage value in the area of leakage current-voltage characteristics. We have carried out calculations of the energy passing everywhere arrester for certain periods of time based on the current-voltage characteristics obtained experimentally. Analysis of the experimental current-voltage characteristics of resistors and literature led to the important conclusion that the dielectric properties of the ceramic varistor affect the value of active power losses in the arrester only when the active component of the leakage current is very small. This is confirmed by the characteristics of different classes of varistor voltage. This property of varistors and surge arresters shows the need to consider how the dielectric and conductive properties of the varistor ceramics in the analysis of work in the area of the arrester leakage current-voltage characteristic. These results demonstrate the need to clarify the mathematical model and the method for determining the energy dissipates in the area of the arrester leakage current CVC with their account. Results.

40|$|Compressed {{air supply}} and demand {{strategies}} have received significant attention since integrated demand management was initiated by Eskom. Due to the expensive nature of this vastly utilised energy carrier, every increase in the efficiency of a system is needed. Usually controlling the compressed air demand resulted in a reduced need for supply, ultimately leading to energy savings. The majority of compressed air optimisation projects on deep level mines in South Africa utilise demand side management initiatives to control or reduce compressed air usage. However, reduction in usage through control, leak repairs and reduced demand often results in system pressure build up. Compressed air supply must also then be reduced accordingly using capacity controllers. The existing capacity control is typically upgraded to reduce compressor output capacity automatically. The problem encountered is that not all compressor controls are created equal, and they produce different results in terms of efficient supply reduction. Inefficient compressor control is frequently encountered in industry today. On average, compressors operate at 16 % below their maximum efficient point due to inefficient <b>surge</b> and <b>capacity</b> controllers. In contrast to this, intelligent compressor control resulted in compressors operating within 9 % of their maximum efficiency point.

40|$|Abstract. Molecular {{nanotechnology}} (MNT) promises new {{functions for}} engineered systems, such as fairly general purpose fabrication and disassembly. Systems designed afresh {{to take advantage}} of these new functions should offer original architectures. One compelling example is the ‘logical core architecture’, which uses subsystems providing general purpose manufacturing to enable a long-lived, very flexible system. This paper provides motivation for the logical core architecture, discussing systems architecting, the inclination of MNT to support polymorphic systems and the implications of using dynamic remanufacture of on-board components for reliability. It describes in detail the logical core architecture, which comprises four levels, the logical core, the physical core, the surge layer, and the external interface layer. The functions of the subsystems in each of these layers are presented. To illuminate the architecture’s capabilities, example operations are presented. Several are space mission profiles for systems using a logical core architecture for such tasks as multimode trajectories and asteroid mining, and several illustrate more general capabilities and flexibilities of the architecture. Basic equations are derived for reliability via on-board remanufacture of subcomponents and for <b>surging</b> functional <b>capacity.</b> The prospect of fundamentally new operating modes raises interesting questions regarding appropriate operating policies. Initial observations are offered on these novel problems. The paper concludes with a discussion of important open questions, including appropriate directions for further stepwise refinement of the architecture. 1...|$|R
