5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. The result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding {{the fact that there was}} a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E
5|$|Babangida's {{fortunes}} <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> {{towards the}} end of 1998. Having missed {{the start of the season}} with malaria, Babangida gradually lost his starting line-up position as Morten Olsen was looking to improve on the team's inconsistent performances both in the domestic league and in Europe. Babangida started two of his team's opening Champions League games. The European season, however, ended in disappointment as Ajax finished bottom of their group behind Olympiacos, Dinamo Zagreb and Porto. Overall, Babangida appeared in 18 league games for Ajax that season, starting only seven. He didn't feature in the Dutch Cup final where Ajax managed to retain the trophy after beating Fortuna Sittard in the final.|$|E

5|$|Maharashtraian Brahmins were {{absentee}} landlords {{and lived}} off the surplus without tilling the land themselves per ritual restrictions. They were {{often seen as}} the exploiter of the tiller. This situation <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> when the newly independent India enshrined in its constitution, agrarian or land reform. Between 1949–1959, the state governments started enacting legislation {{in accordance with the}} constitution implementing this agrarian reform or Kula Kayada in Marathi. The legislation led to the abolition of various absentee tenures like inams and jagirs. This implementation of land reform had mixed results in different States. On official inquiry, it was revealed that not all absentee tenures were abolished in the State of Maharashtra as of 1985. Other social and political issues include anti-Brahminism and the treatment of Dalits.|$|E
5|$|Upon its discovery, the Astronomica was read, commented upon, {{and edited}} {{by a number}} of scholars. Nevertheless, it failed to become as popular as other {{classical}} Latin poems and was neglected for centuries. This <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> during the early 20th century when, between 1903 and 1930, the classicist A. E. Housman published a critically acclaimed edition of the poem in five books. Housman's work was followed by the Latinist G. P. Goold's lauded English translation in 1977. Today, scholars consider the Astronomica to be highly technical, complicated, and occasionally contradictory; at the same time, many have praised Manilius's ability to translate complex mathematical computations into poetic verse.|$|E
5|$|Watford Football Club is an English {{football}} club from Watford, Hertfordshire. Formed as Watford Rovers in 1881, the club entered the FA Cup {{for the first}} time in 1886. In the same year, they also entered the county-wide Herts Senior Cup, reaching the final six times over the next ten years. Watford Rovers became West Hertfordshire in 1893, and joined the Southern League for the 189697 season. The team <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> from one composed entirely of amateurs to one including paid professionals. In 1898, West Hertfordshire merged with Watford St Mary's to form Watford Football Club.|$|E
50|$|The term {{degree is}} used in several scales of temperature. The symbol ° is usually used, {{followed}} by the initial letter of the unit, for example “°C” for degree(s) Celsius. A degree {{can be defined as}} a set change in temperature measured against a given scale, for example, one degree Celsius is one hundredth of the temperature change between the point at which water <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> state from solid to liquid state and the point at which it <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> from its gaseous state to liquid.|$|R

5|$|As in {{most other}} parts of the world, the decades {{following}} the World War II were relatively free from football violence and the supporter culture did not change much. Swedish football culture <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> in the late 1960s, becoming heavily inspired and influenced by the English supporter culture. This flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, giving birth {{to some of the most}} well-known Swedish supporters clubs, AIK's Black Army, Djurgårdens IF's Blue Saints (later Järnkaminerna), and IFK Göteborg's supporters club, Änglarna (the Angels). The first attempt to found an IFK supporters club was made in 1969, but interest diminished when IFK Göteborg were relegated from the highest league the following year. The supporters club was not re-founded until 1973, which is considered the year of foundation of Änglarna.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had shown}} {{independence}} in political matters {{as early as}} 1255, when he sided with the Soler family in Gascony, in the ongoing conflict between the Soler and Colomb families. This ran contrary to his father's policy of mediation between the local factions. In May 1258, a group of magnates drew up a document for reform of the King’s government – the so-called Provisions of Oxford – largely directed against the Lusignans. Edward stood by his political allies and strongly opposed the Provisions. The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward's attitude <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> In March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance {{with one of the}} main reformers, Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. Then, on 15October 1259, he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally a pro-market {{economy and}} pro-EU centre-right party, the NCP were the largest {{party in the}} {{parliament}} {{for the first time}} in its history, though losing seats since the 2007 election. Although leading in the opinion polls for several years, it started to see some loss of support after the rise of the True Finns. Despite being founded as a primarily conservative party, an analysis on the party's programmes made by an NCP-affiliated think tank concluded that in the 2000s the liberal wing had gained the upper hand and had <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the party's political ideology. At the party conference in 2010, the NCP delegates voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. The party's supporters are also generally very supportive of market economy, nuclear power and Finland's admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of American history, most {{political}} leaders were reluctant to involve the federal government too heavily in the private sector, except in the area of transportation. In general, they accepted the concept of laissez-faire, a doctrine opposing government interference in the economy except to maintain law and order. This attitude <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> during {{the latter part of the}} 19th century, when small business, farm, and labor movements began asking the government to intercede on their behalf.|$|E

The chemise, the standard undergarment of the era, prevented the thin, gauzy dresses from being fully transparent. Outerwear, such as the spencer and the pelisse, were popular.|$|E

25|$|After {{experiencing}} several 'Window attacks', the Luftwaffe <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> its tactics. With radar neutralised by Window, German night fighters {{found it}} difficult to intercept the bombers. However, German ground controllers no longer used radar sets to guide German fighters and track individual enemy bombers in order to intercept. Instead, they gave a running commentary on the stream as a whole. No individual aircraft were tracked unless caught in searchlights. These changes did not produce immediate success, but pointed the way to a method of loosely controlled cat's eye interception. The success of the new tactics were indicated in increasing bomber losses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, clothes were mostly sold by {{individual}} shopkeepers who were often the artisans {{who made the}} goods.

However, things <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> during the transition to the 19th century.
