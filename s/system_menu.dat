5|$|The {{front of}} the console {{features}} an illuminated slot-loading optical media drive which accepts only 12cm Wii Optical Discs and 8cm Nintendo GameCube Game Discs. (Units sold in South Korea and later revisions do not support GameCube discs.) The blue light in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console is turned on, and pulses when new data is received through WiiConnect24. After the update (including <b>System</b> <b>Menu</b> 3.0), the disc-slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc-slot light remains off during game play or when using other features. Two USB ports are located at its rear. An SD-card slot is located behind the cover on the {{front of the}} console.|$|E

This lightweight browser was found to use a six-month-old version of WebKit containing a set of vulnerabilities collectively known as Trident that has the potential to allow the Switch to be hijacked by code execution in the browser.|$|E

The soundtrack of Hot Pursuit features a general track list as {{is seen in}} EA Black Box Need for Speed games such as , [...] and [...] rather than a scored soundtrack as seen in [...] and [...] The song [...] "Edge of the Earth" [...] by Thirty Seconds to Mars serves as the game's theme song. Players can also add custom soundtracks to the game, so that any music stored on the player’s hard drive can be selected during gameplay, {{as long as they}} are added to a playlist via the console's <b>system</b> <b>menu.</b> As well as optionally using songs from the player's hard drive, several categories of licensed music are available for the game's racing, menu screens, and the photo mode.|$|E
2500|$|On Unix and Unix-like {{operating}} systems, the key {{is usually}} given the X keysym [...] "Super" [...] (on earlier versions [...] "Meta" [...] was often used), and turns on the shift bit called MOD4. A common action that is not shared with Windows is for the key to allow dragging a window around from any location without raising it. Otherwise it is often used much like Windows, with press+release popping up a primary menu (GNOME Shell bringing up the Activities Overview, Cinnamon pops up its main <b>system</b> <b>menu</b> normally docked at lower-left of screen), and with combinations with letters performing actions such as run-command, often with the shortcuts and actions copied from Windows. In the Compiz window manager, the Super key causes the scroll wheel to zoom {{in or out of}} any part of the desktop.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} GNOME desktop uses a {{menu bar}} {{at the top of}} the screen, but this menu bar only contains Applications and <b>System</b> <b>menus</b> and status information (such as the time of day); individual programs have their own menu bars as well. The Unity desktop shell shipped with Ubuntu Linux since version 11.04 uses a Macintosh-style menu bar; however, it is hidden unless the mouse pointer hovers over it, similar to the Commodore Amiga example below.|$|R

50|$|Up until <b>System</b> <b>Menu</b> 3.0's release, {{and later}} the dawn of Wii homebrew, {{this was also the}} only way of running Game Boy Advance games on the Wii - because, as the Wii lacks the correct port, the Game Boy Player cannot be used. Before <b>System</b> <b>Menu</b> 3.0, the Wii allowed {{unofficial}} GameCube software, such as this and Action Replay. As the dongle plugs into the Memory Card Slot, it was fully compatible with the Wii. <b>System</b> <b>Menu</b> 3.0 prevented unofficial GameCube software from running, rendering this unusable. With the dawn of Wii homebrew, it is now possible to run the Game Boy lineup of games via an emulator.|$|E

Certain spells {{can also be}} taken off the active casting list for computer-controlled allies. At any one time, the AI is controlling the other characters in the party that the player is not directly commanding, taking general strategic orders into consideration when acting. The player controls one character directly at a time, but can switch to other characters and issue special attack or spell orders for any character on command using an in-battle <b>menu</b> <b>system.</b> This <b>menu</b> <b>system</b> enables the player to use items, spells, or special attacks on the fly in battle. Also, the <b>menu</b> <b>system</b> allows the use of general commands given to the entire party during battle, along with instant adjustment of previous strategy or formation orders.|$|R

When compared to command driven <b>systems,</b> computer <b>menu</b> <b>systems</b> are appealing because they reduce memorization of commands, reduce training, and structure the user’s decision making.

40|$|<b>Menu</b> <b>systems</b> are a {{standard}} interface technique in 2 D desktop <b>systems.</b> Using <b>menu</b> <b>systems</b> in virtual reality systems however, is often problematic. In this paper, we present five techniques for menu selection in a 3 D {{desktop virtual reality}} system: a 3 D ray-casting technique, two projective techniques, one technique based on 3 D positioning, and one technique based on the standard 2 D desktop mouse. The different techniques are compared in a user study. Furthermore, 3 D menu location is also considered in the evaluation. The results show that menu selection can very well be performed with 3 D devices, provided that the 3 D movement is constrained.
