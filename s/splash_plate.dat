5000|$|T-80B (Ob'yekt 219R) (1978) - This {{first major}} {{redesign}} features a modified turret with new composite K ceramic armor providing better protection against APFSDS kinetic energy penetrators. The protection {{level of the}} turret increased from 410 mm of steel to 500 mm of steel. It also includes 1A33 fire control system, 9K112-2 system which allows firing 9M112 [...] "Kobra" [...] (NATO code: AT-8 Songster) ATGM using the tank's barrel. The missile control box is mounted {{in front of the}} cupola and has angled support. The ATGM may be launched while moving slowly and can be auto-loaded with the two halves mated during ramming but the stub charge is manually loaded. Unlike T-80, T-80B does not have a <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> on glacis plate.|$|E
5000|$|T-80 (Ob'yekt 219) (1976) - First {{production}} model. The T-80 {{has some}} features {{of both the}} T-64 and T-72, and other features unique to itself. In general, the offensive capabilities of the T-80 {{are similar to the}} T-64A, but it is faster thanks to the GTD-1000T 1,000 hp (746 kW) multi-fuel gas turbine engine. Visual keys are large, die-cast, irregularly spaced, ribbed, rubber-tired road wheels with three support rollers, a self-entrenching blade on the lower glacis, a Luna searchlight in the same position as the T-64. Significant differences are a coincidence rangefinder, and probable enhanced armor on the glacis (an upper glacis of steel layers enclosing fiberglass layers and a cast steel turret enclosing nonmetallic materials). Unlike the later models, the early T-80 had V-shaped <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> on glacis plate. Due to its armour being obsolete, only a few hundred were built between 1976 and 1978 before the production switched to the T-80B. Some T-80s were later upgraded to B level.|$|E

40|$|The use of splash {{plates and}} dual {{impinging}} liquid jets are common methods for fuel atomization, but {{the combination of}} these methods has not been explored. The goal of this experiment is to analyze how <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> position and orientation affect the spray geometry for this combined method. The spray patterns are observed for a single jet against a <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> and two orientations of dual impinging jets against a <b>splash</b> <b>plate.</b> For all three cases, the spray patterns are analyzed for various <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> angles between 30 and 60 degrees relative to the jet centerline. For the dual impinging jets, the <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> is tested in multiple positions relative the two jets’ unimpeded impingement point. The characteristics of the spray patterns are then analyzed using high speed video. The most desirable spray characteristics occur when the <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> is at least two jet diameters lower than the unimpeded impingement point and at an angle between 45 and 60 degrees. The spray has a clear spreading angle and minimum back-spray when the sheet formed by the jets is coincidental with the orientation axis for the splash plat...|$|E
40|$|The <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> slurry {{spreader}} is inexpensive and robust {{but it is}} not environmentally friendly. It releases most of the ammonia (NH 3) in slurry, emits strong odours and distributes the remaining nutrients unevenly. The object of this report is to identify improvements to {{slurry spreader}}s that may eliminate these shortcomings. Several gases are released during and after slurry spreading. NH 3 contributes to acidification of the environment and is emitted almost entirely from agriculture. Over 30 % of European NH 3 emissions come from slurry spreading. The Gothenberg agreement (UNECE, 1999) requires a reduction in national NH 3 emission to 8 % below 1990 levels. Emission of this gas from band, TF (trailing foot) and injector slurry spreaders is 40, 40 and 20 % respectively of that from conventional <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> machines. A switch to spreaders with lower emissions would provide sufficient reduction to satisfy the Gothenberg objective. Odour from livestock units gives rise to many complaints but {{there is little evidence that}} it is a health hazard. Emission of the vapours from slurry spreaders is in the order; (<b>splash</b> <b>plate)</b> >(band) > (TF and injector). Other gases (methane and nitrous oxide) are released primarily after injection. Infection of humans by slurry-borne organisms is not common. In general the differences between spreaders in regard to pathogens are not significant but this conclusion may not apply in all cases. Slurry nutrients amount to 40 % of the N and 65 % of the P required in agriculture. Several commercial and experimental methods exist to measure slurry nutrient content. Field application using a <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> and vacuum tanker gives highly variable distribution. Any of the other spreaders reviewed here combined with a fixed displacement pump achieve more uniform application. Accurate spreading reduces the need for excess application so losses to water from soil are reduced. This conforms to the Water Framework Directive. Deep injection and incorporation can reduce loss of P from slurry but other spreading methods will not normally reduce the risk of P loss at spreading time. The proposed tanker consists of a closed tank with running gear fit for road and field conditions. A TF spreader is fitted at the back. The slurry is handled by a fixed displacement pump which fills the tank or empties it through the spreader. The pump must be protected from obstacles so an intake filter or chopper filter should be included. This slurry spreader would reduce emission of NH 3 and odour and increase the recycling of slurry nutrients to crops. It is more expensive than <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> machines but if widely adopted it could be an economical solution to the UNECE requirement to reduce NH 3 emissions. Alternatives to improving spreaders exist. These include digesting slurry, and reducing emissions from livestock housing and slurry storage. With the exception of digestion these offer poor prospects of success especially in relation to odour reduction and exploitation of slurry nutrients. The cost of providing this equipment on Irish farms is likely to be between € 200 m and € 800 m and depends on the options chosen. End of Project Repor...|$|E

The effect of flow conditions, air mass velocity (mass flow rate per unit area) and liquid to air ratio on the mean drop size was studied. Seven different ethanol solutions were used to simulate changes in fuel physical properties. The range of atomizing air velocities was from 30 to 80 m/s.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{development}} of physical crusts in three typical cultivated soils of China, a black soil (Luvic Phaeozem), a loess soil (Haplic Luvisol), and a purple soil (Calcaric Regosol) were packed in <b>splash</b> <b>plates</b> with covered and uncovered treatments, and exposed to simulated rainfall. Meshes covered above the surfaces of half of soil samples to simulate the effects of crop residue on crusting. The results indicated a progressive breakdown of aggregates on the soil surface as rainfall continued. The bulk density and shear strength {{on the surface of}} the three soil types increased logarithmically as rainfall duration increased. During the first 30 min of simulated rainfall, the purple soil developed a 7 - 8 mm thick crust and the loess soil developed a 3 - 4 mm thick crust. The black soil developed a distinguishable, but still unstable, crust after 80 min of simulated rainfall. Soil organic matter (SOM) content, the mean weight diameter (MWD) of soil aggregates, and soil clay content were negatively correlated with the rate of crust formation, whereas the percentage of aggregate dispersion (PAD), the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), and the silt and sand contents were positively correlated with crusting. Mechanical breakdown caused by raindrop impact was the primary mechanism of crust formation in the black soil with more stable aggregates (MWD 25. 0 mm, PAD 3. 1 %) and higher SOM content (42. 6 g kg(- 1)). Slaking and mechanical eluviation were the primary mechanisms of crust formation in the purple soil with low clay content (103 g kg(- 1)), cation exchange capacity (CEC, 228 mmol kg(- 1)), ESP (0. 60 %), and SOM (17. 2 g kg(- 1)). Mechanical breakdown and slaking were the most important in the loess soil with low CEC (80. 6 mmol kg(- 1)), ESP (1. 29 %), SOM (9. 82 g kg(- 1)), and high PAD (71. 7 %) and MWD (4. 6 mm).

5000|$|The first culinary {{evidence}} of fajitas, as {{a cut of}} meat, the cooking style (directly on a campfire or on a grill), and the Spanish nickname going {{back as far as}} the 1930s in the ranch lands of South and West Texas,. During cattle roundups, beef cattle were butchered regularly to feed the hands. Throwaway items such as the hide, the head, the entrails, and meat trimmings such as skirt were given to the Mexican cowboys called vaqueros as part of their pay. Hearty border dishes like barbacoa de cabeza (head barbecue), menudo (tripe stew), and fajitas or arracheras (grilled skirt steak) have their roots in this practice. Considering the limited number of skirts per carcass and that the meat wasn't available commercially, the fajita tradition remained regional and relatively obscure for many years, probably only familiar to vaqueros, butchers, and their families. The modern [...] "fajitas" [...] were introduced at a county fair in Kyle, Texas in 1969 by Sonny Falcon, who later opened an Austin restaurant offering fajitas as a main fare. Fajitas are generally marinated before grilling in a combination of lime juice and southwestern spices, and then served on a hot <b>plate</b> <b>splashed</b> with lime juice and eaten in taco style with flour tortillas, grated cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.|$|R

40|$|Following surface {{application}} of slurry to grassland between 1 % and 100 % of the ammonia-nitrogen {{of the organic}} fertilizer can be lost through volatilization of ammonia gas. For recording various influence factors on the ammonia volatilization after slurry application, three parallel operated windtunnels are used. Researches on the accuracy of this windtunnel system proved the reprodu-cible measuring and quantification of ammonia emissions. The ammonia-nitrogen loss could be minimized through application techniques, which apply the slurry near or into the soil. In comparison to broadcast spreading with a <b>splash</b> <b>plate,</b> the ammonia emissions were reduced by 40 % using a trailing hose, between 50 % and 60 % with a trailing foot and even by 75 % using the trenching technique.

This system was compared with the conventional management system, utilizing a tank wagon equipped with <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> for slurry application and a fixed irrigation system for irrigation. Analysis on leaching water samples indicate that the quality of percolation water is better due to a reduction in nitrate nitrogen losses.

Several models are used to (i) assess nitrogen losses due to sewage sludge spreading and (ii) calculate additional flow resulting from the technologies performances such as spatial distribution heterogeneity, application rate accuracy and soil compaction of the spreading machine. NH 3 volatilisation due to the spreader performances is generally low and the highest for <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> technology. Additional emissions are mainly caused by application rate accuracy problems. It is not possible to link NO 3 leaching to the technologies performances: this kind of emissions greatly depends on soil and climate conditions.

40|$|Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) {{livestock}} for {{mozzarella cheese}} production plays a fundamental {{role in the}} economy of southern Italy. European and Italian regulations consider nitrogen content in buffalo manure to be {{the same as that of}} cattle manure. This study aimed to assess whether this assumption is true. The first aim of the study was to assess nitrogen content in buffalo manure. Samples were taken from 35 farms to analyse nitrogen and phosphorous concentration in the manure. Analysis confirmed a lower nitrogen concentration (2 %) in buffalo manure. A secondary aim of the study was to evaluate whether manure application techniques that are apparently less suitable, e. g. <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> spreader, could be feasible. The cost of different methods of land application of manure and their characteristics were evaluated on the basis of one operational cycle. Considering losses for volatilisation, and taking into account cost assessment, the immediate incorporation of buffalo manure (nitrogen content 2 %) is a suitable method of ammonia volatilisation.

40|$|The EMEP/EEA guidebook 2009 for {{agricultural}} emission inventories reports an average ammonia (NH 3) emission factor (EF) by volatilisation of 55 % of the applied total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) content for cattle slurry, and 35 % losses for pig slurry, {{irrespective of the}} type of surface or slurry characteristics such as dry matter content and pH. In this review article, we compiled over 350 measurements of EFs published between 1991 and 2011. The standard slurry application technique {{during the early years of}} this period, when a large number of measurements were made, was spreading by <b>splash</b> <b>plate,</b> and as a result reference EFs given in many European inventories are predominantly based on this technique. However, slurry application practices have evolved since then, while there has also been a shift in measurement techniques and investigated plot sizes. We therefore classified the available measurements according to the flux measurement technique or measurement plot size and year of measurement. Medium size plots (usually circles between 20 to 50 m radius) generally yielded the highest EFs. The most commonly used measurement setups at this scale were based on the Integrated Horizontal Flux method (IHF or the ZINST method (a simplified IHF method)). Several empirical models were published in the years 1993 to 2003 predicting NH 3 EFs as a function of meteorology and slurry characteristics (Menzi et al., 1998; Søgaard et al., 2002). More recent measurements show substantially lower EFs which calls for new measurement series in order to validate the various measurement approaches against each other and to derive revised inputs for inclusion into emission inventories...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of manure or slurry management on intensive pig farms are {{the provision of}} adequate slurry storage capacity and the efficient recycling of the slurry nutrients for crop production. However, recent surveys of pig slurry dry matter suggest there is excessive dilution of raw pig slurry with water. This has two important implications for management. The first is greater storage capacity will be required due to the increased volume of slurry generated. Slurry storage is expensive. For example, a 350 sow unit adding 10 weeks storage needs to invest £ 50, 000. Secondly, evidence from the literature indicates an improved slurry nitrogen efficiency with the more dilute manure. The results of field trials showed that higher dry matter pig slurries reduced the relative efficiency of pig slurry nitrogen for second cut silage production. This is probably linked to reduced ammonia volatilisation losses, consequent to the less viscous nature of dilute slurry which permits a more rapid infiltration of the ammonium nitrogen into the soil. The use of a band spreader or shallow injection rather than the conventional <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> were shown {{to increase the efficiency}} of pig slurry nitrogen for grass silage production. Therefore, the potential for the higher pig slurry dry matter, required for cost effective storage/ handling costs, to reduce the efficiency of its nitrogen for grass silage production can be partially offset by using band spreaders or shallow injection spreading systems. These have the added advantage of reducing odour emissions from the land spreading operation. End of Project ReportTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Ammonia {{emissions}} {{represent a}} growing issue for European countries {{due to the}} rapid increase in livestock production and next National Emission Ceilings EU Directive adoption, which will limit emissions of NH 3 as well as SO 2, NOx and NMVOC applicable from 2020 and 2030. Recent researches are devoted to the individuation of standard methods for reliable assessment, consequently many European countries are now building national emissions inventory. The main issue {{is a lack of}} data about ammonia losses from buffalo manure, under Mediterranean climate. Buffalo is reared mostly in South Italy, and even if well studied, there are not researches about ammonia emissions. Besides measurement method itself, meteorological conditions influence emissions too. In this paper, ammonia emissions assessment from buffalo manure application to the field under Mediterranean climate is proposed, with aim of giving first data for this animal species. Methods During summer period of 2016 an experimental trial combining the use of three wind tunnel (WT) and Micrometeorological method specifically Integrate Horizontal flux (IHF) in circular plot was carried out. Buffalo slurry was applied with <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> spreader for IHF and manually under WT. Acid traps were used to assess ammonia fluxes from WT. Acid solutions were replaced every 2 hours for the first two days and every three to four hours for the remaining two days. Glass tubes were employed for IHF method, sampled with same time step of WT. Meteorological data were acquired during the trial and soil samples were taken {{at the end of each}} day for pH and NH 4 -N and NO 3 -N.

40|$|A {{change in}} German energy policy has {{resulted}} in a strong {{increase in the number of}} biogas plants in Germany. As a consequence, huge amounts of nutrient-rich residues, the by-products of the fermentative process, are used as organic fertilizers. Drained peatlands are increasingly used to satisfy the huge demand for fermentative substrates (e. g., energy crops, grass silage) and the digestate is returned to the peatlands. However, drained organic soils are considered as hot spots for nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions and organic fertilization is additionally known to increase N 2 O emissions from managed grasslands. Our study addressed the questions (a) to what extent biogas digestate and cattle slurry application increase N 2 O and methane (CH 4) fluxes as well as the mineral nitrogen use efficiency (NUE min) and grass yield, and (b) how different soil organic matter contents (SOMs) and nitrogen contents promote the production of N 2 O. In addition NH 3 volatilization was determined at one application event to obtain first clues with respect to the effects of soil and fertilizer types. The study was conducted at two sites within a grassland parcel, which differed in their soil organic carbon (SOC) and N contents. At each site (named C org -medium and C org -high) three plots were established: one was fertilized five times with biogas digestate, one with cattle slurry, and the third served as control plot. On each plot, fluxes of N 2 O and CH 4 were measured on three replicates over 2 years using the closed chamber method. For NH 3 measurements we used the calibrated dynamic chamber method. On an annual basis, the application of biogas digestate significantly enhanced the N 2 O fluxes compared to the application of cattle slurry and additionally increased the plant N-uptake and NUE min. Furthermore, N 2 O fluxes from the C org -high treatments significantly exceeded N 2 O fluxes from the C org -medium treatments. Annual cumulative emissions ranged from 0. 91 ± 0. 49 to 3. 14 ± 0. 91 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1. Significantly different CH 4 fluxes between the investigated treatments or the different soil types were not observed. Cumulative annual CH 4 exchange rates varied between − 0. 21 ± 0. 19 and − 1. 06 ± 0. 46 kg C ha − 1 yr − 1. Significantly higher NH 3 losses, NUE min and grass yields from treatments fertilized with biogas digestate compared to those fertilized with cattle slurry were observed. The total NH 3 losses following the <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> application were 18. 17 kg N ha − 1 for the digestate treatments and 3. 48 kg N ha − 1 for the slurry treatments (36 and 15 % of applied NH 4 + –N). The observed linear increase of 16 days' cumulative N 2 O–N exchange or annual N 2 O emissions, with mean groundwater level and ammonium application rate, reveals the importance of site-adapted N fertilization and the avoidance of N surpluses in C org -rich grasslands...|$|E
40|$|Water spray {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to icing of ships and maritime structures. The small size of the droplets in the water spray causes them to easily cool down and freeze to the different structures. Icing can hamper operations on both ships and other maritime structures due to blockage of equipment and slippery deck areas. Besides, if icing occurs on a small ship it is even possible that the increased mass causes the ship to become top heavy, with risk of capsize. De-icing can be costly, dangerous and often both. A better understanding of the spray water forming process can be used to design new structures for minimal ice forming. Reducing the icing on existing structures is also possible by small modifications or optimizing the sailing routes for ships. This in turn can lead to lower operating costs and down-time. In this research the objective was to validate the model of Aalbers en Poen (2015) for the prediction of spray water, in particular the prediction of the droplet mass median diameter. In this model it is assumed that the process of a wave running up against the bow of a ship is comparable to the penetration of water by a wedge. Such a process generates a jet which in turn is expected to breakup in a similar fashion as a jet from a <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> nozzle. Aalbers and Poen use wave mechanics to determine the immersion velocity of the ship and the dead rise angle between the water and the ship. This information can be used to predict the jet root thickness and the jet velocity with the model of Faltinsen (2002). Both parameters are used as the input for a modified model of Adams (1997) to predict the droplet mass median diameter. Simmons (1977) proposed a distribution that can depict the droplet-size/volume-fraction independent of the spray mechanism. Therefore Aalbers and Poen assumed that this distribution can be applied to their problem. For the validation and verification process tests, for this thesis, have been conducted in the concept basin of MARIN. In the tests a wave was used to produce run-up against a wall to create spray. The waves used had the maximum height possible in the basin and were just feasible to check the model of Aalbers and Poen as intended. This size is significantly larger than that of e. g the splash plates in the original models but still not at full (ship) scale. The tests were performed to study the breakup process and in particular the size and distribution of the formed droplets. An algorithm was developed to extract this data from high-speed recordings of the event. The observed breakup process was different from the process assumed in the model of Adams. Nevertheless, the observed and predicted values for the droplet mass median diameter and jet velocity agree reasonably well. The distribution of Simmons was shown to be applicable. The test setup could not fully verify the usage of Faltinsen's theory because the jet root thickness could not be quantified. However, the observations showed that the assumption of Aalbers and Poen to use Faltinsens's theory is promising. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
