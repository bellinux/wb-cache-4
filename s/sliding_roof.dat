5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a <b>sliding</b> <b>roof</b> to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E
2500|$|The stadium roof has {{an area of}} , {{of which}} [...] is movable. The primary reason for the <b>sliding</b> <b>roof</b> was to avoid shading the pitch, as grass demands direct {{sunlight}} to grow effectively. The <b>sliding</b> <b>roof</b> design minimises the shadow by having the roof pulled back on the east, west and south. Angus Campbell, chief architect, also said that an aim was for the pitch to be in sunlight during the match between the beginning of May {{and the end of}} June, between 3pm and 5pm, which is when the FA and World cups would be played. However, it was mentioned during live commentary of the FA Cup Final in 2007 that the pitch was in partial shade at the start at 3pm and also during the match.|$|E
2500|$|The all-seater {{stadium is}} a bowl design with a {{capacity}} of 90,000, protected from the elements by a <b>sliding</b> <b>roof</b> that does not completely enclose it. It can also be adapted as an athletic stadium by erecting a temporary platform over the lowest tier of seating. The stadium's signature feature is a circular section lattice arch of 7m (23ft) internal diameter with a 315m (1,033ft) span, erected some 22° off true, and rising to 133m (436ft). [...] It supports all {{the weight of the}} north roof and 60% of the weight of the retractable roof on the southern side. The archway is the world's longest unsupported roof structure.|$|E

The fragments are then taken to special flat wooden barracks covered with <b>sliding</b> metal <b>roofs</b> which are popularly known on the Polynesian islands as [...] "coprah dryers". The <b>sliding</b> <b>roofs</b> are only used at night and during the rainy season. The coprah is left to dry {{for more than a}} week until the coconut meat has lost over 90% of its moisture.|$|R
