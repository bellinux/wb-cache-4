40|$|In the {{literature}} {{the effects of}} weather on electricity sales are well-documented. However, studies that have investigated the impact of weather on electricity prices are still scarce (e. g. Knittel and Roberts, 2005), partly because the wholesale power markets have only recently been deregulated. We introduce the weather factor into well-known forecasting models to study its impact. We find that weather has explanatory power for the day-ahead power <b>spot</b> price. Using <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> improves the forecast accuracy, and in particular new models with power transformations of <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> variables are significantly better in term of out-of-sample statistics than popular mean reverting models. For different power markets, such as Norway, Eastern Denmark and the Netherlands, we build specific models. The dissimilarity among these models indicates that <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> influence not only the demand of electricity but also the supply side according to different electricity producing methods.

30|$|From {{theoretical}} {{point of}} view, the scientific community, {{the government and}} other stakeholders should apply their joint effort to reassess the main causes for the declining quality of indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> practices. At this stage, modern science has relative upper hand in providing <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> over indigenous ways. However, the main limitation of modern <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> is the very limited temporal scope for which generating relatively reliable weather information is possible. Notwithstanding {{the controversy over the}} vitality of indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting,</b> the system is far better than modern science {{when it comes to the}} longer duration covered in <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting.</b> If the true causes for the function and dysfunction of indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> can be established, that would be a leap forward to the refinement and development of modern <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> technology.

40|$|The {{indoor climate}} of many storage {{facilities}} for agricultural produce {{is controlled by}} mixing ambient air with the air flow through the store room. Hence, the indoor climate {{is affected by the}} ambient weather conditions. Given hourly fluctuating energy tariffs, <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> over some days are required to effectively anticipate. Hence, typically a real-time optimal control strategy results. As <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> are uncertain, predicted model outputs and related costs of the control strategy become uncertain. Usually, a medium-range <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> for a period of some days consists of an ensemble of forecasts. Hence, the uncertainty in the <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> is known a priori. In addition to this, in past-performance studies where <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> and observed <b>weather</b> variables are given, an a posteriori evaluation of the forecast errors can be made as well.

30|$|This {{study has}} shown that {{indigenous}} knowledge based <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> is {{the main source of}} weather information in Borena where access to modern weather information is limited. Next to astrology, biotic means of indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> is highly valued as a credible source of <b>weather</b> <b>forecast.</b> However, as in many other countries, the popularity of indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> is declining for three main reasons. Firstly, the people are exhausted with the faulty <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> and unbearable repercussions associated with it. Secondly, Christianity is growing in the area thereby discouraging the people from their allegiance to indigenous experts whom they equate with witchdoctors. Thirdly, influenced by modern education people are not attracted to indigenous knowledge which makes them ambivalent to study and uphold the indigenous science of <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting.</b> Other factors such as the passing away of indigenous experts, disappearance of indicative tress such as Tedecha (Acacia tortilis) trees, absence of documentation and oral transmission also play remarkable role. As a result, the number of indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> experts is declining at an alarming rate before adequate documentation is made, as observed in by other researchers (e.g. Joshua et al. 2012; Chang’a et al.
