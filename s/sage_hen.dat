40|$|Declines {{in greater}} sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) {{productivity}} and population numbers throughout their range demand {{a better understanding}} of how nutrition influences sage grouse populations. During March and April 1999 – 2001, blood samples were collected from 158 female (73 adult, 85 yearling), free-ranging, prelaying, greater sage grouse from an area in northwestern Nevada, USA, and southeastern Oregon, USA. These blood samples were evaluated to establish normal blood values for sage grouse and ascertain if certain blood parameters, as indices of nutrition, are useful for predicting if <b>sage</b> grouse <b>hens</b> would raise at least one chick to 1 August. Results of logistic regression indicated that three of six blood parameters analyzed—glucose, total plasma protein, and calcium : phosphorus ratio—affected the probability of a female sage grouse raising at least one chick to late summer. Ranking of the standardized estimates revealed that glucose and total plasma protein had the greatest impact on the likelihood of a female successfully raising chicks. Odds ratios indicated that a 1 -unit increase in glucose (1 mg/dl) and plasma protein (0. 1 g/dl) would result in a 4 % and 113 % positive increase, respectively, in the predicted odds of at least one chick surviving until 1 August. Odds ratios for calcium : phosphorus ratio revealed a 70 % decline in the predicted odds of at least one chick surviving until 1 August if the level of this parameter increased one unit (e. g., 3 : 1 to 4 : 1). Based on these analyses, values of some blood parameters used as indices of nutrition, especially glucose, total plasma protein, and calcium : phosphorus ratio, can be successfully used to predict reproductive success of sage grouse. These parameters are not only indicative of the nutritional status of prelaying hens but may be associated with nutritional quality of the habitat and therefore have important management significance...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 In Oregon, {{sage grouse}} (Centrocercus urophasianus) were {{common in the}} eastern portion of the state. Since 1940 populations {{declined}} because of decreased productivity. The western subspecies (C. u. phaios) was listed {{as a candidate for}} threatened and endangered status in 1985 because of declines in Oregon and Washington and extirpation from British Columbia. Habitat availability and habitat condition were factors associated with impaired productivity. Stand structure and forb availability were characteristics most associated with habitat selection by hens with broods. The objectives of this study were to determine habitat use and selection by hens with broods and the relationship between food availability, habitat use by hens, and diets of juvenile sage grouse. Of the 2 study areas used, Hart Mountain had greater long term productivity and abundance than Jackass Creek. Use of cover types and habitat components were compared within and between study areas. In this study, <b>sage</b> grouse <b>hens</b> selected low sagebrush (Artemisia sp.) cover types during early brood-rearing then switched to use of big sagebrush cover types during late brood-rearing. In general, cover types used selectively had greater availability of forbs, and changes in forb availability within cover types from early to late brood-rearing corresponded to changes in cover type use. Differences in forb availability between study areas may have affected productivity. Hens at Jackass Creek selected sites with forb cover similar to that available to broods at Hart Mountain and home ranges were larger at Jackass Creek. Furthermore, diets of juvenile sage grouse were higher in forbs and insects at Hart Mountain. Larger home ranges and less nutritious diets were potentially responsible for lower productivity at Jackass Creek. Results indicated that management to improve brood habitat should focus on maintenance of cover type diversity and availability of forbs...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Sage grouse are {{a species}} of concern because their abundance, distribution, and {{productivity}} have declined during the past century. Sage grouse productivity {{has been linked to}} specific habitat components including particular forbs and native bunchgrasses. Studies on the effects of fire were conducted in Southeastern Oregon in mountain big sagebrush communities to better understand the effects of fire on key sage grouse habitat components. The short-term study was conducted at South Steens Mountain during 1997 and 1998. Habitat components (medium shrub cover; perennial grass cover; hen and chick food forb cover, frequency, and availability; chick food forb nutrition; insect abundance; and sagebrush reproductive branch abundance) were compared between preburn or unburned, 1 - year post-bum, and 2 -years post-burn areas. The long-term effects of fire on essential sage grouse habitat components were studied during 1997 at Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge (Lake County), and during 1998 at South Steens Mountain (Harney County). Habitat components (medium height mountain big sagebrush, tall grass, hen and chick food forb, and other forb cover) were measured at burned and adjacent unburned control sites and compared with recommended cover amounts. Burned sites ranged in age from 5 to 43 years. In the short-term fire effects study, prescribed burning increased the amount of <b>sage</b> grouse <b>hen</b> and chick foods, the quality of some chick foods, and increased the amount of time of these foods were available. Sagebrush cover was essentially eliminated in burned areas. Perennial grass cover was significantly higher in a comparison of the 2 -years post burn to the 1 -year post burn samples. In the long-term fire effects study, all key vegetative and structural components needed for successful sage grouse reproduction became available in burned areas from 25 - 35 years old. Sagebrush cover was the only habitat component tested that was substantially affected by burning in the long term. Prescribed burning would be most beneficial to sage grouse habitat if used as a management tool to create a mosaic of needed habitat components...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the nature of ignorance as it was {{interpreted}} in the Upani~adic tradition, specifically in Advaita Vedanta, and in early and Mahayana Buddhism, e specially in the Madhyamika school of Buddhism. The approach i s a historical and comparative one. It examines the early thoughts of both the upanis. a ds and Buddhism abou t avidya (ignorance), shows how the notion was treated by the more speculative and philosphically oriented schools which base d themselves on the e arly works, and sees how their views differ. The thesis will show that the Vedinta tended to treat avidya as a topic for metaphysical s peculation as t he s chool developed, drifting from its initial e xistential concerns, while the Madhyamika remained in contact with the e xistential concerns evident in the first discourses of the Buddha. The word "notion" has been chosen for use in referring t o avidya, even though it may have non-intellectual and emotional connotations, to avoid more popular a lternatives such as "concept" or "idea". In neither the Upani,ads, Advaita Vedanta, or Buddhism is ignorance merely a concept or an idea. Only in a secondary sense, in texts and speech, does it become one. Avidya {{has more to do with}} the lived situation in which man finds himself, with the subjectobject separation in which he f eels he exists, than with i i i intel lect ual constr ucts. Western thought has begun to r ealize the same with concerns such as being in modern ontology, and has chosen to speak about i t i n terms of the question of being. Avidya, however, i s not a 'question'. If q ue stions we r e to be put regarding the nature of a vidya, they would be more of t he sort "What is not avidya?", though e ven here l anguage bestows a status t o i t which avidya does not have. In considering a work of the Eastern tradition, we f ace t he danger of imposing Western concepts on it. Granted t hat avidya is customari ly r endered i n English as ignorance, the ways i n which the East and West view i gno rance di f f er. Pedagogically, the European cultures, grounded in the ancient Greek culture, view ignorance as a l ack or an emptiness. A child is i gnorant o f certain t hings and the purpose o f f ormal education, in f act if not in theory, is to fill him with enough knowledge so that he can cope wit h t he complexities and the e xpectations of s ociety. On another level, we feel t hat study and research will l ead t o the discovery o f solutions, which we now lack, for problems now defying solut i on. The East, on the o t her hand, sees avidya in a d i fferent light. Ignorance isn't a lack, but a presence. Religious and philosophical l iterature directs its efforts not towards acquiring something new, but at removing t. he ideas and opinions that individuals have formed about themselves and the world. When that is fully accomplished, say the <b>sages,</b> t <b>hen</b> Wisdom, which has been obscured by those opinions, will present itself. Nothing new has to be learned, t hough we do have t o 'learn' that much. The growing interest in t he West with Eastern religions and philosophies may, in time, influence our theoretical and practical approaches to education and learning, not only in the established educati onal institutions, but in religious, p sychological, and spiritual activities as well. However, the requirements o f this thesis do no t permit a formulation of revolutionary method or a call to action. It focuses instead on the textual arguments which attempt to convince readers that t he world in which they take themselves to exist is not, in essence, real, on the ways i n which the l imitations of language are disclosed, and on the provisional and limited schemes that are built up to help students see through their ignorance. The metaphysic s are provisional because they act only as spurs and guides. Both the Upanisadic and Buddhist traditions that will be dealt with here stress that language constantly fails to encompass the Real. So even terms s uch as 'the Real', 'Absolute', etc., serve only to lead to a transcendent experience. The sections dealing with the Upanisads and Advaita Vedanta show some of the historical evolution of the notion of avidya, how it was dealt with as maya, and the q uestions that arose as t o its locus. With Gau?apada we see the beginnings of a more abstract treatment of the topic, and, the influence of Buddhism. Though Sankhara' S interest was primarily directed towards constructing a philosophy to help others attain mok~a (l iberation), he too introduced t echnica l t e rminology not found in the works of his predecessors. His work is impressive, but areas of it are incomplete. Numbers of his followers tried to complete the systematic presentation of his insi ghts. Their work focuses on expl anat i ons of adhyasa (superimposition), t he locus and object of ignorance, and the means by which Brahman takes itself to be the jiva and the world. The section on early Buddhism examines avidya in the context o f the four truths, together with dubkha (suffering), the r ole it p l ays in t he chain of dependent c ausation, a nd t he p r oblems that arise with t he doctrine of anatman. With t he doct rines of e arly Buddhism as a base, the Madhyamika elaborated questions that the Buddha had said t e nded not t o edi f ication. One of these had to do with own - being or svabhava. Thi s serves a s a centr e around which a discussion o f i gnorance unfolds, both i ndividual and coll ective ignorance. There follows a treatment of the cessation of ignorance as it is discussed within this school. The final secti on tries to present t he similarities and differences i n the natures o f ignorance i n t he two traditions and discusses the factors responsible for t hem. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank Dr. Sinha for the time spent II and suggestions made on the section dealing with Sankara and the Advait. a Vedanta oommentators, and Dr. Sprung, who supervised, direoted, corrected and encouraged the thesis as a whole, but especially the section on Madhyamika, and the final comparison...|$|R

40|$|Under the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) Project, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{cleaned up}} uranium mill {{tailings}} and other surface contamination {{near the town}} of Gunnison, Colorado. Remedial action resulted in the elimination of 4. 3 acres (ac) (1. 7 hectares [ha]) of wetlands. This loss is mitigated by the enhancement of six spring-fed areas on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land (mitigation sites). Approximately 254 ac (1 03. 3 ha) were fenced at the six sites to exclude grazing livestock. Of the 254 ac (103. 3 ha), 17. 8 ac (7. 2 ha) are riparian plant communities; the rest are sagebrush communities. Baseline grazed conditions of the riparian plant communities at the mitigation sites were measured prior to fencing. This report discusses results of the fourth year of a monitoring program implemented to document the response of vegetation and wildlife to the exclusion of livestock. Three criteria for determining success of the mitigation were established: plant height, vegetation density (bare ground), and vegetation diversity. By 1996, Prospector Spring, Upper Long`s Gulch, and Camp Kettle met the criteria. The DOE requested transfer of these sites to BLM for long-term oversight. The 1997 evaluation of the three remaining sites, discussed in this report, showed two sites (Houston Gulch and Lower Long`s Gulch) meet the criteria. The DOE will request the transfer of these two sites to the BLM for long-term oversight. The last remaining site, <b>Sage</b> <b>Hen</b> Spring, has met only two of the criteria (percent bare ground and plant height). The third criterion, vegetation diversity, was not met. The vegetation appears to be changing from predominantly wet species to drier upland species, although the reason for this change is uncertain. It may be due to below-normal precipitation in recent years, diversion of water from the spring to the stock tank, or manipulation of the hydrology farther up gradient...|$|E
