5|$|From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the {{southern}} part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The alluvial <b>soil</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of {{the western part of the}} state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta, commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the Casuarina. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari (Heritiera fomes), from which the forest gets its name.|$|E

5|$|Riesling is {{the second}} leading white grape varietal after the {{indigenous}} Gr√ºner Veltliner. Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica <b>soil</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} soil {{series in the}} {{watershed}} of Mud Creek is the Watson-Berks-Alvira series. It is a shaly silt loam that mostly occurs in the watershed's plains and highlands.

Dramatic differences, however, exist between <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summit and other neighboring cones and <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glaciated terrain. <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summit area are clay rich and contain phyllosilicate minerals; <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glaciated terrain are sandy and contain X-ray amorphous clay.

Because <b>the</b> summit area <b>of</b> Mauna Kea supported an ice cap at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cones, <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smectite minerals could have resulted from <b>the</b> alteration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tephra by steam and water released in <b>the</b> melting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice.

5|$|In December 1895, {{two months}} after the French capture of Antananarivo, popular {{resistance}} to French rule emerged {{in the form of the}} menalamba ("red shawl") rebellion. This guerrilla war against foreigners, Christianity and political corruption quickly spread throughout the island and was principally conducted by peasants who wore shawls smeared with the red laterite <b>soil</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highlands. The resistance movement gained ground until it was effectively put down by the French military at the end of 1897. Members of Ranavalona's court were accused of encouraging the rebels and many leading figures were executed, including the queen's uncle Ratsimamanga (brother of her favored adviser, Ramisindrazana) and her minister of war, Rainandriamampandry. Ramisindrazana, the queen's aunt, was exiled to R√©union, as the French were reluctant to execute a woman.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Railway (SR), {{which had}} absorbed the LSWR in 1923, offered the LNC the {{temporary}} use of Waterloo station {{to allow the}} Necropolis Railway service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling {{to and from the}} cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery had little reason to choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains to the cemetery stations over the SR's fast and frequent services to Brookwood. The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which genuine mourners could still travel cheaply to the cemetery on the 11.57am service to Brookwood (the SR service closest to the LNC's traditional departure time), but the SR management (themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage) refused to entertain any compromise. In September 1945, following the end of hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway.

5|$|Where their ranges overlap, the two chough {{species may}} feed {{together}} in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in Juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region {{and at the same}} time of year, which dig for food in the <b>soil</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villages' terraced pastures.|$|E

5|$|Shortly afterwards, at 19:30, B Company {{detected}} a North Korean force of around company-size {{preparing for a}} frontal assault, and called-in mortar fire to break up their formations, while a number of forward patrols had to be withdrawn by the Australians {{in order to prevent}} their encirclement. In response the North Koreans fired mortars at the Australian positions with limited effect. Half an hour later North Korean shells hit the 3 RAR battalion headquarters and C Company positions {{on the other side of}} the river, however the rounds landed in the damp <b>soil</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paddy field and failed to explode. Periodically they were also targeted by machine-gun fire, but it was mostly high and posed little threat. Perhaps also under the impression that the Australians had withdrawn, the North Koreans failed to press their attack. Yet they soon realised their mistake and heavy small arms fire began again at 22:30 with North Korean activity against A and B Companies increasing significantly, which resulted in B Company suffering two killed and three wounded. The Australian right flank was now exposed and following a request from Thirlwell, Chitts detached 1 Platoon under Lieutenant John Wathen to bolster B Company. At 23:00 further artillery and mortar fire missions were ordered by the Australians against the North Koreans in response to renewed concentrations in preparation for an assault. Around the same time 8 Platoon C Company under Lieutenant Colin Townsend was sent across the bridge in the darkness to further reinforce B Company, and they dug-in on each side of the road leading to the bridge. Telephone lines had been laid by the Australians to their forward companies, and despite the fighting they remained intact throughout the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually ‚Äì down from 70‚Äì80 to about 20 ‚Äì and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the <b>soil</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E
