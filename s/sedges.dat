5|$|A {{trial in}} Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be mildly {{sensitive}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Banksia marginata (along with such species as Grevillea steiglitziana) {{was part of}} a secondary regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and <b>sedges</b> had grown back.|$|E
5|$|A wetland reserve {{has been}} created at Heron's Green Pool on the {{opposite}} side of the causeway to the lake. A shallow pool fringed with <b>sedges</b> (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae) and reedgrasses (Calamagrostis) and surrounded by lightly grazed, rough grassland may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings.|$|E
5|$|Grasses and <b>sedges</b> {{are common}} {{everywhere}} except dune systems (where marram grass may be locally abundant) and stony mountain tops and plateaux. The {{total number of}} species is large, 84 have been recorded on the verges of a single road in West Lothian.|$|E
50|$|Carex pensylvanica is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the <b>sedge</b> family commonly called Pennsylvania <b>sedge</b> (sometimes shortened to Penn <b>sedge).</b> Other common names include early <b>sedge,</b> common oak <b>sedge,</b> and yellow <b>sedge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carex nudata is {{a species}} of true <b>sedge</b> known by several common names, {{including}} torrent <b>sedge,</b> California black-flowering <b>sedge,</b> Dudley's <b>sedge,</b> and naked <b>sedge.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to lake <b>sedge,</b> other non-scientific names include common lake <b>sedge,</b> lakebank or lake-bank <b>sedge,</b> hairy <b>sedge,</b> and rip-gut <b>sedge.</b> Its common name in French is carex lacustre.|$|R
5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among <b>sedges.</b>|$|E
5|$|P. semilanceata, {{like all}} others {{species of the}} genus Psilocybe, is a {{saprobic}} fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. The mushroom is also associated with <b>sedges</b> in moist areas of fields, and it is thought {{to live on the}} decaying root remains.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail is a {{seasonal}} breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. The nests are {{situated at the}} base of ferns with tussock grass, tussock grass clumps, or in tufts of <b>sedges.</b> The nests are domed and oval or pear shaped, with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. The nests are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, tussock grass or <b>sedges.</b> Where the construction material is tussock grass, larger leaves are used on the outside and finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced Malus domestica (apple) or Salix babylonica (willow).|$|E
50|$|Carex praegracilis is {{a species}} of <b>sedge</b> known by the common names {{clustered}} field <b>sedge,</b> field <b>sedge,</b> and expressway <b>sedge.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Carex tumulicola, the splitawn <b>sedge</b> {{foothill}} <b>sedge,</b> [...] or previously Berkeley <b>sedge,</b> is a <b>sedge</b> {{member of}} the Cyperaceae family.|$|R

5|$|The {{eastern part}} of the island is a lowland plateau, with {{isolated}} ponds and gently rolling hills. There is low but abundant vegetation, consisting of mosses, lichens, liverworts, ferns, grasses, <b>sedges,</b> and crowberry. The center of the island is mountainous, and the western end is barren and vegetation is sparse.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} grow in {{riparian}} zones along the park's washes. Willows and cottonwoods are the larger plants, joined by rushes and <b>sedges.</b> Here the invasive Eurasian tamarisk, {{also known as}} saltcedar, threatens native plants by crowding, using most of the available water, and increasing soil salinity by exuding salt through its leaves.|$|E
5|$|At the {{floodplain}} at {{the confluence of}} Ithan Creek and Darby Creek, the main trees species include silver maple, black willow, boxelder, and red maple. In the wetlands at this site, the main tree species include scattered black willow and silver maple. There are also patches of silky dogwood and wild rose, which are surrounded by assorted wetland plants, including herbs, grasses, <b>sedges,</b> and rushes. However, numerous exotic plants also inhabit the site.|$|E
5000|$|Carex rosea Schkuhr - Rosy <b>Sedge,</b> Stellate <b>Sedge,</b> Curly-Styled Wood <b>Sedge</b> R ...|$|R
50|$|Carex concinna is {{a species}} of <b>sedge</b> known by the common names low {{northern}} <b>sedge,</b> northern elegant <b>sedge,</b> beauty <b>sedge,</b> and beautiful <b>sedge.</b> It is native to northern North America, where it occurs across Canada and in high elevations in the northern contiguous United States.|$|R
50|$|Sierra <b>sedge</b> (Carex helleri), in the <b>sedge</b> family (Cyperaceae), {{grows on}} gravelly and rocky slopes up to 13600 ft. A {{characteristic}} <b>sedge</b> family member is alpine <b>sedge</b> (Carex subnigricans).|$|R
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is an {{omnivorous}} species with a diverse diet. It feeds by dabbling {{in shallow water}} and grazing on land. Its plant diet primarily includes {{a wide variety of}} wetland grasses and <b>sedges,</b> and the seeds, stems, leaves and root stalks of aquatic plants, such as eelgrass, pondweed and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the island}} {{is typical of the}} Outer Hebrides with heather, {{sphagnum}} moss, <b>sedges,</b> grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single treeâ€“ a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various <b>sedges.</b> The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E
50|$|Small blue-green sedges: {{glaucous}} <b>sedge</b> (Carex flacca), common <b>sedge</b> (Carex nigra), carnation <b>sedge</b> (Carex panicea) etc.|$|R
50|$|Grassland {{areas on}} the site contain the {{uncommon}} bloody cranes-bill (Geranium sanguineum) {{as well as the}} nationally scarce <b>sedge</b> species: dwarf <b>sedge</b> (Carex humilis), fingered <b>sedge</b> (Carex digitata) and soft-leaved <b>sedge</b> (Carex montana).|$|R
50|$|Carex eburnea (ivory <b>sedge</b> or bristleleaf <b>sedge)</b> is a {{small and}} slender <b>sedge</b> native to North America.|$|R
5|$|The later evolved commelinids have {{various kinds}} of flower, few of which are 'lily-like'. In the order Poales, {{comprising}} grasses, rushes and <b>sedges,</b> flowers are either petal-less or have small, unshowy petals. Many Zingiberales species have brightly coloured and showy flowers. However, their apparent structure is misleading. For example, the six tepals of cannas are small and hidden under expanded and brightly coloured stamens or staminodes which resemble petals and may be mistaken for them.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also home}} to several bogs, which exist as breaks in the cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that impedes the root systems of woody plants. Kohala's bogs are characterized by <b>sedges,</b> mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{water in}} the bog is low in {{nutrients}} and high in acidity, which {{makes it difficult for}} most plants to live there. Only specialized plants can thrive in the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of orchid. Wild cranberries and blueberries grow in the bog along with <b>sedges,</b> leatherleaf shrubs, Arctic cotton grass, and viburnums. The bogs are all protected by the state of Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|Carex lasiocarpa is {{a species}} of <b>sedge</b> known by the common names slender <b>sedge</b> and woollyfruit <b>sedge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carex rostrata, bottle <b>sedge</b> or beaked <b>sedge,</b> is a {{perennial}} species of <b>sedge</b> {{in the family}} Cyperaceae.|$|R
50|$|Carex echinata is {{a species}} of <b>sedge</b> known by the common names star <b>sedge</b> and little prickly <b>sedge.</b>|$|R
5|$|There are {{few or no}} {{riparian}} buffers along Mud Creek {{where it}} flows through agricultural land. However, the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory has recommended restoring the riparian buffers in Derry Township. A wet meadow is located along the creek north of Washingtonville. Plant types typically found in wet meadows include various ferns, <b>sedges,</b> grasses, and red maples. Mud Creek is designated as a warm-water fishery.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} wildflower {{species in the}} uplands and rock outcroppings of the Turkey Hill Oxbow. These include white baneberry, northern maidenhair fern, spikenard, blue cohosh, foamflower, false Solomon's seal, purple trillium, and wild columbine. Animals inhabiting the areas surrounding the pools include pickerel frogs, green frogs, wood ducks, and snapping turtles. Plants in this location include broadleaf arrowhead, northern blueflag, manna grasses, water starwort, and several varieties of <b>sedges.</b> Japanese knotweed has been seen near Interstate 80 on the northern edges of the Turkey Hill Oxbow.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, <b>sedges,</b> and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E
50|$|Carex sprengelii (Sprengel's <b>sedge</b> or long-beaked <b>sedge)</b> is a <b>sedge</b> with hanging seed heads, {{native to}} North America.|$|R
5000|$|Carex limosa is {{a species}} of <b>sedge</b> known by the common names bog-sedge, mud <b>sedge</b> and shore <b>sedge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carex disticha is a Eurasian {{species of}} <b>sedge</b> {{known as the}} brown <b>sedge</b> or, in North America, tworank <b>sedge.</b>|$|R
