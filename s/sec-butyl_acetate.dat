40|$|To {{identify}} chemical descriptors {{to distinguish}} Cuban from non-Cuban rums, analyses of 44 samples of rum from 15 different countries are described. To provide the chemical descriptors, {{analyses of the}} the mineral fraction, phenolic compounds, caramel, alcohols, acetic acid, ethyl acetate, ketones, and aldehydes were carried out. The analytical data were treated through the following chemometric methods: principal component analysis (PCA), partial least square-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA), and linear discriminate analysis (LDA). These analyses indicated 23 analytes as relevant chemical descriptors for the separation of rums into two distinct groups. The possibility of clustering the rum samples investigated through PCA analysis led to an accumulative percentage of 70. 4 % {{in the first three}} principal components, and isoamyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, copper, iron, 2 -furfuraldehyde (furfuraldehyde), phenylmethanal (benzaldehyde), epicatechin, and vanillin were used as chemical descriptors. By applying the PLS-DA technique to the whole set of analytical data, the following analytes have been selected as descriptors: acetone, sec-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, methanol, isoamyl alcohol, magnesium, sodium, lead, iron, manganese, copper, zinc, 4 -hydroxy 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzaldehyde (syringaldehyde), methaldehyde (formaldehyde), 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 furfuraldehyde (5 -HMF), acetalclehyde, 2 -furfuraldehyde, 2 -butenal (crotonaldehyde), n-pentanal (valeraldehyde), iso-pentanal (isovaleraldehyde), benzaldehyde, 2, 3 -butanodione monoxime, acetylacetone, epicatechin, and vanillin. By applying the LIDA technique, a model was developed, and the following analytes were selected as descriptors: ethyl <b>acetate,</b> <b>sec-butyl</b> alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, caramel, catechin, vanillin, epicatechin, manganese, acetalclehyde, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzoic acid, 2 -butenal, 4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzoic acid, cyclopentanone, acetone, lead, zinc, calcium, barium, strontium, and sodium. This model allowed the discrimination of Cuban rums from the others with 88. 2 % accuracy...|$|R

50|$|Budiodarone (ATI-2042) is an {{antiarrhythmic}} agent and chemical analog of amiodarone {{that is currently}} being studied in clinical trials. Amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available, but its adverse side effects, including hepatic, pulmonary and thyroid toxicity as well as multiple drug interactions, are discouraging its use. Budiodarone only differs in structure from amiodarone through {{the presence of a}} <b>sec-butyl</b> <b>acetate</b> side chain at position 2 of the benzofuran moiety. This side chain allows for budiodarone to have a shorter half-life in the body than amiodarone (7 hours versus 35-68 days) which allows it to have a faster onset of action and metabolism while still maintaining similar electrophysiological activity. The faster metabolism of budiodarone allows for fewer adverse side effects than amiodarone principally due to decreased levels of toxicity in the body.|$|E

VOCs typically found in a small nitrogen flow covering the skin are 3 -methyl- 2 -butenal, 6 -methylhept- 5 -en- 2 -one, <b>sec-butyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> benzaldehyde, octanal, 2 -ethylhexanol, nonanal and decanal at volume fractions in the low part per billion-(ppb) range.

The thermodynamic consistency of the VLE data was examined by Herrington method. Experimental data was correlated by NRTL and UNIQUAC parameter models. Both of the models satisfactorily correlated with the VLE data. The result showed that the UNIQUAC model was the most suitable one to represent experimental data satisfactorily. The UNIQUAC standard deviation in temperature and in vapor phase composition were 0. 3338, and 0. 0114, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Shipping of {{edible fats}} and oils into Europe is {{permitted}} in bulk tanks, in which substances, included in a positive list, had been previously transported. The European Commission requested EFSA to evaluate the list of substances in the Annex to Commission Directive 96 / 3 /EC as acceptable previous cargoes for edible {{fats and oils}}, taking into account its review of the Scientific Committee on Food criteria for acceptable previous cargoes and criteria proposed by the Codex Committee for Fats and Oils. This is the third and last scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) on this topic, in which sixteen of these substances or groups of substances have been evaluated. The CONTAM Panel concluded that sodium silicate (water glass) solution, iso-octanol, iso-nonanol, iso-decanol, 1, 3 -propanediol, isobutyl acetate, <b>sec-butyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> tert-butyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, propylene tetramer, paraffin wax, candelilla wax, white mineral oils and glycerol would not be of health concern as previous cargoes. The CONTAM Panel concluded that carnauba wax was not acceptable as a previous cargo because of its insolubility in water and high melting point, which raise concerns regarding the efficiency of tank cleaning. There was insufficient information available on the composition of montan wax for the CONTAM Panel to conclude {{that it would be}} of no health concern when used as previous cargo and hence it does not meet the criteria for acceptability as previous cargo. The CONTAM Panel made several recommendations regarding {{the way in which the}} substances are described in the Annex to Commission Directive 96 / 3 /EC, to correct inaccuracies and to better reflect current transport practices...|$|E
