Three research questions were used to achieve the goal. Semi-structured interviews with fourteen senior citizens who utilize <b>social</b> <b>services</b> in Prachatice were used to identify how seniors are informed about <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> Further I wanted to identify how elderly people are content with the offer and availability of <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> and how they are satisfied with the provision of <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> and what could be proposed to improve the offered and delivered <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> The acquired data were analysed using an open data coding method.

A few proposals were raised by respondents that could increase awareness of available <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> Seniors are partly satisfied with the offer and availability of <b>social</b> <b>services</b> while they are not content with the number of vacancies in the Senior Home. They consider the provision of <b>social</b> <b>services</b> in Prachatice to be sufficient. A high number of respondents would propose to increase vacancies in the Senior Home in order to enhance the <b>social</b> <b>services</b> offered in Prachatice. The respondents would also propose to extend the offer of <b>social</b> <b>services</b> by personal assistance, day care center for elderly, home hospice care and increased number of beds in the Nursing Home for Persons with Cognitive Impairment.

To hear their pleas, the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen Blatz as a special master.

Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W.

Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should have been responsible for making decisions about which services could stay open. Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo, which asked to remain open despite the shutdown, and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee. While both pay for themselves at least during the summer, Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations, so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day.|$|E
