Equipment consisted of a cord with a fixed handle on one end and a <b>sliding</b> <b>handle</b> on the other. The <b>sliding</b> <b>handle</b> was adjusted so that the cord length between the 2 handles equaled the participant's shoulder width. Holding the 2 handles, the participant must pass the cord {{from the front of the}} body over the head and as far back as possible with extended arms. The score is the fanning-out angle. Forward flexion, abduction, horizontal retroflexion, and outward rotation were also measured. The test and criterion measurements were administered within 1 wk. The criterion-related validity of the circumduc-tion test as a measure of forward flexion and horizontal retroflexion received support from moderate correlations. Its use as a measure of abduction and outward rotation, however, received no support from the data.

The Generalized Property R Conjecture is that all knots have Property nR for all n ≥ 1. The simplest plausible counterexample could be the square knot. Exploiting the remarkable symmetry of the square knot, we characterize all two-component links that contain it and which surger to # 2 (S 1 × S 2). We argue that at least one such link probably cannot be reduced to the unlink by a series of handle-slides, so the square knot probably does not have Property 2 R.

40|$|Abstract Background In situ {{hybridisation}} {{can provide}} cellular, {{and in some}} cases sub-cellular, resolution of mRNA levels within multicellular organisms and is widely used to provide spatial and temporal information on gene expression. However, standard protocols are complex and laborious to implement, restricting analysis to one or a few genes at any one time. Whole-mount and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) based protocols increase throughput, but can compromise both specificity and resolution. With the advent of genome-wide analysis of gene expression, there is an urgent need to develop high-throughput in situ methods that also provide high resolution. Results Here we describe the development of a method for performing high-throughput in situ hybridisations that retains both the high resolution and the specificity of the best manual versions. This refined semi-automated protocol has the potential for determining the spatial and temporal expression patterns of hundreds of genes in parallel on a variety of tissues. We show how tissue sections can be organized on microscope slides in a manner that allows the screening of multiple probes on each <b>slide.</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>handling,</b> hybridisation and processing steps have been streamlined providing a capacity of at least 200 probes per week (depending on the tissue type). The technique can be applied easily to different species and tissue types, and we illustrate this with wheat seed and Arabidopsis floral meristems, siliques and seedlings. Conclusion The approach has the high specificity and high resolution of previous in situ methods while allowing for the analysis of several genes expression patterns in parallel. This method has the potential to provide an analysis of gene expression patterns at the genome level. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Numerous {{validation}} {{studies in}} digital pathology confirmed its {{value as a}} diagnostic tool. However, a longer time to diagnosis than traditional microscopy {{has been seen as}} a significant barrier to the routine use of digital pathology. As a part of our validation study, we compared a digital and microscopic diagnostic time in the routine diagnostic setting. Materials and Methods: One senior staff pathologist reported 400 consecutive cases in histology, nongynecological, and fine needle aspiration cytology (20 sessions, 20 cases/session), over 4 weeks. Complex, difficult, and rare cases were excluded from the study to reduce the bias. A primary diagnosis was digital, followed by traditional microscopy, 6 months later, with only request forms available for both. Microscopic slides were scanned at × 20, digital images accessed through the fully integrated laboratory information management system (LIMS) and viewed in the image viewer on double 23 ” displays. A median broadband speed was 299 Mbps. A diagnostic time was measured from the point slides were made available to the point diagnosis was made or additional investigations were deemed necessary, recorded independently in minutes/session and compared. Results: A digital diagnostic time was 1841 and microscopic 1956 min; digital being shorter than microscopic in 13 sessions. Four sessions with shorter microscopic diagnostic time included more cases requiring extensive use of magnifications over × 20. Diagnostic time was similar in three sessions. Conclusions: A diagnostic time in digital pathology can be shorter than traditional microscopy in the routine diagnostic setting, with adequate and stable network speeds, fully integrated LIMS and double displays as default parameters. This also related to better ergonomics, larger viewing field, and absence of physical <b>slide</b> <b>handling,</b> with effects on both diagnostic and nondiagnostic time. Differences with previous studies included a design, image size, number of cases, specimen type, network speed, and participant's level of confidence and experience in digital reporting.

Flexibility analysis of the target protein is performed using the graph-theoretic algorithm FIRST, which also identifies coupled networks of covalent and non-covalent bonds within the protein. The available conformations of the flexible regions are then explored with ROCK by random-walk sampling of the rotatable bonds. ROCK explores correlated motions by only sampling dihedral angles that preserve the coupled bond networks in the protein and generates conformers with good stereochemistry without using a computationally expensive potential function.
