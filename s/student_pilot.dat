5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and {{came to rest on}} the M11 motorway, a <b>student</b> <b>pilot</b> being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E

40|$|The United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) and Aeromedical Consult Service (ACS) have {{developed}} waiver criteria for pilots with subtle substandard depth perception. This {{is to allow}} United States Air Force (USAF) pilots with mild depth perception deficiency to continue flying duties while limiting the risk to flight safety and ensuring the availability of costly human resources. From 1999 to 2005, 166 aviators were given waivers for intermittent monofixation syndrome (IMFS). Of these, 96 were <b>student</b> <b>pilots</b> who performed slightly worse at stereoptic dependent flight maneuvers than <b>student</b> <b>pilots</b> (8, 907) with normal depth perception (Lowry, 2006). ^ This study 2 ̆ 7 s purpose is to evaluate {{the performance of the}} extended-trail maneuver, a non-stereoptic dependent flying maneuver, as executed by a cohort of 12 United States Air Force <b>student</b> <b>pilots</b> with intermittent monofixation syndrome versus the cohort of 100 <b>student</b> <b>pilots</b> with normal depth perception.
