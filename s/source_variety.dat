40|$|AbstractThe {{notion of}} the Milnor number of an {{isolated}} singularity of a hypersurface has been generalized to the so-called “Milnor class” {{in such a way}} that the degree of the zero-dimensional component of the Milnor class is nothing but the Parusiński generalized Milnor number. The Milnor class of a local complete intersection in a smooth compact complex analytic manifold is defined, up to sign, by the difference of the Chern–Schwartz–MacPherson class and the virtual class or the Fulton–Chern class. In this paper, for certain reasonable morphisms we relate the Milnor classes of the target variety and the <b>source</b> <b>variety</b> via certain classes of the morphism, in particular, using the bivariant theory due to Fulton and MacPherson...|$|E

40|$|French {{spoken in}} Quebec (QF) is largely {{considered}} to be vastly different from Hexagonal French (HF), spoken in France, but this assumption has not been tested empirically. Systematic and accountable analyses of morphosyntactic features in HF are generally absent from the current body of linguistic research on French, which precludes the possibility of reliable comparison. This dissertation addresses this gap through the systematic analysis of three different linguistic variables in spoken HF (the subjunctive mood, the expression of necessity, and the expression of pronominal indefiniteness), using the comparative variationist sociolinguistics framework, which seeks to account for variability in language by demonstrating that choices made by speakers are not random, but rather are constrained by various social and linguistic factors. The analysis tests whether the strong community trends that deviate from the prescribed standard, shown to be operative in QF (e. g., Poplack, Lealess & Dion 2013), are also present in the <b>source</b> <b>variety</b> (HF) and if so, whether the underlying conditioning of the variability is parallel across the two varieties. The results of this research reveal nearly identical underlying systems in both varieties {{in the case of}} the subjunctive mood and the expression of necessity. The most notable difference is the circumstantial proportion of specific lexical items (namely falloir que, which is strongly entrenched with the subjunctive mood in QF and is also the main variant used to express necessity), which is eventually linked to the different strategies employed in each variety to express indefinite necessity and indefiniteness more generally. The results of this research highlight the importance of considering the consequences of one change on another and how variability in one area of the grammar contributes to the larger picture. It also represents the first comparative variationist analysis of morphosyntactic variation in QF and HF, and thus contributes to clarifying our understanding of the (dis) similarities between the two varieties, in addition to offering insight into the relationship between transplanted dialects and their <b>source</b> <b>variety</b> more generally...|$|E

A numerical invariant of a rational map is introduced, called the Jacobian dual rank. It is proved that a rational map in this general setup is birational {{if and only if}} the Jacobian dual rank attains its maximal possible value. Even in the "classical" case where the <b>source</b> <b>variety</b> is irreducible there is some gain for this invariant over the degree of the map as it is, on one hand, intrinsically related to natural constructions in commutative algebra and, on the other hand, is effectively straightforwardly computable. Applications are given to results so far only known in characteristic zero. In particular, the surprising result of Dolgachev concerning the degree of a plane polar Cremona map is given an alternative conceptual angle. Comment: 24 page...|$|E

Quantitative content analysis was performed on 62 stories selected through a keyword search for the period December 23, 2003 through October 31, 2004 from U. S. newspapers included in the LexisNexis database. These stories were divided into two equal groups based on reporter work-role identity and were analyzed by length, number of sources, and <b>source</b> <b>variety,</b> and by location, circulation, and ownership of the newspapers in which they appeared. ANOVA, bivariate correlation, and forced entry regression were statistical techniques used. Results indicated numbers of stories, story length, and numbers of sources per story appear related to newspaper location, and use of scientists and agricultural scientists as sources to be correlated with type of newspaper. Newspaper circulation and ownership type were found to explain a statistically significant amount of variance in number of sources used. No statistically significant differences between mean length or mean number of sources used were found between stories written by science-specialty beat reporters and those written by reporters not assigned to such beats, contradicting previous research. However, while mean overall <b>source</b> <b>variety</b> did not differ between the two reporters groups, work-role identity was found to be correlated with use of scientists and agricultural scientists as sources. Extrapolation from this study suggests it is open to question whether (a) reporters would be well-advised to pursue courses of study or to seek additional training to build defined areas of expertise, better equipping themselves to cover more complex issues; (b) editors should seek candidates with such special training and structure their newsroom routines to accommodate specialty reporters when considering adding employees to their reporting staffs; and (c) universities should offer journalism curricula that facilitate both acquisition of basic reporting skills and registration for substantive electives which build subject-matter knowledge. Answers to these questions should be actively pursued, since they may shape the future of journalism education and practice...|$|E
40|$|Australian food {{products}} {{have a reputation}} for exceptional quality and are valued for by consumers for high safety standards. Recently, there have been several high profile incidents where Australian products “made from local and imported ingredients” have resulted in negative health outcomes which were traced back to produce that was not locally sourced. Local processing company Tropico Fruits produces an extensive range of fruit based products and list an Australian Kensington Pride mango puree among their flagship products. In light of the recent health issues arising from composite products using imported ingredients, the ability to test a processed product and identify the country of origin of it constituents is of great value to commercial enterprises that promote their products as locally sourced. Processed mango products are great candidates for assessing the feasibility of applying DNA-based identification methodologies for a number of reasons. DNA profiles have been determined for over 300 mango accession sourced from around the globe, including all the major domestic and overseas commercial varieties. Within all the commercial varieties, unique combinations of DNA markers exist such that a specific DNA profile {{can be traced back to}} the <b>source</b> <b>variety.</b> This means that even in composite purees, the major constituent varieties would be detected. To this end, four commercially produced mango purees were provided by Tropico Fruits and samples were subjected to a number of DNA extraction methodologies. While several of the methods produced workable quantities of highly degraded DNA, none of the extracted samples produced any results in the DNA fingerprinting steps. The objective of this project was to produce a set of reliable protocols that could determine the constituents of a processed product on the basis of a DNA profile. Unfortunately, while DNA was isolated using several techniques, the level of DNA degradation arising from the pureeing and sterilisation processes meant that DNA profiles could not be generate...|$|E

To some extent, how much light reflects for a given density of particles is dependent upon properties of the particles such as their shape, color, and reflectivity. Nephelometers are calibrated to a known particulate, then use environmental factors (k-factors) to compensate lighter or darker colored dusts accordingly. K-factor is determined by the user by running the nephelometer next to an air sampling pump and comparing results.
