5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
500|$|Davies {{stated that}} he {{originally}} intended to call this episode [...] "Dining with Monsters". He joked that a much better name for this episode would be [...] "What <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with Margaret?" [...] Davies intended the episode to be a character piece exploring whether the Doctor {{had the authority to}} take someone to their death sentence, as well as showing the consequences of the Doctor's actions the last time he met Margaret. The storyline was fitting for Eccleston's war-torn Doctor. The consequences of the Doctor's lifestyle is also explored through Rose's boyfriend Mickey, who has been forced to move on because she is not around. The resolution is a deliberate deus ex machina, regressing Margaret so she can start anew, although Davies remarked that the resolution did not come completely out of nowhere as the TARDIS' psychic link had been already established.|$|E
2500|$|Dany Roth of blastr.com was {{impressed}} by the show's costume designs, stating that they are [...] "possibly the best on TV right now. Each costume {{tells the story of the}} world, of the people, of the specific character." [...] He said that, like Mad Max, The 100 [...] "understands that the Grounders are repurposing tools and clothing from a time long dead. But the costumes are far from uniform. The people who lived on the ark, the people who live in the forest, the people who live in a frozen tundra, they all dress differently.", and although [...] "there's fashion here that makes the clothes exciting", it is the clothes that tell the story. [...] "I've said this many times before and I'll say it again here," [...] he added, [...] "a good costume makes a good actor a great one. Costumes make a show's world real." [...] Maureen Ryan of Variety, formerly of The Huffington Post, stated that the [...] "most enduring image of Lexa is one of her sitting on a throne made of intertwined branches, her enigmatic eyes looking out from a face half-covered in elaborate war paint." [...] Debnam-Carey said, [...] "I'm lucky they put me in such a badass costume and makeup. It's funny, we did a whole day of tests with that makeup. We were like, 'Should we do this? <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> tears? <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the bindi?'" [...] She collaborated with Rothenberg on the makeup and wardrobe for her character, and both collaborated with viewers on fan versions of the designs.|$|E
5000|$|When Johnson picked Sargent Shriver {{to head up}} his [...] "War on Poverty" [...] in 1966, Vaughn {{was named}} Peace Corps director. [...] "It was so good, so positive," [...] Vaughn said of his appointment. [...] "As a former bureaucrat, to join the Peace Corps was pure joy. All the stuff I knew <b>we</b> shouldn't <b>do,</b> <b>we</b> didn't <b>do.</b> All the things <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> efficiently, {{effectively}} and cheaply." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the tumultuous events, Madame Nhu {{appeared}} on NBC-TV's Meet the Press on 13 October 1963, defending her actions and those of the South Vietnamese government. [...] "I don't know why you Americans dislike us ... Is it because the world is under a spell called liberalism? Your own public, here in America, is not as anti-Communistic as ours is in Vietnam. Americans talk about my husband and I leaving our native land permanently. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> this? Where would we go? To say that 70 percent of my country's population is Buddhistic is absolutely true. My father, who was our ambassador to the United States until two months ago, has been against me since my childhood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many deaths followed, as {{the direct}} results of {{starvation}} and exhaustion, while the local German troops carried out selective shootings. The survivors were sent {{back over the}} river, and the German commanders expressed irritation over the methods applied by their counterparts. Romanian authorities subsequently introduced ghettos or transit camps. After the annexation of Transnistria, there ensued a systematic deportation of Jews from Bessarabia, with additional transports of Jews from the Old Kingdom (especially Moldavia-proper). Based on an assignment Antonescu handed down to General Ioan Topor, the decision involved specific quotas, and the transports, {{most of which were}} carried out by foot, involved random murders. In conjunction with Antonescu's expansionist ambitions, {{it is possible that the}} ultimate destination for the survivors, once circumstances permitted it, was further east than the Southern Bug. On 11 October 1941, the chief of the Federation of Jewish Communities, Wilhelm Filderman issued a public letter to Antonescu asking him to stop the deportations, writing: [...] "This is death, death for no reason except that they are Jews." [...] Antonescu replied to Filderman in a long letter explaining that because the entire Jewish community of Bessarabia had allegedly collaborated with the Soviets during the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, his policies were a justified act of revenge. On 11 November 1941, Antonescu sent Filderman a second letter stating no Jews would be allowed to live in the [...] "liberated territories" [...] and as for the Jews of the Regat: [...] "We decided to defend our Romanian rights because our all-too-tolerant past was taken advantage of by the Jews and facilitated the abuse of our rights by foreigners, particularly the Jews...We are determined to put an end to this situation. We cannot afford to put in jeopardy the existence of our nation because of several hundred thousand Jews, or in order to salvage some principle of humane democracy that has not been understood properly." [...] The deportees' remaining property was nationalized, confiscated or left available for plunder. With its own Jewish population confined and subjected to extermination, Transnistria became infamous in short time, especially so for its three main concentration camps: Peciora, Akhmechetka, Bogdanovka, Domanovka and Obodovka. Manned by Romanian Gendarmes and local Ukrainian auxiliaries who acted with the consent of central authorities, Transnistrian localities became the sites of mass executions, particularly after the administrators became worried about the spread of typhus from the camps and into the surrounding region. At a Cabinet meeting on 16 December 1941 to discuss the fate of the Jews of Transnistria, Antonescu stated: [...] "The question of the Yids is being discussed in Berlin. The Germans want to bring the Yids from Europe to Russia and settle them in certain areas, but there is still time before this plan is carried out. Meanwhile, what <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> Shall we wait for a decision in Berlin? Shall we wait for a decision that concerns us? Shall we ensure their safety? Pack them into catacombs! Throw them into the Black Sea! As far I am concerned, 100 may die, 1, 000 may die, all of them may die" [...] Between 21-24 and 28–31 December 1941, Romanian gendarmes and Ukrainian auxiliaries killed about 70, 000 Jews at the Bogdanovca camp; the massacre was Antonescu's way of dealing a typhus epidemic that had broken out among the Jews of Transistria owing to the poor living conditions that had been forced to endure. [...] The last wave of Jewish deportations, occurring in June 1942, came mainly from the Cernăuți area in Northern Bukovina.|$|E

If we could have taken our horses down with us before we opened fire <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done</b> so, and being so well mounted, I think few of them would have got away; but we could not manage it without risking being seen, and in that case the Boers, on making out what our strength was, would certainly have shown fight; and even if we had beaten them, which I don't suppose <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have suffered heavily." ...|$|R
