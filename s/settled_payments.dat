5000|$|The Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) is a bank owned {{automated}} funds-transfer {{system for}} {{domestic and international}} high value payment transactions in U.S. dollars.

Management of the supply of reserves within the system is critical to ensuring that interbank payments clear on a daily basis. Because tax payments to the government {{reduce the amount of}} reserves in the banking system, the TT&L program provides a buffer for system reserve management, preventing reserve shortfalls on heavy tax payment days which would threaten the ability of banks to <b>settle</b> their <b>payment</b> obligations (ATM transaction and cheque clearing).|$|R

50|$|The United States Clearing System is {{the largest}} {{clearing}} system in the world. Millions of transactions, valued in the trillions of dollars, are conducted between sellers and purchasers of goods, services, or financial assets on a daily basis.

The Federal Reserve therefore performs an intermediary role, clearing and <b>settling</b> international bank <b>payments.</b> Prior to {{the completion of the}} clearing, the banks <b>settle</b> <b>payment</b> transactions by debiting the accounts of the depository institutions, while crediting the accounts of depository institutions receiving the payments.|$|R

BOT became a close partner of the Ministry of Finance and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation in directing Japan's foreign trade policy during the postwar era.

5000|$|CHATS, {{like other}} RTGS systems, <b>settles</b> <b>payment</b> {{transactions}} on a [...] "real time" [...] and [...] "gross" [...] basis—payments are not subjected to any waiting period and each transaction is settled in a one-to-one manner {{such that it}} is not bunched with other transactions. It is a single-tier system where participants settle with one central clearing house. Payments are final, irrevocable, and settled immediately if there is sufficient funds in the participant's settlement account with the clearing house. Daylight overdraft is not offered in CHATS; payments that cannot be settled due to insufficient funds are queued. Banks are able to alter, cancel, and re-sequence payments in their queues.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates a {{collateral}} pool settlement (CPS) payment system – {{a system that}} provides intra-day liquidity against a {{collateral pool}}. First, we show that participants of CPS do not have incentives to delay payments once they have committed to participate. This is in striking contrast to a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system where banks have strong incentives to free-ride on liquidity provided by incoming payments. Second, we establish conditions under which banks prefer {{to participate in a}} collateral pool instead of <b>settling</b> <b>payments</b> in RTGS. Third, we show that a late payment equilibrium may arise in RTGS {{in the presence of a}} possible intra-day failure of a participant if the cost of intra-day liquidity is sufficiently high...|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of CHATS as a RTGS system, interbank {{settlements}} in Hong Kong relied on a multi-tier system which settled in a daily net basis. About 170 banks settled with 10 banks. These 10 banks, in turn, settled with Hongkong Bank, which then settled with the HKMA in a one-to-one basis. Hongkong Bank acted as the clearing house under this system, <b>settling</b> <b>payments</b> across its books in a net basis on the day following the transactions. The HKMA decided that this did not meet international standards as set by G10's Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems; following a six-month feasibility study, in June 1994, it decided to develop CHATS as a RTGS system.|$|R

The common and preferred equity securities that traded on the NYSE during the year 1920 were analyzed. The effect on bid-ask spreads and volume traded were scrutinized. It was found that these securities had increases in bid-ask spreads and decreases in volume traded, contrary to prior hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model of a Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payment system with tiered {{membership}} where settlement is facilitated by intraday credit extensions from the central bank. RTGS systems process and <b>settle</b> <b>payment</b> instructions individually in real time, ensuring intraday finality. Furthermore, central banks typically provide the settlement accounts across which payments are processed; hence, settlement is typically effected in central bank money, thereby eliminating counterparty risks between members once settlement has taken place. The model allows us to examine the key factors that influence both an agent. s decision over whether to participate directly in an RTGS payment system, and a central bank. s decision as to whether to require collateralisation of intraday credit extensions to payment system participants. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies banks' {{incentives}} for choosing {{the timing of}} their payment submissions in a collateral-based real-time gross settlement payment system {{and the way in}} which these incentives change with the introduction of a liquidity-saving mechanism (LSM). We show that an LSM allows banks to economize on collateral while also providing incentives to submit payments earlier. The reason is that, in our model, an LSM allows payments to be matched and offset, helping to <b>settle</b> <b>payment</b> cycles in which each bank must receive a payment that provides sufficient funds to allow the settlement of its own payment. In contrast to fee-based systems, for which Martin and McAndrews (2008 a) show that introducing an LSM can lead to lower welfare, in our model welfare is always higher with an LSM in a collateral-based system...|$|R
