500|$|During an {{interview}} with Billboard, West revealed that he had worked with Chris Martin, the lead singer of the British alternative rock band Coldplay, on a song entitled [...] "Homecoming", and that it just might possibly be released as the lead single for Graduation. The collaboration occurred the year before when Kanye West and Chris Martin met one another during an impromptu jam session at the Abbey Road Studios in London, England. West had just finished performing at a show that had been held at Abbey Road and the band just so happened to be recording their music in the recording studio {{at exactly the same}} time. The song in itself is actually a re-vamping for [...] "Home (Windy)", a track that originated from a demo tape dating back to the year 2001. It was made available two years later under the new title [...] "Home" [...] on West's 2003 mixtape Get Well Soon... and also on the advance copy of West's debut studio album The College Dropout, which due to a leak was never released. This original version possesses Kanye West's once trademark classic soul vocal <b>sample</b> <b>production</b> style, with singer John Legend on the chorus, which contains lyrics that are different than Martin's. This {{is due to the fact}} that Chris Martin asked Kanye West to change the song's lyrical content.|$|E

5000|$|The initial {{outcome of}} the early {{recordings}} of [...] "Home (Windy)" [...] brandished West's once trademark soulful vocal <b>sample</b> <b>production</b> style. Additionally, the lyrics of the chorus were sung by singer John Legend, who was known as John Stephens at the time. The original chorus contains a set of lyrics that are entirely different than that of Chris Martin's. On [...] "Homecoming," [...] Chris Martin sings about Kanye West returning to his hometown of Chicago, Illinois. In contrast, John Legend sang about soldiers who {{did not make it}} back and return home from war. This {{is due to the fact}} that Chris Martin asked Kanye West to change the lyrical content. It was Martin who came up with the song's new concept and also requested to alter the production aspect. In regards to this, West had already the hip-hop beat for what would later on become the track [...] "Heard 'Em Say," [...] the third single from his sophomore album Late Registration. However, Chris Martin reportedly advocated, [...] "No this track's beat needs to be more like a homecoming or something." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Homecoming" [...] {{is a song}} by American hip-hop {{recording}} artist and record producer Kanye West. It was included as the twelfth song on the track-listing of his third studio album Graduation (2007). The track was produced by West with Warryn Campbell and features guest vocals from Chris Martin, lead singer of the English alternative rock band Coldplay. West met Chris Martin by chance at the famed Abbey Road Studios in London, England on February 14, 2006. Afterwards, the two artists held an impromptu jam session and recorded the track. Kanye West wrote [...] "Homecoming" [...] as a tribute dedicated to his hometown of Chicago, Illinois. His song's conceptual lyrics feature an extended metaphor where he uses a love interest to speak on his relationship with her. The composition is actually a re-recording of a track known as [...] "Home (Windy)" [...] that originated from a demo tape {{dating back to the}} year 2001. The early recordings of [...] "Home (Windy)" [...] exhibit West's once trademark soulful vocal <b>sample</b> <b>production</b> style.

5000|$|Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews {{praised the}} album for {{continuing}} Purple Hazes formula with tight wordplay and loose soul <b>sample</b> <b>production,</b> despite containing tracks that were Dipset holdovers, concluding that, [...] "Nonetheless Cam fans {{should be happy}} with Killa Season, an album which continues his recent trend of solid (if somewhat unspectacular) solo CD's." [...] Jayson Greene of Stylus Magazine found some of Cam's lyrics humorous at times, but found the production and guest artists lacking in variety in terms of go-to names, concluding with [...] "Instead, Killa Season is a retreat, an album to satisfy the converted but one that will keep his mythical status confined to the 12-mile radius of his Manhattan home." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media felt the album was a disappointment compared to Purple Haze, finding the production lacking in energy {{and in need of}} more humorous songs ("I.B.S.") then aggressive diss tracks ("You Gotta Love It"). Dombal also pointed out that the limited edition of the album contained a DVD that reveals Cam'ron's battle with Jay-Z was all for publicity, concluding that, [...] "If this underwhelming offering is any indication, such blind self-reference has considerably slowed down Cam'ron's once-unstoppable Dipset Movement." ...|$|E
