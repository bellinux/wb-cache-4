Some time previous several Indians had appeared with fish oil and some dried fat fish to sell, and they had purchased a quantity of both for lighting purposes. The oil was used in a lamp made of a round tin having a home-made wick hanging over the side. The fat fish, dried very hard, were <b>slit</b> in <b>strips</b> and set up, to be lighted and burnt as tallow candles.

40|$|We are {{concerned}} {{in this thesis}} {{with the problem of}} how to extend standard methods of approximating analytic functions on an interval, say [0, 1], to representing with exponential accuracy the more general class of functions analytic on (0, 1) and continuous on [0, 1]. The particular approach we take is based upon using an exponential change of variables to transform (0, 1) to (-∞, ∞) thus in the process mapping any endpoint singularities to infinity. Under mild hypotheses, the resulting function is analytic on the real line and may therefore be approximated to exponential accuracy by a spectral interpolant. These ideas form the foundations of an established class of techniques referred to as sine methods. Vie begin by providing a thorough review of sine methods which takes the form of a description of a computational software package called Sincfun. Our experiences lead us to two key conclusions: (i) it is possible to use other bases instead of sine functions; and (ii) such methods in general seem to lead to highly inefficient representations, particularly for oscillatory functions. Regarding (i), we first set out a new convergence theory for variable transformation methods based on Chebyshev polynomials. We show that, 'when a function only has singularity at only one endpoint, mapping to a semi-infinite interval rather than an infinite one can lead to a much improved exponential rate of convergence, from C-√n to c-n 2 / 3 We also perform a thorough analysis of related numerical methods based on so-called double-exponential transforms. Regarding (ii), we first quantify the inefficiency of exponential transform methods, showing that they are suboptimal in a certain precisely defined sense. We then proceed to derive a new' class of transforms which map conformally from an infinite strip to an infinite <b>slit</b> <b>strip.</b> The resulting numerical schemes are demonstrated to have highly desirable properties with regards to the resolution of oscillatory functions. Finally, we derive new quadrature rules, methods for indefinite integration, and spectral methods for application to singular boundary value problems. All of these techniques are based around our new approach of 'variable transformation used in conjunction with Chebyshev interpolation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This situation is relevant in optics, quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics. We focus on the case when the wavelength {{is comparable to the}} obstacle size, when the most standard approximations fail. The approximations of the radial (or modified) Mathieu functions using WKB method are shown to be especially efficient, in order to precisely evaluate series of such functions. It is illustrated with the numerical computation of the Green function when the wave is scattered by a single <b>slit</b> or a <b>strip</b> (ribbon). Comment: 41 pages, 15 figure...|$|R

The previous {{study of this}} problem usually concentrated on the numerical method; however, we try to analyze this problem and the convergence of the numerical solution from the mathematical {{point of view in}} this work. By use of the Dirichlet to Neumann operator on the <b>slit</b> between two <b>strips,</b> we reformulate the problem to an operator equation. The well-posedness of the solution to the operator equation is proved. The Galerkin method is applied to solve this operator equation and the convergence result of the numerical solution is also derived. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of our method and verify the theoretical convergence result.|$|R

This is achieved by embedding inside the inverted triangular shaped patch a pair of L-shaped slits that have been rotated by ± 90 ° {{so that they are}} horizontal and downward facing, and topping the patch with an arrow-shaped strip. The feedline to the patch also needs to be backed with a trapezoid shaped ground-plane. The center frequency of the notched bands can be easily controlled by altering the parameters of the <b>slits</b> and arrow-shaped <b>strip.</b> The low-profile antenna essentially radiates omni-directionally and has a measured impedance bandwidth of 18. 9 GHz (2. 9 – 21. 8 GHz) with a VSWR[*]≤[*] 2, except at the two rejection bands.

If the manufacturer desired, B.B. Chemical supplied the fabric, pre-coated it, and slit it. B.B. Chemical also supplied adhesive, {{to be applied to}} the pre-coated fabric at the shoe factory immediately prior to the application of the reinforcing material to the insole, and also provided machines suitable for use in applying the adhesive to the strips, the machines being and remaining the property of B.B.

Chemical, in addition, gave instructions to operators, serviced the machines and advised and assisted in the reinforcing operation. As compensation for the foregoing, B.B. Chemical made a single charge to the shoe manufacturers at a rate per web yard of fabric supplied. If the manufacturer did not furnish the fabric, the price of that material was added to the charge. The adhesives used by B.B. Chemical in pre-coating the fabric have all had a large rubber content but were made according to different formulae, developed from time to time by B.B. Chemical with special reference to the patent. B.B. Chemical did not grant written licenses to shoe manufacturers, nor was any such license ever requested.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{mechanism}} {{to construct a}} tunable and ultracompact refractive index sensor by using the Fano resonance in metal-graphene hybrid nanostructure. Plasmon modes in graphene nanoribbons and waveguide resonance modes in the <b>slits</b> of metal <b>strip</b> array coexist in this system. Strong interference between the two different modes occurs when they are spectrally overlapped, resulting in a Fano-type asymmetrically spectral lineshape {{which can be used}} for detecting the variations of ambient refractive index. The proposed sensor has a relatively high figure of merit (FOM) over 20 and its sensing performance shows a good tolerance to roughness. In addition to the wide range measurement enabled by the electrical tuning of graphene plasmon modes, such ultracompact system also provides an angle-independent operation and therefore, it can efficiently work for the detection of gas, liquid, or solids. Such optical nanostructure may also be applied to diverse fields such as temperature/pressure metering, medical detection, and mechanical precision measurement. Department of Applied Physic...|$|R

Pieces of different sizes cannot appear in the same cutting pattern because the orders do not arrive simultaneously.

The partial roll {{will be used to}} fulfill future orders and cannot be slit further. The approach determines several standard widths for the partial rolls and uses a greedy procedure to select the roll (either the original roll or a partial roll) to fulfill the current order. The computational results indicate that the approach is efficient in improving material utilization. Cutting stock Two-dimensional cutting Circle cutting Stainless steel rolls...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} {{of a large}} number of electronic channels poses a big challenge for Micro-pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) to achieve good spatial resolution. By using the redundancy that at least two neighboring strips record the signal of a particle, a novel method of encoded multiplexing readout for MPGDs is presented in this paper. The method offers a feasible and easily-extensible way of encoding and decoding, and can significantly reduce the number of readout channels. A verification test was carried out on a 5 * 5 cm 2 Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM) detector using a 8 keV Cu X-ray source with 100 um <b>slit,</b> where 166 <b>strips</b> are read out by 21 encoded readout channels.

The buffer strips were regularly spaced narrow strips of continuous S glass. Panels were made with a uniweave graphite cloth where the S glass buffer material was woven directly into the cloth. Panels were made with different width and thickness buffer strips.

The notched region and nearby buffer strips were radiographed periodically to reveal crack growth and damage. Except for panels with short <b>slits,</b> the buffer <b>strips</b> arrested the propagating crack. The strength (or failing strain) of the panels was significantly higher than the strength of all-graphite panels with the same length slit.
