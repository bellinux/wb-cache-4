Although most electric appliances require a few amount of kilo-watt input, minimizing power losses during their operation gives a great benefit resulting in nationwide electric energy used by householders. In this paper, a model-based simulation for loss minimization using the space-phasor theory is proposed. Instead of a fixed 220 V, 50 Hz AC power source, a variable-voltage,variable-frequency (VVVF) control scheme is assumed to function the AC supply. By formulating and solving a constrained optimization of <b>single-phase</b> induction <b>motor</b> drives with VVVF, operation of the <b>single-phase</b> induction <b>motor</b> with minimum power losses can be attained.

Common off-grid pumpjack engines run on natural gas, often casing gas produced from the well, but pumpjacks have been run on many types of fuel, such as propane and diesel fuel. In harsh climates, such motors and engines may be housed in a shack for protection from the elements.

50|$|Polyphase {{power is}} {{particularly}} useful in AC motors, {{such as the}} induction motor, where it generates a rotating magnetic field. When a three-or-more-phase supply completes one full cycle, the magnetic field of a two-poles-per-phase motor has rotated through 360° in physical space; motors with more than two poles per phase require more power supply cycles to complete one physical revolution of the magnetic field and so these motors run slower. Induction motors using a rotating magnetic field were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla and developed in a three-phase form by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky in 1889. Previously all commercial motors were DC, with expensive commutators, high-maintenance brushes and characteristics unsuitable for operation on an alternating current network.

5000|$|The {{advantage}} of two-phase electrical power over single-phase {{was that it}} allowed for simple, self-starting electric motors. In {{the early days of}} electrical engineering, it was easier to analyze and design two-phase systems where the phases were completely separated. It was not until the invention of the method of symmetrical components in 1918 that polyphase power systems had a convenient mathematical tool for describing unbalanced load cases. The revolving magnetic field produced with a two-phase system allowed electric motors to provide torque from zero motor speed, which was not possible with a single-phase induction motor (without an additional starting means.) Induction motors designed for two-phase operation use a similar winding configuration as capacitor start <b>single-phase</b> <b>motors</b> (however, in a two-phase induction motor, the impedances of the two windings are identical, whereas in a single-phase induction motor, the impedances can be, and usually are, quite different, to reduce cost without sacrificing starting performance; indeed, some single-phase capacitor start/capacitor run induction motors have superior starting characteristics when compared to two- or three-phase induction motors.) ...|$|E
40|$|Household {{appliances}} utilize <b>single-phase</b> <b>motors</b> {{to perform}} everyday jobs {{whether it is}} to run a fan in an air conditioner or the compressor in a refrigerator. With {{the movement of the}} world going “green” and trying to make everything more efficient, it is a logical step to start with the items that we use every day. This can be done by replacing <b>single-phase</b> <b>motors</b> with three-phase motors in household appliances. Three-phase motors are 14 % more efficient than <b>single-phase</b> <b>motors</b> when running at full load and typically cost less over a large range of sizes [1]. One major downside of incorporating three-phase motors in household appliance is that three-phase power is not readily available in homes. With the motor replacement, a single to three-phase converter is necessary to convert the single-phase wall power into the required three-phase input of the motor. One option is active conversion, which uses switches and introduces different stages that produce power loss [2]. An alternative solution is passive conversion that utilizes the resistances within the motor windings along with additional capacitors and inductors, which in theory are lossless. This study focuses on three different single to three-phase passive converters to run both wye and delta-connected three-phase induction motors, and a possible third winding configuration that utilizes one of the three converters. There will be an emphasis on proving the equivalency of two converters, one proposed by Stuart Marinus and Michel Malengret [11] and the other by Otto Smith [12].
