During the 1980s the Commission launched a mix of infrastructure and social development projects which focused on development of roads, bridges, a fishing harbour facility, rural electricity infrastructure, livestock, education, vocational training and integrated rural development. In the 1990s the Commission streamlined and consolidated its portfolio and reoriented its activities towards policy-based <b>social</b> sector <b>investment</b> <b>programmes,</b> placing greater emphasis on human development and environmental management in line with shifts in government policy.

40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} {{has become the}} business issue of the 21 st century. Heightened expectations of the business sector, globalisation and increased media attention {{on the role of}} business in society are casting an intense spotlight on this issue. As a result, pressure has built on business to play a larger role in bringing about socio-economic development to many local communities where they operate. While for a long time companies {{have been involved in the}} community on a philanthropy basis, many companies today are reassessing the manner in which they conduct their corporate {{social responsibility}} programmes. Many companies are including corporate social responsibility issues into their strategic planning process and overall corporate strategy. Emphasis is given to certain strategic indicators that must be present in order for a company to be said to have taken a strategic approach to corporate social responsibility. This study adopted a critical-realist approach using a case study method to evaluate DaimlerChrysler South Africa’s corporate <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> <b>programmes</b> in the local community of the Border-Kei region against these strategic indicators. This new form of engagement is even challenging for a multinational corporation, which may feel that it is only obliged to assist the local community where its corporate headquarters is located. But as companies derive an everlarger share of revenue and profits from international operations, multinational companies are being called upon to redefine “community”, by looking beyond local, domestic and geographical communities to include those in regions where they have factories or factories operated by key suppliers. This study found that DCSA was strategically involved and had a good relationship with its local community. However, the company needs to be more connected with the rural communities to make local projects more successful especially after handover...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. South Africa {{has faced}} {{tremendous}} changes {{over the past}} decade, which has had {{a huge impact on}} the working environment. Organisations are compelled to address the societal disparities between various cultural groups. However, previously disadvantaged groups have had to face inequalities of the education system in the past, such as a lack of qualified teachers (especially in the natural sciences), and poor educational books and facilities. This has often resulted in poor grade 12 results. Social responsibility and <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> <b>programmes</b> are an attempt to rectify these inequalities. The objective of this research was to investigate the validity of the current selection battery of the Youth Foundation Training Programme (YFTP) in terms of academic performance of the students on the bridging programme. A correlational design was used in this research in order to investigate predictive validity whereby data on the assessment procedure was collected at about the time applicants were hired. The scores obtained from the Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), which forms part of the Raven's Progressive Matrices as well as the indices of the Potential Index Battery (PIB) tests, acted as the independent variables, while the Matric results of the participants served as the criterion measure ofthe dependent variable. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software programme by means of correlations and regression analyses. The results showed that although the current selection battery used for the bridging students does indeed have some value, it only appears to be a poor predictor of the Matric results. Individually, the SpEEx tests used in the battery evidently were not good predictors of the Matric results, while the respective beta weights of the individual instruments did confirm that the APM was the strongest predictor. Limitations were identified and recommendations for further research were discussed. Master...|$|R

The research was carried out at African Bank, a South African financial services organisation. The investigation included both qualitative and quantitative phases. The quantitative research took the form of a self-completed questionnaire. One hundred and seventy seven questionnaires were processed. The qualitative research took the form of a oneon- one interview with ten executives of African Bank. The main findings of this research were that female employees between the ages of 30 to 40 who hold down a supervisory or management position are the employees most likely to volunteer. There are many benefits for the employee, such as skills enhancement in areas such as teamwork, communication, and improved relationships with colleagues. Among the benefits for the employer, the research showed that employees were more committed to African Bank as a result of their CSI involvement but not necessarily more productive. A shared benefit for the employee and employer was the pride employees developed working for African Bank through the organisation’s CSI volunteer initiatives...|$|R

40|$|This {{working paper}} aims to answer three questions: {{what is the}} <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> {{approach}} (and what is it not), how should it be applied and where would it be most productively applied? The current New Zealand Government is following a “social investment” approach to improving the lives of disadvantaged New Zealanders The background to this approach is widespread agreement that for {{a small proportion of}} New Zealanders, improved economic performance has not been reflected in improved living standards and life chances, despite years of active policy interventions and considerable social spending. Further, there is limited evidence about the impact of current <b>programmes.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>investment,</b> Kiwi-style, represents an internationally unique approach in designing and implementing <b>social</b> policy <b>Investment</b> is applying resources today in the expectation of earning a return tomorrow. We define <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> as “a <b>programme</b> funded by the Government that entails applying resources today in the expectation that a measurable improvement in a dimension of policy interest will result {{at some point in the}} future”. New Zealand isn’t the only country using a <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach but while many approaches to <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> have been developed, <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> as practiced in Europe (where it is most predominant) presents some consistent themes. In general, it is applied very widely across the government’s activities, encompassing issues and themes such as gender equality, knowledge economy, youth unemployment and income redistribution. Since the early 1930 s, successive New Zealand governments have based social policy on the idea that the state could provide for the basic needs of families through uniform approaches. Basic needs could be met with universal programmes. This approach has however not proven successful in addressing the needs of and providing equality of opportunities for New Zealand’s most vulnerable. The New Zealand <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach can be best described by its three innovative features which work intimately together The first is client segmentation: identifying groups and individuals with very specific needs by using administrative data more effectively. This is a move away from the uniform approach to policy of the past. The second is intervention innovation: tailoring interventions to better address the specific needs identified through client segmentation, setting very clear expectations about the returns sought from the intervention and measuring those returns. There is a clear shift in focus away from broad programmes covering large groups of people (e. g. the unemployed, single mothers, the injured, the disabled, etc.) to designing interventions that are focusing on specific clients with specific characteristics. The final and perhaps most novel but least developed feature of the <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach is a new mode of governance. Client segmentation and intervention innovation are respectively the demand and supply side of the <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach, but without a structure which allows for and rewards risk taking in investing and learning what works, the <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach is merely a continuation of the past supplemented by better access to data. The governance and institutional change made possible by client segmentation and intervention innovation is necessary for the full implementation of the <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach in New Zealand. What institutional changes are required is still uncertain and needs significant attention from policymakers for this policy to succeed. Some aspects of the New Zealand <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach are not new and largely are a re-labelling of existing polices. There are, however some new, and internationally unique aspects, together with a clear intention to address long-term policy problems using new analytical and measurement tools to both define target populations and test results. This paper was funded as part of a joint project of NZIER and the Institute of Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University (IGPS) entitled “The <b>Social</b> <b>Investment</b> Approach”.  ...|$|R

40|$|The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{agenda and}} {{practice}} {{has been a}} part of the global, academic and corporate debate for many decades. Policymakers are increasingly viewing the private sector as an important role player in contributing towards meeting the socio-economic developmental challenges. The research study has assessed the role of CSR in South Africa's mining industry with a focus on the basic education system; by unpacking the objectives and the key challenges of the provincial department of basic education in the North West and Limpopo provinces. This research study has made use of Anglo American Platinum's Corporate <b>Social</b> <b>Investment</b> (CSI) education <b>programmes</b> as a case study to further gauge the impact of CSR engagement and key challenges that prevail in the execution of CSI education programmes. The challenges pertain to poor coordination and cooperation, poor consultation and strategic planning and lack of consistent review of monitoring and evaluation of all the stakeholders involved. Therefore, the paper argues that company's interests, incentives and motives to engage in CSI education programmes is twofold: one; CSI is used to project public relations and as a 'window-dressing' exercise and two; businesses are gradually viewing CSI as a long-term <b>investment</b> towards <b>social</b> and human capital that will benefit the corporations in the future...|$|R

Addressing these flaws this discussion paper explores {{the ways in which}} the European Institutions can re-evaluate and overcome challenges for a more positive European future. To do this, Janis A.

In close coordination with the European Parliament, the Commission should also review the Country Specific Recommendations with a stronger focus on a smaller number of key priorities for each country. The construction of a fiscal capacity should be made a priority in the new political cycle to resolve the absence of a mechanism to provide effective ex ante fiscal risk sharing in the Eurozone. Furthermore, to boost growth, there is a need to encourage private, public and <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> through a European <b>Investment</b> <b>Programme</b> (EIP) in the short term. Finally, the Commission should ensure that the implementation of an EIP is compatible with the long term goals of a fiscal capacity...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach, there remain ambiguities regarding how to design an effective <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policy. We review evaluations of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in Latin America in order to draw out lessons for how to improve the effectiveness of <b>social</b> <b>investment.</b> CCTs share many of the objectives of the <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach and are targeted at poorer groups. Since research shows that such groups are often not adequately supported through <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policies, analyzing CCTs holds particular promise. Our analysis finds that architects of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policies should consider three questions when designing a <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approach: how much investment is necessary to fulfill <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> functions, what is the causal mechanism through which the goals of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> are to be achieved and what array of policies are necessary for such mechanisms to be effective...|$|R

Broadly <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policy reforms in Canada, Australia, Japan and South Korea can be grouped into types: 1) the “invest in the future” approach more commonly taken by Canada and Australia; and 2) the “human capital activation and mobilization” approach more widely used in Japan and South Korea. The differences in these <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approaches stems from the differences in how the two groups of countries define <b>social</b> <b>investment,</b> and thus the choice of their policy instruments.

40|$|The “World Politics of Social Investment” (WoPSI) project aims at {{explaining}} {{variance in}} <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and <b>social</b> in-vestment reforms across democratic countries in {{different regions of}} the World. Virtually all capitalist economies grapple with challenges of demographic change, slow economic growth, poor employment performance and increasing poverty rates. In dealing with these pro-blems, a <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> strategy appeals to a wide audience, both political and academic. However, <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> reforms and per-formances in democratic countries around the globe are highly une-qual and remain fragmentary: different countries have implemented different types of policy instruments, with different functions, at diffe-rent points in time, and to different degrees. Despite a growing number of scientific contributions on social in-vestment reforms and their effects, a systematic mapping of the de-sign of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and policies in different democra-tic countries around the globe is still lacking. Moreover, we lack an explanation for the variance in the development of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policy reforms. This is where we locate the research interest of the project presented in this paper. In order to understand why <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and policies have developed differently across countries, we need to study the politics of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> reforms. Thus, we ask: How do <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and <b>social</b> in-vestment policy reforms vary across democratic countries around the globe? Under what political conditions do <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and/or reforms develop? In this paper, we situate these questions in the existing state of the literature, and we outline a way to answer these research questions in the context of social policy reforms in Latin America, East Asia, as well as Western and Eastern Europe. We argue that political coali-tions (actors and their interests), as well as the institutional embed-dedness of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> politics are key factors in explaining the high variety of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and policies between countries...|$|R

30|$|The role {{of ideas}} such as {{nationalism}} in Quebec or discourses on <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> {{have been found}} to be important in pushing more generous ECEC policies in Canada (White [2001], [2002 a], [2004], [2011 a], [2011 b]; Béland and Lecours [2006], [2008]; Mahon [2011]). In this case study, ideas emerged as particularly important. Ideas of <b>social</b> <b>investment,</b> linking ECEC to the government's economic growth agenda, and learning from the ‘best practices’ of other jurisdictions were influential in pushing towards an inclusive liberal model. However, it is imprudent to subscribe too much explanatory power to the presence of ideas around <b>social</b> <b>investment.</b> Similar to White's recent finding ([2012]) that the adoption of a <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> paradigm does not necessarily mean movement away from neo-liberal models of ECEC, this study found that <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> ideas were prevalent in all provinces examined, including those with more neo-liberal elements in their models. By 2011, <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> had become a common language and accepted paradigm among ECEC policy actors in Atlantic Canada. In and of themselves, <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> ideas were not able to secure inclusive liberal reforms. Rather, ideas of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> had to combine with other factors such as the presence of bureaucratic champions, a unified childcare sector, and appropriate opportunities for systematic change to push inclusive liberal reform.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increased}} focus amongst UK policy-makers on the marketisation of the third sector in an attempt to increase the sustainability of ‘voluntary, community and social enterprise’ (VCSE) organisations, with a number of policy initiatives focused on the use of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> to drive this marketisation. Furthermore, such policy initiatives have tended to focus on the ‘investment readiness’ of larger VCSE organisations, which has sought to increase the disparity in sustainability between larger national/regional VCSEs and their smaller local counterparts. This has also shaped the design of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> products that are arguably not suitable for smaller VCSEs and led to a lack of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> ‘deal-flow’ at the smaller end of the third sector. Whilst the dominant policy discourse in the UK views this lack of investment as being due to a deficiency in VCSE investment readiness, such an approach also ignores the lack of desire amongst VCSEs to utilise <b>social</b> <b>investment,</b> and the lack of suitable products available. This conflict between the aims of policy-makers and the apparent needs of practitioners has important implications for the culture and context created within policy discourse by dominant narratives in shaping the development of the third sector. This paper seeks to explore this dichotomy between policy and practice through a mixed-methods evaluation of the efficacy of an <b>investment</b> readiness support <b>programme</b> delivered in England. The research captured quantitative organisational demographic data from 868 VCSE applicants to the programme, {{in order to understand the}} demographics of small-scale VCSE organisations and also to assess their investment readiness. In addition, qualitative semi-structured interview data was also gathered from 37 key stakeholders (VCSEs; Support Providers; Investors; Commissioners; Policy-makers; and experts) involved in the programme, in order to understand the needs of VCSEs and the suitability of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> in meeting these. The results to date suggest that there is limited desire (and capacity) amongst smaller VCSEs for <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> and for seeking to scale (to date only 11 VCSEs that have engaged with the <b>programme</b> have secured <b>social</b> <b>investment).</b> The paper argues that policies focused on narrow methods of enhancing sustainability (<b>social</b> <b>investment)</b> are misplaced, and that wider sustainability support is therefore required to support VCSEs.
