500|$|As the {{difference}} between the two prices or quantities increases, the accuracy of the PED given by the formula above decreases for a combination of two reasons. [...] First, the PED for a good is not necessarily constant; as explained below, PED can vary at different points along the demand curve, due to its percentage nature. Elasticity is not the same thing as the slope of the demand curve, which is dependent on the units used for both price and quantity. [...] Second, percentage changes are not symmetric; instead, the percentage change between any two values depends on which one is chosen as the <b>starting</b> <b>value</b> and which as the ending value. For example, if quantity demanded increases from 10 units to 15 units, the percentage change is 50%, i.e., (15 − 10) ÷ 10 (converted to a percentage). [...] But if quantity demanded decreases from 15 units to 10 units, the percentage change is −33.3%, i.e., (10 − 15)÷15.|$|E

Different types of neural networks as well as several training methods have been evaluated in order to find the best equivalent model.

For simplicity, suppose that the <b>starting</b> <b>value</b> L(1) is 0.
