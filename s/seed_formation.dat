50|$|Hybrid {{production}} {{requires a}} female plant {{in which no}} viable male gametes are borne. Emasculation is done to prevent a plant from producing pollen so that it serves only as a female parent. Another simple way to establish a female line for hybrid seed production is to identify or create a line that is unable to produce viable pollen. Since this male-sterile line cannot self-pollinate, <b>seed</b> <b>formation</b> is dependent upon pollen from the male line. Cytoplasmic male sterility is used in hybrid seed production. In this case, the sterility is transmitted only through the female and all progeny will be sterile. This {{is not a problem}} for crops such as onions or carrots where the commodity harvested from the F1 generation is produced during vegetative growth. These CMS lines must be maintained by repeated crossing to a sister line (known as the maintainer line) that is genetically identical except that it possesses normal cytoplasm and is therefore male-fertile. In cytoplasmic - genetic male sterility restoration of fertility is done using restorer lines carrying nuclear genes. The male-sterile line is maintained by crossing with a maintainer line carrying the same nuclear genome as the MS line but with normal fertile cytoplasm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present paper {{reports on}} our {{observations}} on embryological processes {{occurring in the}} ovules of triploids: Taraxacum belorussicum (sect.

It forms a polyploid complex within which there is a close relationship between the mode of reproduction and the ploidy level: diploids reproduce sexually, whereas polyploids are apomicts.

The rice pollen exine, which is mainly composed of sporopollenin, comprises an outer layer (tectum), a foot layer (nexine), the middle bacula, and the tryphine in the cavities (Blackmore et al. 2007; Li and Zhang 2010; Zhang and Li 2014). The development of pollen exine involves three stages, including the formation and degradation of callose wall, the synthesis of primexine, and the secretion and deposition of sporopollenin (Godwin 1968; Rowley et al. 1981; Huang and Huang 2009). The biosynthesis of the sporopollenin precursors occurs in the tapetal cells, and these sporopollenin precursors are then transported {{to the surface of the}} microspore for exine formation (Domínguez et al. 1999; Liu and Fan 2013; Zhang et al. 2016).
