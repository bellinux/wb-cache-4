5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great <b>Silence</b> <b>was</b> awarded an 18 {{rating in}} Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns. The film performed {{better in the}} French and West German markets, {{largely due to the}} presence of Trintignant and Kinski. It has been reported that during a screening of the film in Sicily, one audience member fired a gun at the screen in anger over the film's ending.|$|E

What a <b>silence</b> <b>is</b> that with which the pale bride precedes the responsive I will, to the priest's solemn question, Wilt thou have this man for thy husband? In silence, too, the wedded hands are clasped. Yea, in silence the child Christ was born into the world. <b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> the general consecration of the universe. <b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> the invisible laying on of the Divine Pontiff's hands upon the world. <b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> at once the most harmless and the most awful thing in all nature. It speaks of the Reserved Forces of Fate. <b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> the only Voice of our God.|$|R

5|$|Film {{historian}} Howard Hughes suggests that, {{despite the}} implications of a large budget {{as a result of}} an international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise. These include several continuity errors and revealing mistakes present throughout the film, and a variance in the quality of the film stock. In comparison to the Technicolor/Techniscope presentation most Spaghetti Westerns were filmed in, The Great <b>Silence</b> <b>was</b> filmed in the standard European widescreen format and printed in Eastmancolor.|$|E
5|$|Following the film's completion, The Great <b>Silence</b> <b>was,</b> as per {{standard}} procedure for a Spaghetti Western, edited in its final, completed form and dubbed into five languages: Italian, French, Spanish, German and English.

Meher Baba said that his <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> not undertaken as a spiritual exercise but solely in connection with his universal work.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that his <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E

The AMCJA, though mostly non-Malay, did not represent a large section of the non-Malay communities in Malaya. The lack of interest in or loyalty to Malaya amongst the non-Malays seemed to justify ketuanan Melayu — Malay self-rule.|$|E

5|$|When The Great <b>Silence</b> <b>was</b> {{screened}} for Darryl F.

The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely unrelated project by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E

40|$|The study explores how Martin Heidegger conceives {{communication}} silence. The {{method used}} is meta analytic and allows revealing {{the figure of}} silence in Heidegger's thinking. In the writings of Martin Heidegger, silence appears as a possibility of communication. Dasein that chooses discourse can opt for <b>silence.</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> neither the destiny of the language {{nor is it a}} random limit for it. It <b>is</b> not <b>silence</b> that <b>is</b> decisive, but discourse. The logic of <b>silence</b> will <b>be</b> called by Heidegger “Sygetics” (in Greek “sigan” means “to <b>be</b> silent”). <b>Silence</b> <b>is</b> a place of thinking. According to Martin Heidegger, Sygetics does not translate the idea that discourse must <b>be</b> replaced by <b>silence.</b> Sigetics <b>is</b> logics of thinking silence...|$|R

5|$|Although Amir {{had little}} {{correspondence}} {{with his friends}} in Java, his poems– most {{of which had been}} written in Java– continued to be published in Poedjangga Baroe. His first poetry collection, Nyanyi Sunyi (Songs of <b>Silence),</b> <b>was</b> published in the magazine's November 1937 edition. Nearly two years later, in June 1939, the magazine published a collection of poems Amir had translated, entitled Setanggi Timur (Incense from the East). In June 1941 his last collection, Buah Rindu (Fruits of Longing), was published. All were later republished as stand-alone books. A last book, Sastera Melayu Lama dan Raja-Rajanya (Old Malay Literature and its Kings), was published in Medan in 1942; this was based on a radio speech Amir had delivered.|$|E
5|$|But {{despite their}} best efforts, Huggins {{died at the}} age of 51 on September 25, 1929 of pyaemia. The American League {{canceled}} its games for the following day out of respect, and the viewing of his casket at Yankee Stadium drew thousands of tearful fans. A moment of <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> held for Huggins before the start of Game 4 of the 1929 World Series (at Philadelphia's Shibe Park, after which the A's overcame an 8-0 Cub advantage with 10 runs in the last of the seventh for a spectacular 10-8 come-from-behind victory and a 3-1 Series advantage).

5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great <b>Silence</b> <b>was</b> theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great Silence is now widely regarded by fans and authorities on Spaghetti Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E

5|$|Rififis heist {{scene was}} based on an actual {{burglary}} that took place in 1899 along Marseille's cours St-Louis. A gang broke into the first floor offices of a travel agency, cutting a hole in the floor and using an umbrella to catch the debris in order to make off with the contents of the jeweler's shop below. The scene where Tony regretfully chooses to kill César for his betrayal of the thieves' code of <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> filmed as an allusion to how Dassin and others felt after finding their contemporaries willing to name names in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee.
