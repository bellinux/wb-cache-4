50|$|The {{original}} potter’s {{wheel of}} the Orient was a circular pad of woven matting that the potter turned by hand and wheel, and was known in Japan as the rokuro. But {{with the arrival of}} the te-rokuro or handwheel, the mechanics of throwing made possible a more subtle art. The <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> was a large, thick, circular piece of wood with shallow holes on the upper surface around the periphery of the disc. The potter kept the wheel in motion by inserting a wooden handle into one of the holes and revolving the <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> on its shaft until the desired speed was reached.|$|R
50|$|The {{grinding}} wheel {{is not limited}} to a cylindrical shape and can have a myriad of options that are useful in transferring different geometries to the object being worked on. <b>Straight</b> <b>wheels</b> can be dressed by the operator to produce custom geometries. When surface grinding an object, one must {{keep in mind that the}} shape of the wheel will be transferred to the material of the object like a reverse image.|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} {{grinding}} operation, {{the condition of}} the wheel is extremely important. Grinding dressers are used to maintain {{the condition of the}} wheel, these may be table mounted or mounted in the <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> where they can be readily applied.|$|R

40|$|The {{perpendicular}} guideway {{of surface}} grinder is required high coupling characteristics and high precise slide motion. The slider mechanism of <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> by intermittent holding of perpendicular guideway is proposed and studied. The experimental device {{is made for}} {{the model of the}} perpendicular guideway. The grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> slider is fixed to the perpendicular guideway during grinding operation by the elongation of PZT actuator and is released during the feed motion in the direction of depth of cut. The characteristics of the static rigidity by the holding force and the repeated motion of holding and releasing are examined experimentally and considered. The results are as follows. (1) Increase of pressing force (holding force) causes the increase of static stiffness. The stiffness is able to be calculated with the relations between contraction and pressed force of guideway surface. (2) The good response of repeated motion is obtained and the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} ductile mode {{grinding}} of brittle materials using grinding wheels {{with a grain}} size larger than the ductile-brittle transition value dc is defined as nano-grinding technology. Machine tools for ductile mode grinding of brittle materials according to principles of motion copying are required to have very high feed resolution, motion accuracy and stiffness. In the present paper, new ideas based {{on the principles of}} force control are introduced. These ideas are applied to a horizontal spindle surface grinding machine, a vertical spindle surface grinding machine and a centerless grinding machine. In these ultraprecision grinding machines, grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> is fed directly with dual hydraulic linear actuators based on principles of force control. These grinding machines have been built and evaluated through grinding test of brittle materials. They have high feed resolution of grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> which is order of nano meter. Stiffness and grinding accuracy are shown by experimental results. It is confirmed that ductile mode grinding is superior to lapping in shape generation...|$|R

5000|$|A round, moist lumpy {{clump of}} clay body is thrown at a {{wheelhead}} or a bat attached to it. (The term [...] "bat" [...] {{refers to a}} secondary disc or square, made of wood - or more recently plastic - to which the lump of clay is attached instead of the <b>wheel</b> <b>head,</b> thereby permitting the finished piece to be more easily lifted from the wheel.) The lump or clump is made even and forced to {{the centre of the}} wheel by applying pressure with the hands. The thrower finds the centre of the clay by moving a thumb across the lump until no more friction is felt. The thumb is pressed into the centre of the lump, stopping about 5 mm from the <b>wheel</b> <b>head.</b> The hole made is widened. The sides thus defined are pulled up and made thinner by pressure between the hands. The vessel is shaped, and the mouth is smoothed. The vessel is cut from the wheelhead or bat with a cheese wire and left to stiffen. Sometimes the stiffened vessel is inverted on the wheel and trimmed with a sharp tool.|$|R
40|$|The slider {{mechanism}} of <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> by intermittent holding of vertical guideway is proposed and studied. The experimental apparatus {{is made for}} {{the model of the}} vertical guideway. The grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> slider is fixed to the vertical guideway during grinding by the elongation of PZT actuator and is released during feed motion in the direction of depth of cut. Metalic slide material is tried to be used for the guideway surfaces without lubricating oil. The characteristics of the static rigidity and the repeated motion of holding and releasing are examined experimentally and considered. Further, method to check guideway space and device to keep constant pressing force are proposed. The results are as follows : (1) Increase of pressing force (holding force) causes increase of static stiffness. The siffness is able to be estimated with the relations between contraction and pressed force of guideway surface. It is estimated that the static stiffness of the apparatus on pressing force P= 150 N (Stress= 0. 3 MPa) is more than 6 times of the static stiffness of usual guideway. (2) Good response of repeated motion is obtained. Slider keeps the same position during grinding operation and also the depth of cut 0. 05 μm is easily fed...|$|R

50|$|Cylindrical {{grinding}} (also called center-type grinding) is used {{to grind}} the cylindrical surfaces and shoulders of the workpiece. The workpiece is mounted on centers and rotated by a device known as a drive dog or center driver. The abrasive wheel and the workpiece are rotated by separate motors and at different speeds. The table can be adjusted to produce tapers. The <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> can be swiveled.The five types of cylindrical grinding are: outside diameter (OD) grinding, inside diameter (ID) grinding, plunge grinding, creep feed grinding, and centerless grinding.|$|R

50|$|So {{far as we}} know, the {{original}} potter’s wheel of the Orient was a circular pad of woven matting that the potter turned by hand- and wheel known in Japan as the ‘’rokuro’’. But {{with the arrival of}} the ‘’te-rokuro’’ or “handwheel,” the mechanics of throwing developed into a more subtle art.The <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> was a large, thick, circular piece of wood with shallow holes on the upper surface around the periphery of the disc. The potter kept the wheel in motion by inserting a wooden handle into one of the holes and revolving the <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> on its shaft until he got the speed he desired.The handwheel is always turned clockwise, and the weight of the large <b>wheel</b> <b>head</b> induces it, after starting, to rotate for a long period of time. It revolves rapidly. Pieces made on it have a high degree of accuracy and symmetry because there is no movement of the potter’s body while throwing, as there is in the case of the kick wheel. In the early days of porcelain making in Japan, the Kyoto, Seto, and Nagoya areas used only the handwheel; elsewhere, in the Kutani area and in Arita, the kick wheel was employed.The Japanese-style kick wheel or ‘’ke-rokuro’’ was probably invented in China during the early Ming dynasty. The design of the kick wheel is similar in many aspects to that of the handwheel, or has a wooden tip set in the top of and iron pipe, like that of the latter-day wheel. The kick wheel is always turned in a counterclockwise direction, and the inevitable motion of the potter’s body as he kicks the wheel while throwing gives many Japanese pots that casual lack of symmetry which has much appeal to contemporary Western taste.Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, a student of Dr. Wagener went to Germany to learn how to build the downdraft kiln, and saw many wheels operated by belts on pulleys from a single shaft. On his return he set up a similar system in the Seto area, using one man to turn the flywheel that drove the shaft and the pulley system. From this the two man wheel developed.Today, the majority of potters in Kyoto use electric wheels, though there are many studios that still have a handwheel and a kick wheel. But it is very difficult now to find craftsmen who can make or repair them.|$|R
