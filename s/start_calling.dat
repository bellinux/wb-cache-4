5|$|The film is set during World War II {{in rural}} Vichy France, and {{begins with a}} nine-year-old French boy, Claude (Mathias Laliberté) {{escaping}} from an orphanage. He decides to avoid state protection. He meets a Romani caravan, an extended family of 20 men, women and children, who decide to adopt him. The Romani <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> Claude, Korkoro, the free one. Fascinated by their nomadic lifestyle, Claude decides to stay with them.|$|E
5|$|House sparrows can {{breed in}} the {{breeding}} season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes {{attempt to do}} so. Some birds breeding {{for the first time}} in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season, and fledge more young. As the breeding season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of hatching, the young <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> within the eggs. They have an egg-tooth {{at the tip of}} their snouts, which is {{developed}} from the skin, and that helps them pierce out of the shell. Hearing the calls, the female usually excavates the nest and sometimes takes the unhatched eggs in her mouth, slowly rolling the eggs to help the process. The young is usually carried to the water in the mouth. She would then introduce her hatchlings to the water and even feed them. The mother would then take care of her young for over a year before the next mating season. In the absence of the mother crocodile, the father would act in her place {{to take care of the}} young. However, even with a sophisticated parental nurturing, young crocodiles have a very high mortality rate due to their vulnerability to predation. A group of hatchlings is called a pod or crèche and may be protected for months.|$|E

[...] In 2006 London and Kendrick put the tag team name [...] "The Hooliganz" [...] on their wrestling attires and tried to convince the WWE management to <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> the team by that name, but were unsuccessful in their attempts.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Como was signed, movie musicals {{were on the}} wane and he became a studio {{contract}} player, where the actors or actresses worked only when the studio needed {{to fill out a}} schedule. Though his last movie, Words and Music, was made for prestigious Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Como fared no better. Less than two weeks before the film's release, Walter Winchell wrote in his syndicated column, [...] "Someone at MGM must have been dozing when they wrote the script for Words and Music. In most of the film Perry Como is called Eddie Anders and toward the end (for no reason) they <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> him Perry Como." [...] Como asked for and received a release from the remainder of his movie contract in the same year. Quoting Como, [...] "I was wasting their time and they were wasting mine." ...|$|E
500|$|At the crossword tournament, Homer bets {{his money}} from his breakup {{business}} on Lisa and wins big. However, upon hearing Lisa saying that she is wary of the final round, he bets on the other finalist, Gil Gunderson. Gil plays Lisa for her sympathy and cons her into losing the round, which in turn lets Homer win his final bet. Upon realizing that Homer has come into some money by betting against her in the tournament, Lisa gets angry at him and refuses to acknowledge herself as Homer's daughter, even {{going so far as}} to take Marge's maiden name and <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> herself [...] "Lisa Bouvier". Feeling guilty, Homer commissions Merl Reagle and Will Shortz to create a special puzzle for the New York Times, with his apology to Lisa hidden in the clues and solution. The two of them make up, and Lisa is happy to call herself a Simpson again.|$|E

500|$|Regarding if {{they would}} break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, [...] "A 22-episode arc is a lot for people to hold onto. By {{breaking}} it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it’s something the viewers enjoy, {{and it makes it}} a little easier to digest when you’re telling some of these stories." [...] Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be [...] "broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back-to-back, it feels weird to <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> it different things... We will try to have it in bite-sized chunks." [...] The season will begin airing its episodes on December 1, 2017, once Inhumans has aired its eight episodes, with the intent for all 22 episodes to air mostly uninterrupted.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{reception}} {{has been}} very favorable. Trans-Europe Express has the highest possible ratings from publications including AllMusic, Drowned in Sound, Mojo, Rolling Stone and Slant Magazine. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that the album [...] "is often cited as perhaps the archetypal (and most accessible) Kraftwerk album ... Overall, Trans-Europe Express offers the best blend of minimalism, mechanized rhythms, and crafted, catchy melodies in the group's catalog". Q, in a 1995 review, wrote that the album [...] "changed the face of American dance music" [...] {{and that it was}} one of the most compelling beats of this or any other era". In 2009, Drowned in Sounds Chris Power stated that [...] "Trans-Europe Express is all at once antique, timeless, retro and contemporary. Its status as modern electronic music's birth certificate is well-earned, but its hallowed reputation should never be allowed to disguise its true value and power as a work of art. Nor should it obscure a longevity that, 32 years on, we might as well <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> by its real name: immortality".|$|E
500|$|... "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] was {{animated}} in a {{very complicated}} manner. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director MacMullan stated {{that a couple of}} sequences in the episode were [...] "reaching too far" [...] for the animation process to be [...] "reassembled correctly". One example, she mentioned, is the scene in which Marge remembers Ziff's assault from [...] "The Way We Was". Ziff's assault is shown as hands reaching for Marge, and was put together by MacMullan in post-production. Right after Marge's sisters Patty and Selma send an e-mail to Ziff, the e-mail's path is elaborately shown through a [...] "trip through the computer wires". MacMullan stated that, even though she found the scene [...] "illogical", she maintained that it was [...] "done with great effort". Because the characters at Ziff's prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe, the animators {{had to come up with}} new designs for the character's clothes. Several of the designs were pitched and drawn by Ron Hauge, a former Simpsons writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on the series for many years. The dance that Ziff performs at the prom was pitched by MacMullan, and the prom locale was drawn using a photo reference. A scene in the episode shows Homer and Lenny signing on to become oil workers. The manager who hands them a paper clip can be seen smoking, and originally, MacMullan suggested that the manager [...] "puts his lit cigarette out in the [...] can , and blows his other arm off." [...] She pitched the idea to Jean, who responded by writing [...] "I wouldn't." [...] The episode's complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led the Simpsons animators to <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> MacMullan [...] "Lauren MacMultiplane".|$|E

2500|$|After {{publication}} of a June 2010 Rolling Stone article containing controversial quotes from McCrystal and his staff, which mocked their civilian Obama administration colleagues, Yon wrote; [...] "Unless McChrystal basically denies the article, he must be fired.

2500|$|Cochems {{reportedly}} did not <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> pass {{plays in}} the Carroll game until after he had grown frustrated with the failure of his offense to move {{the ball on the}} ground. [...] After an initial pass attempt from Robinson to Schneider fell incomplete (resulting in a turnover to Carroll under the 1906 rules), Cochems called for his team to again execute the play he called the [...] "air attack" [...] or the [...] "projectile pass." [...] Robinson threw the fat, rugby-style ball for a 20-yard touchdown pass to Schneider. St. Louis won the game by a score of 22–0.|$|E
2500|$|Nafisi {{responded to}} Dabashi's {{criticism}} {{by stating that}} she is not, as Dabashi claims, a neoconservative, that she opposed the Iraq war, and that she {{is more interested in}} literature than in politics. In an interview, Nafisi stated that she's never argued for an attack on Iran and that democracy, when it comes, should come from the Iranian people (and not from US military or political intervention). She added that while she is willing to engage in [...] "serious argument...Debate that is polarized isn't worth my time." [...] She stated that she did not respond directly to Dabashi because [...] "You don't want to debase yourself and <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> names." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bilancia {{was born}} in Potenza, Basilicata, in 1951. When he was about five years old, {{his family moved to}} {{northern}} Italy, first to Piedmont and then to Genoa in the Liguria region. [...] He was a chronic bedwetter until age 10 or 12, and his mother shamed him by placing his wet mattress on the balcony where it could be seen by the neighbors. [...] When undressing him for bed, his aunt would shame him by pulling down his underwear in front of his cousins to show his underdeveloped penis. [...] At age 14, he decided to <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> himself Walter. [...] He {{dropped out of high school}} and worked at jobs such as mechanic, bartender, baker and delivery boy.|$|E
2500|$|... 1999 saw two {{big changes}} coming for Silja. Tax-free sales ended on routes between EU countries, which forced the Helsinki–Stockholm ships to <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> at Mariehamn in the Åland Islands. Although the Åland Islands joined the EU {{along with the}} rest of Finland in 1994, their {{autonomous}} status allowed them to stay outside the EU tax union and hence avoid the end of tax-fee sales. Bigger change than this was Sea Containers purchasing the majority of Neptun Maritime's shares. In 2000 the new owners brought one of their Super SeaCats on Helsinki–Tallinn traffic and Neptun Maritime again changed its name, this time to Silja Oyj Abp. In the same year the route between Vaasa and Umeå was terminated as unprofitable.|$|E
2500|$|The show, {{scheduled}} in a graveyard slot on Tuesday nights at 8:00p.m., {{was not expected}} to challenge the ratings giants Milton Berle and Frank Sinatra, but did surprisingly well. Berle, known to many early television viewers as [...] "Uncle Miltie" [...] and for using ancient vaudeville material, joked about Sheen, [...] "He uses old material, too", and observed that [...] "f I'm going to be eased off the top by anyone, it's better that I lose to the One for whom Bishop Sheen is speaking." [...] Sheen responded in jest that maybe people should <b>start</b> <b>calling</b> him [...] "Uncle Fultie". Life and Time magazine ran feature stories on Bishop Sheen. The number of stations carrying Life Is Worth Living jumped from three to fifteen {{in less than two}} months. There was fan mail that flowed in at a rate of 8,500 letters per week. There were four times as many requests for tickets as could be fulfilled. Admiral, the sponsor, paid the production costs in return for a one-minute commercial {{at the opening of the}} show and another minute at the close. In 1952 Sheen won an Emmy Award for his efforts, accepting the acknowledgment by saying, [...] "I feel it is time I pay tribute to my four writers—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John." [...] When Sheen won the Emmy, Berle quipped, [...] "We both work for 'Sky Chief'", a reference to Berle's sponsor Texaco. Time called him [...] "the first 'televangelist'", and the Archdiocese of New York could not meet the demand for tickets.|$|E

6000|$|There {{is another}} curious French case of {{insanity}} in twins, which {{was pointed out}} to me by Sir James Paget, described by Dr. Baume in the Annales M. édico-Psychologiques, 4 série, vol. i., 1863, p. 312, of which the following is an abstract. The original contains a few more details, but is too long to quote: Francois and Martin, fifty years of age, worked as railroad contractors between Quimper and Châteaulin. Martin had twice slight attacks of insanity. On January 15 a box was robbed in which the twins had deposited their savings. On the night of January 23-24 both François (who lodged at Quimper) and Martin (who lived with his wife and children at St. Lorette, two leagues from Quimper) had the same dream at the same hour, three a.m., and both awoke with a violent <b>start,</b> <b>calling</b> out, [...] "I have caught the thief! I have caught the thief! they are doing mischief to my brother!" [...] They were both of them extremely agitated, and gave way to similar extravagances, dancing and leaping.|$|E
