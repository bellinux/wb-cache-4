5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{evolution}} of primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields {{which may have been}} amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} bat's {{discovery}} in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed {{as a result}} of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs. However, these pressures may not have had a <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the reasons to why railway projects conducted by Banverket (Swedish National Rail Administration) {{could be expected}} to cause <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment, <b>on</b> which grounds <b>the</b> County Administrative Board and Swedish National Rail Administration base their decisions/assumptions and highlight regional differences between the different Swedish national rail administrations regions. Total 24 railway projects, conducted or being conducted, during the time period 2001 - January 2010 have been analyzed and studied. These projects represent eight different measures/activities which are dispersed throughout all five of the Swedish National Rail Administration´s different regions. Swedish legislations demands that the planner of a new railway project shall first conduct a pre-study and then conduct a public consultation which provides the participants an opportunity to provide input. The County Administrative Board shall then decide if the project could cause <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment. The amount of published material is scarce regarding why railway projects cause <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment. The study concludes that those railway projects conducted during 2001 - Jan 2010 and which are localized within or near residential areas constitute laying down a new track i. e. from single track to double track and imply major encroachments on existing station- and railway yards, culture- and nature environments will get the decision to cause <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment. Projects that are not localized within or near residential areas, and only imply minor measures/activities which do not include <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> above described environments will not cause <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment. Other conclusions obtained from the study are that the motivations for the decision making among the different County Administrative Boards are homogeneous. Suggested improvements for the Swedish National Rail Administration regarding their planning and EIA-process is that an increased studying of earlier preformed projects could help to predict the County Administrative Boards decision if a project could cause <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment or not...|$|R
5|$|The opera was {{frequently}} revised, most particularly in 1717 and in 1731; modern performances are usually a conflation of the versions available. Up {{to and including}} 1717, these changes had no <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plot. In the 1731 version, however, in Act 2 Armida imitates Almirena's voice rather than assuming her appearance, and Argante declares his love to Almirena's portrait rather than to her face. In Act 3 the marches and the battle scene are cut; Armida and Argante remain unrepentant and vanish in a chariot drawn by dragons before the conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Just as they {{finished}} their report, the detachment was fired on by Ustaše Militia. The Ustaše called {{for help from}} Sinj, and by 18:00, Italian reinforcements had arrived and began encircling the detachment, engaging them with mortars and light artillery. Outnumbered and facing an enemy with greater firepower, the Partisans planned to hold their positions until evening then retreat using the cover of darkness. About 20:00, Kovačević-Lala, {{one of the most}} experienced members of the detachment, was killed after being hit by a mortar round, which had a <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> morale of the remaining fighters.

Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Trimmer, Jane Taylor, and Ellenor Fenn, {{to name a}} few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because of Lessons and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. Lessons itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male Romantic writers, Barbauld's Lessons has rarely been studied by scholars. In fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Task of {{developing}} a constitution for the nation was undertaken by the Constituent Assembly of India, composing of elected representatives. The Constituent Assembly first met on December 9, 1946 under the presidency of Dr. Sachidanand later Dr. Rajendra Prasad was made its President. While members of Congress composed of a large majority, Congress leaders appointed persons from diverse political backgrounds to responsibilities {{of developing}} the constitution and national laws. Notably, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar became the chairperson of the drafting committee, while Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel became chairpersons of committees and sub-committees responsible for different subjects. A notable development during that period having <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indian constitution took place on 10 December 1948 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and called upon all member states to adopt these rights in their respective constitutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} in the Adriatic has been credited with having a <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wider war through the disruption of French forces in the Balkans. It {{has been suggested that}} Napoleon intended to invade the Ottoman Empire following the War of the Fifth Coalition, but was dissuaded in part due to the difficulty of supplying a force in the region without control of the Adriatic, his attention eventually turning to Russia. The campaign also had effects on the morale and effectiveness of the French fleet, which lost some of its best commanders and frigates in the campaign, and on the Austrian advance on Italy in 1813, when French defence lines were repeatedly out-flanked by British attacks from the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{summit and}} {{surrounding}} areas of Nethermost Pike contain many species and communities which are of biological interest. North {{east of the}} summit is Nethermost Cove which contains some of England's best arctic-alpine and tall-herb vegetation, including {{one third of the}} English population of Downy Willow (Salix lapponum). Similarly Ruthwaite Cove contains Arctic-alpine and tall-herb communities, and it is believed that the cove may contain very rare species of plants in very small, and therefore precarious, populations. The lower eastern slopes form Grisedale Common, a large expanse of dwarf shrub heath. The lower slopes are grazed by sheep, which has a <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> type of vegetation which grows. Certain areas, such as Eagle Crag, are inaccessible to sheep due to their steep slopes.|$|E

5|$|On 25 September, Allemand {{achieved}} a major success when his squadron, {{while waiting for}} a convoy from the Leeward Islands, encountered a seven-ship convoy from the island of Saint Helena. The convoy's commander, Captain Daniel Woodriff in the fourth rate , sought to interpose his ship between the French squadron and his convoy and was captured after a fierce battle. All except one of convoy escaped, and by deliberately drawing the French away from his own convoy's direction, he had saved the Leewards Islands convoy from attack as well. After the battle, Allemand was forced to conduct repairs at Tenerife, sailing again on 17 October, {{four days before the}} French Mediterranean Fleet was destroyed at the Battle of Trafalgar. With the planned invasion impossible, Allemand began commerce raiding in the Eastern Atlantic, capturing 43 merchant ships during his cruise and successfully disrupting the British blockade of Cadiz. This had an unintended but <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic campaign of 1806, resulting eventually in the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806. Allemand returned to Rochefort on 23 December, having not lost a single ship during the expedition.|$|E
5|$|On Hitler's orders, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) (the {{intelligence}} {{branch of}} the SS), who had commanded the operation to rescue Mussolini in September 1943, was independently involved in intelligence gathering in the lead-up to the raid. Skorzeny acted {{on behalf of the}} SD, and after obtaining information from a Partisan deserter that pinpointed Tito's headquarters at the cave, he proposed a plan to infiltrate Drvar {{with a small group of}} soldiers to assassinate Tito. Skorzeny soon discovered that the plan to eliminate Tito had been compromised, and had nothing further to do with the operation. It appears that he did not pass on the useful intelligence he had gathered to SS-Hauptsturmführer Kurt Rybka, the commander of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, who was responsible for planning the critical airborne aspects of the operation. Largely due to interservice rivalry and competition, the three organisations did not share the intelligence they gathered, which had a <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tactical planning and execution of the operation.|$|E

5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to have a <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded introductions were to Barbados and Martinique. The Barbados introductions {{were focused}} on the biological control of pests damaging the sugarcane crops, and while the toads became abundant, they have done even less to control the pests than in Australia. The toad was introduced to Martinique from French Guiana before 1944 and became established. Today, they reduce the mosquito and mole cricket populations. A third introduction to the region occurred in 1884, when toads appeared in Jamaica, reportedly imported from Barbados to help control the rodent population. While they had no <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rats, they nevertheless became well established. Other introductions include the release on Antiguapossibly before 1916, although this initial population may have died out by 1934 and been reintroduced {{at a later date}} and Montserrat, which had an introduction before 1879 that led to the establishment of a solid population, which was apparently sufficient to survive the Soufrière Hills volcano eruption in 1995.|$|E
