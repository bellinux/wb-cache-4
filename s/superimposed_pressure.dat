40|$|Time {{dependent}} simulations {{are used}} to characterize the unsteady impeller blade loading due to imipeller-diffuser interaction in centrifugal compressor stages. The capability of simulations are assessed by comparing results against unsteady pressure and velocity measurements in the vaneless space. Simulations are shown to be adequate for identifying the trends of unsteady impeller blade loading with operating and design parameters. However they are not sufficient for predicting the absolute magnitude of loading unsteadiness. Errors of up to 14 % exist between absolute values of flow quantities. Evidence suggests that the k - e turbulence model used is inappropriate for centrifugal compressor flow and is the significant source of these errors. The unsteady pressure profile on the blade surface is characterized as the sum of two <b>superimposing</b> <b>pressure</b> components. The first component varies monotonically along the blade chord. The second component {{can be interpreted as}} an acoustic wave propagating upstream. Both components fluctuate at the diffuser vane passing frequency, but at a different phase angle. The unsteady loading is the sum of the fluctuation amplitude of each component minus a value that {{is a function of the}} phase relationship between the pressure component fluctuations. Simulation results for different compressor designs are compared. Differences observed are primarily attributed to the amplitude of pressure fluctuation on the pressure side of the blade and the wavelength of the pressure disturbance propagating upstream. Lower pressure side pressure fluctuations are associated with a weaker pressure non-uniformity at the diffuser inlet as a result of a lower incidence angle into the diffuser. The wavelength of the pressure disturbance propagating upstream sets the domain on the blade surface in which the phase relationship between pressure component fluctuations is favorable. A longer wavelength increases the domain over which this phase relationship is such that the amplitude of unsteadiness is reduced. by Christopher Lusardi. Thesis (S. M.)

An example model is built to simulate a patient under mechanical ventilation with accurate volumes and compliances, while connected directly to a ventilator. Methods The lung is modelled with multiple units, represented by rubber bellows, with adjustable weights placed on bellows to simulate compartments of different <b>superimposed</b> <b>pressure</b> and compliance, as well as different levels of lung disease, such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The model was directly connected to a ventilator and the resulting pressure volume curves recorded. Results The model effectively captures the fundamental lung dynamics {{for a variety of}} conditions, and showed the effects of different ventilator settings. It was particularly effective at showing the impact of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) therapy on lung recruitment to improve oxygenation, a particulary difficult dynamic to capture. Conclusion Application of PEEP therapy is difficult to teach and demonstrate clearly. Therefore, the model provide opportunity to train, teach, and aid further understanding of lung mechanics and the treatment of lung diseases in critical care, such as ARDS and asthma.

30|$|Patients {{at risk of}} {{developing}} ARDS often have a decrease in chest wall compliance secondary to fluid overload and/or increased intra-abdominal pressure. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} PEEP could be set too low unless the transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) is known. Clinically, esophageal pressure (Pes) is used as a surrogate for pleural pressure (Ppl) and used to calculate Ptp. It has shown that PEEP set to maintain Ptp above 0  cmH 2 O had positive impact in both animal [99, 100] and human [101, 102] studies. Personalizing PEEP using Ptp is a physiologically sound concept since Ptp is the force that distends the lung. However, Pes is not the perfect surrogate of Ppl and thus the calculated Ptp might not be accurate. In a recent study, Huang et al. compared open-lung PEEP guided by CT to Ptp guided PEEP (i.e., PEEP set to always keep end Ptp above 0  cmH 2 O) in a porcine saline lavage lung injury model [103]. They found that Ptp-guided PEEP was unable to maintain recruited lung open with a hypothesized mechanism for this failure being an increase in the <b>superimposed</b> <b>pressure</b> between the esophageal plane and dorsal lung level. However, using Ptp to guide PEEP is a physiologically sound technique and, there is a multicenter randomized clinical trial using Ptp-guided ventilation that should help determine the efficacy of this ventilation strategy [104].|$|E
40|$|Abstract In a {{model of}} acute lung injury, we showed that {{positive}} end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (VT) are interactive variables that {{determine the extent of}} lung recruitment, that recruitment occurs across the entire range of total lung capacity, and that <b>superimposed</b> <b>pressure</b> is a key determinant of lung collapse. Aiming to verify if the same rules apply in a clinical setting, we randomly ventilated five ALI/ARDS patients with 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, and 45 cm H 2 O plateau pressure and 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm H 2 O of PEEP. For each PEEP-VT condition, we obtained computed tomography at end inspiration and end expiration. We found that recruitment occurred along the entire volume-pressure curve, independent of lower and upper inflection points, and that estimated threshold opening pressures were normally distributed (mode = 20 cm H 2 O). Recruitment occurred progressively from nondependent to dependent lung regions. Overstretching was not associated with hyperinflation. Derecruitment did not parallel deflation, and estimated threshold closing pressures were normally distributed (mode = 5 cm H 2 O). End-inspiratory and end-expiratory collapse were correlated, suggesting a plateau-PEEP interaction. When superimposed gravitational pressure exceeded PEEP, end-expiratory collapse increased. We concluded that the rules governing recruitment and derecruitment equally apply in an oleic acid model and in human ALI/ARD...|$|E

40|$|Sandy beaches are {{impacted}} by multiple threats, leaving them vulnerable to <b>superimposed</b> <b>pressures</b> from global change. While {{the extent of}} beaches along coasts is vast, management resources are finite, which necessitates prioritisation of beaches for management action. Our aim was to modify an existing, globally applied cumulative-impacts mapping framework to make it applicable specifically to sandy beach ecosystems at fine spatial scales. We conducted an online survey prior to the VIth International Sandy Beaches Symposium 2012, allowing beach experts to score habitat-threat interactions with regards to: extent, frequency and functional impact of disturbances, resistance of the ecosystem to these disturbances, and the time taken for complete recovery following the disturbances. We also investigated the relative weighting of these 5 categories in the final threat score, as well as interactions among stressors. There were 65 complete responses from sandy beach experts worldwide. The average range in scores was 9. 7 {{out of a possible}} maximum range of 10 (i. e., at least one expert rated each threat-habitat interaction to be 0 or 1, and another scored the same phenomenon, 9 or 10), and extent and frequency were the only criteria experts were confident to score. There were no consistent significant biases in the scores associated with the experts' stated experience and expertise, or geographic factors. We concluded that the large range in perceived threat intensities among experts, and potential misunderstanding of the tasks were the most likely explanations for the extreme variability in the scores. Since the response rate in the section on interactions among stressors was so low, we concluded that this was most likely because there is insufficient published information available for experts to evaluate threat interactions with any level of confidence. This was also confirmed by comments provided by experts in this section. In short, the methodology for assessing cumulative threats to beaches needs to be revised. The first aim of this workshop is thus to score the functional impact and recovery time of a base case scenario for each threat, which is represented by a realistic maximum intensity of the threat acting on a pristine beach. The second aim is to identify knowledge gaps and research priorities for threats to beaches. While the results from the online threats survey were too variable to be meaningful for their intended purpose, they have benchmarked our understanding of threats to beaches, and will be useful in guiding future research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} aluminium {{wrought alloys}} {{as well as}} powder metallurgical aluminium alloys are limited regarding massive formability. The formability at room temperature can be significantly affected by <b>superimposing</b> hydrostatic <b>pressure.</b> Depending on the process control, cold forming enables locally induced strain hardening effects, whereby increased hardness or hardness gradients can be regulated. Simultaneously, the necessity of mechanical post processing is reduced by a metal forming fabrication of joint and connection elements at room temperature. By splitting the component in strengthened and not strengthened regions, specially adapted property profiles can be adjusted to the application. Thus, specially load adapted components with locally optimised property profiles e. g. ductile or high strength, brittle areas can be manufactured. A defined buckling or folding of a component {{in case of a}} crash can thereby be achieved. In this project innovative tool principles for superimposed cold solid forming will be developed.

Excised syringes were driven with a frequency-swept acoustic pressure wave through the trachea, and the resulting vibrations measured using a laser interferometer. The frequency-dependent mem-brane compliance was measured at 10 – 20 different positions, giving a detailed picture of the linear vibra-tional modes of the two membrane components, the medial labium and the medial tympaniform mem-brane. Nonlinear properties of the membrane were determined by measuring the linear response at several <b>superimposed</b> static <b>pressures.</b> The membrane compli-ance {{is dominated by the}} lowest vibrational mode, a narrow mechanical resonance, at roughly 700 Hz in the zebra finch, that extends over the entire membrane. Several higher-frequency modes were also observed. The frequency of the lowest vibrational mode is de-termined largely by the mass of the heavier medial la-bium, rather than the thinner medial tympaniform membrane, suggesting that the medial labium is critical in determining the oscillatory frequency of the syrinx. The difference in mass of the medial labium and medial tympaniform membrane may serve to produce a wave-like motion of the membranes during flow-driven oscillations, thus increasing the efficiency of sound production.

Depending on the choice of experimental parameters (impact speed and <b>superimposed</b> quasi-static <b>pressure),</b> we observe sub-Rayleigh, intersonic and even supersonically propagating pulses. Unlike classical shear cracks in coherent interfaces of finite strength, sliding areas in frictional interfaces seems to grow without noticeable acceleration phases and at various discreet speeds. A relatively broad head wave that emanates from the interface and is caused from the interaction of the impact wave with the preexisting static stress field was observed. There was a cusp in the stress contours at the interface, indicating that the propagation speed was slightly faster along the interface than in the bulk. The propagation speed of the rupture tip was greater than 2 times the shear wave speed. Supersonic trailing pulses were also observed. Mach lines with different inclination and emanating from the rupture zone tips were discovered. In addition, behind the rupture point there were different structures which traveled at the Rayleigh wave speed. In one of them the fringes passed continuously from the upper plate to the lower plate which indicates that a relatively wide contact region was formed. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study dynamic sliding at high strain rates along incoherent (frictional) interfaces between two identical plates. The plates were held together by a uniform compressive stress, while dynamic sliding was initiated by an impact-induced shear loading. The case of freely-standing plates with no external pressure was also investigated. The dynamic stress fields that developed during the events were recorded in a microsecond time scale by high-speed photography in conjunction with classical dynamic photoelasticity. Depending on the choice of experimental parameters (impact speed and <b>superimposed</b> static <b>pressure),</b> pulse-like and crack-like sliding modes were observed. Visual evidence of sub-Rayleigh, intersonic and even supersonically propagating pulses were discovered and recorded. Unlike classical shear cracks in coherent interfaces of finite strength, sliding areas in frictional interfaces seem to grow at various discrete speeds without noticeable acceleration phases. A relatively broad loading wave caused by the interference between the impact wave and the preexisting static stress field was observed emanating from the interface. There was a cusp in the stress contours at the interface, indicating that the propagation speed was slightly faster along the interface than in the bulk. The observed propagation speeds of the sliding tips were dependent on the projectile speed. They spanned almost the whole interval from sub-Rayleigh speeds to nearly the sonic speed of the material, {{with the exception of}} a forbidden gap between the Rayleigh wave speed and the shear wave speed. Supersonic trailing pulses generating Mach lines of different inclination angles, emanating from the sliding zone tips, were discovered. In addition, behind the sliding tip, wrinkle-like opening pulses were observed for a wide range of impact speeds and confining stresses. They always traveled at speeds between the Rayleigh wave speed and the shear wave speed of the material. ...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS Hovercraft lift {{fans are}} {{subjected}} to varying back pressure due to wave action and craft motions when these vehicles are operating in a seaway. The oscillatory back pressure causes the fans to perform dynamically, exhibiting a hysteresis type of response and a corresponding degrada-tion in mean performance. Since hovercraft motions are influenced by variations in lift fan pressure and discharge, {{it is important to}} un-derstand completely the nature of the dynamic performance of lift fans in order to completely solve the hovercraft seakeeping problem. The present study was performed to determine and classify the insta-bilities encountered in a centrifugal fan operating against time-varying back pressure. A model-scale experiment was developed in which the fan discharge was directed into a flow-measuring device, terminating in a rotating valve which produced an oscillatory back <b>pressure</b> <b>superimposed</b> upon a mean aerodynamic resistance. Pressure and local velocity were measured as functions of time at several locations in the fan volute. The measurements permitted the identification of rotating (or propagating) stall in the impeller. One cell and two cell configurations were classified and the transient condition con-necting these two configurations was observed. The mechanisms which lead to rotating stall in a centrifugal compressor are presented and discussed with specific reference to hovercraft applications...|$|R
40|$|The failure {{strengths}} of anisotropic bodies and {{especially those of}} fiber reinforced materials are generally studied at the principal directions of their strength and loading of the bodies. For the most reliable criteria, based on failure functions having {{the form of a}} general tensorial polynomial, the modes of failure of anisotropic (orthotropic, transversely isotropic) bodies were studied primarily on the principal stress (sigma- 1, sigma- 2, sigma- 3) -subspace. The elliptic paraboloid failure surface, (EPFS), being one of them, was based on the phenomenological assumption that even the anisotropic media do not fail under the influence of any hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>superimposed</b> with an elementary loading, taking care of the anisotropy. Modes of failure of orthotropic media under the influence of shear loading, which are very important especially for the transfer of loading between fibers and matrix in a single lamina, {{as well as in the}} theory of failure of laminates, was up-to-now neglected. In this paper the effect of shear is studied for transversely isotropic and orthotropic materials. The dependence of the pure shear loading on the sign of shear, as well as on the parameters of anisotropy of the medium, is established. Interesting results are revealed, having a direct application on a well-founded theory of strength of laminates...|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} Adriatic Sea (NA) {{is affected}} by strong anthropogenic <b>pressure,</b> <b>superimposed</b> to a large river runoff. The consequent pressure exerted on the NA ecosystem either triggers or worsens negative phenomena like anoxic/hypoxic events. During the summer-autumn period, the NA is often exposed to these events, which can be categorised as either coastal (relatively frequent south of the Po River delta during the summer) and offshore (rare, affecting wider areas). An operational system for monitoring and forecasting anoxic/hypoxic events {{has been set up}} in the framework of the EU LIFE “EMMA” project. The system is composed of a meteo-oceanographic buoy; a numerical prediction system based on the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS), including a Fashamtype module for biogeochemical fluxes; and oceanographic surveys. Every day since June 2007, the system provides 3 -hourly forecasts of marine currents, thermohaline and biogeochemical fields for the incoming three days. The system demonstrated its ability to produce accurate temperature forecasts and relatively good salinity and dissolved oxygen forecasts. The Root Mean Square Error of the dissolved oxygen forecast was largely due to the mean bias. The system is currently being improved to include a better representation of benthic layer biogeochemical processes and several adjustments of the model. While developing model improvements, dissolved oxygen forecasts were improved with the removal of the 10 -day mean bias...|$|R
40|$|Both {{experiments}} and numerical simulations have provided evidence that an initially fully developed two-dimensional boundary layer, {{subjected to a}} sudden spanwise forcing, exhibits a decrease of turbulent quantities such as the Reynolds shear stress, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent friction drag. In past {{experiments and}} investigations, such forcing has traditionally been {{in the form of}} spanwise wall oscillations, spanwise travelling Lorentz forcing, <b>superimposed</b> spanwise <b>pressure</b> gradients and spanwise travelling waves of an inplane flexible wall. The aim of this work is to take the idea a step further and develop an active surface which locally executes the motions described above making such a system more readily deployable. Two surfaces were developed: both executing in-plane local oscillations with amplitude close to or larger than the mean streak spacing in a turbulent flow, but based on two different technologies, electroactive polymers in the dielectric form of actuation and electromagnetic motor forcing. The effect of these two surfaces was confined to wall-normal heights on the order of the linear sublayer of the turbulent boundary layer, and frequency and wavelength similar to those reported in literature. Extensive hot-wire measurements, some PIV measurements and direct measurement of friction drag using a bespoke drag balance are presented for the systematic variation of the relevant parameters for turbulent friction drag reduction. Electroactive polymers (EAP) are able to undergo relatively large deflections at high frequencies. Developments in the field of EAP such as static and dynamic characterisation of the EAP membranes in use in this work, development of robust electrodes and their characterisation, in-house manufacturing of thin silicone membranes and post-processing of pre-built silicone membranes are presented. Numerical studies of the optimum pre-strain values and of the optimum electrode to passive portions width ratios are presented. Actuator development techniques including EAP membrane pre-stretch in a bespoke jig, EAP membrane pre-conditioning to go past the Mullins' effect, electrode preparation procedure and deposition, and frame preparation are presented. Actuator characterisation results including analysis of multi-flash photographs and laser profilometer scans for in-plane and out-plane deflections at different frequencies are also presented.
