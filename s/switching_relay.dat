40|$|Electronic and {{electrical}} appliances used in most {{homes in the}} country are designed to operate at a nominal 230 V AC, which ought to be acceptable within certain tolerable upper and lower limits. Excessive fluctuations beyond these limits may cause the appliance to malfunction or get irreparably damaged. Most protective devices are imported as well as expensive. The circuit presented is a relatively cheap automatic mains voltage switch (AVS) protector that senses undesirable and harmful fluctuations in mains voltages and disconnects the appliance whenever the mains voltage supply goes above or below pre-settable and safe tolerable limits or ‘window’. The appliance is automatically reconnected when mains power returns to normal within that ‘window’. The design features anti-surge protection, a transformerless power supply for the circuitry, a window comparator for the detection of low and excessively high mains voltages to the load and a <b>switching</b> <b>relay</b> capable of switching high currents, ideal for compressor-based appliances. A delay section for control of spurious low voltage drops as well as mains stability is incorporated. The design provides a safe operating voltage range of 180 V to 250 V and offers practically the same functions as those of the imported brands. Basically, the design consists of various circuit building blocks and circuit techniques that would be of interest to the electronic hobbyist...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. The {{intention}} of this dissertation is to determine, on the Eskom system, if the pre-insertion closing resistors {{installed on the}} Alpha-Beta 765 kV line breakers are preventing overvoltages from being caused during auto-reclosing. Other possible solutions of reclosing protection are investigated. It has been shown on two occasions, from actual field data that overvoltages have occurred on the lines after reclosing. High overvoltages on this network could {{be the cause of}} the many reactor failures that have occurred. A mathematical model of the Alpha-Beta 765 kV system was produced on Matlab/Simulink to simulate the resonance of the line during opening and then the effect on the voltage when reclosing takes place. The effects of installing pre-insertion resistors to reduce overvoltages on reclosing were analysed, as well as looking at controlled reclosing at the optimal voltage across the line breakers. It was shown from the studies, that pre-insertion resistors do limit the overvoltages to within the surge capabilities of the line (10 % overvoltage) and that the cause of the previous overvoltages were actually due to insertion resistor operations failure. It was also shown that the method of controlled closing at optimal voltage across the breakers is also a successful method of preventing overvoltages. This dissertation also evaluates a design specification for a <b>switching</b> <b>relay</b> for controlled re-closing of the line...|$|E
40|$|The design {{model of}} a 4. 50 Kilowatt, 3 -phase, 50 hertz solar-based power {{generating}} station was examined by the paper. The power station is a dual source input generating station using 8 series connected 100 A, 12 V batteries per phase as backup, the solar panels being the main frame. An inverter of 12 Volt direct current input voltage was incorporated to supply an output of 3 -phase, 220 Volts and 50 hertz alternating current. A charging circuit was installed to monitor charging level and to preserve the accumulator’s life span. The paper also looked into the solar-based power station component design model. The batteries therein are back-up and the system will ensure 24 -hours reliable power supply. The setup has a normally closed <b>switching</b> <b>relay</b> ready to pickup the auxiliary battery supply within a few milliseconds after the solar source voltage drops below a stipulated level.

30|$|The {{lifetime}} {{of the network}} is an important performance indicator in energy-constrained wireless networks, such as WSNs, since sensors are usually equipped with limited energy supplies. Harvesting energy from the environment is a promising approach to prolong the {{lifetime of}} the energy-constrained wireless networks. The basic idea of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) was first proposed in [15, 16], and a general receiver architecture was then developed in [17]. Then, the SWIPT was extended to various communication scenarios such as the cellular system [18], the broadcasting system [19, 20] with a single energy receiver and a single information receiver when they are separately located or co-located, the cooperative relay system [21 - 25], the two-way relaying system [26], and the interference channel [27 - 29]. For broadcasting system, [19] investigated the R-E trade-off for a transmitter transferring energy and information to two separated/co-located information-decoding and energy harvesting receivers. And [20] optimized the beamforming designs of general broadcasting system where there are multiple separated/co-located information-decoding and energy harvesting receivers. For a DF cooperative network, [21] derives the outage probability of time <b>switching</b> <b>relay</b> receiver. In [22], the authors studied the outage probability and network capacity of end-to-end one-way relay system with a battery-free relay. For multiple source-destination pairs communication system aided by a relay, [23] studied the relays’ strategies to distribute the harvested energy among the multiple users {{and their impact on}} the system performance. For multiple-input multiple-output relay channels, [24] proposed a low complexity dynamic antenna switching between information decoding and energy harvesting based on the principles of the generalized selection combiner. In [25], the authors studied the relay selection problem in AF relay network with QoS and harvested energy constraints. In [26], the trade-off end-to-end outage probability and power splitting coefficient are studied in a two-way AF relay system where two source nodes exchange data via an energy harvesting relay. In [28] and [29], the authors investigated joint wireless information and energy transfer in the two-user/multiple-user MIMO interference channel, in which each receiver either information decoding or energy harvesting.|$|E
40|$|The {{thalamus}} is {{the major}} gate to the cortex for almost all sensory signals, for input from various subcortical sources such as the cerebellum and the mammillary bodies, and for reentrant cortical information. Thalamic nuclei do not merely relay information to the cortex but perform some operation on it while being modulated by various transmitter systems and in continuous interplay with their cortical target areas. Indeed, cortical feedback to the thalamus is the anatomically dominant input to relay cells even in those thalamic nuclei that are directly driven by sensory systems. While it is well-established that the receptive fields of cortical neurons are strongly influenced by convergent thalamic inputs of different types, the modulation effected by cortical feedback in thalamic response {{has been difficult to}} interpret. Experiments and theoretical considerations have pointed to a variety of operations of the visual cortex on the visual thalamus, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), such as control of binocular disparity for stereopsis (Schmielau & Singer, 1977), attention-related gating of relay cells (Sherman & Koch, 1986), gain control of relay cells (Koch, 1987), synchronizing firing of neighboring relay cells (Sillito et al., 1994; Singer 1994), increasing visual information in relay cells' output (McClurkin et al., 1994), and <b>switching</b> <b>relay</b> cells from a detection to an analyzing mode (Godwin et al., 1996; Sherman, 1996; Sherman & Guillery, 1996). Nonetheless, the evidence for any particular function is still sparse and rather indirect to date. Clearly, detailed concepts of the interdependency of thalamic and cortical operation could greatly advance our knowledge about complex sensory, and ultimately cognitive, processing. Here we present a novel view on the corticothalamic puzzle by proposing that control of velocity tuning of visual cortical neurons may be an eminent function of corticogeniculate processing. The hypothesis is advanced by studying a model of the primary visual pathway in extensive computer simulations. At the heart of the model is a biophysical account of the electrical membrane properties of thalamic relay neurons (Huguenard & McCormick, 1992; McCormick & Huguenard, 1992) that includes 12 ionic conductances. Among the different effects that corticogeniculate feedback may have on relay cells, we focus on the modulation of their relay mode (between tonic and burst mode) by control of their resting membrane potential. Employing two distinct temporal-response types of geniculate relay neurons (lagged and nonlagged), we find that shifts in membrane potential affect the temporal response properties of relay cells in a way that alters the tuning of cortical cells for speed. Given the loop of information from the LGN to cortical layer 4, via a variable number of synapses to layer 6, and back to the LGN, the question arises, what are likely implications of adaptive speed tuning for visual information processing? Based on some fairly general considerations concerning the nature of motion information, we devise a simple model of the corticogeniculate loop that utilizes adaptive speed tuning for the fundamental task of segmentation of objects in motion. A detailed mathematical analysis of the model's behavior is presented. Treating visual stimulation as a stochastic process that drives the adaptation dynamics, we prove the model's object-segmentation capabilities and reveal some non-intended properties, such as oscillatory responses, that are consequences of its basic design. Several aspects of the dynamics in the loop are discussed in relation to experimental data...|$|E
