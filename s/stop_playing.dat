5|$|The episode {{has several}} {{references}} to Christmas films. The title is {{a play on}} Miracle on 34th Street while the scene where everyone rallies around to support the Simpsons {{is reminiscent of the}} last scene of the classic holiday movie It's a Wonderful Life. The film is further spoofed when Homer tells Lisa to <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> the piano which parodies a similar scene involving George Bailey.|$|E
5|$|James played wide {{receiver}} for St. Vincent-St. Mary's football team and was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame. As a sophomore, {{he was named}} first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals. He decided to <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> high school football before his senior year, after he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game. Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on whether he could have played in the National Football League.|$|E

5|$|Long-time {{assistant}} coach Brian Schmetzer {{was promoted to}} interim head coach. The same day, the club announced their signing of Uruguayan midfielder Nicolás Lodeiro on a designated player contract, {{as well as the}} return of former designated player Álvaro Fernández. Despite the sluggish start as well as the loss of midfielder Clint Dempsey, who was forced in August to <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> after evaluations for an irregular heartbeat, the Sounders turned their season around with 8 wins, 2 losses, and 4 draws. In the process, they came back from 9th to 4th in the Western Conference and qualified for the 2016 MLS Cup Playoffs. Schmetzer was named as permanent head coach as a result.|$|E
5|$|Following For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore had {{expressed}} a desire to <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, a requirement fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films had been negotiated on a film-by-film basis. The producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next actor to play Bond, which would be for Octopussy. However, when Kevin McClory announced his re-working of Thunderball as Never Say Never Again, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against McClory's choice of Bond, Sean Connery. Before For Your Eyes Only had been released, Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct Octopussy. George MacDonald Fraser wrote an initial treatment that was extensively revised by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Hardy {{is the son}} of Gilbert and Ruby Moore Hardy, and {{the younger}} brother of Matt Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1986, when Hardy was nine. He {{developed}} an interest in motocross aged 12 and got his first bike, a Yamaha YZ-80, at age 13. He had his first race when he was in ninth grade. Hardy played baseball as a child, but had to stop after he crashed during a motocross race, injuring his arm. He also played football during high school as a fullback and linebacker. He briefly competed in amateur wrestling in high school. He had to <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> football in high school, after he was ordered to pick between professional wrestling and football, and he chose wrestling. Hardy's favorite subjects in school were U.S. history and art, which he did for extra credit.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Boycott {{appeared}} only intermittently in the Test team. A back injury forced him to miss half of the 1967 season, and an average of 32.40 against the Australians during the 1968 Ashes was unspectacular. Domestically, his injury also limited his contribution; however, he did hit five centuries before {{he was forced to}} <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> in June 1968. Health problems with his spleen and trouble adjusting to wearing contact lenses meant that Boycott missed the tour of Pakistan in 1967–68, but he returned to the team by the summer of 1969, scoring 128 against the West Indies at Old Trafford, and another century at Lord's. However, he lost form {{in the rest of the}} season; he scored 12 and 0 in the third Test and averaged only 20.20, with two ducks, in the three Tests against New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|This tournament also {{transformed}} Söderling's {{career as}} he went from a top thirty player to a perennial top ten player, reaching a high of number 4 in the world.

25|$|When Siaki was three, {{his family}} moved to Hawaii, then California in the United States of America before {{settling}} in Wilmington, North Carolina. Siaki graduated from New Hanover High, received a football scholarship to play at East Carolina University, and majored in Physical Education.

25|$|As before, {{with one}} exception, {{the goal was}} to {{identify}} seven tunes in thirty seconds to win the grand prize. The champion stopped the clock by hitting a buzzer, which was a cue for the band to <b>stop</b> <b>playing,</b> and could either give an answer or pass if he/she was not sure. Once all seven tunes were played, the champion went back to play the passed tunes if there were any.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{appearing}} at the New Orleans Jazz Festival in 1969, Clayton underwent lip surgery, {{and had to}} give up playing the trumpet in 1972. He was able to resume playing in 1977 for a State Department sponsored tour of Africa, but had to permanently <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> in 1979, though he still worked as an arranger. He began to teach at Hunter College, CUNY from 1975–80 and again in the early eighties.|$|E
25|$|Often, Webb and Hitchcock use {{no music}} {{at all to}} undergird a romantic scene. The two-and-a-half minute kiss begins with distant music when it commences out on the balcony, but goes silent when the couple move inside. Other times, they flout {{conventional}} wisdom: when Alicia asks the band to <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> stuffy waltzes and liven things up with Brazilian music to cover her trip to the wine cellar with Devlin, Latin dance tunes replace the expected suspense cue.|$|E

25|$|An episode {{related to}} Brazil {{national}} football team almost made Zico {{give up on}} his career. He made his international debut in the South American Qualifier to the 1972 Summer Olympics playing 5 matches and scoring the qualifying goal against Argentina. Despite this fact, he wasn't called up to the Munich games. He felt extremely frustrated and told his father in dismay he wanted to <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> football. He even got absent from training at Flamengo for 10 days, being later convinced otherwise by his brothers.|$|E
25|$|In July 1969, Taylor headlined a six-night {{stand at}} the Troubadour in Los Angeles. On July 20, he {{performed}} at the Newport Folk Festival as the last act and was cheered by thousands of fans who stayed in the rain to hear him. Shortly thereafter, he broke both hands and both feet in a motorcycle accident on Martha's Vineyard {{and was forced to}} <b>stop</b> <b>playing</b> for several months. However, while recovering, he continued to write songs and in October 1969 signed a new deal with Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
25|$|Musicians {{were free}} to join in, but such collaborations were often {{short-lived}} if the contributions were lacking the proper spirit: notable jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy sat in with the group but was quickly asked to <b>stop</b> <b>playing.</b> Observers were welcome, provided they were silent and didn't disturb the proceedings. American saxophonist Ornette Coleman was asked to leave after he continually talked during one performance; Beatles member Paul McCartney once sat quietly through an early AMM session. When asked how he liked the music he said they went on too long.|$|E
