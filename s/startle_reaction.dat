40|$|In a pilot study, {{aspects of}} startling noises were investigated. For a typical {{synthetic}} broadband sound, i. e. uniform exciting noise, {{the influence of}} the following stimulus parameters on <b>startling</b> <b>reactions</b> were studied: (1) Magnitude of a level increase (5 [...] . 40 dB, 10 ms rise time) above a pedestal of 45 dB (2) Level increase of 30 dB for pedestals between 40 and 55 dB as well as 20 dB for pedestals between 50 an 65 dB (10 ms rise time). (3) Rise times between 1 and 300 ms for a level increase of 35 dB above a 50 dB pedestal. For the parameters considered in the pilot study, the magnitude of the level increase of a rising edge was found to be crucial for the <b>startling</b> <b>reaction.</b> Rise times between 1 and 10 ms lead to similar <b>startling</b> <b>reactions,</b> which were approximately halved for 200 ms rise time.

50|$|Older {{children}} and adults with atypical neurology (e.g., people with cerebral palsy) may retain these reflexes and primitive reflexes may reappear in adults. Reappearance {{may be attributed to}} certain neurological conditions including dementia (especially in a rare set of diseases called frontotemporal degenerations), traumatic lesions, and strokes. An individual with cerebral palsy and typical intelligence can learn to suppress these reflexes, but the reflex might resurface under certain conditions (i.e., during extreme <b>startle</b> <b>reaction).</b> Reflexes may also be limited to those areas affected by the atypical neurology, (i.e., individuals with cerebral palsy that only affects their legs retaining the Babinski reflex but having normal speech); for those individuals with hemiplegia, the reflex may be seen in the foot on the affected side only.|$|E
50|$|This is {{sometimes}} referred to as the <b>startle</b> <b>reaction,</b> startle response, startle reflex or embrace reflex. It is more commonly known as the Moro response or Moro reflex after its discoverer, pediatrician Ernst Moro. The Moro reflex is present at birth, peaks in the first month of life, and begins to disappear around 2 months of age. It is likely to occur if the infant's head suddenly shifts position, the temperature changes abruptly, or they are startled by a sudden noise. The legs and head extend while the arms jerk up and out with the palms up and thumbs flexed. Shortly afterward the arms are brought together and the hands clench into fists, and the infant cries loudly. The reflex normally disappears by three to four months of age, though it may last up to six months. Bilateral absence of the reflex may be linked to damage to the infant's central nervous system, while a unilateral absence could mean an injury due to birth trauma (e.g., a fractured clavicle or injury to the brachial plexus). Erb's palsy or some other form of paralysis is also sometimes present in such cases. In human evolutionary history, the Moro reflex may have helped infants cling to the mother while being carried around. If the infant lost its balance, the reflex caused the infant to embrace its mother and regain its hold on the mother's body.|$|E

40|$|Gene-environment {{interactions}} have {{an important}} role in the development of psychiatric disorders. To generate and validate a new substrain of rats with signs related to schizophrenia, we used selective breeding after postweaning social isolation and chronic ketamine treatment through several generations of animals and compared the subsequent strain to naive rats that were not genetically manipulated. We further investigated whether social isolation and ketamine treatment augmented the appearance of schizophrenic-like signs in these rats. Four experimental groups were studied (n= 6 - 15 rats/group) : naive rats without any treatment (NaNo); naive rats with postweaning social isolation and ketamine treatment (NaTr); 15 th generation of selectively bred animals without any treatment (SelNo) or selectively bred rats with both isolation and ketamine treatment (SelTr). The <b>startle</b> <b>reaction,</b> tail-flick and novel object recognition tests were used to classify the animals into low- or high-risk for schizophrenia. Reduced pain sensitivity, higher degree of the <b>startle</b> <b>reaction,</b> disturbed prepulse inhibition, altered motor activity and decreased differentiation index in the memory test were observed in the 15 th generation of the substrain, along with enhanced grooming behavior. Five functional indices (TF latency, <b>startle</b> <b>reaction,</b> prepulse inhibition, differentiation index, and grooming activity) were rated from 0 to 2, and the analysis of the summarized score revealed that the NaNo group had the lowest overall indication of schizophrenic-like signs, while the SelTr animals scored the highest, suggesting that both heritable and environmental factors were important in the generation of the behavioral alterations. We assume that further breeding after this complex treatment may lead to a valid and reliable animal model of schizophrenia. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|About 30 % {{of people}} on Earth have latent toxoplasmosis. Infected {{subjects}} do not express any clinical symptoms, however, they carry dormant stages of parasite Toxoplasma {{for the rest of}} their life. This form of toxoplasmosis is mostly considered harmless, however, recent studies showed its specific effects on physiology, behaviour and its associations with various diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Individuals who suffer from schizophrenia have about 2. 7 times higher prevalence of Toxoplasma-seropositivity than controls, which suggests that some traits characteristic of schizophrenic patients, including the sex difference in schizophrenia onset, decrease of grey matter density in specific brain areas and modification of prepulse inhibition of <b>startle</b> <b>reaction</b> could in fact be caused by toxoplasmosis for those patients who are Toxoplasma-seropositive. We measured the effect of prepulse inhibition/facilitation of the <b>startle</b> <b>reaction</b> on reaction times. The students, 170 women and 66 men, were asked to react as quickly as possible to a startling acoustic signal by pressing a computer mouse button. Some of the startling signals were without the prepulse, some were 20 msec. preceded by a short (20 msec.) prepulse signal of lower intensity. Toxoplasma-seropositive subjects had longer reaction times than the controls. Acoustic prepulse shorted the reaction times in all subjects. This effect of prepulse on reaction times was stronger in male subjects and increased with the duration of infection, suggesting that it represented a cumulative effect of latent toxoplasmosis, rather than a fading out after effect of past acute toxoplasmosis. Different sensitivity of Toxoplasma-seropositive and Toxoplasma-seronegative subjects on effect of prepulses on reaction times (the toxoplasmosis-prepulse interaction) suggested, but of course did not prove, that the alternations of prepulse inhibition of <b>startle</b> <b>reaction</b> observed in schizophrenia patients probably joined the list of schizophrenia symptoms that are in fact caused by latent toxoplasmosis...|$|E
40|$|The major form of {{familial}} hyperekplexia, a rare {{autosomal dominant}} disorder, {{is characterized by}} an abnormal <b>startle</b> <b>reaction</b> elicited by auditory and somatosensory stimuli, with transitory stiffness during the neontam period, followed later by falling attacks accompanied by momentary generalized muscular stiffness. Affected neonates occasionally have fatal hypertonia. The minor form is characterized only by an inconstant excessive startle response. We encountered a family in which three females presented with a partial or complete major form of the disease. All our patients were hyperreflexic, insecure gait was present in two subjects, without concomitant spontaneous nocturnal myoclonus. The pathophysiological basis of the hyperekplexia remains unclear. The abnormal startle reflex, probably related {{to the lack of}} inhibition by higher centers, is relayed in the caudal brainstem (ponto-medullary reticular formation), where bulbospinal motor efferents originate. Moreover, nonspecific changes such as large somatosensory evoked potentials and long-loop reflexes ("C-responses") may indicate increased cortical neuronal excitability. Polygraphic studies in these patients were normal. The locus of the major form of the disorder is located on chromosome 5 q 33 -q 35. Sequence analysis of the alpha 1 subunit of the inhibitory glycine receptor (GLRA 1) revealed a mutation at the same codon 271 in several families (G 1192 A and G 1192 T). We analyzed this gene and found a G 1192 A mutation changing an ARG to a LEU codon in all three presented patients. Sporadic cases may represent new mutations or lack of penetrance in some family members. Only one of our three patients needed clonazepam. The diagnosis of this disorder rules out epilepsy, or psychogenic pathological <b>startle</b> <b>reaction.</b> Electrophysiological criteria are useful, however perinatal hypertonia or a tonic generalized spasm accompanied with falls following an abnormal <b>startle</b> <b>reaction</b> and genetic studies remain the diagnostic milestones of familial hyperekplexia...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently {{authors have}} begun to {{emphasize}} the non-motor aspects of Cerebral Palsy and their influence on motor control and recovery prognosis. Much {{has been written about}} single clinical signs (i. e., <b>startle</b> <b>reaction)</b> but so far no definitions of the six perceptual signs presented in this study have appeared in literature. AIM: This study defines 6 signs (<b>startle</b> <b>reaction,</b> upper limbs in startle position, frequent eye blinking, posture freezing, averted eye gaze, grimacing) suggestive of perceptual disorders in children with cerebral palsy and measures agreement on sign recognition among independent observers and consistency of opinions over time. DESIGN: Observational study with both cross-sectional and prospective components. SETTING: Fifty-six videos presented to observers in random order. Videos were taken from 19 children with a bilateral form of cerebral palsy referred to the Children Rehabilitation Unit in Reggio Emilia. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five rehabilitation professionals from all over Italy: 9 doctors and 26 physiotherapists. METHODS: Measure of agreement among 35 independent observers was compiled from a sample of 56 videos. Interobserver reliability was determined using the K index of Fleiss and reliability intra-observer was calculated by the Spearman correlation index between ranks (rho - ρ). Percentage of agreement between observers and Gold Standard was used as criterion validity. RESULTS: Interobserver reliability was moderate for <b>startle</b> <b>reaction,</b> upper limb in startle position, adverted eye gaze and eye-blinking and fair for posture freezing and grimacing. Intraobserver reliability remained consistent over time. Criterion validity revealed very high agreement between independent observer evaluation and gold standard.

In this paper, two siblings with generalized stiffness and sudden muscle jerks to unexpected stimuli of various types are presented. They were previously misdiagnosed as epilepsy and treated with the conventional antiepileptic drugs. We wanted {{to call attention to}} and increase awareness of this rare disease and its differential diagnosis to avoid unnecessary investigations and treatment. Key words: startle, hyperekplexia, differential diagnosis. Startle disease, also known as hyperekplexia, is a rare non-epileptic disease. It is characterized by an exaggerated persistent <b>startle</b> <b>reaction</b> to unexpected auditory, visual and somatosensorial stimuli, generalized muscle stiffness, nocturnal myoclonus, and generalized hyperreflexia. It usually presents in the neonatal period with sustained tonic spasms, exaggerated <b>startle</b> <b>reaction,</b> fetal posture with clenched fists and anxious stare. The tonic spasms may mimic generalized tonic seizures and, seldomly, may cause apnea and death 1. It is often passed through autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance, but recessively inherited and sporadic forms of the disease are also seen. Hypertonia decreases within a few months and disappears by two to three years of age, while the exaggerated startle response may persist up to adulthood 2, 3. Delay in the diagnosis may lead to unnecessary investigations and inappropriate treatment.

Abnormalities of startle response have been observed in many stress-related mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the molecular mechanisms of startle in stress-associated conditions – for example, whether the <b>startle</b> <b>reaction</b> is associated with any gene variance – is still unknown. In this paper, we will carry out a systematic review by retrieving, assessing, and combining, when applicable, individual studies investigating association of the molecular variation of candidate gene with the startle response. The systematic review {{is based on the}} search for numerous publications using the keywords ‘‘startle gene’’ on September 15, 2010 using PubMed, which comprises more than 20 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE and life science journals.

40|$|Falls {{frequently}} {{occur in}} patients with Parkinson's disease (Bloem et al. 2001). One potential source for such falls during walking might be caused by the reaction to loud noises. In normal subjects <b>startle</b> <b>reactions</b> are well integrated in the locomotor activity (Nieuwenhuijzen et al. 2000), but whether this is also achieved in Parkinson patients is unknown. Therefore, in the present study, the startle response during walking was studied in eight patients with Parkinson's disease and in eight healthy subjects. To examine how <b>startle</b> <b>reactions</b> are incorporated in an ongoing gait pattern of these patients, unexpected auditory stimuli were presented in six phases of the step cycle during walking on a treadmill. For both legs electromyographic activity was recorded from biceps femoris and tibialis anterior. In addition, we measured the stance and swing phases of both legs, along with the knee angles of both legs and the left ankle angle. In all subjects and all muscles, responses were detected. The pattern of the responses, latency, duration, and phase-dependent modulation was similar in both groups. However, the mean response amplitude was larger in patients due to a smaller habituation rate. No correlation {{was found between the}} degree of habituation and disease severity. Moreover, a decreased habituation was already observed in mildly affected patients, indicating that habituation of the startle response is a sensitive measure of Parkinson's disease. The results complement the earlier findings of reduced habituation of blink responses in Parkinson's disease. With respect to behavioral changes in healthy subjects we observed that startle stimuli induced a shortening of the step cycle and a decrease in range of motion. In the patient group, less shortening of the subsequent step cycle and no decrease in range of motion of the knee and ankle was seen. It is argued that the observed changes might contribute to the high incidence of falls {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease. status: publishe...|$|R
