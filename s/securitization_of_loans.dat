Shale discoveries lead to large un-expected personal wealth windfalls, which result in an exogenous increase in local bank deposits and a positive local credit supply shock. Using this shock I examine whether local credit supply influences economic outcomes and how local banking market struc-ture affects the importance of credit supply. After a credit supply shock, the number of business establishments in industries more reliant on external finance increases 4. 6 % relative to those less reliant on external finance. This increase is more than five times higher in counties dominated by small banks relative to all other counties.

40|$|Financial {{innovations}} often {{respond to}} regulation by sidestepping regulatory restrictions {{that would otherwise}} limit activities in which people wish to engage. <b>Securitization</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> (e. g., credit card receivables, or subprime residential mortgages) is often portrayed, correctly, as having arisen in part {{as a means of}} “arbitraging ” regulatory capital requirements by booking assets off the balance sheets of regulated banks. Originators of the loans were able to maintain lower equity capital against those loans than they otherwise would have needed to maintain if the loans had been placed on their balance sheets. 1 Capital regulation of securitization invited this form of off-balance-sheet regulatory arbitrage, and did so quite consciously. Several of the capital requirement rules for the treatment of securitized assets originated by banks, and for the debts issued by those conduits and held or guaranteed by banks, were specifically and consciously designed to permit banks to allocate less capital against their risk...|$|E

40|$|Securitization is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important financial development in recent history. It offer the benefits of improving returns on capital, lowering borrowing costs, diversifying risks, increasing secondary market liquidity and increasing availability of credit for mortgage borrowers. However, many parties blamed the moral hazards in the <b>securitization</b> <b>of</b> mortgage <b>loans</b> as the key factor contributing to the recent US financial crisis of 2007 - 2008.

A good recent {{example of this is}} how the collective actions of bank managers engaging in <b>securitization</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> ended up freezing the world financial markets in 2008. Motivated by examples like the 2008 crisis, we analyze how endogenous shocks driven by collective actions of managers impact social welfare by using a dynamic general equilibrium model. We first show that such endogenous shocks render competitive equilibrium allocations inefficient due to externalities. We establish that a socially optimal allocation can only be attained by paying managers the socially optimal wages, and this can be achieved by imposing wage taxes (or subsidies) on managers. Finally, we extend the model by allowing for information asymmetry, and show that {{it is not possible to}} attain a socially optimal (i. e., first-best) allocation. We instead examine second-best allocations. In the second chapter, I study whether coalitions of consumers are beneficial to consumers when producers have market power.

30|$|Currently, {{government}} {{agencies such as}} Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), at the US, or China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), at China, are analyzing the cases of finance innovations and designing new regulation rules. As Internet finance is creating a more completive financial market, it may produce a far-reaching impact on credit risk management and demand the amendments to obsolete legal instruments (Luo 2013; Mishikin, F.S 2012; Tan 2014). For example, fostering Internet finance has the tendency to force China Central Bank to liberate the interest rate (Wei, L & Mozur 2014). One issue that is particularly relevant to IS research {{is the role of}} platforms for various innovative finance services. Comparing with traditional finance industry, Internet finance relies on IT platforms to bridge customers and finance service providers. Therefore, the credit risk management for Internet finance should pay special attention to the platform. In 2008, the SEC of the US issued a Cease and Desist Order to Prosper. The SEC claimed that Prosper was selling securities, so Prosper should have registered as a public company with the SEC. Similarly, Lending Club encountered the same problem, as it set up Eaglewood Capital to invest in its loans. The problem is that if such P 2 P loan securitization is not regulated by credit risk control framework, the <b>securitization</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> could be very risky. However, in another aspect, improper regulation may set hurdles to financial innovations (Verstein, A 2011). Thus, rules, policies, and laws should be developed or amended to govern cyber credit system in the way encouraging financial innovations while controlling risks at individual, company, and market levels. It seems that the issue of regulation or deregulation is still haunting the academia and industry since the case of AT&T decomposition in 1980 s (Economides 1999). The challenge is how to conceive and renovate a right legal system for Internet finance in terms of different credit governance systems in different economies with different cultural backgrounds, and in different contexts.|$|E

40|$|Mortgage fraud, often a {{violation}} {{of federal and state}} criminal statutes, covers a number of different types of behavior, all of which have the common denominator of conduct that has the intent or effect of impairing the value of residential mortgage loans. Mortgage fraud has become prevalent over the past decade and shows no signs of diminishing despite the collapse of domestic housing markets during the past two years. This paper analyzes the complex relationships between prime mortgage loan markets, subprime markets, and various types of mortgage fraud. This paper concludes that the root causes of mortgage fraud are associated with the core institutional and structural components of mortgage markets, which cut across all types of residential mortgage products. The organizing principle is the historical evolution from proximity to distance within the mortgage market, which is explored along three axes. First, geographical distance between lenders and borrowers has replaced geographical proximity. The mortgage market is national, with local lending institutions no longer making a significant proportion of the loans that are originated. Second, transactional distance has replaced transactional proximity. Lenders and borrowers have little direct contact; instead intermediaries such as mortgage brokers, appraisers, insurers, and closing officers, separate the principals. Third, financial distance has replaced financial proximity. Previously both borrowers and lenders had significant financial interests in the mortgage loan transaction. The borrower had equity in the property, and the lender held the loan in its portfolio. Presently many borrowers have no equity (or negative equity) in their homes, and due to the <b>securitization</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> through the secondary mortgage market, few originating lenders retain a stake in the loans they create. Reforms that could serve to reduce borrower-lender distance or to ameliorate its effects include the fashioning of better closing procedures for verifying borrower identity, providing a premium for community-bank loans to local borrowers, making originating lenders liable for all misconduct by appraisers, requiring significant down payments for borrowers, and allowing secondary market purchasers full recourse against originating lenders for losses caused by borrower defaults...|$|E

The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 repealed part of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, removing barriers in the market among banking companies, securities companies and insurance companies that prohibited any one institution from acting as any combination of an investment bank, a commercial bank, and an insurance company.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the roots}} of the recent global {{financial}} crisis has been seen in the design of subprime mortgage contract leading to high sensitivity of such type <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> to house price changes. The market <b>of</b> subprime <b>loans,</b> especially in the last years preceding the crisis, has been highly financed by securitization. The paper investigates how borrowers with subprime characteristics influence the transmission mechanism of business cycles in the economy and whether the <b>securitization</b> <b>of</b> subprime <b>loans</b> has a positive effect on the economy. The formal setup is a DSGE model with different types of borrowers and banks acting as financial intermediaries, in which households and entrepreneurs borrow against housing collateral. The economy is subject to four shocks: monetary, inflationary, preference and technology. It is shown that alone the existence of subprime borrowers does not make the economy more responsive to different shocks at the aggregate level (it has only redistributional effects) and that under certain circumstances the <b>securitization</b> <b>of</b> subprime <b>loans</b> (in form <b>of</b> residential mortgage backed securities) may lead to amplification of the business cycles...|$|R

Partly crafted by Mr. Kenneth Valley, Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Trade, the CTS Programme provides loans to finance business development projects {{in order to help}} CARICOM States improve their trade capacity, enhance the performance of their individual economies and to strengthen the competitiveness among private sector firms. Loans are provided on an interest-free basis and must be used for the purposes of procuring technical assistance services which are to be delivered by consultants. The Programme was launched on October 29, 2004 with a revolving fund loan in the amount of TT$100 million to be disbursed on an interest free basis to firms in CARICOM, except those located in Trinidad and Tobago. The TT$100 million (US$16 million or J$1 billion (at the 2004 exchange rate)) loan facility is just one component of the programme however. Other components of the trade support programme include the facilitation of investment by firms from Trinidad and Tobago in CARICOM member-states through joint ventures and strategic alliances; as well as the provision of technical inputs from national and regional private sector umbrella bodies. Administered by Trinidad and Tobago's Ministry of Trade and Industry the programme has already approved loans for private sector firm in St. Kitts & Nevis, Antigua & Barbuda, Grenada, and more recently in Suriname (the Sunspot company) and Jamaica (for the Pulse Investment Company Ltd.). The latter two companies received loans totalling US$180,000 for the purposes of restructuring to ensure enhanced profitability and to develop an export marketing programme.

The model finds that <b>securitization</b> <b>of</b> mortgage <b>loans</b> allows originators to pass on risk. As a consequence, investor borrowers start receiving loans, and when these loans are non-recourse, there is a put option that pushes up house prices during a demand boom. I thus have the novel prediction that the interaction between securitization and non-recourse status should lead to higher house prices. The second chapter proceeds to test this prediction, making use of heterogeneity in recourse laws in US states.

Using a sample of US financial institutions over the period 2003 - 2009 we document that CEOs with high equity incentives have systematically engaged in securitization transactions to a larger extent than CEOs with low incentives. We also show that CEOs with high equity and risk-related incentives have engaged in the <b>securitization</b> <b>of</b> risky <b>loans</b> and have used securitization for transferring risks to outside investors.
