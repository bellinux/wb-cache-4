It is also believed that God did not make himself known through the revelations; it was his will that was revealed. There is nothing in the Quran that suggests that Muhammad saw God during his revelations.

In his Book of Shadows, there are texts taken from various sources, including Charles Godfrey Leland's Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches (1899) and the works of 19th–20th century occultist Aleister Crowley, whom Gardner knew personally.

Additionally, women can donate money, act as trustees and set up a business or company. These rights cannot be altered, irrespective of marital status. When a woman is married, she legally has total control over the dowerthe mahr or bridal gift, usually financial in nature, while the groom pays to the bride upon marriageand retains this control in the event of divorce.|$|E

With an approximate duration of 60 minutes, this piece utilizes as a script a story from the Popol Vuh (the <b>sacred</b> <b>text</b> of the Maya culture) about the mythic brothers Hunahpu and Ixbalanqué. The score includes soloists and a choir of nine mixed voices, accompanied by an instrumental group and an electro-acoustic quadraphonic system. The scene requires a stage elevated over the choir spatial position, which members wear dinner jackets, in opposition to the more casual attire of the soloists. All singers wear Indian masks.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} of Guru Granth Sahib {{is done by}} the official religious body of Sikhs based in Amritsar. Great care is taken while making printed copies and a strict code of conduct is observed during the task of printing. Before the late nineteenth century, only handwritten copies were prepared.

Only machine printed copies of 20th century and Not Hand written of Guru Granth Sahib deemed unfit to be read from are cremated. Such cremating is called Agan Bheta and no burning material such as wood is used. Guru Granth Sahib is currently printed in an authorized printing press {{in the basement of the}} Gurudwara Ramsar in Amritsar; misprints and set-up sheets, and printer's waste with any of its <b>sacred</b> <b>text</b> on, are cremated at Goindval.|$|E
40|$|This course {{offers an}} {{introduction}} to the study of religion through the <b>sacred</b> <b>texts,</b> concepts, and practices of four religious traditions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Christianity.

This course, like others in the Religion Department, is designed to help students develop a coherent set of academic skills in the study of religion, as well as an interdisciplinary approach to work in the Humanities and Social Sciences, with a special emphasis on literary, historical, and anthropological methods of study...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{refers to}} the role of <b>sacred</b> <b>texts</b> in {{defining}} a building by using some texts more than others, by highlight some issues in a context while skip others, or by adopting references from the Quran or Hadith to bolster certain beliefs. The <b>sacred</b> <b>texts</b> in this mosque depend mostly on the Shiites Imams’ speech, some from Hadith of Prophet Muhammad, and the minority of the <b>sacred</b> <b>texts</b> is taken from the Quran. Minority here is not in terms of quantity but in using the context to confirm the Shi’a ideology in contrast with the Sunni ideology, by depending on the interpretation of the <b>sacred</b> <b>texts</b> in Quran. The reasons for this clearly appear in the influence of ideologies using <b>sacred</b> <b>texts</b> from the same religion, among Sunni and Shi’a, to attract people to a certain ideology and to simultaneously stand against the other which was the method used in the middle age. In this paper, the focus will be on tracing the meanings that characterize this mosque in the Islamic world by reflecting on its history, architecture, and arts element. This mosque was first established following the Sunni ideology, then, it was transformed to belong to the Shi’a in the Safavid Period to spread their ideology...|$|R

25|$|Among the {{influences}} which have {{played an important}} role in defining the social, spiritual and cosmological status of women in the course of Islamic history are Islam's <b>sacred</b> <b>text,</b> the Qur'an; the Ḥadīths, which are traditions relating to the deeds and aphorisms of Islam's Prophet Muḥammad; ijmā', which is a consensus, expressed or tacit, on a question of law; qiyās, the principle by which the laws of the Qur'an and the Sunnah or Prophetic custom are applied to situations not explicitly covered by these two sources of legislation; and fatwas, non-binding published opinions or decisions regarding religious doctrine or points of law. Additional influences include pre-Islamic cultural traditions; secular laws, which are fully accepted in Islam so long as they do not directly contradict Islamic precepts; religious authorities, including government-controlled agencies such as the Indonesian Ulema Council and Turkey's Diyanet; and spiritual teachers, which are particularly prominent in Islamic mysticism or Sufism. Many of the latterincluding perhaps most famously, Ibn al-'Arabīhave themselves produced texts that have elucidated the metaphysical symbolism of the feminine principle in Islam.|$|E

To quote Metzger, {{the purpose of the}} Babalon Working was [...] "a daring attempt to shatter the boundaries of space and time" [...] facilitating, according to Parsons, the emergence of Thelema's Æon of Horus. When Cameron departed for a trip to New York, Parsons retreated to the desert, where he believed that a preternatural entity psychographically provided him with Liber 49, which represented a fourth part of Crowley's The Book of the Law, the primary <b>sacred</b> <b>text</b> of Thelema, as well as part of a new <b>sacred</b> <b>text</b> he called the Book of Babalon.

[...] Believing the Babalon Working was accomplished, Parsons sold the Parsonage to developers for $25,000 under the condition that he and Cameron could continue to live in the coach house, and he appointed Roy Leffingwell to head the Agape Lodge, which would now have to meet elsewhere for its rituals.|$|E
