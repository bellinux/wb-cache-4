5|$|Although sea otters can be {{playful and}} sociable, {{they are not}} {{considered}} to be truly social animals. They <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> alone, and each adult can meet its own needs in terms of hunting, grooming, and defense.|$|E
5|$|The mutual {{attraction}} {{between individual}} insects continues into adulthood, {{and they continue}} to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals {{at the front of the}} swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.|$|E
5|$|By {{early summer}} 1871, Morris began {{to search for}} a house outside London where his {{children}} could spend time away from the city's pollution. He settled on Kelmscott Manor in the village of Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, obtaining a joint tenancy on the building with Rossetti in June. Morris adored the building, which was constructed circa 1570, and would <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in the local countryside. Conversely, Rossetti would be unhappy at Kelmscott, and eventually suffered a mental breakdown. Morris divided his time between London and Kelmscott, however when Rossetti was there he would not spend more than three days at a time at the latter. He was also fed up with his family home in Queen Square, deciding to obtain a new house in London. Although retaining a personal bedroom and study at Queen Square, he relocated his family to Horrington House in Turnham Green Road, West London, in January 1873. This allowed him to be far closer to the home of Burne-Jones, with the duo meeting on almost every Sunday morning for the rest of Morris' life.|$|E

5|$|In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard {{and with}} members that {{included}} Cockcroft, {{was sent to}} America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, antisubmarine warfare, aeronautical engineering and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added impetus {{to the development of}} microwave radar and proximity fuses. This prompted the Americans to create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve a model for the Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls' and Frisch's findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role of the development of military technologies was strengthened {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E

25|$|Despite the casualties, Aylmer {{could not}} afford to <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> waiting for the arrival of the second {{division}} of reinforcements still working its way upriver to the front. Every advance he made, put him further from his supply base at Basra, and closer to the Ottoman logistical hub at Baghdad. Although considered a British victory (albeit a costly one), the Ottoman forces had achieved their goal in delaying the Tigris Corps. They had bloodied Aylmer's forces, using up time which the Kut garrison believed it did not have and reinforcements which were hard for the British and Indian governments to replace.|$|E

25|$|Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: an Istari wizard {{and mentor}} to Frodo. Sean Connery was {{approached}} for the role, {{but did not}} understand the plot, while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with X-Men. He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films, and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.|$|E
25|$|Cortés {{brought his}} second wife, Doña Juana de Zúñiga {{to live at}} the palace, where she stayed until after Cortés death in 1547.

He {{spent most of his}} time after the Conquest {{organizing}} expeditions, building ships on the Pacific coast, touring his encomienda holdings as Marquis and introducing crops such as sugar cane with success. Cortés had three haciendas in the Cuernavaca area, and eventually {{spent most of his time}} in Morelos at one of these, especially Atlacomulco.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Caillebotte began {{visiting the}} studio of painter Léon Bonnat, where {{he began to}} study {{painting}} seriously.

In 1873, Caillebotte entered the École des Beaux-Arts, but apparently did not <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> there. He inherited his father's fortune in 1874 and the surviving sons divided the family fortune after their mother's death in 1878. Around 1874, Caillebotte met and befriended several artists working outside the Académie des Beaux-Arts, including Edgar Degas and Giuseppe de Nittis, and he attended (but did not participate in) the first Impressionist exhibition of 1874.|$|E
