40|$|Abstract — Polycrystalline <b>solar</b> <b>wafer</b> {{consists}} of various crystals so {{the surface of}} <b>solar</b> <b>wafer</b> shows heterogeneous textures. Because of this property the visual inspection of micro-crack is very difficult. In this paper, we propose the anisotropic diffusion-based micro-crack detection scheme for polycrystalline solar wafers. In the proposed method, anisotropic diffusion {{is based on the}} application of diagonal-kernel and cross-kernel in parallel. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance of micro-crack detection than conventional anisotropic diffusion-based methods on a cross-kernel.

30|$|The {{increasing}} demand for solar electrical energy has multiplied {{the need for}} photovoltaic (PV) arrays. As the major component of the PV array, the demand for solar cells has also increased. This demand has translated into an increased production of solar cells in recent years.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the implications and remaining challenges behind the seemingly happy {{ending of the}} recent EU–China trade dispute on solar products. First, the EU's choice of a specific trade defence measure – anti-dumping – was based on shaky arguments. Second, further trade disputes on green goods are very likely, in particular because China is increasingly implementing domestic support policies on green sectors, bringing down Chinese export prices. Third, trade defence measures could be adopted as an expensive option. Alternatively to this, the EU and China could consider setting up constructive and preventive mechanisms in order to stabilize trade and broaden their economic relationship. Policy relevance In July 2013 the EU accepted an undertaking by Chinese <b>solar</b> <b>wafer,</b> cell, and module manufacturers to fix minimum import prices for their products, along with a volume cap to be imposed on Chinese solar exports to the EU. In spite of the seemingly happy end of a trade dispute between the two {{major players in the}} renewables sector, we show that the possibility of trade disputes over low-carbon products in the near future cannot be ruled out. Drawing on the China–EU photovoltaic 'dumping case', we highlight some weaknesses in the EU's choice to resort to anti-dumping measures and emphasize the urgent need to invent new forms of trade dialogues between the EU and China as first-choice trade dispute settlement policies.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} a laser method of micro-machining front contacts of monocrystalline solar wafers. This means forming front electrodes in order to decrease their resistance. It was demonstrated, that laser processing is a promising technique for selective laser sintering (SLS) solar cell contacts compared conventional forming front grid methods. Design/methodology/approach: The topography of laser micro-machining contact formations and screen-printing were investigated using ZEISS SUPRA 25 scanning electron microscope. The materials {{used in the present}} invention are different granulation silver powders. The grain size analysis were used in order to determine their size. The transmission line model (TLM) patterns were fabricated by selective laser sintering. Findings: This work presents an initial analysis of a new selective laser sintering/melting process to contact crystalline silicon solar cells. The seed layer was created using both silver pastes and powders by a selective laser sintering, do not use up to now in Poland. These contact structures were investigated microscopically {{to gain a better understanding}} of the method and select laser micro-machining parameters, which will influence on electrical parameters of formed front side grids. Practical implications: SLS can produce parts from a relatively wide range of commercially available powder materials. The physical process can be full melting, partial melting, or liquid-phase sintering and depending on the material.

40|$|As the {{thickness}} of silicon <b>solar</b> <b>wafer</b> and solar cells becomes thinner, the cells are subjected to high stress due to the thermal coefficient mismatch induced by metallization process. Handling and bowing problems associated with thinner wafers become increasingly important, as these can lead to cells cracking and thus to high yield losses. The goal of this work to provide experimental understanding of Al rear side microstructure development and mechanical properties as well as correlate the obtained results with fracture behaviour of the cell. It is shown that the aluminium back contact has a complex microstructure, consisting of five main components: 1) the back surface field layer; 2) a eutectic layer; 3) spherical (3 - 5 µm) hypereutectic Al-Si particles surrounded by a thin aluminium oxide layer (200 nm); 4) a bis- muth-silicate glass matrix; and 5) pores (14 vol%). It was concluded that the eutectic layer thickness and waviness depends on Al particle size, amount of Al paste and textured surface roughness of silicon wafers. The Young’s modulus of the Al-Si particles is estimated by nano-indentation and the overall Young’s modulus is estimated {{on the basis of}} bowing measurements and found to be ~ 43 GPa. It was found, that there is a relation between aluminium paste composition, eutectic layer thickness, mechanical strength and bowing of solar cells. Three main parameters were found to affect the mechanical strength of mc-silicon solar cells with an aluminium contact layer, namely the eutectic layer thickness and uniformity, the Al layer thickness (which results from the Al particle size and its distribution), and the amount of porosity and the bismuth glass fraction...|$|E

30|$|To date, {{few studies}} have {{highlighted}} the benefit of computer inspection for defect detection in EL images of solar cells. For example, multicrystalline solar cell images have been categorized into three distinct classes based on the features extracted from texture analysis [7]. An evaluation of crack formation in the PV module before and after mechanical load testing using EL images has been presented by Kajari-Schröder et al. [8]. Recently, a defect detection scheme based on Fourier image reconstruction has also been reported [9]. These authors presented a successful detection of a micro-crack which is geometrically simple like straight lines. A micro-crack detection scheme for a <b>solar</b> <b>wafer</b> based on an anisotropic diffusion filter has also been documented [10]. As reported by these authors, this filter is very efficient in preserving important edges in the image while smoothing other less important and connected regions. However, correct implementation of this technique depends crucially on the choice of an edge stopping threshold. In most cases, this value has to be determined interactively, frequently through trail-and-error method. Only under very unusual circumstances can anisotropic diffusion filtering be successful using a single threshold since images {{are likely to be}} gray level variations in objects and background due to non-uniform lighting and other factors. Clearly, a more robust approach is needed in order to increase the efficiency of this filtering strategy. In this paper, an enhanced version of the anisotropic diffusion filter featuring an adaptive thresholding via a sigmoid transformation function is presented. Meanwhile, pattern classification is established using support vector machines (SVMs) with supervised learning [11]. The methods and procedures are tested using intact and defected solar cells, and results are compared with other filters and artificial classifiers.|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{enhanced}} {{chemical etching}} of silicon wafers {{has been successfully}} carried out at atmospheric pressure. The etching process was developed using a linear extended DC arc with a working width of 150 mm for plasma activation. The technology operates in a remote (downstream) mode. The experimental set-up allows continuous processing which is advantageous in terms of in-line capability and consequently reduced effort for substrate handling. Fluorine radicals generated downstream of the plasma source from CHF 3, CF 4, C 2 F 6, C 4 F 8, SF 6, NF 3, CHF 3 /O 2, C 2 F 6 /O 2 and SF 6 /O 2 have been successfully utilized to etch (100) -mono-Si wafers. Static etch rates of over 11 micron/min and dynamic etch rates of 1. 5 micronxm/min have been obtained with NF 3. SEM images of the etched silicon wafers exhibit different surface morphologies such as pyramids of several microns size or nano structured surfaces with high aspect ratio, strongly depending on process conditions and etch precursors used. The reactive plasma {{was used to remove}} the rear side emitter and provide for edge isolation of crystalline Si solar cells. Results comparable to established wet chemical etch processes were achieved. Plasma chemical etching at atmospheric pressure can also be introduced into other steps for continuous <b>solar</b> <b>wafer</b> processing. One promising step is surface texturing in order to decrease front side silicon reflectance. Different substrate textures, i. e. pyramids of some microns and nano structures with high aspect ratio have been obtained leading to substantial decreased reflectance. Furthermore the feasibility of both saw damage etching and phosphorsilicate glass removal have been demonstrated. The PSG (Phosphorsilicate-glass) etching rate is strongly dependent on both etchant selection and plasma parameters used. The PSG rate can be factor 10 to 100 higher against the etch rate of the doped silicon wafer. The underlying plasma equipment is characterized by low footprint requirements and is well suited for in-line integration into both existing lines and newly designed lines...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve cost {{competitiveness}} for energy production, the solar PV technology is dynamically shifting towards thinner wafers. Due to this cost driven reduction of <b>solar</b> <b>wafer</b> thickness, there is more influence of surface recombination in limiting the overall solar cell efficiency. Therefore a high surface passivation quality, using low cost process techniques is crucial for the concept of high-efficiency silicon solar cells with low cost per Watt peak. A new generation of silicon solar cell type is the passivated emitter and rear solar cell (PERC). In this technology, the cell is passivated on both emitter and rear sides to reduce recombination at the surface. During large scale development of PERC solar cells, there are certain drawbacks confronting current PERC cell development. Therefore, industries sought after process optimization techniques for developing high efficiency PERC cells through effective use of materials and low cost production methods. Hence {{within the framework of}} this Master thesis, further investigation to reduce the total cost of PERC-type solar cells is carried out. The thesis work is dedicated to investigating an optimized PERC concept to enhance the method of solar cell production, by suggesting an alternative process flow for the manufacture of PERC cells. This can be achieved through a re-arrangement of inline process steps involved in the standard fabrication mechanism and also through the omission of the rear polishing step. After a thorough study of different passivation layers, it was evident that the stack of Al 2 O 3 rear passivation layer with SiNx capping layer proves to be a very suitable option for the proposed new concept of PERC cells fabrication. At Fraunhofer ISE a Sputter and PECVD deposition process for Al 2 O 3 and SiNx layers has been successfully established. Therefore, experiments are performed with the main focus of investigating the stability of these Al 2 O 3 /SiNx rear passivation stacks as a barrier against the texturing and diffusion process and also to investigate the quality of surface passivation after the high temperature diffusion process. After a detailed analysis {{of the results of the}} texturing and diffusion experiments, three potential Al 2 O 3 /SiNx stack solutions are proposed as rear passivation stacks for the new PERC concept, which are deposited using the MW PECVD, ICP PECVD and Sputter techniques. Also, an economic analysis of the proposed solutions is performed, to validate the implementation of the new PERC concep...|$|E
