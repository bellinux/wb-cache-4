Coronary artery occlusion may cause diastolic heart murmurs, so analysis of diastolic heart murmurs has important significance to noninvasive diagnosis of CAD. Heart <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> is typical nonlinear and non-stationary time series, nonlinear analysis method- correlation dimension can effectively describe the nonlinear characteristics of heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals,</b> but {{the analysis of the}} correlation dimension shows that trend terms in the heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> may lead to erroneous results. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is adaptive to remove trend for non-stationary signal, so a method combining EMD and correlation dimension was proposed for nonlinear analysis of diastolic heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> The EMD method was applied to reconstruct heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> after removing trend, and the correlation dimension for reconstructed heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> was used as characteristics to distinguish between normal heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> and CAD heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> The diastolic heart sounds of 15 normal people and 15 patients with CAD were analyzed in the experiment, and the results showed that the proposed method can effectively distinguish between normal people and patients wit...|$|R

40|$|Auditory system detects <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> {{and uses}} the temporal-frequency {{information}} of the <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> to conduct <b>sound</b> identification, sound localization, and sound source separation. Thanks to the past studies, {{we know that the}} hair cells at cochlea show frequency-dependent responses against input <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> But, little is known about how the sound information is conducted to and processed within the auditory cortex. Recently, B. A. Pearlmutter and A. M. Zador proposed an algorithm for monaural source separation under the assumption that the precise head-related transfer function (HRTF) and all the sound dictionary elements are known (ref. [1]). To apply this algorithm to the real <b>sound</b> <b>signals,</b> here I propose that non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) applied to the spectrograms of <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> would successfully give a set of sound dictionary elements. When NMF was applied to solo-music signals with an appropriate value for the rank of factorization, it could extract instrument-specific patterns of basis spectrograms, each of which has a peak frequency for different notes. Interestingly, the <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> converted back from the obtained basis spectrograms sounded more or less like the corresponding instrument, which suggests that the obtained basis spectrograms, or basis sound elements, would be a good candidate for the sound dictionary. When NMF was applied to <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> played with several different instruments, the obtained basis sound elements can be categorized into each instrument-specific pattern by hand. In addition, using the categorized elements, <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> can be reconstructed corresponding to each instrument part of the original music. The fact that source separation can be done using the basis sound elements obtained by NMF suggests that NMF would be a possible way to learn sound dictionaries from <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> ...|$|R
