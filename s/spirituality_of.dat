5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the <b>spirituality</b> <b>of</b> the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{artists of}} the mid-nineteenth century were {{influenced}} by the painters of the Nazarene movement, a group of German artists based in Rome, who attempted to revive the <b>spirituality</b> <b>of</b> Medieval and Early Renaissance art. They were also influenced by, and influenced, {{the work of the}} English Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who rejected the formalism of Mannerist painting after Raphael. David Scott's (1806–49) learnt the art of fresco painting from the Nazarenes. He painted historical works, such as The Poles did nobly and the Russian General Craved and Armistice to bury his Dead (1832) and Traitor's Gate (1842). His most ambitious historical work was the triptych Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and J. P. Nichol's Architecture of the Heavens (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelites mainly through his brother William Bell Scott (1811–90), who became a close friend of founding member D. G. Rossetti. His most famous work, Iron and Coal {{was one of the most}} popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{increase}} in the number <b>of</b> studies on <b>spirituality</b> manifests growing recognition of the importance <b>of</b> <b>spirituality,</b> as well as mounting interest in studying spirituality in healthcare. Most studies on <b>spirituality</b> in end <b>of</b> life care focus on identifying specific features <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> and often represent an individualistic understanding <b>of</b> <b>spirituality.</b> They seldom engage in a historical–cultural exploration of the contextual meanings of those features <b>of</b> <b>spirituality.</b> This paper aims to demonstrate the absence of contextual factors in studying spirituality {{at the end of life}} and to highlight the growing recognition of the importance of history, culture and traditions as resources to enrich our understanding <b>of</b> <b>spirituality.</b> An exploration <b>of</b> the concept <b>of</b> <b>spirituality,</b> an overview <b>of</b> the trajectory of the study <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> and a review of existing methodological stances reveal the silent space in current approaches to understanding spirituality at the end of life. Recognition of the importance of these contextual factors in understanding spirituality is growing, which is yet to influence the conceptualization and the conduct <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> research. Contextual understandings <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> that incorporate insights from the history, culture and traditions of specific contexts can inform effective means for providing spiritual support in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} explores the role <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> in {{achieving}} job satisfaction. Divine Economics Framework {{is used for}} quantifying the interrelationships between spirituality and worklife using empirical data of 383 workers from 5 districts of Azad Kashmir. The study analyzed the effect <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> level <b>of</b> workers on their subjective evaluation of their worklife (job satisfaction).   An index <b>of</b> workers’ <b>spirituality</b> is developed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The literature on theology and philosophy indicates that spirituality has many types which may lead to produce a systematically different human behavior. To test whether or not workers having different levels <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> have the same job satisfaction, Logistic regression technique is used. The results of given sample revealed that besides the conventional variables such as income, age, education, health, and job sector, a particular type <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> is {{a significant predictor of}} workers’ job satisfaction. Our estimates relating to selected dimension <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> are presented to serve as new insights for further research in different types <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> at workplace. This study concludes that the Divine Economics Framework is relatively more capable to analyze economics <b>of</b> <b>spirituality.</b> The future research may utilize this framework to study the interrelationships <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> with workplace as well as other areas of economics. </p...|$|R

25|$|The Qliphah is the {{unbalanced}} {{power of}} a Sephirah. Malkuth is the lowest Sephirah, {{the realm of the}} earth, into which all the divine energy flows, and in which the divine plan is worked out. However, its unbalanced form is as Lilith, the seductress. The material world, and all of its pleasures, is the ultimate seductress, and can lead to materialism unbalanced by the <b>spirituality</b> <b>of</b> the higher spheres. This ultimately leads to a descent into animal consciousness. The balance must therefore be found between Malkuth and Kether, to find order and harmony.|$|E

25|$|Ignatian Spirituality {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} earlier spiritual traditions: finding God in all things, or being a contemplative in action, has been likened to the <b>spirituality</b> <b>of</b> St. Francis of Assisi whom Ignatius admired. Meditation/contemplation on the Gospels has {{roots in the}} Benedictine Lectio Divina. However, Ignatian Spirituality is adaptable as is clear from Ignatius' book on the Exercises. For instance, Pedro Arrupe (1907-1991), a prominent Superior General of the Jesuits from 1965-1983, was known for incorporating Zen meditative techniques to assist in his concentration. Another example of adaptability {{is the extent to}} which the individual exercitant applies imagination, quite presence, or discursive reasoning to the events of Jesus' life, to arrive at closer knowledge and following of the Lord.|$|E

How do New Age <b>spiritualities</b> <b>of</b> life fare {{in the context of this}} development? Concentrating on activities found in the holistic milieu which is to be found in many countries today, the argument is that activities like yoga or spiritual aromatherapy serve as 'intermediary institutions', successfully negotiating a path between antinomian freedom and social conformism...|$|R
