40|$|About 1500 {{strains of}} El Tor vibrios, {{isolated}} in 1964 and 1965 in the Philippines, were examined for their susceptibilities to 17 drugs. All the strains tested were highly sensitive to dihydroxymethyl-furalazine, and most were highly sensitive to tetracycline hydrochloride, chloramphenicol and erythromycin, and moderately sensitive to novobiocin, dihydrostreptomycin sulfate, kanamycin and neomycin. They showed a remarkable fluctuation of sensitivity to ampicillin, cefaloridine, cefalotin and <b>sulfafurazole,</b> {{and a high}} resistance to benzylpenicillin sodium, oleandomycin and spiramycin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:Escherichia coli were {{isolated}} from water from two boreholes in Ile Ife, Osun state, Nigeria. This was {{an indication of}} faecal contamination. These strains of Escherichia coli were Gram negative short rods, Catalase positive, Methyl red positive, Voges Proskaeur negative. The strains could ferment glucose galactose, sucrose, lactose, mannitol and maltose with the production of acid and gas but could not hydrolyze starch. A particular strain was resistant to sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, cephaloridine, streptomycin, carbenicillin, <b>sulfafurazole</b> and tetracycline but sensitive to gentamicin, colistin, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin and colistin sulphat...|$|E
40|$|Three {{antibiotics}} <b>sulfafurazole</b> (SFZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and sulfacetamide sodium (SSA-Na) {{belonging to}} sulfonamides were irradiated {{and changes in}} physico-chemical properties, pH, melting points, UV, IR, NMR, TLC, GC-MS, ESR characteristics, antimicrobial activities of active components were studied at normal and accelerated stability test conditions. Two radiolytic intermediates for both SFZ and SMZ and four radiolytic intermediates for SSA-Na {{were found in the}} irradiated solid samples after the GC-MS analysis. The results obtained under normal and accelerated stability test conditions were observed to be consistent with the unirradiated values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} seventy-one Shigella strain {{isolated}} in Hongkong {{during a period}} from 1959 July, to June, 1964 were classified serologically. All of the strains, 105 belonged to Sh. flexneri, 2 to Sh. boydii and 64 to Sh. sonnei. These strains were mainly originated from patients who had clinically been diagnosed as bacillary dysentery and from patients having some or other gastro-intestinal complaints, but it worth special mention that there were 3 cases of extra-intestinal shigellosis. Sensitivity tests to 8 kinds of antibiotics or chemotherapeutic drugs were carried out every year. Sensitive strains to <b>sulfafurazole</b> could hardly be found, and emergence of resistant strains to streptomycin showed a yearly increase. Since 1962 the multiple resistant strains of CTS pattern have increased particularly...|$|E
40|$|Methenamine hjppurate {{was used}} as a prophylactic/suppressive agent after initial {{treatment}} of episodes of urinary tract infection in 116 children. The recurrence rate while on treatment was 12 - 2 and post-therapy was 31 - 4 %. The recurrence rates for a group treated with sulfafurazolc were 2 - 0 % during and 48 - 5 % after therapy. For nitrofurantoin the respective rates WCTC 4 - 7 and 44 - 6 %, and for alternating sulfa-furazole and nitrofurantoin therapy 8 - 1 and 71 - 7 %. Side effects and allergic reactions were encountered in M % of the cases given methenamine hippurate, 9 - 4 % given <b>sulfafurazole</b> and 13 - 6 % given nitrofurantoin. The incidence of Escherichia coli amongst organisms causing the recurrence during methenamine hippurate therapy increased, but decreased during sulfa-furazole and nitrofurantoin therapy. In the post-therapy recurrences a higher incidence of E. coli was found only in the nitrofurantoin group...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the levels of Salmonella spp. contamination in raw food samples, including chicken, beef, pork, and shellfish, from Vietnam and to determine their antibiotic resistance characteristics. A total of 180 samples were collected and examined for the presence of Salmonella spp., yielding 91 Salmonella isolates. Sixty-one percent of meat and 18 % of shellfish samples were contaminated with Salmonella spp. Susceptibility of all isolates to a variety of antimicrobial agents was tested, and resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin/amoxicillin, nalidixic acid, <b>sulfafurazole,</b> and streptomycin was found in 40. 7 %, 22. 0 %, 18. 7 %, 16. 5 %, and 14. 3 % of the isolates, respectively. Resistance to enrofloxacin, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and gentamicin was also detected (8. 8 to 2. 2 %). About half (50. 5 %) of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and multiresistant Salmonella isolates, resistant to at least three different classes of antibiotics, were isolated from all food types. One isolate from chicken (serovar Albany) contained a variant of the Salmonella genomic island 1 antibiotic resistance gene cluster. The results show that antibiotic resistance in Salmonella spp. in raw food samples from Vietnam is significant...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine a current baseline profile of antimicrobial resistance and virulence of Escherichia coli isolated from foods commonly sold in the market place in Vietnam. E. coli were isolated from 180 samples of raw meat, poultry and shellfish and also isolated from 43 chicken faeces samples. Ninety-nine E. coli isolates recovered from all sources were selected for the investigation of their susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents by the disk diffusion method. Eighty-four percent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics, and multi-resistance, defined as resistance to at least 3 different classes of antibiotics, was detected in all sources. The rates of multi-resistance were up to 89. 5 % in chicken, 95 % in chicken faeces and 75 % in pork isolates. Resistance was most frequently observed to tetracycline (77. 8 %), <b>sulfafurazole</b> (60. 6 %), ampicillin (50. 5 %), amoxicillin (50. 5 %), trimethoprim (51. 5 %), chloramphenicol (43. 4 %), streptomycin (39. 4 %), nalidixic acid (34. 3 %) and gentamicin (24. 2 %). In addition, the isolates also displayed resistance to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 16. 2 %, norfloxacin 17. 2 %, and enrofloxacin 21. 2 %), with chicken isolates showing the highest rates of resistance to these antibiotics (52. 6 63. 2 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Salmonella enterica is a {{zoonotic}} pathogen {{causing a}} variety of diseases in humans and animals. Many countries are reporting {{an increase in the}} prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. enterica in food animals. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether S. enterica isolated from livestock in New South Wales, Australia, have similar resistance traits to those reported internationally. Salmonella enterica (n = 165) from clinical infections in food animals between 2007 and 2011 were serotyped and tested for susceptibility to 18 antimicrobials. Also, 22 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), 3 integrons and 18 plasmid replicon types were screened for using PCR. Most isolates (66. 1 %) remained susceptible to all antimicrobials; 8. 5 % of the isolates were resistant to four or more antimicrobials. Antimicrobials with the highest prevalence of resistance were <b>sulfafurazole</b> (28. 5 %), ampicillin (17. 0 %), tetracycline (15. 8 %) and trimethoprim (8. 5 %). There was no resistance to fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporins. The most common ARGs were bla (15. 2 %), sul 2 (10. 3 %), tetB (9. 1 %), tetA (5. 5 %), aphA 1 (4. 8 %) and dhfrV (4. 8 %). Class 1 integrons (7. 9 %) and IncFIIA (69. 7 %) were the most commonly detected integron and plasmid replicon types, respectively. Class 1 integrons were positively associated with MDR phenotypes and ARG carriage (P â‰¤ 0. 001). Internationally prominent MDR serovars associated with severe disease in humans (e. g. AmpC-positive Salmonella Newport) were not detected. Overall, the comparatively favourable resistance status of S. enterica in Australian livestock represents minimal public health risk associated with MDR strains and supports a conservative approach to the registration of antimicrobial drug classes in food-producing animals.
