25|$|User {{equivalent}} range errors (UERE) {{are shown}} in the table. There is also a numerical error with an estimated value, , of about 1 meter. The <b>standard</b> <b>deviations,</b> , <b>for</b> the coarse/acquisition (C/A) and precise codes are also shown in the table. These standard deviations are computed by taking the square root of {{the sum of the}} squares of the individual components (i.e., RSS for root sum squares). To get the standard deviation of receiver position estimate, these range errors must be multiplied by the appropriate dilution of precision terms and then RSS'ed with the numerical error. Electronics errors are one of several accuracy-degrading effects outlined in the table above. When taken together, autonomous civilian GPS horizontal position fixes are typically accurate to about 15 meters (50ft). These effects also reduce the more precise P(Y) code's accuracy. However, the advancement of technology means that in the present, civilian GPS fixes under {{a clear view of the}} sky are on average accurate to about 5 meters (16ft) horizontally.|$|E

50|$|Stevens (1946) argued that, {{because the}} {{assumption}} of equal distance between categories does not hold for ordinal data, the use of means and <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> description of ordinal distributions and of inferential statistics based on {{means and standard deviations}} was not appropriate. Instead, positional measures like the median and percentiles, in addition to descriptive statistics appropriate for nominal data (number of cases, mode, contingency correlation), should be used. Nonparametric methods have been proposed as the most appropriate procedures for inferential statistics involving ordinal data, especially those developed for the analysis of ranked measurements. However, use of parametric statistics for ordinal data may be permissible with certain caveats {{to take advantage of the}} greater range of available statistical procedures.|$|E

5000|$|In general, 'normal' {{refers to}} a lack of {{significant}} deviation from the average. The word normal is used in a more narrow sense in mathematics, where a normal distribution describes a population whose characteristics centers around the average or the norm. When looking at a specific behaviour, such as the frequency of lying, a researcher may use a Gaussian bell curve to plot all reactions, and a normal reaction would be within one standard deviation, or the most average 68.3%. However, this mathematical model only holds for one particular trait at a time, since, for example, the probability of a single individual being within one standard deviation for 36 independent variables would be one in a million. In statistics, normal is often arbitrarily considered anything that falls within about 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, or the most average 95% (see 1.96). The probability of an individual being within 1.96 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> 269 independent variables is approximately one in a million. [...] For only 59 independent variables, the probability is just under 5%. [...] Under this definition of normal, it is abnormal to be normal for 59 independent variables.|$|E

50|$|The {{test was}} {{developed}} using {{a sample of}} responses from the comparison of 504 sets of results from a trial by students, taken from a larger sample of 950 first year university student responses.The test was then normed on a sample of 1044 males and 1870 females aged between 17 and 69 years, across participants of varying backgrounds, including university students, nurses in training and blue and white collared employees of a major airline, bank, railway workshop and naval dockyard. The scores were subsequently checked for validity against outpatient groups including patients suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders, insomniacs, myocardial infarction patients, as well as patients undergoing treatment for sexual, menopausal and depressive disorders. While the test was not normed against samples younger than 17, due to the simplicity of language, {{there has been no}} compelling evidence against the use of the scales for comparison against children as young as 12.The reliability scores of the scales in terms of Cronbach's alpha scores rate the Depression scale at 0.91, the Anxiety scale at 0.84 and the Stress scale at 0.90 in the normative sample. The means and <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> each scale are 6.34 and 6.97 for depression, 4.7 and 4.91 for anxiety and 10.11 and 7.91 for stress, respectively. The mean scores in the normative sample did vary slightly between genders as well as varying by age, though the threshold scores for classifications do not change by these variations. The Depression and Stress scales meet the standard threshold requirement of 0.9 for research, however, the Anxiety scale still meets the 0.7 threshold for clinical applications, and is still close to the 0.9 required for research.|$|E
