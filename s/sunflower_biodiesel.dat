40|$|The {{synthesis}} of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from sunflower oil and methanol was studied {{in a continuous}} centrifugal contactor separator (CCCS) using sodium methoxide as the catalyst. The effect of relevant process variables like oil and methanol flow rate, rotational speed and catalyst concentration was investigated and modelled using non-linear regression. Good agreement between experiments and model were obtained. At optimised conditions (oil flow rate of 31 mL/min, rotational speed of 34 Hz, catalyst concentration of 1. 2 %w/w and a methanol flow rate of 10 mL/min), the FAME yield was 94 mol% at a productivity of 2470 kg (FAME) /m(reactor) (3). h. Proof of principle for the synthesis and subsequent refining of FAME in a cascade of two CCCS devices was also obtained. Relevant properties of the refined FAME obtained using this technology were determined and were shown to meet the ASTM specifications. Practical application: Synthesis and refining of <b>sunflower</b> <b>biodiesel</b> was successfully performed in a cascade of two CSSS devices. Besides for large scale biodiesel production, this technology has particularly potential to be applied in small mobile biodiesel units due to the compact size, robustness, flexibility in operation, and high volumetric productivity of the CCCS devices.

40|$|The European Union Renewable Energy Directive 2009 / 28 /EC (RED) {{has adopted}} climate change {{assessment}} {{as one of}} the environmental criteria used to evaluate the level of sustainability by indicating the impact values for every phase of the biofuel chain. This paper shows the results of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cultivation of sunflower for biodiesel production in Tuscany, Italy. In the five case studies, the GHG emissions of sunflower cultivation exceed the default value (18 g [CO 2 eq] MJ - 1) indicated by the RED. This is mainly due to diesel consumption and emissions from nitrogen fertilisers that are on average 180 % and 255 % higher than the reference values, respectively. GHG emissions allocation among <b>sunflower</b> <b>biodiesel</b> and co-products was made according to energy content principle. Only the biodiesel from sunflower cultivated in the two most efficient farms achieved a GHG saving with respect to conventional diesel (36 %) that made it possible to fulfil the RED's requirements. From these results, it seems that the observance of such requirements on GHG emissions for <b>sunflower</b> <b>biodiesel</b> cultivation phase in Tuscany will not be easy to satisfy without a significant revision of local farm practices, aimed primarily at reducing the use of nitrogen fertilisers and diesel consumption. In fact, the GHG emissions reported in the RED for sunflower cultivation were calculated using excessively low farm inputs compared with the typical amounts for sunflower cultivation practices in Tuscan...|$|E
40|$|The higher is {{the degree}} of {{unsaturation}} in ester chain of a biodiesel, the smaller is its oxidation stability. <b>Sunflower</b> <b>biodiesel</b> obtained by the ethyl route possesses a high amount of unsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleic acid (C 18 : 1) and linoleic acid (C 18 : 2), thus being more prone to the oxidation process. In Brazil, {{with the purpose of}} meeting the specifications of the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), antioxidant additives, from synthetic and natural origins, {{have been added to the}} biofuel. Antioxidants are an alternative to prevent the oxidative deterioration of the fatty acid derivatives, as they are substances able to reduce the oxidation rate. In this study, the oxidative stability of <b>sunflower</b> <b>biodiesel,</b> obtained by the ethyl route and additivated with different concentrations of the antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and t-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), was evaluated by means of Pressure differential scanning calorimetry (P-DSC) and the Accelerated oxidative stability test (Rancimat, Method EN 14112). The results obtained by the two techniques showed the same oxidation tendency. Thus, P-DSC can be used as an alternative to determine the oxidative stability of biodiesel. The antioxidant TBHQ, added to biodiesel at the concentrations of 2000 and 2500 mg kg- 1, raised the oxidation induction time to a value higher than 6 h, the limit established by the Resolution ANP number 7 / 2008, thus being the best alternative among the studied antioxidants...|$|E

In grade A raw glycerol, the growth inhibition was reduced from 85. 25 ± 0. 35 to 32 ± 1. 4 % (about 53. 2 % reduction) at 40 g glycerol L - 1 by giving a two times washing to grade A raw glycerol with n-hexanol (grade A- 2).

40|$|Biofuels have {{demonstrated}} great promise for global energy production. In the United States, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS 2) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) {{calls for the}} production of 15. 2 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year by 2013, 1. 28 billion gallons of which need to be biomass-based diesel. Increased biofuel production can help meet rising energy demands, however most biofuel production processes are land- and nutrient-intensive, and must be managed throughout the life cycle to ensure sustainability. The goal of this dissertation was to evaluate industrial symbiosis as a sustainable approach to U. S. biofuel and energy production by creating a framework using GIS that integrates the spatial implications of land and nutrient supply. Defined by the synergistic collaboration of industries enabled by geographic proximity, industrial symbiosis is a key element in resource conservation, as it uses traditionally defined waste outputs as resource inputs. Four systems were examined in this dissertation: a coupled wastewater-power plant system, a <b>sunflower</b> <b>biodiesel</b> production system using urban marginal land, a national biodiesel production system using contaminated waste sites, and an algal biodiesel production system using wastewater and waste CO 2. Results from the wastewater-power plant system indicated that secondary-treated wastewater can provide cooling water to power plants, however traditional metrics and tools used to evaluate sustainability are inadequate for such complexity. Spatial assessment is needed to efficiently design transportation and conveyance within the system. Two land-identification frameworks were created using GIS to identify regional and national “waste” lands, or marginal lands, and to evaluate these lands for sunflower, soybean, and algal biodiesel production. A nutrient-availability framework was also created to identify synergistic opportunities for algal biodiesel production.

However, the food-fuel debate over conventional vegetable oils has rekindled research interest in exploring lesser known and minor oil crops. In this work, egusi melon seed oil was studied {{for the first time as}} a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. Crude egusi melon seed oil was transesterified using sodium methoxide as the catalyst at 60 °C and an oil/methanol ratio of 1 : 6 to produce its corresponding methyl esters. Egusi melon oil methyl ester (EMOME) yield was 82 %.

Pots irrigated with freshwater received commercial fertilizer, containing N, P, and K, applied {{at the beginning of}} each irrigation period. The results obtained in this study showed that irrigation with effluent did not result in significant changes in soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and dehydrogenase activity, whereas soil available P was found to increase in the upper soil layer. Soil salinity varied slightly throughout the experiment in effluent irrigated pots but no change was detected at the end of the experiment compared to the initial value, suggesting sufficient salt leaching. Pots irrigated with effluent had higher soil salinity, P, and dehydrogenase activity but lower SOM and TKN than freshwater irrigated pots. Sunflower showed greater SOM and TKN values than castor bean suggesting differences between plant species in the microorganisms carrying out C and N mineralization in the soil. Plant species irrigated with freshwater achieved higher seed yield compared to those irrigated with effluent probably reflecting the lower level of soil salinity in freshwater irrigated pots.

40|$|The guiding {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{empirical}} analysis of recent food price behavior. It is composed of three applied studies that address the impacts of energy prices on both food price levels and volatility, {{as well as the}} impact of public information release on futures markets of major agricultural commodities. Non-structural time series econometric techniques are applied for such purpose. In the first chapter, the impact of the Spanish biodiesel industry on agricultural feedstock prices is investigated. Both price level and volatility interactions are evaluated. Three relevant prices are considered: the international crude oil price, the Spanish biodiesel blend price and the Spanish sunflower oil price. Weekly Prices are observed from November 2006 to October 2010, yielding a total of 205 observations. Blended <b>biodiesel,</b> <b>sunflower</b> and crude oil prices are found to be interrelated in the long-run. This parity is preserved by the biodiesel industry in order to be in equilibrium. The impact of <b>biodiesel</b> on <b>sunflower</b> oil price levels is found to be very modest, which is reasonable given the small size of the Spanish biodiesel industry. Volatility spillovers between <b>sunflower</b> and <b>biodiesel</b> markets are found to be significant. Evidence of asymmetries in price volatility patterns is also found, with price declines causing more price instability than price increases. Asymmetries can be triggered by the availability of alternative feedstocks in the market, {{as well as by the}} unwillingness of biodiesel producers to increase food prices when feedstocks become more expensive. In the second chapter, the impact of the EU biodiesel market on agricultural feedstock prices is analyzed. The study comprises the period between 06 / 11 / 2008 to 14 / 06 / 2012, and is based on 189 weekly prices. Cointegration analysis suggests that the three prices have a long-run equilibrium relationship that is preserved by the pure biodiesel price. Biodiesel prices are not found to have an effect on rapeseed oil prices. Volatility of pure biodiesel price is affected by its own past volatility and past pure biodiesel and rapeseed market shocks. Also, evidence is found of asymmetries in price volatility, with negative market shocks having a greater impact than positive ones. While pure biodiesel prices cannot affect rapeseed oil price-levels, they can bring instability to these prices. Inventory building and the euro-dollar exchange rate are found to be relevant risk management instruments that can be used to mitigate the biodiesel and rapeseed oil price volatilities. In the third chapter, the impact of public information in the form of USDA-NASS crop production reports on daily corn and soybeans futures prices is evaluated. The study period is between 1970 to 2004, with a total of 700 observations. Results show that USDA-NASS crop production reports significantly affect futures price levels. Report releases at the beginning and at the end of the harvest season are usually the ones exerting a stronger impact. Report releases are not however found to have an effect on price volatility, which suggests gradual price-level changes as a response to published information.

40|$|AbstractAs {{demand for}} {{alternatives}} to petroleum fuels increases to meet renewable fuel policy requirements (an attempt to address {{global climate change}} concerns) both agricultural production of biofuel feedstock and feedstock-to-fuel conversion pathways must be examined for both energy efficiency and sustainability. The overarching agricultural method evaluated in this research is that of cultivating low-input biofuel feedstock on marginal lands. With {{a growing body of}} literature on sunflower crops cultivated on marginal land, as well as previous work by these researchers, describing positive overall outcomes, this study extended the scope of that previous research conducted by this group, specifically, examining low-input sunflower feedstock production on abandoned mine lands in the Appalachia, and subsequent feedstock conversion to diesel fuel alternatives. The previous life cycle assessment (LCA) demonstrated that growing sunflower feedstock on a specific abandoned coal mine refuse pile in Appalachia for production of biodiesel would be environmentally sound and net-energy positive if conducted with low input agricultural practices, and if production continues five years after initial soil amelioration [1]. This LCA normalized the data and generalized the method in order to apply them to over 1000 coal mine refuse piles in three Appalachian states located through global information systems (GIS). Additionally, this study included two conversion pathways for diesel replacement biofuels, namely transesterification of <b>sunflower</b> oilseed for <b>biodiesel</b> production – included in the original LCA – and fast pyrolysis of sunflower silage for green diesel production – new to this study. The results of this study indicate when cultivating <b>sunflower</b> feedstock for <b>biodiesel</b> production on the average coal refuse pile in the Appalachian region produce approximately 11. 6 barrels of biodiesel, plus 18. 5 barrels of green diesel, with a similar environmental impact landscape to that of the specific site explored in the original LCA. Including the additional biofuel pathway of fast pyrolysis does alter the energy return outlook for the average Appalachian site, depending on the transportation distances and yields, the energy return varies greatly between sites, however overall environmental impacts only increase nominally. Site by site evaluation should be conducted before implementation to ensure the benefits outweigh negative impacts and a positive energy return is achieved. Because of the approximately 32 thousand barrels per year of renewable diesel biofuel which could be produced from 6642 ha of coal refuse piles in only three states, it is highly recommended that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) consider expanding the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to include biofuel production on marginal land for Renewable Identification Number (RIN) assignment...|$|R
40|$|The sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., {{is one of}} the world’s major oilseed crops. Sunflower oil {{contains}} a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids than other vegetable oils and is therefore useful as a raw material in the production of biodiesel oil. The technology for processing <b>sunflower</b> oil into <b>biodiesel</b> oil has recently been developed; consequently, the importance of the sunflower is increasing. Despite the importance of this plant, effective methods for sunflower transformation have not yet been established. Although many {{attempts have been made to}} establish plant regeneration and gene transformation systems for the sunflower, only a limited number of reports have described successful transformation in this species. The transient expression of foreign genes, such as the GUS reporter gene, has been accomplished following the direct transfer of genes into sunflower protoplasts (Kirches et al. 1991) and particle bombardment into tissues (Schenk et al. 1999, 2001). In addition, transgenic calli and tumors containing the GUS gene have been obtained by direct gene introduction into protoplasts (Moyne et al. 1989) and infection of tissues with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Czarnecka et al. 1992). These methods, however, have not been used to successfully generate transgenic sunflower plants. Shoot regeneration systems have been used to produce transgenic sunflower plants. Specifically, transgenic shoots have been regenerated from mature, immature or germinated seeds infected with A. tumefacien...|$|R
40|$|Bio-diesel, {{derived from}} the {{transesterification}} of vegetable oils or animal fats with simple alcohols, has attracted more and more attention recently. As a cleaner burning diesel alternative, bio-diesel claims to have many attractive features including: biodegradability, nontoxicity, renewability and low emission profiles. Free fatty acid (FFA) esterification and triglyceride (TG) transesterification with low alcohols molar ratio are the central reactions for the bio-diesel production. This study presents an experimental investigation into the effects of running biodiesel fuel and its blends on conventional diesel engines. Bio-fuels provide a way to produce fuels without redesigning any of the engine technology present today, yet allowing for green house emissions to decrease. Bio-diesel {{is one of these}} types of emerging bio-fuels, which has an immediate alternative fuel, while providing a decrease in green house gas emissions, as well as a solution to recycling used Waste Vegetable Oils which are otherwise disposed. This study shows how by blending bio-diesel with petroleum diesel at intervals of B 5, B 10, B 15, and B 20 decrease green house gas emissions significantly while maintaining similar performance output and efficiency with respect to 100 % petroleum diesel. The focus of this research is to optimize the biodiesel production from crude sunflower oil. The effect of variables including methanol/oil molar ratio, NaOH catalyst concentration, reaction time, reaction temperature, and rate of mixing on the bio-diesel yield was examined and optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Besides, a second-order model was deduced to predict the biodiesel yield. Confirmation experiment was further conducted, validating the efficacy of the model. Transesterification of sunflower oil was carried out using low molecular weight alcohols and sodium hydroxide. For sunflower oil, a central composite design with eight factorial, six center and six axial points was used to study the effect of catalyst concentration, molar ratio of methanol to sunflower oil and reaction temperature on percentage yield of the biodiesel. Catalyst concentration and molar ratio of methanol to sunflower oil were the most influential variables affecting percentage conversion and percentage initial absorbance. Maximum percentage yield of 95 % is predicted at a catalyst concentration of 1. 1 % (wt/wt) and methanol to sunflower oil molar ratio of 6. 8 : 1 at reaction time of 66 min and temperature of 35 °C. In general, the <b>sunflower</b> oil <b>biodiesel</b> exhibited friendly environmental benefits and acceptable stability, demonstrating its feasibility as an alternative fuel.

40|$|The {{attendance}} of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) in Greek and European energy balance is considerable strengthened {{in the last}} decade. In our days, biodiesel production is worldwide based on vegetable oils like soy bean oil, rapeseed oil and <b>sunflower</b> oil. However, <b>biodiesel</b> production is a fairly expensive process with its feedstock comprising the major cost. For this reason the investigation for new low cost competitive feedstock is important. Waste tallow utilization has also the advantage that does not compete with the food supply chain and has a higher sustainability rating due to waste recycling. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the utilization of animal fats from Greek slaughter residues and meat processing units as a potential low cost alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. The main objective of this research was to assess the base catalyzed processes to produce biodiesel using waste tallow. The tallow oil was purified in order to reduce the free fatty acids (FFAs) and water content. The dehydration was carried out under vacuum, while acid esterification process with sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) as catalyst was applied for the reduction of FFAs content. The transesterification reactions for FAME production were carried out at 65 °C with anhydrous methanol in various methanol-to-oil molar ratios (from 6 : 1 to 15 : 1), using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as catalyst in concentrations from 0. 5 %, up to 3 % w/w. Optimum reaction conditions were examined and the quality and properties of the biodiesel product were evaluated through determination of the parameters according to EN 14214 European Standard...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{investigation}} into the feasibility of using <b>sunflower</b> oil based <b>biodiesel</b> blends as alternatives to fossil diesel fuel. The current global reliance on fossil fuels {{is coming to an}} end. This is driven on one hand by the dwindling global fossil fuel reserves and the understanding of the consequences of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere on the other. Dwindling reserves continue to drive global fuel prices upwards with negative effects on economic performance. Continued accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is perceived to be responsible for the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) effect. This dual problem can be addressed by using alternative renewable fuel sources, which guarantee continued supply while maintaining global carbon neutrality. Biofuels are now largely recognized as viable options. Some of the challenges of using biodiesel in conventional diesel engines are their low density, which leads to low calorific value and acidity levels that threatens the structural integrity of the engine. Blending biodiesel with petroleum diesel can mitigate these effects and lead to better performing fuels. Fuel characterization is therefore essential to establishing notable similarities and differences between biodiesel and fossil diesel, and in determining optimum blending proportions for more effective use of biodiesels. In this investigation, biodiesel was produced from commercial sunflower cooking oil using the batch trans-esterification process with methanol in the presence of Sodium hydroxide catalyst. The characterization of the biodiesel was then conducted using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), bomb calorimetry, acidity and flash point analysis, sulphur content tests and Gas Chromatography (GC). Blends ranging between 5 % and 50 % biodiesel concentration in Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel (ULSD), in increments of 5 % were analyzed. Results obtained confirmed that biodiesel has lower calorific value than ULSD, implying higher fuel consumption. The high flash point, almost at a temperature twice as high as that of ULSD, though advantageous for storage and transportation, results in poor ignition. The results also suggest that an increase in concentration of biodiesel leads to larger difference in properties between the blend and the ULSD. The pH value of biodiesel was found to be lower than that of ULSD which compromises engine structural integrity. Biodiesel’s chain length was found to contain an average of 19 carbons which makes it a viable option when compared to ULSD. Despite the relatively inferior properties measured, biodiesel still {{remains one of the most}} attractive fuel options...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in global demand {{for renewable energy}} has encouraged, both directly and indirectly, the production of oilseeds, including sunflower, as feedstocks for biodiesel. In this scenario, Brazil stands out for its excellent agronomic and climatic conditions for growing these crops throughout its territory. However, there is still little information about the sustainability of the biodiesel production chain, depending on the source of raw materials and inputs, the rural context and the region where it is produced. Faced with these questions, this study aimed at evaluating the social and environmental impacts, both along the production chain of <b>biodiesel</b> obtained from <b>sunflower,</b> and at the rural establishment level, in the reference context of southern Minas Gerais state, Southeast Brazil. The methodology involved application of two impact assessment tools: a) the ?Base System for Eco-certification of rural activities' (Eco-cert. Rural) ? comprised of 24 criteria and 125 indicators for performance evaluation at the value-chain level (gathering 19 experts with knowledge of different links in the biodiesel chain within the studied area) and b) "System of Environmental Impact Assessment of Rural Activities" (APOIA-NovoRural), comprised of 62 sustainability indicators applied to the rural establishment scale (through a detailed field survey / interview involving a reference sunflower producer). The {{study was conducted in}} November 2009 and information from the interviews were inserted directly into the weighting matrices of the systems, automatically expressing the results in graphs for partial and final environmental impact index of the activity, that for the system APOIA-NovoRural varies between 0 and 1 (as the limit of sustainability, taking the value 0. 7). According to the experts, the results of the insertion of <b>sunflower</b> for <b>biodiesel</b> production (in no-till system, following corn crop) promoted positive social and environmental impacts. The highlights were the criteria for producer training, income generation, food security and institutional relations. In the ecological dimension, not all indicators were favorable, mainly due to increased demand for inputs and sources of energy, while others had positive performance such as soil quality, biodiversity and environmental recovery. So to give this result in a rural area, the study APOIA-NovoRural system showed, in general results/trends similar to those obtained for the chain, with some significant discrepancies. Benefits were observed for management aspects (0. 80, in a 0 - 1 utility scale) and economic values (0. 82), which increased income and investment capacity on the farm. Still, social values changed little with the activity (0. 71), which contradicts the opinion of chain experts. In terms of environmental performance indicators, the inclusion of sunflower has provided positive impacts on water quality (0. 92), atmosphere (0. 85) and for the production system, the experts disagreeing only for soil quality, which presented unsatisfactory result (0. 68), denoting low fertility. This result was a point of alert for the farmer, who received recommendations for soil fertility correction before starting a new sunflower crop. This oilseed requires good nutrition and does not tolerate low pH. The experts who evaluated the biodiesel chain did not identify this. Thus, at the scale of the rural establishment, the insertion of an additional culture (late season) without a good management and technical support should impact negatively the soil quality, even though other environmental and economic positive aspects were observed. It is possible to conclude that the insertion of sunflower, stimulated by the biodiesel program, showed positive impacts for rural establishment, with a final performance index of 0. 77. However, some aspects such as social benefits were not fully noted. This result points to the need of public actions for the effective implementation of the government guidelines in the Brazilian Program for Biodiesel Production and Use, which has social values as one of the pillars of sustainability. This kind of study subsidizes the elaboration of regional public policies that promote the sustainable development of the biodiesel production chain generated by sunflower oilseed. 201...|$|R
