500|$|In {{preparing}} for their mission, {{in addition to}} the usual Apollo spacecraft training, Young and Duke, along with backup commander Fred Haise, underwent an extensive geological training program that included several field trips to introduce them to concepts and techniques they would use in analyzing features and collecting samples on the lunar surface. During these trips, they visited and provided scientific descriptions of geologic features they were likely to encounter. In July 1971, they visited Sudbury, Ontario, Canada for geology training exercises, the first time U.S. astronauts did so. Geologists chose the area because of a [...] wide crater created about 1.8 billion years ago by a large meteorite. The Sudbury Basin shows evidence of <b>shatter</b> <b>cone</b> geology familiarizing the Apollo crew with geologic evidence of a meteor impact. During the training exercises the astronauts did not wear space suits, but carried radio equipment to converse with each other and scientist-astronaut Anthony W. England, practicing procedures they would use on the lunar surface.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new model for the {{formation}} of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones.</b> The model follows earlier suggestions that <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> are initiated by heterogeneities in the rock, but does not require the participation of an elastic precursor wave: the conical fractures are initiated after the passage of the main plastic compression pulse, not before. Numerical simulations using the hydrocode SALE 2 D, enhanced by the Grady-Kipp-Melosh fragmentation model, support the model. The conditions required {{for the formation of}} <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> are explored numerically and are found to be consistent with the pressure range derived from both explosion experiments and the analysis of shock metamorphic features in impact structures. This model permits us to deduce quantitative information about the shape of the shock wave from the shape and size of the observed <b>shatter</b> <b>cones.</b> Indeed, the occurrence of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> is correlated with the ratio between the width of the compressive pulse {{and the size of the}} heterogeneity that initiates the conical fracture. The apical angles of the <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> are controlled by the shape of the rarefaction wave. ...|$|R
40|$|Associations between impact {{structures}} and meteorite occurrences are rare and restricted to very young structures. Meteorite fragments are often disrupted in the atmosphere, {{and in most}} cases, meteorite falls that have been decelerated by atmospheric drag do not form a crater. Furthermore, meteorites are rapidly weathered. In this context, the finding of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> in Jurassic marly limestone in the same location as a recent (105 +/- 40 ka) iron meteorite fall {{near the village of}} Agoudal (High Atlas Mountains, Morocco) is enigmatic. The <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> are the only piece of evidence of a meteorite impact in the area. The overlap of a meteorite strewn field with the area of occurrence of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> led previous researchers to consider that the meteorite fall was responsible for the formation of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> in the context of formation of one or several small (< 100 m) impact craters that had since been eroded. <b>Shatter</b> <b>cones</b> are generally not reported in association with subkilometer-diameter impact craters. Here, we present new field observations and an analysis of the distribution and characteristics of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones,</b> breccia, and meteorites in the Agoudal area. Evidence for local deformation not related to the structural High Atlas tectonics has been observed, such as a vertical to overturned stratum trending N 150 -N 160. New outcrops with exposures of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> are reported and extend the previously known area of occurrence. The area of in situ <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> (similar to 0. 15 km(2)) and the strewn field of meteorites are distinct, although they show some overlap. The alleged impact breccia is revealed as calcrete formations. No evidence for a genetic relationship between the <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> and the meteorites can be inferred from field observations. The extent of the area where in situ <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> and macrodeformation not corresponding to Atlas tectonic deformation are observed suggest that the original diameter of an impact structure could have been between at least 1 - 3 km. For typical erosion rates in the Atlas region (similar to 0. 08 cm yr(- 1)), the period of time required for the erosion of such a structure (1. 25 - 3. 75 Ma) is much larger than the age of the meteorite fall. This line of reasoning excludes a genetic link between the <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> and the meteorite fall and indicates that the observed <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> belong to an ancient impact structure that has been almost entirely eroded...|$|R
40|$|<b>Shatter</b> <b>cones</b> are the {{characteristic}} forms of rock fractures in impact structures. They {{have been used}} for decades as unequivocal fingerprints of meteoritic impacts on Earth. The abundant data about shapes, apical angles, sizes and distributions of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> for many terrestrial impact structures should provide insights for the determination of impact conditions and characteristics of shock waves produced by high-velocity projectiles in geologic media. However, previously proposed models for the formation of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> do not agree with observations. For example, the widely accepted Johnson-Talbot mechanism requires that the longitudinal stress drops to zero between the arrival of the elastic precursor and the main plastic wave. Unfortunately, observations do not support such a drop. A model has been also proposed to explain the striated features on the surface of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> but can not invoked for their conical shape. The mechanism by which <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> form thus remains enigmatic to date. In this paper we present a new model for the formation of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones.</b> Our model has been tested by means of numerical simulations using the hydrocodes SALE 2 D enhanced with the Grady-Kipp-Melosh fragmentation model...|$|R

40|$|While <b>shatter</b> <b>cones</b> are {{generally}} accepted {{as indicators of}} meteorite impact, older petrologic features are not widely recognized in the geologic community. Breccia dikes are one such feature. They are found in many large impact structures occurring over an area at least as extensively as <b>shatter</b> <b>cones.</b> Breccia dikes will survive moderate degrees of metamorphism and tectonism, unlike many other microscopic features (shocked quartz grains, high-pressure polymorphs, etc.) and even large-scale features such as annular or bowl-shaped topographic features. Thus, they are important diagnostic criteria, especially for large, poorly preserved impact structures. The Beaverhead Impact structure is a recently discovered, deeply eroded impact structure in southwestern Montana. The remains of the structure are delineated by the occurrence of <b>shatter</b> <b>cones,</b> found in an area greater than 200 sq km, occurring within the Cabin thrust plate, part of the Cretaceous Sevier fold and thrust system.

50|$|Before Apollo 16 sampled the Descartes Highlands, it was {{believed}} that volcanic material would be abundant in the area after visual analysis of the features there. It was thought that the formations in the area were formed by lavas more viscous than the lavas that formed the Lunar mare. This was later disproved after the analysis of samples from the area. It was revealed that many of the rocks in the area are not volcanic in origin, but breccias composed of fragments from several lunar impacts. Astronauts Young and Duke visited Sudbury, Ontario Canada in July 1971 to examine shatter cones. Sudbury is a site of a large meteor impact exhibiting substantial evidence of <b>shatter</b> <b>cone</b> geology. In the Descartes Highlands, it was determined that the region's topography was formed by meteor impact instead of volcanic activity.|$|E

Only one out of eight ureilites studied (the North Haig ureilite) by this group contained suessite. Most contained trace amounts of kamacite which is the mineral from which Suessite is formed. In this particular study, the meteorite that contained suessite contained the highest amounts of shock metamorphism, which can be determined from {{the size of a}} <b>shatter</b> <b>cone</b> created from the impact. This could mean that suessite is formed due to the extreme increase in temperature combined with reduction of silicate rims, shortly followed by a rapid decrease in temperature. This means that, in meteorites, the abundance of suessite can be used to identify deformation associated with shock metamorphism, which could be used to determine various characteristics of the studied meteorites.|$|E
50|$|Amelia Creek crater is {{an impact}} {{structure}} (or astrobleme), the eroded remnant {{of a former}} impact crater, located in the Davenport Range, Northern Territory, Australia. It lies within a low range of Paleoproterozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, which are extensively folded and faulted, thus making an eroded impact crater difficult to recognize. It was only discovered by the identification of shatter cones near its centre. The central <b>shatter</b> <b>cone</b> locality {{is surrounded by a}} 20 by 12 km area of anomalous deformation, the asymmetry being possibly related to very oblique impact, but may be at least partly due to the pre-existing structural complexity of the rocks. This deformed zone gives the best estimate for the original size of the crater. Impact took place after folding of the Paleoproterozoic rocks but before deposition of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian rocks which overlie them, thus constraining the impact event to the interval between about 1660 and 600 Ma.|$|E
50|$|It is 5.5 mi in {{diameter}} and covers an area of approximately 25 sq mi. The age {{is estimated to be}} less than 280 million years (Permian or younger). The crater is buried beneath 75 to 200 feet (23 - 60 m) of glacial till and can only be seen as a series of faults and deformations in well logs and seismic surveys. Faulting in the structure has produced as much as 600 ft of vertical displacement. Subsurface strata of Cambrian through Pennsylvanian age has been faulted and tilted by the event. The anomalous area was first noted by water well drillers in 1893, who noted an absence of water in a 1600 ft deep well. Prior to being recognized as an impact structure, the feature was referred to as a cryptoexplosion structure or cryptovolcanic structure, as were several others in the Midwestern United States. The upfaulted central portion and the presence of <b>shatter</b> <b>cone</b> structures support the impact origin.|$|E
