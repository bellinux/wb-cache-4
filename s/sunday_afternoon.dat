On the final day 221,554 visitors added to the more than 50 million (50,306,648) that attended Expo 67 at a time when Canada's population was only 20 million, setting a per-capita record for World Exhibition attendance that still stands.|$|E

5|$|The Hunyani was on {{the second}} and final leg of its regular {{scheduled}} journey between Victoria Falls and Salisbury, stopping over in the resort town of Kariba. Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on Kariba by ZIPRA guerrillas on the northern side of the Zambezi (in Zambia), the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia's choice tourist destinations. The flight on 3 September 1978, <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers, {{most of whom were}} holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake.

5|$|By <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E
5|$|Presenters on {{the station}} include many notable British radio personalities. The breakfast show was hosted by Simon Bates, who joined the network in January 2011.

Former LBC 97.3 presenter Anthony Davis joined the station as its Drivetime presenter from January 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is {{the fifth}} heat in which the {{remaining}} four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semifinal (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semifinal performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon</b> after the fourth semifinal. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semifinals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, tens of {{thousands}} of tourists and residents were evacuated from the beach resorts in and around Cancún, the Riviera Maya, and Cozumel. Hotel guests were evacuated on Saturday afternoon, and staff on <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Though some hotel guests in second floor rooms and above were given the option to be bussed into the center of Cancun to safe houses and shelters or to stay and wait out the storm in only the modern built hotels and resorts. Most of the remaining guests were restricted to their rooms and were not allowed out on the beach areas. No alcohol was sold in Cancun for 36hours prior to the arrival of the storm, in an attempt to avoid drunken tourists being injured during the night. Two helicopter pilots were killed when their aircraft crashed while evacuating offshore oil platforms operated by Pemex. A German resident was electrocuted while on his roof in Playa del Carmen.|$|E
5|$|On January 2, 2014, the Phillies and Comcast Sportsnet {{announced}} a 25-year, $2.5billion TV contract; although it averaged $100million a year, it was structured to begin below the average and end above it. Soon after {{the agreement was}} reached, Comcast (who would hire announcers under the deal) removed 37-year announcer Chris Wheeler and seven-year announcer Gary Matthews. Although the remaining Phillies announcers were disappointed with the decision, they all returned for the season. One replacement analyst was planned, and early candidates included Ricky Bottalico, Mitch Williams, John Kruk, Chris Coste, Jamie Moyer, Brad Lidge and Matt Stairs. Lidge and Kruk {{were among the first}} to be contacted, but both declined. Mickey Morandini was a possibility, but Stairs and Moyer reportedly interviewed well and were favored. On February 11, Comcast announced that Moyer and Stairs would join Tom McCarthy and Gregg Murphy on the Phillies' TV broadcast team. The company later announced that Moyer and Stairs would each call over 100 games, including 30 games together with McCarthy. After the first spring-training game, it was announced that Mike Schmidt would join the broadcast team for <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon</b> games.|$|E
5|$|On the Rauma Line, {{the units}} {{are used as}} feeders between the Oslo–Trondheim express trains on the Dovre Line, {{connecting}} Dombås to Åndalsnes. On the Røros Line, the trains are used both on the Hamar–Røros and the Røros–Trondheim section. On the Nordland Line, the Class 93 serves both the Ole Tobias service between Trondheim and Mo i Rana. The unit was considered for use on the Meråker Line as well, but this has continued to be operated by Class 92 units. The initial plan was that eight of the eleven units were needed for daily operations. Four on the Røros Line, two on the Nordland Line and two on the Rauma Line. The additional four units were needed for operating the Trondheim–Bodø trains on the Nordland Line, of which three would be used at any one time. Double units (four cars) are sometimes operated on the Trondheim – Mo i Rana train, as are the Friday and <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon</b> trains on the Rauma Line, for exchange of equipment, and to handle the increased traffic on these days. In addition, NSB uses the trains on the commuter services Bodø–Fauske–Rognan and Mo i Rana–Mosjøen.|$|E

5|$|Plans for an IndyCar Series race in Brazil were {{confirmed}} on 25 November 2009, with authorities in São Paulo and the Indy Racing League agreeing {{to a deal}} {{for the city to}} host the series. Race details for the São Paulo Indy 300 were announced on 25 January 2010. It was the first American open-wheel race in the country since the Rio 200 at Jacarepaguá in 2000. Despite a lengthy distance to travel from most team bases, the event promoters offered each team a six-figure sum of money, as well as paying for all expenses. A total of seven Brazilian drivers would compete in the race, including Ana Beatriz, Hélio Castroneves, Tony Kanaan, Raphael Matos, Vitor Meira, Mario Moraes and Mario Romancini. Of those seven, four drivers—Beatriz, Castroneves, Moraes and Romancini—are natives of São Paulo. The race weekend was scheduled to have two practice sessions on Saturday morning, qualifications on Saturday afternoon with the race on <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> In preparation for the race weekend, the public roads that made up areas of the track were closed off just before midnight on Friday evening.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{straight}} {{after finishing}} Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series {{in which he}} portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon</b> CBBC slot in 2003. He watched debates in the House of Commons {{to prepare for the}} role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair. In 2003, he returned to theatre {{for the first time in}} four years to play Vershinin in The Three Sisters, opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He had not seen The Three Sisters before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not feel he had to live up to previous portrayals. After its run concluded, a special edition of The Three Sisters was filmed with the same cast for television broadcast on BBC Four. In 2005, the second series of My Dad's the Prime Minister was broadcast, now moved to a Friday night time slot to take advantage of the adult humour. The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this white-collar worker had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a yardstick when accepting those sorts of roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{began their}} 2009 season {{in front of}} a sold-out crowd of 44,532 at Citizens Bank Park on April 5, playing against the Atlanta Braves. The Phillies, {{originally}} scheduled to play in the afternoon of April 6, earned the distinction of playing the opening game of the entire 2009 Major League Baseball season after winning the 2008 World Series. They lost the opener 4–1 to the division-rival Braves, whose new ace, Derek Lowe, pitched eight shutout innings. The Phillies lost the next game, and were in danger of losing the following night and dropping to 0–3 before scoring eight runs {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning for a 12–11 come-from-behind win. The Phillies lost their first game in Denver, but came from behind again in their next two games to take the second series from the Colorado Rockies. The Phillies defeated the Washington Nationals in the opener of their third series, just hours after the death of Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas, but lost the third scheduled game of the series after the second was cancelled due to weather. In their series against the San Diego Padres, the Phillies dropped the first two games as well; during the second game, closer Brad Lidge blew his first save in a Phillies uniform, breaking his streak of 47 consecutive saves extending back to the 2007 regular season. The Phillies won the <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon</b> matinee against the Padres, 5–4, on a walk-off home run by Ibáñez after trailing the entire game.|$|E
