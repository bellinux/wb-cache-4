5|$|Nafaryus hears a rumor about Gabriel {{being the}} <b>savior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people. He {{and his family}} travel to Ravenskill to see him for {{themselves}} ("Lord Nafaryus"). In the Ravenskill town square, Gabriel is performing for the people when the royal family shows up. He continues playing at the emperor's request ("A Savior in the Square"), nearly bringing them all to tears ("When Your Time Has Come"). As he plays, Faythe remembers how she found a music player {{when she was a}} child and kept it a secret all her life, and as she and Gabriel stare at each other and fall in love ("Act of Faythe"). Nafaryus, though briefly moved by Gabriel's song, sees him as a threat to his rule and gives the people of the town three days to deliver their savior to him or he will destroy the town ("Three Days"). Arhys hides his brother and refuses to give him up ("Brother, Can You Hear Me?").|$|E

Shiva, the fabled <b>savior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land of Meluha, rushes {{to save his}} wife Sati from the Naga, the {{supposed}} killer of Shiva's friend Brahaspati. The Naga escapes, leaving behind coins with strange engravings. After consulting with Sati's father Daksha and Dilipa, the king of Ayodhya, they come {{to know that the}} coin belongs to King Chandraketu, the ruler of the land of Branga in eastern India. Shiva and Sati travel to Kashi, where a community of Brangas inhabit, in order to get more information on the Nagas. They are accompanied in their journey by Shiva's General Parvateshwar, his associates Nandi and Veerbhadra, Ayurvati the doctor, and Bhagirath and Anandamayi, the prince and princess of Ayodhya. At Kashi, Parvateshwar gets mortally injured while trying to pacify a riot at the Branga community. The Branga leader Divodas administers a medicine on Parvateshwar; it works and the General is healed, but Shiva comes to know from Ayurvati that it contains herbs which is only available at Panchavati, the capital of the Nagas. He consults with Divodas and comes to know that Branga suffers from a mortal plague, which has led them to ally with the Nagas, in return for benefits. Shiva decides to travel to Branga but Divodas informs him that to reach there special ships need to be made, which would take about six months.|$|E

Just as African-American women lived lives that knew no such false divisions, so those active in national and local women 2 ̆ 7 s organizations drew upon their strength as mothers to argue for a legal equality that recognized their difference as black and female from the dominant white society. They offered an interpretation of political life that emphasized <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> women as <b>saviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, justifying their activity because they were mothers.

This paper investigates a few examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequent overlapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authorial voice <b>of</b> Callimachus with different Callimachean voices impersonating or allusively evoking a series of more or less peremptory figures—a literary critic in defense <b>of</b> his poetics, <b>the</b> vox populi, <b>the</b> director <b>of</b> a ritual for a god, the god himself, or a series <b>of</b> <b>saviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past.

25|$|The School of the Prophets {{spoken of}} in the book Under the Banner of Heaven claims revelation showing that Young was {{inaccurate}} in some points of his Adam–God teachings, but otherwise he was correct. The understanding from these revelations is that Jesus was the Only Begotten Son in {{the flesh of the}} <b>Savior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous Earth where the father of all Spirits, Michael/Adam, had his mortal probation. The lineage of Michael/Adam, which includes all but Jesus on this Earth, will never become saviors of worlds. Thus the Adam–God doctrine of Young is simply a fuller understanding of the New Testament doctrine of joint-heirs with Christ.|$|E

25|$|The Siege of Marienburg was an {{unsuccessful}} two-month siege {{of the castle}} in Marienburg (Malbork), {{the capital of the}} monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. The joint Polish and Lithuanian forces, under command of King Władysław II Jagiełło and Grand Duke Vytautas, besieged the castle between 26 July and 19 September 1410 in a bid of complete conquest of Prussia after the great victory in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg). However, the castle withstood the siege and the Knights conceded only to minor territorial losses in the Peace of Thorn (1411).

25|$|The Vishnu Sukta 1.154 of Rigveda {{says that}} {{the first and second}} of Vishnu's strides (those {{encompassing}} the earth and air) are visible to the mortals and the third is the realm of the immortals. The Trivikrama describing hymns integrate salvific themes, stating Vishnu to symbolize that which is freedom and life. The Shatapatha Brahmana elaborates this theme of Vishnu, as his herculean effort and sacrifice to create and gain powers that help others, one who realizes and defeats the evil symbolized by the Asuras after they had usurped the three worlds, and thus Vishnu is the <b>savior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mortals and the immortals (Devas).|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to notice {{that some of these}} individuals represent Christ as an impersonal force, e. g. Jesus, meaning that although he was an individual Christ, he taught the doctrine of the Cosmic Christ, intentionally molding his physical life after the psychological processes that one undergoes to incarnate the Christ. As with Buddha, Jesus is seen as a Bodhisattva who came to help humanity. Jesus is viewed as the <b>Savior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World because he is a Paramarthasatya (an inhabitant of the Absolute) that physically incarnated specifically for the sake of poor suffering humanity. According to Samael Aun Weor, Jesus purposefully played out physically the internal or psychological struggle one must undergo in the path of Self-Realization; thus, the Gospels are a mixture of reality and kabbalistic, initiatic symbolism.|$|E
40|$|Fishing {{down the}} food chain is a {{controversial}} issue that demands further exploration. Redfeed is a marine species located on the second to last level on the food web. It is also one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential <b>saviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aquaculture industry. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> effective management of this species is of utmost importance to avoid the potential catastrophe associated with its overharvesting. Using a calculation of behavioral effectiveness, a blueprint redfeed regime is compared with the Convention for <b>the</b> Conservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), an ecosystem-based management regime with the now famous krill as its key species. Though the regimes are similar in nature, their geopolitical differences suggest that a future redfeed regime will be effective even though CCAMLR has not been. Ensuring that the redfeed is not merely incorporated into existing regimes, but is treated separately in an ecosystem-based regime, will alleviate the interplay this future redfeed regime otherwise would encounter...|$|R
40|$|Many Western {{environmental}} activist {{groups and}} theorists have sounded {{the call for}} the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s salvation from the 2 ̆ 2 global environmental crisis. 2 ̆ 2 What is lacking, however, is some reflection on <b>the</b> ramifications <b>of</b> framing <b>the</b> problem globally, and on the justifications for particular solutions. This paper examines the 2 ̆ 2 ecomessiah 2 ̆ 2 (<b>saviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth) phenomenon to investigate <b>the</b> impacts <b>of</b> these types of programs. Specifically, we examine the 2 ̆ 2 global environmental ethic 2 ̆ 2 proposed by J. Baird Callicott. His program, presented as an inclusive system that incorporates non-Western belief systems, trades heavily on Western science as an authority and a justification. We contend that his ethic, while well-intentioned, rests on assumptions and uses of science that subvert both non-Western ideologies and non-Western interests rather than revere them. Consequently, the inherent flaws undermine the feel-good one-world rhetoric that he espouses...|$|R

Tewodros II furiously responded {{that he would never}} be taken prisoner. The British shelled Magdala, killing most of Tewodros II's remaining loyal men. The emperor committed suicide on Easter Monday, April 13, 1868, as the British troops stormed the citadel of Magdala.
