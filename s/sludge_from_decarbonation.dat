40|$|This study {{relates to}} the {{application}} of mineral wastes and by-products on cultivated land. Since there is a critical lack of data on mineral wastes and by-products used for application on cultivated land regarding type, amount and composition {{the objectives of the}} study are as follows: identification of wastes and by-products applied on cultivated land, assessment of quantities of the identified wastes/by-products and of the amounts applied on cultivated land, collection of information regarding material properties of such wastes and by-products and establishment of a data base. The study shows that at present at least 3 mil. tons of mineral wastes and by-products are applied on cultivated land. Particularly wastes and by-products are employed which are resulting from sugar processing (calcium carbonate sludge), water supply (dredging spoil), exploration of quarry (fractions of minor quality, mineral powder), chemical industry (ammonium sulphate, various limy residues), treatment of water for industrial use (<b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> <b>decarbonation)</b> and iron and steel production (blast furnace cinder and converter slug). In view of detrimental effects of substances as applied on cultivated land substantial efforts for legal regulations are required. (orig.)

40|$|Category 2 animal {{by-products}} {{that need to}} be sterilized with steam pressure according Regulation (EC) 1774 / 2002 are studied. In this work, 2 sets of experiments were performed in mesophilic conditions: (i) biomethane potential determination testing 0. 5 %, 2. 0 % and 5. 0 % total solids (TS), using <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> the anaerobic digester of a wastewater treatment plant as inoculum; (ii) biodegradability tests at a constant TS concentration of 2. 0 % and different inoculum sources (digested <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> a wastewater treatment plant; granular <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor; leachate from a municipal solid waste landfill; and <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> the slaughterhouse wastewater treatment anaerobic lagoon) to select the more adapted inoculum to the substrate in study. The higher specific methane production was of 317 mL CH 4 g− 1 VSsubstrate for 2. 0 % TS. The digested <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> the wastewater treatment plant led to the lowest lag-phase period and higher methane potential rate.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} verify the {{potential}} of urban solid wastes as substrate for production of seedlings of Lafoensia pacari. Five treatments were tested, four with solid wastes and one standard substrate, namely: sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> Alegria Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTP); sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> Ilha do Governador WTP; sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> Sarapuí WTP; domestic garbage compost (Fertlurb); and a commercial substrate made of biostabilized pine bark (standard substrate). The wastes received 20 % (in volume) of shredded coconut fiber. At 105 days after sowing, the seedlings were evaluated for different quality parameters. Seedlings produced with Sarapuí WTP sewage sludge showed the best results in all the parameters, followed by seedlings produced with sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> Alegria and Ilha do Governador WTPs, which did not differ. Seedlings produced with domestic garbage compost showed satisfactory results, higher than the ones observed for seedlings produced with commercial substrate. The urban solid wastes with 20 % of coconut fiber showed high potential and can be recommended for the composition of substrate {{in the production of}} Lafoensia pacari seedlings...|$|R

40|$|In this diploma I {{will present}} the {{possibilities}} of using sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> municipal wastewater treatmentplant. The initial part of the diploma are the official documents and various literature to describe {{what should be the}} future application of this type of waste and uses. The following thesis has described some common options of sewage sludge, and products that can be extracted <b>from</b> the sewage <b>sludge.</b> In addition I described restrictions on the parameters of <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> wastewater treatment plant that shall not exceed for a particular use. The final part of the diploma presents an analysis of <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> wastewater treatment plant Ivančna Gorica. Based on a sample of sludge was used to determine suitability for continued use of sludge and its potential use. These results will serve us, so we can remove mud in legal acceptable way. It is necessary to emphasize that in the past for this purpose, cost was not necessary large, because the mad was cart away on agricultural land. Now, legislation is so strict that the possibility of using sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> municipal wastewater treatment plant is very limited and associated with a high cost of municipal wastewater treatment plant operator itself. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of {{small amounts of}} well-stabilized biological sludge {{is one of the}} main advantages of upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactors over aerobic wastewater treatment systems. In this work, sludge produced in three pilot-scale UASB reactors used to treat sewage under subtropical conditions was assessed for both stability and specific methanogenic activity. Stability of primary <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> settling tanks and digested <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> conventional <b>sludge</b> digesters was also measured for comparison purposes. Kinetic parameters like the hydrolysis rate constant and the decay rate constant were calculated. High stability was observed in <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> UASB reactors. Methanogenic activity in anaerobic sludges was relatively low, probably due to the low organic matter concentration in influent sewage. Knowledge on sludge growth rate, stability, and activity might be very useful to optimize sludge management activities in full-scale UASB reactor...|$|R

40|$|Return <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> two Swedish and two Danish {{wastewater}} treatment plants were hydrolysed in laboratory reactors. Treatment plants with/without pre-sedimentation and with/without nitrification were represented. Soluble organic matter was produced from all types of sludge, but the yield was {{to a large extent}} dependent on what type of sludge was hydrolysed. Activated <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> {{wastewater treatment}} plants without pre-treatment returned more soluble carbon after hydrolysis than <b>sludge</b> <b>from</b> treatment plants with pre-sedimentation. In addition, more soluble carbon was formed <b>from</b> non-nitrifying activated <b>sludge</b> than <b>from</b> nitrifying <b>sludge.</b> Moreover, the maximum yield of soluble COD at 10 degrees C was less than the yield at 20 degrees C. The initial hydrolysis rate was found to be between 0. 35 and 1. 8 mg soluble COD/(g VS x h). With the exception of one case, between 15 and 50 % of the produced soluble COD was shown to be volatile fatty acids, a suitable carbon source for biological phosphorus removal. Nitrification rate measurements indicated that the viability of the activated sludge was not affected by the hydrolysis...|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} sewage <b>sludge</b> {{produced}} <b>from</b> the activated <b>sludge</b> process is {{directly proportional to}} the amount of wastewater treated.

In addition, about 110–170kg/ML of primary sludge is produced in the primary sedimentation tanks which most - but not all - of the activated sludge process configurations use.|$|R
