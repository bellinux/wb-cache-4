40|$|Purpose: The {{main idea}} of MSR {{technology}} is the capability of producing two, three, four and even five rods simultaneously from a single strip in a hot rolling process. Correctly separation of the joined strips is {{the one of the}} mainly problem in MSR process. Changing the rolling speed may causes easier of the strand division. In this paper results of the computer simulation of the double slitting rolling process were presented. Design/methodology/approach: For numerical modelling of the multi rolling process a computer program Forge 2005, based by the finished element method was used. As a slitting criterion normalised Cockroft – Latham criterion was used. Findings: For the analysis performed in this study, it was found that increasing of the rolling speed causes of increasing the normalized Cockroft – Latham criterion. For the small values of rolling velocity the strip separation was easier. Research limitations/implications: Multi Slit Rolling process is applied in ribbed rods rolling. Adjusting of the rolling speed in multi slit rolling process could improve of the <b>slitting</b> <b>band</b> to the separated strips. Originality/value: Incorrect construction or bad gap matching could cause lack of separation propelled slitting rolls. The separation of the band is effected by means of separating rollers, which shape must be properly designed to suit to the slitting pass. Changing of the rolling speed could improve of the separation to the single strips...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Basing on {{the results}} of {{computer}} simulations, {{it will be possible to}} choase proper technological parameters for the slitting rollers (such as shape), which will assure the <b>slitting</b> of the <b>band</b> and verify the force parameters. Design/methodology/approach: Using FEM-based computer programs for solving the problems of the theory of plasticity enables determining the force parameters during the band separation and enabled also the determination of the tools abrasive wear. Findings: Longitudinal band separation depends on the shape of the used slitting rollers. Increasing the roller opening angle has an effect on the force parameters and on the tools abrasive wear. Practical implications: The use of commercial software applications in the design of process technologies will allow for the development of a multi slit rolling technology with a minimum number of laboratory and industrial trials. Originality/value: Using the cracking (element removal) algorithm implemented in the Forge 3 ® program, it was possible to carry out the numerical modiling of the proces for rolling with <b>band</b> <b>slitting...</b>|$|R

The band's last live performance was in 1980 to a crowd of 500,000 people at Trafalgar Square as part of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament protest. They split in 1981, after legal wranglings and internal disagreements. Members of the group went on to collaborate and join bands including Pigbag, Maximum Joy, Head, the Slits and Rip Rig + Panic, the latter notable for the involvement of Neneh Cherry.

The data include a broad K– band image, an image in the H 2 vibrationally excited 1 – 0 S(1) line and K <b>band</b> <b>slit</b> spectra at three positions in the nebula. In the H 2 1 – 0 S(1) line, the nebula {{is characterized by a}} central, bright torus, surrounded by weaker emission with a typical butterfly shape, as seen in Hα and CO lines.

40|$|We {{have started}} a {{campaign}} to identify massive star clusters inside bright molecular bubbles towards the Galactic Center. The CN 15 / 16 / 17 molecular complex is the first example of our study. The region {{is characterized by the}} presence of two young clusters, DB 10 and DB 11, visible in the NIR, an ultra-compact HII region identified in the radio, several young stellar objects visible in the MIR, a bright diffuse nebulosity at 8 μ m coming from PAHs and sub-mm continuum emission revealing the presence of cold dust. Given its position on the sky (l= 0. 58, b=- 0. 85) and its kinematic distance of 7. 5 kpc, the region was thought to be a very massive site of star formation in proximity of the CMZ. The cluster DB 11 was estimated to be as massive as 10 ^ 4 M_sun. However the region's properties were known only through photometry and its kinematic distance was very uncertain given its location at the tangential point. We aimed at better characterizing the region and assess whether it could be a site of massive star formation located close to the Galactic Center. We have obtained NTT/SofI JHKs photometry and long <b>slit</b> K <b>band</b> spectroscopy of the brightest members. We have additionally collected data in the radio, sub-mm and mid infrared, resulting in a quite different picture of the region. We have confirmed the presence of massive early B type stars and have derived a spectro-photometric distance of 1. 2 kpc, much smaller than the kinematic distance. Adopting this distance we obtain clusters masses of M(DB 10) 170 M_sun and M(DB 11) 275 M_sun. This is consistent with the absence of any O star, confirmed by the excitation/ionization status of the nebula. No HeI diffuse emission is detected in our spectroscopic observations at 2. 113 μ m, which would be expected if the region was hosting more massive stars. Radio continuum measurements are also consistent with the region hosting at most early B stars. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

40|$|We {{present results}} from K <b>band</b> <b>slit</b> scan {{observations}} of a ~ 20 ''x 20 '' {{region of the}} Galactic center (GC) in two separate epochs {{more than five years}} apart. The high resolution (R>= 14, 000) observations allow the most accurate radial velocity and acceleration measurements of the stars in the central parsec of the Galaxy. Detected stars can be divided into three groups based on the CO absorption band heads at ~ 2. 2935 microns and the He I lines at ~ 2. 0581 microns and ~ 2. 112, 2. 113 microns: cool, narrow-line hot and broad-line hot. The radial velocities of the cool, late-type stars have approximately a symmetrical distribution with its center at ~- 7. 8 (+/- 10. 3) km/s and a standard deviation ~ 113. 7 (+/- 10. 3) km/s. Although our statistics are dominated by the brightest stars, we estimate a central black hole mass of 3. 9 (+/- 1. 1) million solar masses, consistent with current estimates from complete orbits of individual stars. Our surface density profile and the velocity dispersion of the late type stars support the existence of a low density region at the Galactic center suggested by earlier observations. Many hot, early-type stars show radial velocity changes higher than maximum values allowed by pure circular orbital motions around a central massive object, suggesting that the motions of these stars greatly deviate from circular orbital motions around the Galactic center. The correlation between the radial velocities of the early type He I stars and their declination offsets from Sagittarius A* suggests that a systematic rotation is present for the early-type population. No figure rotation around the Galactic center for the late type stars is supported by the new observations.
