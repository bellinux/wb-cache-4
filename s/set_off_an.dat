5|$|Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky and is {{informed}} that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is {{in league with}} Renard: Bond kills Davidov and follows the trail to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones. The two witness Renard stealing the GPS locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from a bomb and <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> explosion, from which Bond and Jones escape. Elektra kidnaps M after she thinks Bond had been killed and Bond establishes that Elektra intends to create a nuclear explosion in a submarine in Istanbul to increase the value of her own oil pipeline. Bond frees M, kills Elektra and then disarms the bomb on the submarine where he kills Renard.|$|E
5|$|The {{main base}} was then {{subjected}} to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122mm rockets {{slammed into the}} base, leveling most of the above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> explosion in the main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown {{into the air and}} detonated on impact within the base. Soon after another shell hit a cache of tear gas, which saturated the entire area. Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of C-4 and other explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} was worse in Huế, where {{the approach of}} government forces was met by the beating of Buddhist drums and cymbals to alert the populace. The townsfolk left {{their homes in the}} middle of the night in an attempt to defend the city's pagodas. At Từ Đàm, the temple of Buddhist protest leader Thích Trí Quang, monks attempted to burn the coffin of a monk who had self-immolated recently. Government soldiers, firing M1 rifles, overran the pagoda and confiscated the coffin. They demolished a statue of Gautama Buddha and looted and vandalized the pagoda. They then <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> explosion, leveling much of the pagoda. Many Buddhists were shot, beheaded, confiscated, and clubbed to death.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} side of the parade are two early 18th century magazines, altered in the 19th century. These were {{specially}} designed to avoid the use of iron, which might have generated sparks and <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> explosion, instead being built using wood and copper; they are the only remaining examples of their type in Britain. The Landport Gate lies behind the magazines, and has a gatehouse, called the Dead House, above the passageway leading into the interior of the fort. Past the north-west bastion, the soldiers' barracks would have stood opposite those of the officers', but was destroyed after the war and only the foundations of the building remain. The south-west magazine also holds a covered magazine, similar to that in the north-east bastion. Just to the west of the Water Gate is the fort's guardhouse and chapel, dating from the late 17th century and one of the oldest surviving places of worship within a British artillery fortress.|$|E

25|$|The {{two factors}} that are {{required}} for external otitis to develop are (1) the presence of germs that can infect the skin and (2) impairments in {{the integrity of the}} skin of the ear canal that allow an infection to occur. If the skin is healthy and uninjured, only exposure to a high concentration of pathogens, such as submersion in a pond contaminated by sewage, is likely to <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> episode. However, if there are chronic skin conditions that affect the ear canal skin, such as atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis or abnormalities of keratin production, or if there has been a break in the skin from trauma, even the normal bacteria found in the ear canal may cause infection and full-blown symptoms of external otitis.|$|E

25|$|On {{his return}} Dexter was made captain of Sussex, which he held until {{he retired in}} 1965. He had a quiet home Test season against South Africa, but in the First Test at Edgbaston in the 1961 Ashes series England started their second innings needing 321 runs to avoid an innings defeat. Dexter made 180, the biggest century for England against Australia since the war and studded with 31 {{cracking}} boundaries, but typically he was stumped in the last minutes of the match trying to hit Bobby Simpson for six so {{he could make a}} double century. In the famous Fourth Test at Old Trafford he played a spectacular innings of 76 in 84 minutes to take England to 106 runs from victory with 9 wickets in hand and the Ashes in sight, but his dismissal <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> England collapse and the series was lost.|$|E
25|$|During the war years, the C-46 {{was noted}} for an {{abnormal}} number of unexplained airborne explosions (31 between May 1943 and May 1945) that were initially attributed to various causes. In particular, the fuel system, which was quickly designed, then modified for the new, thirstier Pratt & Whitney engines, was criticized. The {{cause of the}} explosions was eventually traced to pooled gasoline from small leaks in the tanks and fuel system, combined with a spark, usually originating from open-contact electrical components. Though many service aircraft suffered small fuel leaks in use, the C-46's wings were unvented; if a leak occurred, the gasoline had nowhere to drain, but rather pooled at the wing root. Any spark or fire could <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> explosion. After the war, all C-46 aircraft received a wing vent modification to vent pooled gasoline, and an explosion-proof fuel booster pump was installed with shielded electrical selector switches {{in lieu of the}} open-contact type used originally.|$|E
25|$|All of the Gremlins {{are killed}} except Stripe, who escapes {{to a local}} YMCA and jumps into a {{swimming}} pool, spawning an army of gremlins who wreak chaos around Kingston Falls. Billy tries to warn the police, but they don’t believe him. Many people are injured or outright killed by the gremlins' rampage, including Mrs. Deagle, who is launched {{out of her house}} on a stair lift that has been sabotaged by the creatures. At the local bar, the gremlins have fun until the barmaid Kate Beringer, Billy’s girlfriend, flashes them with a camera and escapes into the bank with Billy and Gizmo.

25|$|August began explosively for D.C. United, with United {{defeating}} visitors Real Salt Lake {{in a wild}} 6–4 {{shooting gallery}} of a game. As they did the previous weekend at home, United surrendered an extremely early goal, {{this time in the}} second minute. Once again, United also soon gave up another goal, falling behind 2–0 before rallying to victory. Rolfe scored unassisted from about 7 yards before halftime. Chris Rolfe tied the score in the second half, on a penalty kick that <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> incredible spree of goals. Five minutes after Rolfe's penalty kick evened the score, Taylor Kemp put the home team in front with a prodigious one-time strike on a loose ball from about 25 yards. The visitors evened the score only 3 minutes later with a header for goal on a free kick taken by Javier Morales. The tie score lasted about a minute, as Fabian Espindola was credited with a goal as he stretched to try and connect with a loose rebound, following a shot by Alvaro Saborio. RSL defender Justen Glad attempted to clear the loose ball off the line, but his attempted clearance hit Espindola's outstretched leg and the ball crossed the line before the defense could react. Once again, United failed to protect the lead, as RSL's Morales again picked apart the defense and earned his second assist within 6 minutes. This time, the tie score lasted for 11 minutes as Kemp served in a cross after a short corner kick, with Perry Kitchen getting {{on the end of the}} cross, heading it for the game-winning goal, in the 79th minute. Six minutes later, Nick DeLeon knifed through the RSL defense and blasted a long-range shot for an unassisted goal, capping off the 6-4 win. The six goals scored by United were the most the team had scored since a game in 2004, tying the team's all-time record mark. The combined 10 goals were also the most in any MLS game since 2004, a total that had been exceeded only once in league history. The win put D.C. United back on top of the Supporters Shield standings. Several teams held games in hand and the chance to catch United in that race, but only FC Dallas had earned more points per game played.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, Teller {{was invited}} {{to be part of}} Robert Oppenheimer's summer {{planning}} seminar, at the University of California, Berkeley for the origins of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to develop the first nuclear weapons. A few weeks earlier, Teller had been meeting with his friend and colleague Enrico Fermi about the prospects of atomic warfare, and Fermi had nonchalantly suggested that perhaps a weapon based on nuclear fission could be used to <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> even larger nuclear fusion reaction. Even though he initially explained to Fermi why he thought the idea would not work, Teller was fascinated by the possibility and was quickly bored with the idea of [...] "just" [...] an atomic bomb even though this was not yet anywhere near completion. At the Berkeley session, Teller diverted discussion from the fission weapon to the possibility of a fusion weapon—what he called the [...] "Super", an early concept of what was later to be known as a hydrogen bomb.|$|E
500|$|After {{delivering}} Cavador to Viktoria, Garrett steals a Servant mask {{to learn}} about a Mechanist technology called a [...] "Cultivator". Meanwhile, Karras hides inside the Mechanist cathedral in preparation for his plan.

Karras had provided Servants to nobles with gardens in order to <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>an</b> apocalyptic chain reaction. Viktoria plans to lure the Servants into the hermetically sealed Mechanist cathedral before Karras activates their masks, but Garrett believes this to be too dangerous and leaves. Viktoria goes to the cathedral alone and dies while filling it with plants, and Garrett completes her plan, killing Karras in the rust gas. Afterward, Garrett is approached by a Keeper who explains that Karras' scheme and Viktoria's death had been prophesied.
