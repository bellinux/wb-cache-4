5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive <b>search</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of death tolls were {{reported}} by many different sources. Then-Mexico president Luis Echeverria {{as well as the}} HPC and EPHC claimed that 435people died during the hurricane. It was initially stated that 630people had died during the storm; however, this total does not include victims discovered by the Mexican army. During the afternoon of October 2, the local government had placed the confirmed death toll at 397. Two days later, the Bangor Daily News reported that the number of bodies found dead ranged from 400to750. By late October3, Mexican officials and a Red Cross spokesperson reported that 650bodies had been found. Meanwhile, a military <b>search</b> <b>operation</b> claimed that the death toll of the hurricane was1,050. By October6, local officials had abandoned efforts to retrieve additional bodies, citing safety reasons. Even though 650people were confirmed to have died during Hurricane Liza, officials estimated that at least 1,000people died. Within a week after Hurricane Liza, some feared 10,000people perished. In addition, some modern estimates suggest that the toll could have been as high as7,000.|$|E
5|$|Five {{people died}} as a result of the storm, though only one of them on land. Rough seas in the western Atlantic {{battered}} the Alberto Benati, pitching one man overboard. Two others drowned near Denmark while attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. Another man was missing and presumed dead after heavy seas forced him and his shipmates to abandon their boat off the northern coast of Denmark. Property damage was minimal, mainly because the areas impacted by Faith were sparsely populated. A 2,726ton Norwegian car ferry known as Skagerak began to sink as it headed for Hirtshals in Region Nordjylland of Denmark. Waves pounded the side hatches, which flooded in the engine room, causing the ship to become disabled. A large-scale <b>search</b> <b>operation</b> was conducted to rescue the 144passengers aboard. All passengers were rescued and treated for their injuries in Hjørring, Denmark. However, one person later died in the hospital. In Norway, the remnants of Faith impacted areas between Ryfylke and Sunnfjord. The storm brought heavy rainfall and resulted in glacier melting, which in turn caused rampant flooding in some locations. Discharge from the Folgefonna, Fjærland, and Sunnfjord glaciers reached a record high melt due to the remnants of Faith.|$|E

5|$|The Australians {{continued}} {{to explore the}} tunnels, finding a large quantity of documents and equipment, and by 10 January they had recovered 59 weapons, 20,000 rounds of ammunition, 100 fragmentation grenades, one 57mm recoilless rifle, explosives, clothing and medical supplies. At least 11 Viet Cong had also {{been killed in the}} fighting. Contact also continued, and overnight the Australians killed another five Viet Cong outside their perimeter, while numerous actions occurred during the day as the US 173rd Brigade maintained its sweep. On 10 January at 09:00 the American cavalry from Troop E, US 17th Cavalry Regiment and the Australians from the Prince of Wales Light Horse commenced a combined <b>search</b> <b>operation</b> and fought communist snipers and small groups throughout most of the day. At 14:00 a number of Viet Cong dug-in in trenches were encountered, and following a series of air-strikes and artillery barrages, the cavalry and the Australian M113s swept the area during which several Australians were slightly injured by a misdirected US Navy air-strike. Sixteen Viet Cong bodies were subsequently recovered, and another 60 were believed to have been killed but had been removed from the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operation}} {{involving the}} 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over {{the night of}} 24/25November. Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to the settlements of Rishpon and Sidna Ali. In the following cordon and <b>search</b> <b>operation,</b> the police were stoned by the inhabitants, and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages. The next day, 26November, the police were involved in hand-to-hand fighting with the villagers and eventually withdrew, calling on the brigade to enter the settlements and enforce law and order. Leaving some men behind on the cordon {{to hold back the}} estimated 3,000 crowd, the remainder of the brigade entered the settlements. Here they carried out several baton charges {{and for the first time}} used tear gas to disperse the crowds. In the cleanup operation, 900 persons were later arrested.|$|E
25|$|Following the attack, a <b>search</b> <b>operation</b> and aerial {{surveillance}} {{of the base}} was conducted for hidden terrorists and around 15 people were arrested during the <b>search</b> <b>operation.</b> Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif visited the wounded at CMH Peshawar and held meetings with Corps Commander Lieutenant-General Hidayatur Rehman and Air Chief Marshal Sohail Aman to discuss the terrorist attack.|$|E

40|$|Model {{verification}} {{and validation}} (V&V) {{is one of}} the most important activities in simulation modelling. Model validation is especially challenging for agent-based simulation (ABS). Techniques that can help to improve V&V in simulation modelling are needed. This paper proposes a V&V technique called Test-Driven Simulation Modelling (TDSM) which applies techniques from Test-Driven Development in software engineering to simulation modelling. The main principle in TDSM is that a unit test for a simulation model has to be specified before the simulation model is implemented. Hence, TDSM explicitly embeds V&V in simulation modelling. We use a case study in maritime <b>search</b> <b>operations</b> to demonstrate how TDSM can be used in practice. Maritime <b>search</b> <b>operations</b> (and <b>search</b> <b>operations</b> in general) are one of the classic applications of Operational Research (OR). Hence, we can use analytical models from the vast search theory literature for unit tests in TDSM. The results show that TDSM is a useful technique in the verification and validation of simulation models, especially ABS models. This paper also shows that ABS can offer an alternative modelling approach in the analysis of maritime <b>search</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R
25|$|It is {{believed}} that she now haunts Harecastle Tunnel, either {{in the form of}} a headless woman, or a white horse, and her appearance used to forewarn of disaster in the local mines. Some boatmen took long detours to avoid the tunnel, and today the tunnel keepers relate tales of occasional mismatches in the number of boats going in and coming out. Such tales are, however, fanciful, as any such discrepancy would result in a major <b>search</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, the {{programmer}} may {{abandon the}} notion of representing the Life field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, like a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, {{as long as the}} population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or <b>search</b> <b>operation,</b> slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.|$|E
