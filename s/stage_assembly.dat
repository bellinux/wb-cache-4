50|$|After {{having just}} {{recently}} retired a successful shuttle program NASA {{is once again}} looking into deep space (where no human has gone), only not to probe but to actually go. The spacecraft (currently labeled Orion) must first reach orbit before attempting a journey to mars. Nasa has designed {{what they call the}} S.L.S. or space launch system to perform this first critical task. Much like the space shuttle booster rockets, the S.L.S. will be assembled at the Michoud Assembly Facility and then transported to the launch location. The S.L.S. will be more powerful than any other similar system Nasa has designed with an expected 8.4 million pounds of thrust at launch. This larger scale and thrust meant facility wide upgrades at the Michoud Assembly location would be required. The task of removing the existing concrete silos, originally built for assembling the space shuttle booster rockets, to make way for larger SLS core <b>stage</b> <b>assembly</b> towers was estimated to take three months. Bluegrass was called in to regain schedule for the overall project eventually completing the demolition of cells B and C in a month.|$|E

5000|$|The {{two-stage}} missile {{is equipped}} with solid propellant booster and sustainer rocket motors. The missile uses an initial burn {{to carry out a}} vertical hot launch from the container and a secondary burn to sustain the missile's trajectory towards the target at a speed of Mach 9, or [...] Thrust vector control is used in the boost and sustainer phases of flight. At the ignition of the second stage sustainer motor, the first <b>stage</b> <b>assembly</b> separates. The Arrow missile is launched before the threat missile's trajectory and intercept point are accurately known. As more trajectory data becomes available, the optimum intercept point is more precisely defined, towards which the missiles is then guided. The 500 kg kill vehicle section of the missile, containing the warhead, fusing and the terminal seeker, {{is equipped with}} four moving delta aerodynamic control fins to give low altitude interception capability. The dual mode missile seeker has a passive infrared seeker for the acquisition and tracking of tactical ballistic missiles and an active radar seeker used to home on air-breathing targets at low altitudes. The infrared seeker is an indium antimonide focal plane array. The kill vehicle is designed to achieve a hit-to-kill interception, but if this is not achieved, the proximity fuze will direct the warhead fragments at the target shortly before reaching the closest point to the target. The high explosive directed blast fragmentation warhead is capable of destroying a target within a 40 - 50 m radius. In this manner, Arrow also differs from Patriot PAC-3, THAAD, and Standard Missile 3, which rely purely on hit-to-kill technology in which the kinetic force of a precise impact causes the destruction of the threat.|$|E

40|$|Capacitive {{displacement}} sensors {{have many}} applications where non-contact, high precision measurement of a surface is required. Because of their non-contact nature {{they can easily}} measure conductive surfaces that are flexible or otherwise unable to be measured using a contact probe. Since {{the output of the}} capacitance gage is electrical, data points can be collected quickly and averaged to improve statistics. It is often necessary for capacitive displacement sensors to gage the distance from a curved (non-flat) surface. Although displacements can easily be detected, the calibration of this output can vary considerably from the flat case. Since a capacitance gage is typically factory-calibrated against a flat reference, the experimental output contains errors in both gain and linearity. A series of calibration corrections is calculated for rectifying this output. Capacitance gages are also limited in their overall displacement travel. A support stage is described that, along with control electronics, allow the properties of the capacitance gage to be combined with an interferometer to overcome this displacement limitation. Finally, an application is proposed that would make use of the capacitance sensor and support <b>stage</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{sequential assembly}} of chemically patchy colloids such that their valence differs from stage to stage to produce hierarchical structures. For proof of concept, we employ ACB triblock spheres suspended in water, with the C middle band electrostatically repulsive. In the first <b>assembly</b> <b>stage,</b> only A-A hydrophobic attraction contributes, and discrete clusters form. They can be stored, but subsequently activated to allow B-B attractions, leading to higher-order assembly of clusters with one another. The growth dynamics, observed {{at a single}} particle level by fluorescence optical microscopy, obey the kinetics of stepwise polymerization, forming chains, pores, and networks. Between linked clusters, we identify three possible bond geometries, linear, triangular, and square, by an argument that is generalizable to other patchy colloid systems.

40|$|The {{early stages}} of the {{self-assembly}} of peptide hydrogels largely determine their final material properties. Here we discuss experimental methodologies for monitoring the self-assembly kinetics which underpin peptide hydrogel formation. The early <b>stage</b> <b>assembly</b> of an enzyme-catalysed Fmoc-trileucine based self-assembled hydrogel was examined using spectroscopic techniques (circular dichroism, CD, and solution NMR) as well as chromatographic (HPLC) and mechanical (rheology) techniques. Optimal conditions for enzyme-assisted hydrogel formation were identified and the kinetics examined. A lag time associated with the formation and accumulation of the self-assembling peptide monomer was observed and a minimum hydrogelator concentration required for gelation was identified. Subsequent formation of well defined nano- and microscale structures lead to self-supporting hydrogels at a range of substrate and enzyme concentrations. 1 H NMR monitoring of the early self-assembly process revealed trends that were well in agreement with those identified using traditional methods (i. e. HPLC, CD, rheology) demonstrating 1 H NMR spectroscopy can be used to non-invasively monitor the self-assembly of peptide hydrogels without damaging or perturbing the system...|$|E
40|$|The current project {{addresses}} the productivity improvement of a manual assembly line by {{making use of}} operations analysis {{in the framework of}} Lean production. A methodology is proposed that helps to improve the productivity of any production process. The methodology consists of selecting a product or product family to be studied followed by current process study. Once the existing process is documented, all the assembly tasks involved must be timed using time study techniques. Operations analysis enables the reduction of non-productive tasks and results in a set of standardized work elements along with the set of standard procedures for performing the operations. Assembly line balancing along with the associated operations analysis assists in constructing or re-configuring an assembly system, which is the key step in improving the overall performance of an assembly line. Following this approach, two manual assembly line configurations (single stage parallel line and five-stage serial line) are constructed for a case study.
