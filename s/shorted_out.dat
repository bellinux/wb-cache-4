5|$|Around the 1990s, {{the station}} was modernized. After water <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> old wires in the station, on March 11, 1999, a major fire {{occurred}} originating in an equipment room on the station's lower level. A 1930s-era relay room, which controlled the interlocking north of the station, was destroyed in the fire. The station was closed for several months, with G service suspended south of Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets and F trains simply bypassing the station at a lower-than-normal operating speed. Signals and switches at the station were replaced and modernized after the fire, and again in Fall 2008 when the relay room was rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|Some of Baird's early inventions {{were not}} fully successful. In his twenties {{he tried to}} create {{diamonds}} by heating graphite and <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> Glasgow's electricity supply. Later Baird invented a glass razor, which was rust-resistant, but shattered. Inspired by pneumatic tyres he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons, which burst. He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. Baird suffered from cold feet, and {{after a number of}} trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth.|$|E
25|$|In late October 1967, Scorpion started {{refresher}} training and weapons system acceptance tests, {{and was given}} a new commanding officer, Francis Slattery. Following type training out of Norfolk, Virginia, she got underway on 15 February 1968 for a Mediterranean Sea deployment. She operated with the 6th Fleet into May and then headed west for home. Scorpion suffered several mechanical malfunctions, including a chronic problem with Freon leakage from refrigeration systems. An electrical fire occurred in an escape trunk when a water leak <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> a shore power connection. (However, major steam and leakage problems are not uncommon on U.S. Navy or Royal Navy submarine deployments, even in the 21st Century.) There {{is no evidence that}} the Scorpions speed was restricted in May 1968, although it was conservatively observing a depth limitation of 500 feet, due to the incomplete implementation of planned post-Thresher safety checks and modifications.|$|E

Fire boats got {{too close to the}} target ships they were hosing and drenched their crews with radioactive spray. One fire boat had to be taken out of service. Film badges showed 67 overdoses between August 6 and 9. More than half of the 320 Geiger counters available <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> and became unavailable.

500|$|One {{thing that}} was not seen at the time by the public was Shepard's pre-launch [...] "emergency". [...] Because the entire journey was only {{expected}} to take fifteen minutes, Shepard's suit {{did not have any}} provision for elimination of bodily wastes. After being strapped into the capsule's seat, launch delays kept him in that suit for eight hours; Shepard's endurance gave out before launch, and he was forced to empty his bladder into the suit, which <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> the medical sensors attached to it to track the astronaut's condition in flight. [...] After Shepard's flight, NASA called in the space suit's manufacturer, B. F. Goodrich, and by the time of John Glenn's Mercury-Atlas 6 orbital flight the following year, a liquid waste collection feature had been built into the suit.|$|E
500|$|In 1943 it was {{renumber}} 790 {{and remained}} in service {{until it was}} replaced by diesel-electric locomotives and put into storage, [...] "the railroad nevertheless had to fire No. 790 up in the spring to assist Illinois Central trains through track inundated by flood waters near Cedar Rapids, because diesel-electric locomotives with their electric motors <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> in any water, whereas even {{the bottom of the}} firebox in a steam locomotive was much higher above the rail, hence above flood waters." [...] It was sold to Louis S. Keller of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1959 who had hoped to use it for excursions. It was used for [...] "flood duty" [...] in April 1965 at the Clinton Corn Processing Company [...] "where it plowed through overflow from the Mississippi River." [...] Later that year it was sold to David de Camp who planned to use it in the area of Lake Placid, New York. The plans were not met and it was sold to F. Nelson Blount in January 1966.|$|E

500|$|The {{transports}} {{always took}} off in daylight; weather reports were not available before dawn, and the fighter escort could not operate in darkness. Weather was a constant hazard over the Owen Stanley Range, and clouds could build up faster than an aircraft could climb. Poor flying weather, either over Port Moresby or over the target, could ground the transports {{for a week or}} more at a time. Weather and rough airstrips increased the amount of maintenance required to keep the planes flying. So too did the climate. The high humidity encouraged the growth of fungus which <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> electrical components; metal surfaces were subject to corrosion; and lubrication oils evaporated in the high temperatures. Critical spare parts were often out of stock, and their delivery was an important role of the intra-theatre air transport. Availability did not just mean the transports; there was also the fighter escorts, which were normally based at another field. If they could not fly, or were required for another mission, then the transports could not fly. For planning purposes, a C-39 planeload was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel, while that of the larger C-53 was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel; but loading charts were not available in 1942, and aircraft were sometimes overloaded.|$|E
500|$|Beatty {{ordered his}} battlecruisers {{to make all}} {{practicable}} speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, Lion, her sister [...] and , were doing [...] in pursuit and Lion opened fire at 8:52 at a range of [...] The other ships followed {{a few minutes later}} but, hampered by the extreme range and decreasing visibility, they did not score their first hit on Blücher until 9:09. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves a few minutes later at 9:11, at a range of , and concentrated their fire on Lion. They first hit her at 9:28 on the waterline with a shell that flooded a coal bunker. Shortly afterwards a [...] shell from Blücher hit the roof of 'A' turret, denting it and knocking out the left gun for two hours. At 9:35 Beatty signalled 'Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy's line', but Tigers captain, believing that Indomitable was already engaging Blücher, fired at , as did Lion, which left [...] unengaged and able to continue to engage Lion without risk. However, Lion scored the first serious hit of the battle when one of her shells penetrated the working chamber of Seydlitzs rear barbette at 9:40 and ignited the propellant lying exposed. The resulting fire spread into the other turret and burnt out both of them, killing 159 men. Seydlitz returned the damage at 10:01 with a [...] shell that ricocheted off the water and pierced Lions five-inch armour aft, although it failed to explode. However, the resulting [...] hole flooded the low power switchboard compartment and eventually <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> two of Lions three dynamos. [...] scored the most telling hits on Lion at 10:18 when two [...] shells struck her port side below the waterline. The shock was so great that her captain, Ernle Chatfield, thought that she had been torpedoed. One shell pierced the five-inch armour forward and burst in a wing compartment behind the armour. It drove in a [...] piece of armour and flooded a number of compartments adjacent to the torpedo flat and the torpedo body room. One splinter put a hole in the exhaust pipe of the capstan engine which eventually contaminated the auxiliary condenser with salt water. The other shell hit further aft and burst on the six-inch portion of the waterline belt. It drove in two armour plates about [...] and flooded some of the lower coal bunkers. At 10:41 a 283mm shell burst against the eight-inch armour of 'A' barbette, but only started a small fire in the 'A' turret lobby that was quickly put out, although the magazine was partially flooded when a false report was received that it was on fire as well. Soon afterwards Lion was hit by a number of shells in quick succession, but only one of these was serious. A shell burst on the nine-inch armour belt abreast the engine room and drove a [...] armour plate about two feet inboard and ruptured the port engine's feedwater tank. By 10:52 Lion had been hit fourteen times and had taken aboard some [...] of water which gave her a list of 10° to port and reduced her speed. Shortly afterwards her port engine broke down and her speed dropped to [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{task force}} {{returned}} to the Philippines on 10 December, this time to support landings on Mindanao. As Japanese air attacks had slackened off by this time, the most notable event to the ships {{of the task force}} was a typhoon that swept through the area on the 18 December. Caught {{in the center of the}} storm, Benham found herself faced with stack-high seas and [...] winds that sent her laboring greatly. More seriously, water flooding through the ventilators <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> her switchboards, the vent fans failed, and the crew had to bail free water in the extreme heat below decks. After five hours of punishing weather, the worst of the storm passed; and the warship limped to Ulithi for repairs. There, the crew heard the news that the storm had sunk three other destroyers and damaged at least 27 other ships.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{of these}} reports of {{transmissions}} were later {{determined to be}} hoaxes but others were deemed authentic. Bearings taken by Pan American Airways stations suggested signals originating from several locations, including Gardner Island (Nikumaroro), 360 miles (580km) to the SSE. It was noted {{at the time that}} if these signals were from Earhart and Noonan, they must have been on land with the aircraft since water would have otherwise <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> the Electra's electrical system. Sporadic signals were reported for four or five days after the disappearance but none yielded any understandable information. The captain of the USS [...] later said: [...] "There was no doubt many stations were calling the Earhart plane on the plane's frequency, some by voice and others by signals. All of these added to the confusion and doubtfulness of the authenticity of the reports." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deep-sea photography, {{recovered}} artifacts, and {{an evaluation}} of her design and operational history permitted a Court of Inquiry to conclude Thresher had probably suffered {{the failure of a}} salt-water piping system joint which relied heavily on silver brazing instead of welding; earlier tests using ultrasound equipment found potential problems with about 14% of the tested brazed joints, most of which were determined not to pose a risk significant enough to require a repair. High-pressure water spraying from a broken pipe joint may have <b>shorted</b> <b>out</b> one of the many electrical panels, causing a shutdown ("scram") of the reactor, with a subsequent loss of propulsion. The inability to blow the ballast tanks was later attributed to excessive moisture in the submarine's high-pressure air flasks, moisture which froze and plugged the flasks' flowpaths while passing through the valves. This was later simulated in dock-side tests on Threshers sister sub, [...] During a test to simulate blowing ballast at or near test depth, ice formed on strainers installed in valves; the flow of air lasted only a few seconds. Air dryers were later retrofitted to the high-pressure air compressors, beginning with Tinosa, to permit the emergency blow system to operate properly.|$|E
