Wesley Yang in his essay [...] "Inside the Box" [...] in n+1, compared the music video to Britny Fox's [...] "Girlschool" [...] because it featured [...] "a classroom full of Catholic schoolgirls gyrating to the beat in defiance of a stern teacher. [...] But that was a sexist video by a horrible hair metal band that exploited women. Britney Spears was something else—an inflection point in the culture". The music video is also referenced in the music video of Spears's 2000 single, [...] "Stronger" [...] where Spears sings, [...] "My loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] - a reference to [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] where she sings, [...] "My loneliness is killing me."
