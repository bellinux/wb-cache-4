5|$|At the time, {{the general}} method {{to compute the}} inverse <b>square</b> <b>root</b> was to {{calculate}} an approximation for , then revise that approximation via another method until it came within an acceptable error range of the actual result. Common software methods in the early 1990s drew approximations from a lookup table. The key of the fast inverse <b>square</b> <b>root</b> was to directly compute an approximation by utilizing the structure of floating-point numbers, proving faster than table lookups. The algorithm was approximately four times faster than computing the <b>square</b> <b>root</b> with another method and calculating the reciprocal via floating point division. The algorithm was designed with the IEEE 754-1985 32-bit floating point specification in mind, but investigation from Chris Lomont showed {{that it could be}} implemented in other floating point specifications.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the <b>square</b> <b>root</b> of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same <b>square</b> <b>root</b> dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E

These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale.
