50|$|There {{are five}} {{different}} types of stretching: ballistic, dynamic, SMF <b>stretching,</b> PNF <b>stretching,</b> and static <b>stretching.</b> Ballistic <b>stretching</b> is a rapid bouncing <b>stretch</b> in which a body part is moving with momentum that <b>stretches</b> the muscles to a maximum. Muscles respond {{to this type of}} <b>stretching</b> by contracting to protect itself from over extending. Dynamic <b>stretching</b> is a walking or movement <b>stretch.</b> By performing slow controlled movements through full range of motion, a person reduces risk of injury. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a type of <b>stretch</b> for a particular muscle and its specific job, so resistance should be applied, then the muscle should be relaxed. Static <b>stretching</b> is a type of <b>stretch</b> whereby a person <b>stretches</b> the muscle until a gentle tension is felt and then holds the <b>stretch</b> for thirty seconds or until a muscle release is felt, without any movement or bouncing.|$|R

5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first <b>stretched</b> while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being <b>stretched</b> again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the <b>stretched</b> tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E

40|$|Hypertonia {{is seen in}} 85 % {{of people}} with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) {{resulting}} in disability and functional restrictions. Hypertonia {{can be caused by}} increases in passive stiffness and enhanced <b>stretch</b> reflexes (spasticity) and is frequently managed clinically using passive <b>stretches.</b> However, the optimal parameters of <b>stretching</b> such as the applied torque and <b>stretch</b> duration remain unclear. During commonly prescribed ankle plantarflexor <b>stretches</b> pwMS produced higher torques when standing in a weight bearing position compared to <b>stretches</b> applied using the upper limbs. <b>Stretches</b> could be held for 120 seconds on average and <b>stretch</b> duration was mainly limited by fatigue. People with higher disability tended to favour more supported <b>stretching</b> positions. The effects of <b>stretching</b> for either 30 or 10 minutes using a customised motor at three torque levels covering the range that MS participants could produce was investigated. Compared to the 10 minute <b>stretch,</b> greater reductions in passive stiffness and greater increases in range of movement (ROM) were seen immediately following the 30 minute <b>stretch</b> with the effects being sustained for the 30 minute post <b>stretch</b> period. Higher levels of applied torque resulted in a greater change in ROM however; there was no effect of applied torque on passive stiffness. <b>Stretch</b> reflex mediated stiffness was unaffected by the <b>stretching</b> intervention and showed transient post <b>stretch</b> increases. Ultrasonography was used to investigate changes in muscle–tendon length and strain in pwMS and controls and following <b>stretching.</b> PwMS showed evidence of stiffer muscles and increased tendon length at baseline compared to controls. Following a 10 minute <b>stretch</b> overall muscle length did not increase in pwMS, although increases in strain in the musculotendinous junction region were observed suggesting that more proximal regions of the muscle was likely to have contributed significantly to overall stiffness. This work highlights that <b>stretch</b> duration and levels of applied torque are critical factors in determining the effectiveness of <b>stretches.</b> The pathological mechanisms underlying hypertonia at a molecular and structural level and the effects of <b>stretching</b> on components of the musculo-tendinous structure and on functional ability should be ascertained.
