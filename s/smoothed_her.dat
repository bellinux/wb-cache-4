6000|$|He hummed {{about the}} room, running over the {{advertising}} pages of magazines, discussing Plato fraternities, and waiting till {{it should be}} time to go home. Their conversation kept returning to the fraternities. There wasn't much else to talk about. Before to-night they had done complete justice to all other topics--Joralemon, Bennie Rusk, Joe Jordan's engagement, Adelaide Benner, and symphony concerts.

6000|$|... "Entirely {{out of the}} house," [...] assented the presence, comfortably <b>smoothing</b> <b>her</b> hands. [...] "Which is {{considered}} much better for all parties, and much more conwenient." ...|$|R
