40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the potential of}} engaging gifted and talented learners in an online community of inquiry promoted {{by the use of}} asynchronous discussion forums. It employed a mixed-method, case-study approach where non-participant observation of online interactions and focus group meetings with the tutors contributed to the qualitative analysis of how the members realised participation in the forums. Quantitative analysis of membership data and online questionnaire responses revealed member characteristics of the sample members and patterns of active (vocal and <b>silent)</b> <b>participation.</b> Analysis was inductive and interpretive, informed by an original synthesis of the theoretical perspectives of two theories: the online learning theory suggested by Garrison, Anderson and Archer (2000); and the cognitive and affective domains for learning skills, proposed by Bloom et al. (1956) and Krathwohl et al. (1964). Content analysis of over 3000 messages posted or read by approximately 4500 members revealed community-based and ability-based characteristics that enabled the group to deal with social stigma, co-construct knowledge and promote meta- learning skills. The study concluded that participation in online discussion forums held the potential to address several of the needs identified by research for gifted learners: The need for the company of like-minded and similar ability peers; the need to develop higher order thinking skills; and the need to become independent learners. In this online network, the gifted learners could receive communal support from other members and tutors who acted as 'mentors' and role models for honing interpersonal and thinking skills such that they were motivated to pursue their interests to their full potential.

2500|$|Per Section 3 of BP 51, {{all other}} cities were {{considered}} [...] "component cities" [...] of the provinces {{in which they}} are geographically located, or the provinces of which they were originally a part. Despite considering all other cities as part of their respective provinces, under BP 51 the eligibility of voters to participate in provincial elections were still determined by their cities' respective charters (as amended). The voters of a total of thirteen [...] "component cities" [...] continued to be ineligible to vote for provincial officials for the local elections of 1980. Nine of these were cities with charters (as amended) that expressly prohibited participation in provincial elections: Dagupan, General Santos, Iloilo, Mandaue, Naga, Ormoc, Oroquieta, San Carlos (Pangasinan) and Zamboanga. The remaining four — Bais, Canlaon, Cotabato and Ozamiz — were cities whose charters were <b>silent</b> on <b>participation</b> in provincial elections; BP 51 upheld the 1951 Supreme Court decision on Teves, et al. v. Commission on Elections by barring their residents from participating in the election of provincial officials.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{displays}} of orientation that students use {{to participate in the}} classroom. It is argued that students use their direction of gaze, body posture, gesture and other modes of communication to realize such displays and respond to what goes on when they are not nominated speakers. The focus of the paper is on the <b>silent</b> but active <b>participation</b> of a recently immigrated student in a secondary classroom in England. Fine grained analysis of the preparatory stages of a lesson on Romeo and Juliet shows that she demonstrates understanding of the changing contextual grounds for meaning making in the classroom through careful alignment of her displays of orientation with the subsequent stages in the whole-class activity. It is suggested that this interactional fluency will {{have a significant impact on}} her educational career...|$|R
40|$|By {{the late}} eighteenth century, African and Luso-African women in Luanda were already key agents in the {{development}} of local, regional, and long distance trade, supplying foodstuffs and trading in captives. Nevertheless, most foreign observers were <b>silent</b> about womens <b>participation</b> in domains beyond agriculture and household chores. This dissertation examines the involvement of women in commercial activities in Luanda between {{the late eighteenth}} and the mid-nineteenth centuries. This port town was the most important of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, attracting foreign merchants seeking quick enrichment. Incoming traders relied on local intermediaries with knowledge of indigenous languages and cultures, many of whom were women with whom they entered into commercial and intimate relationships. Despite the importance of these unions, primary sources confirm that women were able to accumulate their own independent capital which they invested in commercial activities. Women with capital acquired land and captives, which allowed them to produce foodstuffs for subsistence and to supply urban markets, caravans, and slave ships. Nevertheless, few women were able to enter the highly competitive slave trade due to limited access to credit. Those who did so were wealthy women who engaged in the Atlantic market alone or in partnership with foreign husbands and associates. The retail trade, in turn, created opportunities for women of modest means who became shop and tavernkeepers, while poor and enslaved females peddled edibles and imported goods in the markets and streets. The development of legitimate commerce in the mid-nineteenth century created more opportunities for female entrepreneurship in commercial agriculture, the trade in tropical products and the supply of foodstuffs for the growing population of Luanda. In this study, I argue that women played a fundamental role in the socio-economic fabric of Luanda through their involvement in local, regional and long distance trade, as well as agents of a cultural hybridization. There, despite the prevalence of a gendered and racialized structure, women were able to operate as traders in various instances, contributing to increase their household incomes and establishing a degree of independence relative to men...|$|R
