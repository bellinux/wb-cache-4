40|$|We analyze ~ 600 ks {{data from}} the X-ray {{observatory}} Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer of the neutron star low mass X-ray binary and atoll source 4 U 1636 - 53. These observations span almost three years, from April 1996 to February 1999. The color-color and hardness-intensity diagrams show significant secular shifts of the atoll track, similar to what is observed for some Z sources. These are most evident in the hardness-intensity diagram, where shifts in intensity up to ~ 20 % are observed. We find that the intensity shifts in the hardness-intensity diagram {{are responsible for the}} parallel tracks observed in the kilohertz quasi periodic oscillations frequency vs. intensity diagram. While the parallel tracks in the frequency vs. color plane partially overlap, systematic long term shifts are still evident. We also study the broad band power spectra of 4 U 1636 - 53 {{as a function of the}} source <b>position</b> <b>Sa</b> along the track in the color-color diagram. These power spectra are all characteristic of the lower and upper banana state in atoll sources, showing very low frequency noise, band limited noise, and sometimes one or two kHz QPOs. We find that the very low frequency noise in some intervals is not well described by a power law because of an excess of power between 20 and 30 mHz, which can be fitted by a Lorentzian. Also, the characteristic frequency of the band limited noise shows a trend to decrease with increasing Sa at high Sa values...|$|R

The problem becomes MAX-SNP-hard as soon as arbitrary pairwise dependencies among the alignment edges are introduced. We present a global propagator for this problem which is based on efficiently solving a relaxation of it. In the context of bioinformatics, the problem is known as alignment of arc-annotated sequences, which is e. g. used for comparing RNA molecules. For a restricted version of this alignment problem, we show that a constraint program based on our propagator is on par with state of the art methods. For the general problem with unrestricted dependencies, our tool constitutes the first available method with promising applications in this field. The maximum weight string alignment problem for strings Sa and Sb asks for a partial matching of <b>positions</b> in <b>Sa</b> and Sb that preserves the string order and has maximum weight.

40|$|IntroductionIn aortic {{stenosis}} (AS), the left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction is classically maintained within {{the normal range}} {{despite the presence of}} decreased longitudinal function. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) assessment of myocardial velocities is a sensitive method to detect long-axis dysfunction. However, in AS, data are limited and no studies have correlated the symptomatic status and the level of plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) with the severity of long axis dysfunction. Method and resultsA comprehensive 2 D echocardiogram including TDI of LV was performed in 40 consecutive patients with severe AS (age, 71 ± 13 years, 62 % of male, AVA, 0. 67 ± 0. 2 cm 2, mean transaortic pressure gradient, 44 ± 14 mmHg, LV mass, 162 ± 49 g/m 2). Concomitantly, plasma BNP level was measured. Peak systolic (Sa) and diastolic tissue velocities (Ea and Aa) were measured in septal, lateral, inferior and anterior <b>position.</b> <b>Sa</b> (mean, 5. 4 ± 1. 4 cm/s, range 2. 5 to 8. 8 cm/s) was significantly correlated with aortic valve area (AVA) (r= 0. 53, p= 0. 0004), LV ejection fraction (r= 0. 55, p= 0. 02) and septal E/Ea ratio (r= 0. 45, p= 0. 008). Consistently, patients with AVA ≤ 0. 7 cm 2 (n= 19, 47. 5 %) had lower Sa (4. 8 ± 1. 3 vs. 5. 9 ± 1. 3 cm/s, p= 0. 016). Sa was lower even in patients with preserved LV ejection fraction (Sa= 5. 6 ± 1. 2 cm/s). Interestingly, Sa was also correlated with BNP (r= 0. 48, p= 0. 004). Patients with low Sa (≤ 5. 4 cm/s, n= 16, 40 %) had significantly higher BNP (570 ± 190 vs. 271 ± 167 pg/ml, p= 0. 03). Moreover, symptomatic patients (n= 29, 73 %) had lower Sa (5 ± 1. 3 vs. 6. 5 ± 1. 1 cm/s, p= 0. 02) and higher septal E/Ea ratio (28 ± 16 vs. 13 ± 17, p= 0. 007). ConclusionIn patients with AS and preserved LV ejection fraction, the decrease in long-axis function is directly correlated to symptoms and BNP levels. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of subclinical LV dysfunction in the management of patients with severe {{aortic stenosis}}...|$|R

40|$|Tax {{avoidance}} through interest deductions {{has been}} highlighted internationally as {{a concern with}} the effect of eroding tax revenues of countries, including South Africa (SA). The evident cause of this concern is what is termed base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) mainly orchestrated by multinational companies using aggressive tax planning schemes. Although the concern continues to exist, comprehensive measures are in place in SA such as the anti-avoidance rules and exchange control regulations to mitigate the concern. The study was undertaken to analyse the legislation on interest deductions {{in terms of the}} Income Tax Act No 58 of 1962 (‘the Act’) with particular focus on anti-avoidance. A number of issues pertaining to the operation of the provisions in the Act; administrative challenges as well the possible exploitation of loopholes within the provisions were identified. Furthermore, a comparative analysis conducted against Australia and the United Kingdom indicated that the measures adopted in SA are relatively similar, if not ahead.

40|$|The city of Naples is {{commonly}} {{represented as a}} place of contact and exchange between the northern and the southern regions of the Mediterranean. Such a representation of Naples as an ‘in-between' place is problematic, as the case of migration flows to the city shows. Naples can be regarded as a space of transition and interaction between the EU and the multiple South(s) of the world. However, this particular role is not exclusively connected to the city's cosmopolitan historical background or to its specific geographic location. This role of the city as an ‘interface' place has to be critically reconsidered, particularly in light of the ongoing globalisation of migratory flows and the differentiation of migrants' profiles and trajectories. On the basis of such changes, {{it can be argued that}} Naples is becoming a laboratory of emerging forms of international migration. Cross-border traders seek to take advantage of the interface location of the city, especially benefiting from the price and taxation differentials. However, this leads to a reconfiguration of the spatial positionality of the city and the shaping of a new ‘centrality'. Résumé La ville de Naples a souvent été représentée comme un lieu de contact et d'interpénétration entre Sud et Nord de la Méditerranée. Une telle conception de la ville comme « entre-deux » est problématique, comme le montre l'étude des flux migratoires qui la traversent. Naples peut certes être considérée comme un espace de transition et d'échange entre l'Union Européenne et les différents Suds du monde, mais ni son histoire cosmopolite, ni <b>sa</b> <b>position</b> spatiale ne permettent seules d'en expliquer les raisons. En outre, ce rôle d'interface de la ville doit être relativisé, notamment à la lumière de la mondialisation des flux et de la diversification des profils et parcours des migrants. A l'aune de ces évolutions, la ville est avant tout un laboratoire de nouvelles formes migratoires. Il est vrai que certains migrants, à travers la circulation commerciale, choisissent la ville en vertu de <b>sa</b> <b>position</b> d'interface, permettant l'exploitation des différentiels. Toutefois, cela induit, dans une certaine mesure, un bouleversement des hiérarchies spatiales sur lesquelles étaient fondées leurs stratégies migratoires...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to compare the stability of four commercially available implants by investigating the focal stress distributions and relative micromotion using finite element analysis. Variations in the numbers of pegs between the implant designs were tested. A load of 750 N was applied at three different glenoid positions (SA: superior–anterior; SP: superior–posterior; C: central) to mimic off-center and central loadings during activities of daily living. Focal stress distributions and relative micromotion were measured using Marc Mentat software. The results demonstrated that by increasing the number of pegs from two to five, the total focal stress volumes exceeding 5 MPa, reflecting the stress critical volume (SCV) as the threshold for occurrence of cement microfractures, decreased from 8. 41 to 5. 21 % in the <b>SA</b> <b>position</b> and from 9. 59 to 6. 69 % in the SP position.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} {{political}} violence in the Nazi rise and seizure of power at local and regional levels. Its subject is the SA in the former eastern regions of Germany - East Prussia, Pomerania, Silesia and the Border Province of Posen and West Prussia. The thesis is organised thematically, but within a rough chronological framework, and falls essentially into four parts. The first offers background, by examining social, economic and political conditions in eastern Germany during the Weimar Republic and then discussing {{the rise of the}} Nazi movement there. The second concerns the SA itself its composition, the nature of membership in the organisation, its relationship to other components of the Nazi movement and to the Reichswehr. The third, the core of this study, is a detailed analysis of SA violence and terror, both in the rise of the Nazi movement and the seizure of power. Finally, the fourth deals with the SA after the seizure of power, the failure of the SA to find a new political role, and the purge in 1934.

40|$|Plants possess {{multiple}} resistance {{mechanisms that}} guard against pathogen attack. Among these are inducible {{systems such as}} systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SAR is activated by pathogen exposure and leads {{to an increase in}} salicylic acid (SA), high-level expression of SAR-related genes, and resistance to a spectrum of pathogens. To identify components of the signal transduction pathways regulating SAR, a mutant screen was developed that uses 2, 6 -dichloroisonicotinic acid as an activator of SAR gene expression and pathogen resistance, followed by assays for resistance to the fungal pathogen Peronospora parasitica. Mutants from this screen were subsequently examined to assess their defense responses. We describe here a recessive mutation that causes a phenotype of insensitivity to chemical and biological inducers of SAR genes and resistance. These data indicate the existence of a common signaling pathway that couples these diverse stimuli to induction of SAR genes and resistance. Because of its non-inducible immunity phenotype, we call this mutant nim 1. Although nim 1 plants fail to respond to SA, they retain the ability to accumulate wild-type levels of SA, a probable endogenous signal for SAR. Further, the ability of nim 1 plants to support growth of normally incompatible races of a fungal pathogen indicates a role for this pathway in expression of genetically determined resistance, consistent with earlier findings for transgenic plants engineered to break down SA. These results suggest that the wild-type NIM 1 gene product functions in a pathway regulating acquired resistance, at a <b>position</b> downstream of <b>SA</b> accumulation and upstream of SAR gene induction and expression of resistance...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare surface imaging, portal imaging, and skin marker set-up in {{radiotherapy}} of thoracic and pelvic regions, using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) data as the gold standard. Patients and methods: Twenty patients were included in this study. CBCT, surface acquisition (SA), and two orthogonal portal images (PI) were acquired during the first four treatment sessions. Patient set-up corrections, obtained by registering the planning CT with CBCT, were used as the gold standard. Registration results of the PI and SA were evaluated and compared with those obtained with CBCT. The advantage derived from using SA or PI verification systems over a skin marker set-up was also quantified. Results: A statistically significant difference between PI and SA (in favour of PI) was observed in seven patients undergoing treatment of the pelvic region and in two patients undergoing treatment of the thoracic region. The use of SA or PI, compared with a skin marker set-up, improved patient positioning in 50 % and 57 % of the thoracic fractions, respectively. For pelvic fractions, the use of PI was beneficial in 73 % of the cases, while the use of SA was beneficial in only 45 %. Patient <b>positioning</b> worsened with <b>SA,</b> particularly along longitudinal and vertical directions.

Here, we investigated the SA 14 - 14 - 2 -attenuation determinants by mutating E 107, E 138, E 176, E 177, and E 279 in SA 14 - 14 - 2 to their status in the parental virulent strain and tested the replication capacity, neurovirulence, neuroinvasiveness, and mortality associated with the mutated viruses in mice, as compared with those of JEV SA 14 - 14 - 2 and SA 14. Our findings indicated that revertant mutations at the E 138 or E 107 <b>position</b> significantly increased <b>SA</b> 14 - 14 - 2 virulence, whereas other revertant mutations exhibited significant increases in neurovirulence only when combined with E 138, E 107, and other mutations. Revertant mutations at all eight positions in the E protein resulted in the highest degree of SA 14 - 14 - 2 virulence, although this was still lower than that observed in SA 14. These results demonstrated the critical role of the viral E protein in controlling JEV virulence and identified the amino acids at the E 107 and E 138 positions as the key determinants of SA 14 - 14 - 2 neurovirulence...|$|R
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{is a very}} dynamic {{vehicle with}} many {{operational}} constraints that affect its performance, operations, and vehicle lifetime. Most constraints are designed to alleviate various safety concerns that {{are a result of}} dynamic activities between the ISS and various Visiting Vehicles (VVs). One such constraint that has been in place for Russian Vehicle (RV) operations is the limitation placed on Solar Array (<b>SA)</b> <b>positioning</b> in order to prevent collisions during separation and subsequent relative motion of VVs. An unintended consequence of the SA constraint has been the impacts to the operational flexibility of the ISS resulting from the reduced power generation capability as well as from a reduction in the operational lifetime of various SA components. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss the technique and the analysis that were applied in order to relax the SA constraints for RV undockings, thereby improving both the ISS operational flexibility and extending its lifetime for many years to come. This analysis focused on the effects of the dynamic motion that occur both prior to and following RV separations. The analysis involved a parametric approach in the conservative application of various initial conditions and assumptions. These included the use of the worst case minimum and maximum vehicle configurations, worst case initial attitudes and attitude rates, and the worst case docking port separation dynamics. Separations were calculated for multiple ISS docking ports, at varied deviations from the nominal undocking attitudes and included the use of two separate attitude control schemes: continuous free-drift and a post separation attitude hold. The analysis required numerical propagation of both the separation motion and the vehicle attitudes using 3 -degree-of-freedom (DOF) relative motion equations coupled with rigid body rotational dynamics to generate a large set of separation trajectories...|$|R
40|$|Bitcoin is {{a virtual}} crypto-currency that exists solely in {{electronic}} form. 1 Bitcoin was first launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, which is an alias for a programmer or group of programmers. 2 Bitcoin is defined as ?a digital, decentralized, partially anonymous currency, not backed by any government or other legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or other commodity?. 3 Virtual currency {{is a type of}} fund used and accepted in a virtual or online community. 4 Generally Bitcoin has been and is visible in South Africa (?SA?). It is more apparent in Cape Town. 5 The first commercial conference on Bitcoin was held in Cape Town on April 20156 and BitHub, a virtual currency hub and incubator, was launched by the Cape Innovation and Technology Initiative in June 2015. 7 On 7 September 2015, BitHub had a series of education Bitcoin courses which provided students with basic understanding of Bitcoin. 8 The use of Bitcoins as a medium of exchange is not yet widespread in SA, however, it has been noted that this industry is growing at a fast rate as several online retailers are now accepting Bitcoins as a means of payment for goods and services, for example Takealot. com. 9 SA has already installed its first Bitcoin vending machine, situated in Kyalami, north of Johannesburg, to give users the ability to get Bitcoins in exchange for rand. 10 South African authorities have been silent on how bitcoin transactions should be taxed and even regulated. Research on this matter is relatively limited in South Africa. Studies are thus needed and are relevant to address the South African taxation implications of bitcoin exchange transactions as countries such as Australia and the USA have already issued guidelines to taxpayers in this regard. The primary research objective {{of this study was to}} comparatively explore how Bitcoins should be classified in SA from a tax perspective. A comparative study was therefore performed to understand the current tax <b>position</b> in <b>SA</b> with regards to the classification of Bitcoins either as an asset or currency for Bitcoin transactions that may result in taxable income. The research has limitations in that it did not look at cross-border tax evasion, collection of taxes, permanent establishment rules and the enforcement of taxes on Bitcoin transactions. Tax legislation is vast in SA and therefore every type of transaction could not be analysed due to the extensive nature of tax. It was found that the current SA legislation does make provision for the classification of Bitcoin. However, it is suggested that SA authorities amend certain legislative requirements to cater for Bitcoin, as well as issue appropriate guidelines for the treatment of Bitcoin transactions, as was done in the U. S. and Australia. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Mercantile LawLLMUnrestricte...|$|R
