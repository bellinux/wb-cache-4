5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always {{wanted to make a}} video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

She later reminisced about her experience with Dupri: [...] "I am so grateful I went to Atlanta," [...] she said. [...] "And I have to say, we wrote <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> songs on the album. I'm so proud of Jermaine – he's so focused, and he knew {{what had to be}} done." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 8, 2012, Cudi {{announced}} Indicud, {{would be}} a double-disc album, until tweeting on October 28, 2012 that [...] "Indicud {{will not be a}} double disc but will contain a maximum of 17 brand new jams."

25|$|Garroway, {{an amateur}} drummer and inveterate music lover, lent {{his name to}} a series of {{recordings}} of jazz, classical, and pop music released in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Among them were Wide, Wide World <b>of</b> Jazz, 1957's <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Favorites</b> and 1958's Dave Garroway's Orchestra: An Adventure in Hi-Fi Music.|$|R
5000|$|I {{argued for}} her inclusion. Those scenes with her were <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites</b> in the {{original}} [...] - [...] they had some real emotion [...] - [...] and I honestly don't know why she isn't there. I haven't seen the sequel, but (when the film focuses) just on Miyagi, well, he's a great character, {{but after a while}} he can become sort of a walking fortune cookie with all of his sayings.|$|R
5000|$|I {{try to read}} as much as I can, and I {{find that}} reading good books and poetry always helps put my mind {{in the right place}} to write lyrics. Listening to other great songs helps too. Bob Dylan is one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> artists. His lyrics are {{incredible}} to me. They're very poetic and descriptive. I find that filling my mind with that type of stuff helps me write that way as well. Lately, I've been reading a lot of F. Scott Fitzgerald. One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> books <b>of</b> all time is Lord of the Flies. I like Charles Dickenstoo. They're <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites.</b> Matt Hires ...|$|R
500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Dungeon Master for Dummies lists Steading of the Hill Giant Chief {{as one of}} the ten best classic adventures. Stephen Colbert, {{who played}} Dungeons & Dragons as a child, reminisced about these modules: [...] "Those old [...] "Giants" [...] modules, those were tremendous. Those are <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> memories: working my way through fire giant, frost giant, and storm giant castles." [...] Ken Denmead of Wired said the first module is a [...] "pretty easy crash-and-grab," [...] the second {{contains}} [...] "some really excellent treasure," [...] but the third is [...] "the end-all, be-all of hack-fests". According to Denmead, the hill giant adventure does not prepare players for the later adventures. Describing the difficulty of battling the fire giants he said, [...] "remember Bambi Versus Godzilla? You're Bambi".|$|E
500|$|To get a {{feel for}} the era, X-Files {{composer}} Mark Snow listened to the big band music of Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Harry James. The [...] "bouncy instrumental" [...] that plays during the fight scene in the ballroom was inspired by a similar swing tune composed by John Williams for the 1979 Steven Spielberg film 1941. Snow later joked that his composition was [...] "the third generation of the same inspiration." [...] Carter had significant musical input when it came to scene transitions, saying, [...] "I got a chance to use <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> '40s music here, too, or '30s and '40s music to transition scenes." [...] The song that is heard near the end of the ballroom fight and in the scene featuring Scully and the Lone Gunmen searching for the Queen Anne is a piece of stock music called [...] "Hot Liquorice", composed by Dick Walters. Producer Paul Rabwin oversaw a special arrangement of the 1938 jazz standard [...] "Jeepers Creepers", which was included in the ballroom scene.|$|E
5000|$|Dean Norris (Hank Schrader) {{spoke about}} the [...] "tense" [...] family dinner scene: [...] "Those are <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites</b> because we all get together, and they've kind of become a {{signature}} thing on the show. I work with the DEA guys all the time, who I love, but from a personal side it's nice {{to hang out with}} the rest of the gang. Those scenes are going to be even more interesting if Hank ever knows something about Walt that Walt doesn't know he knows, because for the entire series Walt's had this secret that everybody in the audience knows and Hank is the one guy that doesn't know it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “It’s always difficult, but {{we use a}} {{democratic}} process and the songs with the most votes are usually {{the backbone of the}} album,” producer Rick Rubin wrote in an email. “I can just say as is always the case, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> personal <b>favorites</b> don’t make the cut. I’m sure everyone in the band can tell you the same.” ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{said the}} album's {{elaborate}} title {{was inspired by}} a heavily tattooed bar patron Sykes saw outside a club in Reno: [...] "I met this extraordinary guy. He was covered in tattoos, and he had three scripted L's tattooed on his wrist," [...] she recalled. [...] "When I asked him what it meant, he said, 'Like, Love, Lust, baby'—and he pointed at his wife and said, 'That's all that matters. You got that, and you got everything'." [...] Sykes said [...] "Aftermath" [...] drew its inspiration from Swedish singer-songwriter Nicolai Dunger, who provides backup vocals on another song, [...] "Station Grey". [...] "It was magical," [...] she said. [...] "He was just sitting on my couch and playing a bunch <b>of</b> his songs, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites.</b> He has kind of a strange, complicated style. I was so inspired, and I think 'Aftermath' came out of trying to incorporate that experience." ...|$|R

"I {{decided to}} pursue a career in {{engineering}} because I always had a fascination with bridges, and throughout my education math and science were <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> subjects.

[...] When I completed my education at Auburn I joined the firm and worked with my father for 20 years before taking over as President/CEO five years ago.

So much the better; they don't remind me of my deafness by trying to talk, and they keep as much as possible out of my way. This morning, after breakfast, I altered the arrangement of my books--and then I made my fourth attempt, in the last ten days, to read <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> authors. No: my taste has apparently changed since the time when I could hear. I closed one volume after another; caring nothing for what used to be deeply interesting to me.|$|E

5000|$|Snail's music shuns {{conventional}} {{melody and}} often includes elements of noise. Her unconventional approach to music was influenced, in part, by her experiences with hallucinogenics. In the early 1990s, she occasionally used LSD and magic mushrooms to enhance her perceptions. Though {{she has never}} used hallucinogenics since, she says, [...] "I'm {{a big believer in}} Timothy Leary and Aldous Huxley and a lot of important philosophers who have all taken drugs to expand their horizons.
