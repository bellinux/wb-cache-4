5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River {{to the mouth of}} the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E

25|$|The only virgin trees left {{untouched}} were on steep ground {{above the}} Laurel Hill Creek that was apparently {{too difficult for}} the loggers to reach. The Hemlock Trail now winds through this ancient <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees,</b> and is accessible from one end at the sharp bend on Buck Run Road, and from the other {{at the head of}} the lake.|$|E

50|$|The acacia tit inhabits arid and semi arid wooded and bushed savanna, principally in acacia and <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> along streams or rivers, {{avoiding}} truly arid regions. Recorded up to 2000m in Somalia.|$|R
50|$|The estate {{with its}} {{pastures}} and <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> {{that belongs to}} Syburg is about 7,000 m² in area and lies in the triangle formed by the cities of Dortmund, Schwerte and Hagen.|$|R
25|$|Selecting {{carefully}} {{the plant}} material {{with emphasis on}} getting a high genetic diversity rather than aiming at producing a uniform <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees,</b> is essential for sustainable use of FGR. Considering the provenance is crucial as well. For example in relation to climate change, local material {{may not have the}} genetic diversity or phenotypic plasticity to guarantee good performance under changed conditions. A different population from further away, which may have experienced selection under conditions more like those forecast for the site to be reforested, might represent a more suitable seed source.|$|E
25|$|From Skwentna, {{the route}} follows the Skwentna River into the {{southern}} part of the Alaska Range to Finger Lake. The stretch from Finger Lake to Rainy Pass on Puntilla Lake becomes more difficult, as teams follow the narrow Happy River Gorge, where the trail balances on the side of a heavily forested incline. Rainy Pass is the most dangerous check point in the Iditarod. In 1985, Jerry Austin broke a hand and two of his dogs were injured when the sled went out of control and hit a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> Many others have suffered from this dangerous checkpoint. Rainy Pass is part of the Historic Iditarod Trail, but until 1976 the pass was inaccessible and route detoured through Ptarmigan Pass, also known as Hellsgate, because of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake.|$|E
25|$|At {{approximately}} 11:00 am on Wednesday, 6 April 1966, a {{class of}} students and a teacher from Westall High School (now Westall Secondary College) were just completing a sport activity on the main oval when an object, described as being a grey saucer-shaped craft with a slight purple hue and being about {{twice the size of}} a family car, was alleged to have been seen. Witness descriptions were mixed: Andrew Greenwood, a science teacher, told The Dandenong Journal {{at the time that he}} saw a silvery-green disc. According to witnesses the object was descending and then crossed and overflew the high school's south-west corner, going in a south-easterly direction, before disappearing from sight as it descended behind a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> and into a paddock at The Grange in front of the Westall State School (primary students). After a short period (approximately 20 minutes) the object – with witnesses now numbering over 200 – then climbed at speed and departed towards the north-west. As the object gained altitude some accounts describe it as having been pursued from the scene by five unidentified aircraft which circled the object.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} {{threatened}} by habitat loss, with both forest fires and nickel mining activities posing ongoing threats to the remaining populations, although some <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> are located within protected national park areas.|$|R
25|$|Areas {{of heavy}} {{rainfall}} contain <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> bamboo, ferns, ebony, mahogany, and rosewood. Cactus and similar dry-area plants are found {{along the south}} and southwest coastal area. Parts {{of the west and}} southwest consist of large grasslands, with scattered <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{quality and}} density <b>of</b> its <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> gives the Holzland ("wood land") its name. Even during times when {{large areas of}} the Palatine Forest were {{depleted}} by wood pasture practices, charcoal burning and mining, valuable <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> woodland survived for centuries in this area.|$|R
500|$|The hill is {{surrounded}} by terraced earthwork banks and ditches and a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> On the north west and south sides there are 4 ramparts, with two remaining on the east. The summit plateau covers , and {{is surrounded}} by the inner bank which is [...] long. The hill fort is overlooked by Sigwells, a rural plateau rich in archaeological remains. Due to scrub and tree growth the site {{has been added to}} the Heritage at Risk register.|$|E
500|$|On January 7, 1994, United Express Flight 6291 was a BAe Jetstream 41 being {{operated}} by Atlantic Coast Airlines; {{it was on}} approach to runway 28L when it entered into a stall at [...] above runway level. The aircraft collided with a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> and came to rest inside a commercial building [...] short of the runway and burst into flames. The accident killed two of three crewmembers and five of nine passengers. The probable cause was attributed to [...] "(1) An aerodynamic stall that occurred when the flight crew allowed the airspeed to decay to stall speed following a very poorly planned and executed approach characterized by an absence of procedural discipline; (2) Improper pilot response to the stall warning, including failure to advance the power levers to maximum, and inappropriately raising the flaps; (3) Flight crew experience in 'glass cockpit' automated aircraft, aircraft type and in seat position, a situation exacerbated by a side letter of agreement between {{the company and its}} pilots; and (4) the company's failure to provide adequate stabilized approach criteria, and the FAA's failure to require such criteria.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of Howard Hughes' personal 307 also survives, {{although it}} has been converted into a houseboat. The aircraft was awaiting restoration at Fort Lauderdale international airport when it was severely damaged in a hurricane in the early 1960s, having been blown into a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> after its tiedowns failed. [...] The aircraft languished for nearly a year before being removed and longer still until later salvaged for its conversion into the house boat. [...] The interior is notable for the original finishes and fitments added by Howard Hughes.|$|E
50|$|Stabilization of {{the river}} channel through clearing, pilot channels, and jetty fields has {{resulted}} in the establishment of large wooded riparian areas called the bosque. Previously, large <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> were destroyed during heavy runoff years because the river meandered {{back and forth across the}} channel from levee to levee. The areas between the cleared floodway and the riverside levees are now filled with a permanent <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> large <b>trees</b> and other dense growths of vegetation. The invasion of nonnative species, as well as the lack <b>of</b> native <b>tree</b> regeneration, is <b>of</b> environmental concern.|$|R
5000|$|In forestry, {{monoculture}} {{refers to}} the planting of one species <b>of</b> <b>tree.</b> Monoculture plantings provide great yields and more efficient harvesting than natural <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> Single-species <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> are often the natural way trees grow, but the stands show a diversity in tree sizes, with dead trees mixed with mature and young trees. In forestry, monoculture stands that are planted and harvested as a unit provide limited resources for wildlife that depend on dead trees and openings, since all the trees are the same size; they are most often harvested by clearcutting, which drastically alters the habitat. The mechanical harvesting <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> can compact soils, which can adversely affect understory growth. [...] Single-species planting <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> also are more vulnerable when infected with a pathogen, or are attacked by insects, and by adverse environmental conditions.|$|R

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was descending through {{an altitude of}} [...] when the stick shaker activated and sounded for 3 seconds. After 1.5 seconds, the stick shaker sounded again. The aircraft continued to descend below the glide slope until it collided with a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> in a high nose-up attitude. It came to rest upright in a commercial building, [...] short of the runway. After the impact, a fire started {{in or near the}} left engine, which spread {{to the rest of the}} aircraft. At least four of the passengers survived the crash, however, only three escaped before the {{aircraft was}} fully engulfed in flames.|$|E
2500|$|The town of Nerstrand {{was settled}} in the 1850s, though unlike most prairie farming {{communities}} they were fortunate to have a <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> nearby. [...] Following a pattern of their European homeland, the adjacent forest was divided into woodlots, typically of [...] each, which the individual owners managed {{according to their own}} needs. [...] The timbers and planks for most of the area's barns, and some of its houses, were cut from old-growth oak present in the area that is now the park. [...] Some lots were cleared for farming or grazing, but many were left as sustainable sources of firewood. [...] This mosaic of uses created patches where native animals and plants could survive and then recolonize other lots as usage changed over the years, resulting in the high quality of the habitat today. [...] In the 1930s large lumber companies attempted to acquire the land for logging. However, the lots were divided among 169 owners, not all of whom even lived in Minnesota anymore, and buying enough land to log commercially proved to be so complicated that each company gave up.|$|E

25|$|Trees in {{the area}} date from the {{founding}} of the University in the 1870s. The campus, itself, contains numerous wooded areas; including: Founders' Rock, Faculty Glade, Grinnell Natural Area, and the Eucalyptus Grove, which is both the tallest <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> such <b>trees</b> {{in the world and the}} tallest <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> hardwood <b>trees</b> in North America.|$|R
