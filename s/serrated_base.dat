40|$|The {{offshore}} caisson breakwater at Costa Azul {{installed in}} 25 m water depth {{is designed to}} withstand Pacific swell waves up to a PLS test case Hs 9. 2 m Tp 18. 6 s. Overall stability design is {{in accordance with the}} recommendations of PIANC WG 28. The critical failure mechanism is sliding, and the caisson base is cast with a deliberately roughened (serrated) profile to increase sliding resistance and optimize the caisson cross section. Site based testing at prototype scale was conducted to validate the coefficient of friction used for design between the caisson base and nominal 100 mm single size granular bedding material. This testing confirms that the use of a suitably dimensioned <b>serrated</b> <b>base</b> profile allows the full internal angle of friction (with allowance for dilation) of the bedding material to develop {{at the base of the}} caisson, allowing the cross section design to be optimized...|$|E
40|$|The {{secretory}} {{coils of}} glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide-fixed and Epon-Araldite-embedded eccrine sweat glands from {{the palms of}} young men were studied with the electron microscope. The myoepithclial cells lie on the epithelial side of the basement membrane and abut other epithelial elements directly. The irregularly <b>serrated</b> <b>base</b> of the cell has dense thickenings along the plasma membranc which alternate with zones bcaring pits; the smooth apical surface lacks dense thickenings, is studded with pits, and conjoined to secretory cells by cccasional desmosomes. Masses of myofilaments, 50 A in diameter, fill most of the cell and are associated with irregular dense zones. In cross-section {{the arrangement of the}} myofilaments seems identical with that of the I band of striated muscle, and the dense zone has typical Z band structure. A few microtubules and cytoplasmic cores bearing profiles of the endoplasmic reticulum, filamentous mitochondria, and glycogen granules penetrate the fibrillar masses and run parallel to the oriented myofilaments. In the perinuclear zone, Golgi membranes, rough- and smooth-surfaced elements of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, glycogen, microtubules, lipid, pigment, and dense granules are variable components in the cytoplasm. The interrelationships of the myoepithelial cells with the secretory cells suggest that the former may act as regulators, controlling the flow of metabolites to the secretory epithelium...|$|E

This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly <b>serrated</b> near the <b>base</b> and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip.

40|$|Most {{international}} post polypectomy surveillance guidelines do not recommend surveillance for serrated polyps. In {{the present study}} the additional impact of serrated polyps on surveillance intervals from international adenoma surveillance guidelines was investigated. Endoscopic and pathology records were audited {{of participants in the}} NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (guaiac faecal occult blood test, gFOBT) in 2011. Surveillance intervals were calculated for current guidelines and also for <b>serrated</b> polyps <b>based</b> on previously described aggressive and conservative strategies. In total, 389 patients were included of whom 141 (36. 2 %) were high risk (advanced adenoma: adenoma ≥ 10 mm, villous elements, high grade dysplasia, or adenoma ≥ 3 in number) needing surveillance at ≤ 3 years. Thirty-three (8. 5 %) had significant serrated polyps, of whom 18 (4. 6 % of the total) had significant serrated lesions and simultaneous advanced adenoma or ≥ 3 adenomas. Adopting an aggressive surveillance strategy, the mean overall absolute additional proportion of all such patients in the surveillance group at 3 years or less was 4. 0 % (3. 9 % - 4. 1 %; 4. 2 % women; 3. 8 % men). These proportions varied according to endoscopist from 2. 3 % to 4. 7 %. For more conservative strategies the increase was only 1 %. The impact of including serrated polyps in current guidelines would result in a small increase in surveillance intervals for FOBT based bowel cancer screening. About half of those who might need surveillance for serrated polyps would already receive surveillance for being in a high risk adenoma grou...|$|R
40|$|Background Classification {{schemes for}} {{differentiation}} of conventional colorectal adenomas from serrated lesions rely on patterns {{of blood vessels}} and pits. Morphologic features have not been validated as predictors of histology. Aim Describe the prevalence of the “valley sign” and validate it as a marker of conventional adenomas Methods Three experts judged the prevalence of the valley sign in 301 consecutive small adenomas. Medical students were taught to recognize the valley and tested on their recognition of the valley sign. Consecutive diminutive polyps were video-recorded and used to validate the association of the valley sign with conventional adenomas. Results The prevalence of the valley sign in 301 consecutive adenomas < 10 mm in size, determined by 3 experts, ranged from 35 % to 50 %. Kappa values for agreement among the 3 experts were 0. 557, 0. 679, and 0. 642. Ten medical students were taught to interpret the valley sign and recognized it with accuracy of 96 % or higher in 50 selected photographs of diminutive polyps. Four medical students evaluated video-recordings of 170 consecutive diminutive polyps {{for the presence of}} the valley sign. Kappa values for the interpretation of the valley sign ranged from 0. 52 to 0. 68 among the students. The sensitivity of the valley sign for adenoma ranged from 40. 2 % to 54. 9 %, and specificity ranged from 90. 2 % to 91. 7 %. The valley sign was strongly associated with adenomas (p< 0. 0001). Conclusions The valley sign is insensitive but highly specific for conventional adenoma in diminutive polyps. It may enhance classification schemes for differentiation of adenomas from <b>serrated</b> lesions <b>based</b> on vessels and pits...|$|R
5|$|The snout {{is rather}} short, broad, and rounded, without {{prominent}} flaps of skin beside the nostrils. The eyes {{are large and}} circular, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). There are 1113 tooth rows in either half of both jaws. The teeth have broad <b>bases,</b> <b>serrated</b> edges, and narrow cusps; the front 24 teeth on each side are erect and the others increasingly oblique. The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long, with the third gill slit over {{the origin of the}} pectoral fins. The first dorsal fin is high and falcate (sickle-shaped). There is a low interdorsal ridge running behind it to the second dorsal fin, which is relatively large with a short free rear tip. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the free rear tips of the pectoral fins, and that of the second dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are long and narrow, tapering to a point. The dermal denticles are closely spaced and overlapping, each with five (sometimes seven in large individuals) horizontal low ridges leading to marginal teeth.|$|R
