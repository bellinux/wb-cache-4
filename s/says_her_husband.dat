25|$|Frankie meets two {{neighbours}} of the Bassington-ffrenches – Dr Nicholson and {{his younger}} wife, Moira. Dr Nicholson runs a local sanatorium. Frankie writes to Bobby and gets him to investigate the establishment. On the grounds at night, Bobby encounters a girl who says that she fears for her life; she is the original of the photograph that Bobby found in the dead man's pocket. Several days later, Moira Nicholson turns up at the local inn where Bobby stays in his disguise as Frankie's chauffeur. She <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> is trying to kill her and says she knew Alan Carstairs before her marriage to the doctor. Bobby introduces her to Frankie. Moira suggests they ask Roger if he took the photograph {{from the body of}} the dead man. At the next opportunity, Frankie asks. Roger admits that he took the photo, recognising Moira and wanting to avoid scandal for her. Frankie leaves after Henry is found dead in his home, an apparent suicide.|$|E
6000|$|The Smails did not [...] "believe in {{all this}} nonsense" [...] about privacy and reticence. When Carol left a letter from her sister on the table, she was astounded to hear from Uncle Whittier, [...] "I see your sister <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> is doing fine. You ought to go see her oftener. I asked Will and he says you don't go see her very often. My! You ought to go see her oftener!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> [...] "but I value it, for I won't {{have such}} a blot lie upon the family, and upon your children; he was a worthy, ancient, and good man, and his name is {{respected}} among all his neighbours; {{it will be a}} reproach to you, that are his daughter, and to our children, that are his grandchildren, that we should let your brother's children perish, or come to be a charge to the public, in the very place where your family once flourished. Come, say no more; I will see what can be done." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Now I {{write to}} state my reaction," [...] added Lario, <b>saying</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband's</b> {{comments}} were [...] "unacceptable" [...] {{and could not}} be reduced to mere jokes.|$|R
50|$|Sources vary about <b>her</b> <b>husband's</b> identity. Some chronicles <b>say</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> was a {{handsome}} man who failed to assassinate her father and was taken prisoner; others refer to him as Kaidu's companion from the Choros clan. Rashid al-Din wrote that Khutulun {{fell in love with}} Ghazan, Mongol ruler in Persia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, so have I been {{thinking}} too, Rick," [...] said my guardian, [...] "and our little woman likewise; she and I {{have been talking}} of it this very day. I dare <b>say</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> won't object. What do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As far as I can see," [...] {{continued}} Frank, [...] "she has a fair {{claim to}} them. I suppose they'll file {{a bill in}} Chancery, {{and then it will}} be out of my line altogether. She <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> gave them to her,--absolutely put them on her neck himself, and told her that they were hers. As to their being an heirloom, {{that turns out to be}} impossible. I didn't know it, but it seems you can't make diamonds an heirloom. What astonishes me is, that Fawn should object to the necklace. However, he has objected, and has simply told her that he won't marry her unless she gives them up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I kept {{my letter}} open, that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey, and now I am {{extremely}} glad I did, {{having a great}} deal to add. In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like. The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants. I shall be truly glad to have them back again. Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family. But now for Louisa. I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little. She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles; {{and what do you think}} was the reason? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville. True, upon my honour! Are not you astonished? I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did. Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter. We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day. Mrs Harville <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> feels a good deal on his poor sister's account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both. Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her. Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see anything of it. And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours. How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me. I hope he will be more agreeable now. Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters." ...|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after Janice's departure, Tony and {{his younger}} sister Barbara arrive at Livia's home to discuss her {{permanent}} living arrangements.

5000|$|However, she <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> was [...] "a {{frustrated}} film director", so {{she came}} out of retirement to appear in a movie produced and directed by him, Breakdown (1952).

She did appear in an episode of General Electric Theatre, [...] "They Like Me Fine" [...] in 1960.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{he was a}} sort of hanger-on, Mrs. Dr. dear, but {{you could}} not exactly call him a beau. He did not really have any intentions. Twenty-one beaus--and me that never had one! But Barbara went through the woods and picked up the crooked stick after all.

Denise says hers locked her in a basement, so Gail says it does not compare to being in prison, to which Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) says Gail is the winner. Michelle and Alfie sing karaoke but are stopped by Kat, who tells them to get out of her pub. She then sees a charm on Liz's {{bracelet}} and asks her to explain it. Liz says she gave up a child for adoption and made charms out of two nappy pins, one which she kept and one which she gave to the adoptive parents to give to her daughter when she turned 18. Liz says they probably did not do that, but Kat says maybe they did, revealing an identical charm. Kat insists Liz is not her mother, but Liz says she is (referencing the majorly recognised Kat and Zoe cliffhanger from 2001).|$|E

She <b>says</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> was a cautious man and probably only died because he was showing off to the woman, trying to prove his manliness, and thereby taking unnecessary risks, rather than hanging back and staying safe.|$|E
