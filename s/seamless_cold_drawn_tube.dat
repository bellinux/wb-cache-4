40|$|The {{current study}} {{is a part of}} a long term {{experimental}} project devoted to investigate flow boiling heat transfer, pressure drop and flow visualization of R 134 a in small to mini/micro-diameter tubes. The experimental facility was first designed and constructed by X. Huo (2005) with the contribution of L. Chen (2006). In the present study, the experimental facility was upgraded by changing the heating system from AC to DC heating and also upgrading the logging system through using a faster data logger and developing a new Labview program. The objectives of the current study include (i) contribute in identifying the reasons behind the wide scatter in the published flow boiling heat transfer results, (ii) contribute in understanding the fundamentals of flow boiling heat transfer in mini/micro-diameter tubes and (iii) evaluation of the existing heat transfer and pressure drop prediction methods. Two sizes of stainless steel tubes were investigated in the current study; 0. 52 mm and 1. 1 mm diameter. In the current study, the 0. 52 mm tube was roughly called a “micro-tube” whilst the 1. 1 mm tubes were called “mini-tubes”. The present study proposes two possible reasons for the scatter in the published heat transfer results. The first reason is the variations in the heated length from one study to another–there is no criterion for choosing the heated length. The second reason is the variations in the inner surface characteristics of the channels from one study to another. These two important parameters were not taken into consideration by researchers in the past studies. Accordingly, the effect of the heated length was investigated in the current study using a <b>seamless</b> <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>tube</b> with diameter of 1. 1 mm and heated length ranging from 150 to 450 mm. The effect of the tube inner surface was also tested here by conducting the test in two stainless steel tubes with diameter of 1. 1 mm and manufactured by two different processes. The first tube was manufactured by welding technique whilst the second tube was a <b>seamless</b> <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>tube.</b> Both tubes were identical in design and dimensions. The inner surface of each tube was examined first using SEM analysis and demonstrated that, the surface morphology is completely different. The local heat transfer coefficient was determined through measuring the local wall temperature using 14 K-type thermocouples attached to the wall using thermally conducting but electrically insulating epoxy supplied by Omega. Pressure drop was measured directly across the heated section and a high speed camera was used for the flow visualization at 1000 frames/s. All measurements were recorded after the system attained steady state. The experimental conditions include mass flux range of 100 – 500 kg/m 2 s, system pressure range of 6 – 10 bar, inlet sub-cooling of about 5 K and exit quality up to about 0. 9. The most frequently observed flow regimes in the 0. 52 mm tube were found to be slug (elongated bubble), transition to annular and annular flow regimes. In the 1. 1 mm tube, the observed regimes were found to be slug, churn and annular. The transition from slug flow to annular flow in the 0. 52 mm tube occurred smoothly with little disturbances at the liquid vapour interface compared to the 1. 1 mm tube. Additionally, increasing the heated length of the 1. 1 mm tube was found to shift the transition to annular flow to occur at lower vapour quality. The heat transfer results demonstrated that the behaviour of the local heat transfer coefficient in the 0. 52 mm diameter tube is different compared to that in the 1. 1 mm tubes. Also, the tube inner surface characteristics and the heated length were found to strongly influence the local behaviour of the heat transfer coefficient. Flow boiling hysteresis was investigated and the results indicated that hysteresis exists only at very low heat fluxes near the boiling incipience. Existing heat transfer and pressure drop correlations were examined using the results of the 0. 52 and 1. 1 mm seamless cold drawn tubes. The pressure drop data were predicted very well using the Muller-Stienhagen and Heck (1986) correlation, the homogeneous flow model and the correlation of Mishima and Hibiki (1996). On the contrary, all macro and microscale heat correlations failed to predict the current experimental data. The mechanistic models failed to predict the data of all tubes with the same accuracy. Accordingly, two heat transfer correlations were proposed in the current study. The first correlation is based on dimensionless groups whilst the second is based on the superposition model of Chen (1966). Both correlations predicted the current experimental data and the data of Huo (2005) and Shiferaw (2008) very well.

Stephenson's valve gear replaced the previous Joy motion. This engine was used on all vehicles developed thereafter. Again, the car neither possessed nor needed a clutch or transmission, and due to the engine being integrated directly into the rear axle, it did not need a drive shaft either. Like all steam vehicles it could burn a variety of liquid fuels with a minimum of modification and was a noticeably clean running vehicle, its fuel being burned at high temperatures and low pressures, which produced very low pollution.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the experimental and theoretical study of flow boiling in small to micro diameter tubes using R 134 a. Flow pattern, heat transfer and pressure drop studies were conducted in stainless steel <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>tubes</b> with internal diameter 2. 88, 1. 1, and 0. 52 mm using an existing facility that was designed with a long term research objective of improving the fundamental understanding of flow boiling in small metallic tubes. The facility was moved to the present location from London South Bank University and re-commissioned before carrying out the experiments. The test sections were heated by a direct passage of alternating current and wall temperatures were measured at 15 axial locations by miniature thermocouples that were directly spotwelded at the tube outer wall. A digital high-speed camera was used to simultaneously observe the flow patterns (during the heat transfer tests) directly at a borosilicate glass tube located immediately downstream of the heat transfer test section. The purpose of the flow visualization study was to support understanding of the heat transfer characteristics and development of flow regime-specific models. The heat transfer and pressure drop data of X. Huo (2005) in the 4. 26 and 2. 01 mm tubes and the flow visualization results of Chen (2006) for the tubes of diameter 4. 26, 2. 88, 2. 01, and 1. 1 mm were included with the new data in an extensive analysis of flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop in five vertical tubes with internal diameters 4. 26, 2. 88, 2. 01, 1. 1 and 0. 52 mm. The wide range of tube diameter was chosen to investigate the influence of tube size and possibly identify the threshold where the effect of small or micro diameter effects become significant. In the experiments, parameters were varied in the ranges: mass flux 100 to 700 kg/m 2 s; heat flux 1. 6 to 150 kW/m; pressure 6 to 14 bar; quality up to 0. 9 and the inlet temperature was controlled at a subcooling of 1 - 5 K. There was no clear significant difference between the characteristics and magnitude of the heat transfer coefficients in the 4. 26 mm and 2. 88 mm tubes but the coefficients in the 2. 01 and 1. 1 mm tube were higher. The heat transfer results suggested that a tube size of about 2 mm might be considered as a critical diameter to distinguish small and conventional tubes. Further differences have now been observed in the 0. 52 mm tube. These differences, both in flow patterns and heat transfer, indicate a possible second change from small to micro behaviour at diameters less than 1 mm for R 134 a. Also, the results showed axial variations in heat transfer characteristics marking the importance of surface conditions on heat transfer. This calls for a further detail investigation to understand the underlying physics in the initiation of boiling, effect of surface condition on nucleation, and structure of newly emerging flow patterns, particularly in very small tubes. Existing correlations were examined using the results of the five tubes and indicated that these correlations do not predict the present small diameter data to a satisfactory degree. Therefore, two new correlations that take into account both magnitude and characteristic effect of tube diameter have been proposed covering the 4. 26 mm- 1. 1 mm and the smallest 0. 52 mm tube, respectively. A detailed comparison was also made with the state-of-the-art flow regime-specific model of Thome et al. (2004) and verified that the mechanistic modelling approach has a promising capability of predicting two phase heat transfer in small diameter tubes, although it still requires further development. Some improvements have been proposed and tested against the current data. Using a similar approach, a new two phase pressure drop model has been proposed and compared with the current data with encouraging results.

This thesis {{is dedicated to the}} experimental and theoretical study of flow boiling in small to micro diameter tubes using R 134 a. Flow pattern, heat transfer and pressure drop studies were conducted in stainless steel <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>tubes</b> with internal diameter 2. 88, 1. 1, and 0. 52 mm using an existing facility that was designed with a long term research objective of improving the fundamental understanding of flow boiling in small metallic tubes. The facility was moved to the present location from London South Bank University and re-commissioned before carrying out the experiments. The test sections were heated by a direct passage of alternating current and wall temperatures were measured at 15 axial locations by miniature thermocouples that were directly spotwelded at the tube outer wall. A digital high-speed camera was used to simultaneously observe the flow patterns (during the heat transfer tests) directly at a borosilicate glass tube located immediately downstream of the heat transfer test section. The purpose of the flow visualization study was to support understanding of the heat transfer characteristics and development of flow regime-specific models. The heat transfer and pressure drop data of X. Huo (2005) in the 4. 26 and 2. 01 mm tubes and the flow visualization results of Chen (2006) for the tubes of diameter 4. 26, 2. 88, 2. 01, and 1. 1 mm were included with the new data in an extensive analysis of flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop in five vertical tubes with internal diameters 4. 26, 2. 88, 2. 01, 1. 1 and 0. 52 mm. The wide range of tube diameter was chosen to investigate the influence of tube size and possibly identify the threshold where the effect of small or micro diameter effects become significant. In the experiments, parameters were varied in the ranges: mass flux 100 to 700 kg/m 2 s; heat flux 1. 6 to 150 kW/m; pressure 6 to 14 bar; quality up to 0. 9 and the inlet temperature was controlled at a subcooling of 1 - 5 K. There was no clear significant difference between the characteristics and magnitude of the heat transfer coefficients in the 4. 26 mm and 2. 88 mm tubes but the coefficients in the 2. 01 and 1. 1 mm tube were higher. The heat transfer results suggested that a tube size of about 2 mm might be considered as a critical diameter to distinguish small and conventional tubes. Further differences have now been observed in the 0. 52 mm tube. These differences, both in flow patterns and heat transfer, indicate a possible second change from small to micro behaviour at diameters less than 1 mm for R 134 a. Also, the results showed axial variations in heat transfer characteristics marking the importance of surface conditions on heat transfer. This calls for a further detail investigation to understand the underlying physics in the initiation of boiling, effect of surface condition on nucleation, and structure of newly emerging flow patterns, particularly in very small tubes. Existing correlations were examined using the results of the five tubes and indicated that these correlations do not predict the present small diameter data to a satisfactory degree. Therefore, two new correlations that take into account both magnitude and characteristic effect of tube diameter have been proposed covering the 4. 26 mm- 1. 1 mm and the smallest 0. 52 mm tube, respectively. A detailed comparison was also made with the state-of-the-art flow regime-specific model of Thome et al. (2004) and verified that the mechanistic modelling approach has a promising capability of predicting two phase heat transfer in small diameter tubes, although it still requires further development. Some improvements have been proposed and tested against the current data. Using a similar approach, a new two phase pressure drop model has been proposed and compared with the current data with encouraging results.

Experimental result shows that: Tensile strength of two wire are almost same. After <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> tensile strength of wire with reserved texture are higher than tensile strength of the without one. Before <b>cold</b> <b>drawn,</b> two wires have same microstructure of isometric pearlite and after drawing the wire with reserved texture has less shear deformed pearlitic colony.

40|$|Magnesium alloys have, {{in recent}} years, been {{recognized}} as highly promising biodegradable materials, especially for vascular stent applications. Forming of magnesium alloys into high-precision thin-wall tubes has however presented a technological barrier in the fabrication of vascular stents, because of the poor workability of magnesium at room temperature. In the present study, the forming processes, i. e., hot indirect extrusion and multi-pass <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> were used to fabricate seamless microtubes of a magnesium alloy. The magnesium alloy ZM 21 was selected as a representative biomaterial for biodegradable stent applications. Microtubes with an outside diameter of 2. 9  mm and a wall thickness of 0. 2  mm were successfully produced at the fourth pass of <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> without inter-pass annealing. Dimensional evaluation showed that multi-pass <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> was effective in correcting dimensional non-uniformity arising from hot indirect extrusion.
