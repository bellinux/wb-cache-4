5|$|A {{researcher}} {{examining the}} skeleton identifies {{it as the}} missing victim from 1933. However, {{there seems to be}} no <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> proving that Tooms was the murderer. Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they are unaware that Tooms is hiding in the trunk of Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E
5|$|In a 2005 Canadian dispute, Rogers Media and Newcap Broadcasting {{maintained}} a joint sales agreement pertaining to CHNO-FM in Sudbury, Ontario, but community {{interests and the}} lobby group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting presented <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that in practice, the agreement was a de facto LMA, going significantly beyond advertising sales into program production and news-gathering. LMAs in Canada cannot be implemented without the CRTC's approval, and in early 2005, the CRTC ordered the agreement to cease.|$|E
5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E

5|$|The EC, {{is located}} in the parahippocampal gyrus, a {{cortical}} region adjacent to the hippocampus. This gyrus conceals the hippocampus. The parahippocampal gyrus also includes the perirhinal cortex which {{plays an important role in}} the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> that it makes a contribution to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of the hippocampus. It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are damaged.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E
5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E
60|$|Arguments {{like these}} were suited to an {{age in which}} even the most learned were obliged to grope their way to {{accurate}} knowledge, through the mists of superstition and ignorance, and {{in which it was}} a prevailing weakness to put faith, on the one hand, in visible proofs of the miraculous power of God, and, on the other, in <b>substantial</b> <b>evidences</b> of the ascendency of evil spirits, as they were permitted to affect the temporal affairs of those they persecuted.|$|R
40|$|Neutron-proton (np-) pairing is {{expected}} {{to play an important}} role in the N Z nuclei. In general, it can have isovector and isoscalar character. The existence of isovector np-pairing is well established. On the contrary, it is still debated whether there is an isoscalar np-pairing. The review of the situation with these two types of pairing with special emphasis on the isoscalar one is presented. It is concluded that there are no <b>substantial</b> <b>evidences</b> for the existence of isoscalar np-pairing. Comment: 18 pages, 4 figures, chapter in "Fifty Years of Nuclear BCS", eds. R. A.

40|$|International audienceSamples of carbon-black filled styrene {{butadiene}} rubbers (SBRs) were submitted to successive nonproportional loadings {{in order to}} define a general criterion for the Mullins softening. For this purpose, each sample was initially submitted to uniaxial or biaxial preloadings followed by a cyclic uniaxial tension test. An original experimental analysis aimed at defining the activation threshold for the Mullins softening during cyclic uniaxial loadings. The experimental data provide <b>substantial</b> <b>evidences</b> establishing {{the surface of the}} maximum directional stretch undergone by the material as a relevant Mullins softening criterion. The latter was used to successfully predict the Mullins softening surfaces for additional loading cases...|$|R
5|$|Rumours {{of affairs}} did not {{surround}} only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise's presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours {{that the two}} were having an affair. Boehm's assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who {{played a central role}} in comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues that there is no <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> to suggest that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband.|$|E
5|$|In northwestern Iowa, Great Oasis {{underwent}} {{dramatic changes}} as Mill Creek sites appeared. While Mill Creek has many stylistic similarities with Great Oasis and some Mill Creek sites contain Great Oasis ceramic forms, Mill Creek sites are substantially different. Mill Creek sites became nucleated, often fortified, {{had a much}} higher dependence on maize and bison hunting, show <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> of long-distance trade, and {{appear to have been}} occupied year-round. The Phipps and Chan-Ya-Ta sites are classic examples. Glenwood culture sites in southwest Iowa near the Missouri River appear to be unrelated to the earlier Great Oasis sites, and are notable for their large earthlodge sites. Glenwood sites appear to have been more oriented in lifeways and trade with the Central Plains Tradition cultures to the west than with the Mississippian cultures to the southeast. Around 1300 AD Mill Creek and Glenwood sites in Iowa disappeared, replaced by the rapidly spreading Oneota cultures.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E

5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E
5|$|During the {{settlement}} period the lands {{ruled by the}} incomers {{seem to have been}} fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when <b>substantial</b> <b>evidence</b> of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued. The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence. In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded {{at the expense of the}} kingdoms of the Danelaw. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea Empire that also included Denmark and Norway. However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.|$|E

30|$|<b>Substantial</b> <b>evidences</b> have {{confirmed}} that the main anti-inflammatory mechanism of ethyl pyruvate is attributed to the inhibition of levels and secretion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1; Ulloa et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2013), which is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine in activation of inflammatory reaction. It is known that HMGB 1 releases from nuclei into extracellular milieu in response to exogenous and endogenous stimuli, subsequently, it binds to receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), which is a known receptor for HMGB 1, and then activates nuclear factor (NF)-ΚB to mediate the production and release of other cytokines, such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, etc. (Ulloa and Messmer 2006; Xu et al. 2010).|$|R
