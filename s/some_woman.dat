500|$|Writer Joss Whedon {{says that}} [...] "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress" [...] {{was really the}} first {{incarnation}} of the Buffy concept, [...] "just the idea of <b>some</b> <b>woman</b> {{who seems to be}} completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary". This early, unproduced idea evolved into Buffy, an inversion of the Hollywood formula of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie". Whedon wanted [...] "to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero". He explained, [...] "The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it".|$|E
500|$|In early 1922, Zelda again became pregnant. Although {{some writers}} {{have said that}} Scott's diaries include an entry {{referring}} to [...] "Zelda and her abortionist", there is, in fact, no such entry. Zelda's thoughts on the second pregnancy are unknown, but in {{the first draft of}} The Beautiful and Damned, the novel Scott was completing, he wrote a scene in which the main female character Gloria believes she is pregnant and Anthony suggests she [...] "talk to <b>some</b> <b>woman</b> and find out what's best to be done. Most of them fix it some way." [...] Anthony's suggestion was removed from the final version, a change which shifted focus from the abortion choice to Gloria's concern that a baby would ruin her figure.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Some</b> <b>women</b> wear pasties when {{wearing a}} strapless or backless dress. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> {{who choose to}} be braless may at times wear pasties.

2500|$|In January 2016, {{an unnamed}} woman {{who wrote that}} {{she was married to}} Gafni from 1999 to 2004 {{published}} an opinion piece in The Times of Israel in response to a New York Times article about Gafni the preceding week. She catalogued what she described as her [...] "story of abuse" [...] and wrote that she had gone public to [...] "Protect some girl. Protect <b>some</b> <b>woman.</b> Some student. Some unsuspecting soul." [...] Within two weeks, Sara Kabakov revealed in The Forward that she was the formerly unnamed teenage girl who had been abused by Gafni in the early 1980s, beginning when she was thirteen years old. Gafni commented, [...] "she was 14 going on 35, and I never forced her." [...] In a subsequent article, The Forward published Gafni's response together with the analysis of sexual abuse experts. Gafni included polygraph results to support his claim that his relationship with Kabakov was consensual.|$|E

A few {{visitors}} cheered these days, but, toward the end, he was frequently too sick to see any of them. By September 1830, Hazlitt was confined to his bed, with his son in attendance, his pain so acute that his doctor kept him drugged on opium much of the time. His last few days were spent in delirium, obsessed with <b>some</b> <b>woman,</b> which in later years gave rise to speculation: was it Sarah Walker? Or was it, as biographer Stanley Jones believes, {{more likely to have}} been a woman he had met more recently at the theatre? Finally, with his son and a few others in attendance, he died on 18 September. His last words were reported to have been [...] "Well, I've had a happy life".|$|E

However many women feel the value of buying some maternity clothes because they can be worn the entire pregnancy as opposed to buying larger sizes that are not likely to grow with a pregnant women the entire pregnancy.

5000|$|Doggy style sex has {{advantages}} and disadvantages. In a doggy style position, a woman may feel exceptionally vulnerable, which <b>some</b> <b>women</b> find arousing in itself; while others consider doggy style sex unromantic.

However, this position may offer only minimal stimulation of the clitoris, so <b>some</b> <b>women</b> may require manual stimulation to achieve orgasm.

40|$|This study {{uses the}} concept of risk {{avoidance}} to analyze responses from in-depth interviews {{with a group of}} women lawyers and accountants about their employment decision-making in order to provide a deeper understanding of why and how <b>some</b> <b>women</b> come to choose government employment over private-sector employment. An analysis of interviews reveals that <b>some</b> <b>women</b> perceived work-family conflict, economic precariousness, and fewer protections against employers' arbitrary decision-making as potential risks associated with private-sector employment. To reduce these risks, <b>some</b> <b>women</b> "chose" to work in government rather than in the private sector. This study contributes to existing literature by identifying risk avoidance in employment decision-making as a response to work-family conflict and social class constraints and by illustrating why and how this risk avoidance occurs among <b>some</b> <b>women</b> in elite white-collar professions.
