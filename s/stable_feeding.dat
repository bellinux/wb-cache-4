50|$|In {{temperate}} areas, variable climates {{and environmental}} conditions occur during changing seasons. Lack of available food due to these unpredictable circumstances can often negatively affect colony growth, reproduction, {{and resistance to}} parasites. In poor environments with limited food, the few workers born are smaller than average. However, it appears that B. terrestris is well adapted to a changing environment, considering colony growth is higher under variable feeding conditions than under <b>stable</b> <b>feeding</b> conditions. Workers and reproductives are also heavier with a variable food supply when compared to stable food availability.

50|$|Betta pallifina are {{relatively}} undemanding {{when it comes}} to care of bettas. They tolerate harder water conditions than most of their relatives. They adapt quickly to life in captivity. They should be kept in species-only tanks; one pair can comfortably occupy a 24-inch tank (60 centimeters), while two pairs should be kept in a 30-inch tank (75 centimeters). The tank should have many hiding places, plants, and driftwood. pH should be kept in the range of 6.6-7.4, though a level that is under or over this is fine if kept <b>stable.</b> <b>Feeding</b> is easy, as they will readily take most foods offered. As for any fish, it is recommended that the tank is cycled to prevent ammonia or nitrites from harming the fish. Water current caused by a filter does not cause problems with Betta pallifina, since they come from forest streams and can handle current better than most species of Betta. They will eat a large variety of live foods, such as white worms (Enchytraeus albidus), grindal worms (Enchytraeus buchholzi), wingless fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and brine shrimp. Captive fish will readily take pelleted and flake foods, as well as frozen and freeze dried foods, though these should be soaked prior to feeding. Fry should be fed baby brine shrimp, microworms, or infusoria.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of foraging on local scrubby rangeland versus <b>stable</b> <b>feeding</b> with high-protein concentrate as well as the compulsory pasteurization process on goats’ milk and artisan soft cheese quality in terms of chemical composition and fatty acid profile. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in the energy, fat, or ash content of milk and cheese due to feeding; however, a significant influence of feeding on cheese protein and fatty acids in both milk and cheese was detected. Feeding on scrubby rangeland tended to increase the amounts of major polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk and cheese from goats. Pasteurization, which is mandatory in Mexico, did not alter the fatty acid concentrations in milk or cheese. Small goat-keepers using rangeland resources might claim better economical returns for products recognized as healthier. Further investigations to assure ecosystem sustainability of shrubby rangeland joined with economical evaluations and best animal management to avoid deleterious effects are recommended...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} year of life, infants go through a crucial {{transition}} in feeding when they are introduced to solid food. However, the literature is lacking a good description of the changes in feeding behaviors during this transition. The current paper addresses this by means of a multiple case study focusing on how caretaker and infant build a new and effective feeding dialogue after the transition to solid food. It describes the development of stable interaction patterns, as they emerge during this transition. Feeding interactions are studied directly through repeated naturalistic observations. The results show that while the interaction behavior of some caretaker-infant dyads remains variable, others stabilize quickly. However, ultimately most dyads self-organize their behaviors towards a <b>stable</b> <b>feeding</b> dialogue, which is both sensitive and effective. Evidence for the existence of four characteristic patterns was found. We argue that this finding can be interpreted {{as the result of a}} co-regulation process of consensual frames. The study also offers a framework for analyzing other processes of co-regulation that occur throughout human development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Both {{human and}} non-humans species face {{decisions}} {{in their daily}} lives which may entail taking risks.

In the current study we compared two closely related species; wolves and dogs, which differ significantly in their feeding ecology and their explorative tendencies. Wolves depend on hunting for survival with a success rate of between 15 and 50 %, whereas free-ranging dogs (which make up 80 % of the world dog population), are largely scavengers specialized on human produce i. e. a more geographically and temporally stable resource. Here, we used a foraging paradigm, which allowed subjects to choose between a guaranteed less preferred food vs. a more preferred food, which was however delivered only 50 % of the time (a stone being delivered the rest of time).

40|$|Synopsis For most vertebrates, {{locomotion}} is {{a fundamental}} component of prey capture. Despite this ubiquitous link, few studies have quantified the integration of these complex systems. Several variables related to locomotor performance, including maximum speed, acceleration, deceleration, maneuverability, accuracy, and approach stability, likely influence feeding performance in vertebrates. The relative importance of these measures of performance, however, depends on {{the ecology of the}} predator. While factors such as morphology and physiology likely define the limits of these variables, other factors such as motivation of the predator, prey type, and habitat structure can also influence performance. Understanding how these variables relate to feeding under a given suite of ecological conditions is central to understanding predator–prey interactions, and ultimately how locomotion and feeding have co-evolved. The goals of this article are to discuss several variables of locomotor performance related to prey capture, present new data on the relationship between locomotor and feeding morphology in fishes, discuss the evolution of prey capture in cichlid fishes, and outline some future directions for research. While suction feeding is a primary mechanism of prey capture in fishes, swimming is vital for accurately positioning the mouth relative to the prey item. Many fishes decelerate during prey capture using their body and fins, but the pectoral fins have a dominant role in maintaining approach stability. This suggests that fishes employing high-performance suction feeding (relatively small mouth) will have larger pectoral fins to facilitate accurate and <b>stable</b> <b>feeding.</b> I provide new data on the relationship between pectoral fin morphology an...|$|E
40|$|In 2009, Mt. Etna (Italy) {{activity}} was characterised {{by the end}} of a long-lasting flank eruption started on 13 May 2008 and by the opening of a new summit degassing vent on the E flank of the South-East crater on 6 November. This was preceded by a sequence of significant anomalies in volcanic degassing, detected by periodic measurements of soil CO 2 efflux on the east flank of the volcano, continuous measurements of SO 2 flux from five fixed monitoring stations, and periodic FTIR measurements of the SO 2 /HCl and SO 2 /HF molar ratios in the volcanic plume. Since April 2009, soil and crater emissions showed a progressive increase marked at least by two major steps, in April-May and September-October. Increases were not observed simultaneously; in fact, they were detected first in soil CO 2 emissions and then, a few days/weeks later, in crater SO 2 flux. Only minor increases of HCl and HF crater fluxes were observed between November and December. The highest SO 2 and halogens fluxes were recorded in coincidence {{with the opening of the}} November 6 vent. The degassing behaviour of the volcano in 2009 is consistent with the differential release of magmatic gas species, according to their different solubilities, from a magma body rising from ~ 5 km depth to the surface. Our results suggest the start of a new phase in Etna’s activity, in which the new vent might reflect improved efficiency in the release of magmatic gas through the main feeding system, supplied by a magma body stored at depths between 4 and 2 km. If degassing at the new vent will remain steadystate, thus forming a <b>stable</b> <b>feeding</b> system, then its opening might represent the eastward migration of the South-East crater activity with the likely formation of a new stable summit cone...|$|E

40|$|The Quartz Melt Rate Furnace (QMRF) was {{developed}} to study the melt rate and offgas composition of simulated Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) melter feed. The objective of this testing was to evaluate whether the apparatus {{could be used to}} study the offgas chemistry of melting batches and perform small-scale slurry-fed melt rate tests. The furnace was tested in three different configurations: a dry-fed test with offgas analysis, a slurry-fed test without offgas analysis, and a slurry-fed test with offgas analysis. During the dry-fed test, offgas composition was successfully measured throughout the run and total offgas flow was calculated from the helium tracer concentration. During the slurry-feeding tests without offgas analysis, the furnace exhibited <b>stable</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior with no problems with feed tube pluggage. Feeding behavior was used to measure the melt rate of Sludge Batch 3 with Frit 320 and with Frit 418. Both frits had approximately the same melt rate during the tests based on amount of melter feed added per minute. During the slurry-fed test with offgas analysis, spikes in the data prevented overall offgas flow analysis from the helium tracer, but the ratio of different offgas species allowed the composition data to be compared between runs. Minor improvements were identified that would enhance the performance of the furnace and further testing should be performed to optimize the performance of the apparatus. These tests should focus on increasing the stability of offgas composition data by providing more surge capacity in the offgas system, determining the sensitivity of the furnace to melt rate during slurry-fed tests and refining the lid heat power to optimize melt rate measurements, and to develop the capability to utilize the system with radioactive feeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{operational}} time distribution (OTD) defines {{the time for}} bed-load sediment spent in motion, which is needed to characterize the random nature of sediment transport. This study explores the influence of bed clusters and size gradation on OTD for non-uniform bed-loads. First, both static and mobile bed armouring experiments were conducted in laboratorial flumes to monitor the transport of mixed sand/gravel sediments. Only in the mobile armouring experiment did apparent bed clusters develop, because of <b>stable</b> <b>feeding</b> and a longer transport period. Second, a generalized subordinated advection (GSA) model was applied to quantify the observed dynamics of tracer particles. Results show that for the static armour layer (without sediment feed), the best-fit OTD assigns more weight to the large displacement of small particles, likely because of the size-selective entrainment process. The capacity coefficient in the GSA model, which affects {{the width of the}} OTD, is space dependent only for small particles whose dynamics can be significantly affected by larger particles and whose distribution {{is more likely to be}} space dependent in a mixed sand and gravel system. However, the OTD for the mobile armour layer (with sediment recirculation) exhibited longer tails for larger particles. This is because the trailing edge of larger particles is more resistant to erosion, and their leading front may not be easily trapped by self-organized bed clusters. The strong interaction between particle-bed may cause the capacity coefficient to be space-dependent for bed-load transport along mobile armour layers. Therefore, the combined laboratory experiments and stochastic model analysis show that the OTD may be affected more by particle-bed interactions (such as clusters) than by particle-particle interactions (e. g. hiding and exposing), and that the GSA model can quantify mixed-size sand/gravel transport along river beds within either static or mobile armour layers.

40|$|Changes {{affecting}} {{livestock farming}} systems have made farm work a central concern {{for both the}} sector and for farmers themselves. Increased pressure on farms to be competitive and productive together with farmers' demand for greater autonomy, holidays or time to spend on private activities and the family converge to underline the two key dimensions of work - productivity and flexibility - required {{for the assessment of}} work organization. This paper proposes a method called the QuaeWork (QUAlification and Evaluation of Work in livestock farms) to assess work productivity and flexibility on a farm, and its use to identify how livestock management can contribute to work organization on dairy farms. The QuaeWork method was set up through an iterative process combining surveys conducted with farmers in two regions of France, discussions with different experts and literature review. The QuaeWork was applied on a sample of seven dairy farms in the southern Massif Central in France to identify patterns of how livestock management contributes to work organization. The QuaeWork was used to analyse work organization over the year through a systemic approach to the farm, integrating interactions between herd and land management, workforce composition, equipment facilities and combinations of activities through a characterization of 'who does what, when and for how long'. The criteria for assessing work productivity were work duration (routine work, seasonal work) and work efficiency (per livestock unit or hectare of utilized agricultural area). The criteria for assessing work flexibility were room for manoeuvre and adjustments to internal and external events. The three main patterns of livestock management practices to work organization were identified. In pattern- 1, farmers used indoor <b>stable</b> <b>feeding</b> practices with delegated work, with moderate room for manoeuvre and efficiency. In pattern- 3, farmers used simplified milking, reproduction and breeding practices to seasonalize work and make it efficient with consistent room for manoeuvre. The method suggests social sustainability criteria to assess work productivity and flexibility, which are important for making reasoned decisions on livestock farm changes, especially innovations. Researchers could usefully exploit the QuaeWork to integrate work objectives (productivity, flexibility) into technical and economic goals...|$|E

40|$|Animals often respond {{differently}} {{to the same}} environmental cues. Where behavioural responses differ consistently between individuals over time or contexts, this is “personality”. In wild animals, personality is linked to variation in fitness and survival. Predictions on the behavioural mechanisms underlying this variation come from captive studies, on the often untested assumption that captive behaviour reveals how animals would behave in the wild. In chapter 2, using blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) I tested first whether behaviour in captivity predicted foraging behaviour in the wild. I measured the personality traits neophobia (latency to feed in novel scenarios) and exploratory tendency, first by relatively standard captive protocols and second, using an electronic monitoring system at feeding stations, by novel wild methods. As predicted, analogous traits correlated across contexts. Moreover, neophobia and exploratory tendency were uncorrelated within individuals in both contexts, in contrast to many other species. In captive studies, personality types also respond {{differently to}} changing environmental cues, or “environmental sensitivity”: neophobic and non-exploratory types adjust behaviour whilst neophilic and exploratory types maintain foraging routines. In chapter 3, I tested this second captive prediction in the wild, defining environmental sensitivity in the wild by changes in feeder use with varying air temperature or food supply. Neophobic and, contrary to expectation, exploratory blue tits were most environmentally sensitive. By contrast, neophilic and nonexploratory birds visited feeders at a fixed level independent of temperature and continued to visit feeders for a prolonged period even after they were emptied. Age and body size also influenced environmental sensitivity, suggesting learning and dominance interactions modify the expression of personality in the wild. From potential behavioural costs, in chapter 4 I turned to the physiological costs of personality. Variation in metabolic rate and stress metabolism may be proximate mechanisms for personality. Whilst these physiological traits are linked to oxidative stress directly, with pro-oxidants that damage body tissue a by-product of metabolism, few studies link personality to oxidative stress. I found that oxidative profile (pro-oxidants, antioxidants, oxidative stress and oxidative damage) and hence physiological costs differed notonly within traits but also related differently to neophobia and object exploration in captive-bred greenfinches (Carduelis chloris). Finally, variation in response to environmental cues may reflect differences in learning between individuals, as perhaps illustrated by age differences in environmental sensitivity (Chapter 3). In chapters 5 and 6, I investigated whether learning that a feeding site is temporally stable could cause changes in response to food appearance (“local cues”) when foraging. I predicted that birds would re-find food by spatial rather than local cues in these scenarios, as appearance can change hence local cues become unreliable over time. In chapter 5, I carried out an associative learning test to test this prediction in captive-bred greenfinches. Within a simple foraging scenario, the prediction was upheld: greenfinches favoured local cues in situations where the temporal stability of food was unknown, but switched to spatial cues when temporal stability was learnt through repeated encounters. In chapter 6 though, four of five wild bird species foraging at temporally stable bird feeders continued to respond to local cues, selecting feeders {{on the basis of}} colour. Most species were biased toward red feeders, and also responded to social cues when finding feeders: foraging strategies better suited to finding ephemeral food than re-finding temporally <b>stable</b> <b>feeding</b> sites. I suggest that wild birds use information on temporal stability from the broader environment (i. e. natural ephemeral food beyond temporally stable artificial feeders). This illustrates how animals may not necessarily forage in the wild as we would expect within specific contexts. Throughout this thesis therefore, my findings illustrate the importance of testing predictions generated from captive behaviour in the wild. Moreover, identifying variation in both the foraging strategies and physiological costs to individual variation in behaviour, this thesis provides new insight into the adaptive significance of animal personality.

40|$|In this {{investigation}} 17 horses which show stereotypic walking, were observed directly during {{one week in}} summer and one week in winter. The daily observation started just before feeding {{in the morning and}} ended when there was no activity in the stable in the evening. Additional data from altogether 61 horses were raised by questionnaire. The aim {{of the study was to}} describe the stereotypic behaviour and to receive indications about environmental factors effecting the behaviour as well as causes of the stereotypy. The postal questionnaire that was sent to riding-, breeding- and racing-stables in the region Berlin-Brandenburg at the beginning of the study obtained a resonance of 41, 2 %. Additionally owners of box-walking horses contacted the author after the publication of two magazine articles and the presentation of the project in the Internet. Altogether a prevalence of 1, 3 % could be determined for stereotypic walking. Stereotypic walking takes place along a straight or circular route, the former being observed more frequently. Usually the horses turn to the fence when changing the walking direction, the head being more or less turned toward the fence. In the box the horses wind themselves to a certain extent back and forth. The observed horses showed stall-circling predominantly in clockwise direction. Completely calm walking could be observed as well as nervous and excited pacing. A diversion, although brief, by external attractions during the execution of the stereotypy could be observed. Only with 41, 2 % of the horses stereotypic walking actually takes place only in the box. Therefore the term `box-walking´ is regarded as unsuitable for the behaviour disturbance. Instead the term `stereotypic walking&# 180; is proposed. For all horses the portion of the behaviour disturbance of the total observed time hardly differs between the winter and the summer observation period. In some cases the portion of the stereotypy of the time budget was higher in summer, in others during the winter observation. A maximum of the stereotypic activity is registered in winter in the afternoon, when most activity in the stable prevails. A second peak can be observed in the morning, at the time when the horses are brought on the paddock or the pasture and when stable work takes place. During the summer observation the maximum of stereotypic activity is in the morning. There is another rise in the afternoon which is lower, however, than in winter. In this study a correlation between the occurrence of stereotypy and the race of the horses could be shown. The prevalence of stereotypic walking was higher in Thoroughbred horses than in ponies. Questions about the character and temperament of the animals resulted, however, in no indication for a predisposition for the development of stereotypy. The portion of stallions among the stereotypic animals appears very high. An increased occurrence of stereotypic walking for specific utilizations of the horses could not be determined. Likewise no accumulation within a certain age range could be found. The number of horses on the yard as well as the quantity of fed hay had no effect on the incidence of the abnormal behaviour, either. A vast majority of the affected horses has access to a paddock and/or a pasture. With over 60 % of the horses the beginning of stereotypic walking could not be determined. For the remaining animals the first time in stable, weaning, the beginning of the training, the separation from grazing pals or a stable change were indicated as a cause. Beside this in several horses the stereotypy started during a longer period when the horse had to stay in the box. Altogether 24 % of the registered stereotypic activities (stereotypic walking and/or weaving) were related to an environmental event. In the remaining cases a connection was only to be assumed. A factor related to the prevalence of abnormal behaviour in all horses could not be found. Stereotypic walking arose particularly in situations that are connected with a high level of arousal for the horse, like the appearance of the owner, general unrest in the <b>stable,</b> <b>feeding</b> or taking horses out of the stable. The effectiveness of changes in the management for the therapy of the behaviour disturbance could not be judged clearly. A medicinal therapy was conducted with none of the animals. Preventing the movement by tying up led only in one case to a reduction of the stereotypy, no horse began to weave. In all horses the stereotypy was generally very hard or impossible to influence. With the eight animals whose behaviour disturbance, according to statements of the owners, led to damage to the animal, one must assume a disturbed well-being of the animals. In all other respects the stereotypy can be seen as a pattern which helps the animal to cope with an environment which is or was not optimal for the animal. Therefore an animal should not be prevented from the execution of the stereotypy as long as no damage develops, in order to avoid further motivation conflicts. One should try, however, to reduce stereotypy by changes in the management that are individually matched to causes that have been determined. <br /...|$|E

A Cologne legend recorded by Keightley claims that bakers in {{the city in the}} early 19th century never needed hired help because, each night, the kobolds known as Heinzelmänchen made as much bread as a baker could need. Similarly, bieresal, kobolds who {{live in the}} beer cellars of inns, bring beer into the house, clean the tables, and wash the bottles and glasses. This association between kobolds and work gave rise to a saying current in 19th-century Germany that a woman who worked quickly [...] "had the kobold".|$|R
40|$|Marine {{microbial}} protists, in particular, dinoflagellates, produce polyketide toxins with ecosystem-wide {{and human}} health impacts. Species of Gambierdiscus produce the polyether ladder compounds ciguatoxins and maitotoxins, {{which can lead to}} ciguatera fish poisoning, a serious human illness associated with reef fish consumption. Genes associated with the biosynthesis of polyether ladder compounds are yet to be elucidated, however, <b>stable</b> isotope <b>feeding</b> studies of such compounds consistently support their polyketide origin indicating that polyketide synthases are involved in their biosynthesis...|$|R
