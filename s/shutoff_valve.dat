5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no <b>shutoff</b> <b>valve,</b> so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
25|$|A {{second stage}} freeze {{is also likely}} to happen with the valve open, causing a free flow, which may {{precipitate}} a first stage freeze if not immediately stopped. If the flow through the frozen second stage can be stopped before the first stage freezes, the process can be halted. This may be possible if the second stage is fitted with a <b>shutoff</b> <b>valve,</b> but if this is done, the first stage must be fitted with an overpressure valve, as closing the supply to the second stage disables its secondary function as an overpressure valve.|$|E

[...] The biplane C-1s were {{evolved from the}} Douglas World Cruiser design, with the pilots side-by-side in an open cockpit forward of the wing. Two [...] tanks were installed in their cargo compartments, attached to a lead-weighted [...] length of [...] fire hose. The nozzle of the hose had a quick-closing valve on the tanker's end and was tightly wrapped with copper wire, one end {{of which could be}} attached to a corresponding copper plate mounted in Question Mark to ground the hose. The C-1's would each carry a third crewman in the cargo compartment to reel out the hose, lower a supply rope, and to work the <b>shutoff</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E

The mask and its tube unscrews from the canister and can be replaced by a tube ending in a mouthpiece. The mouthpiece tube has a <b>shutoff</b> <b>valve</b> at the mouthpiece.

50|$|A plant {{operator}} heard the escaping propylene and the expanding vapor cloud. He notified the plant's control {{room of the}} problem.

5000|$|The {{investigators}} {{also noted}} that the steel clamp used to lock the hose connected to the gas range’s nozzle was found far from where it should be, which meant that the workers did not properly refit the hose,“This is the proximate cause of the gas leak.

40|$|WSSPC {{recommends}} that each state, province or territory which is considering implementing requirements for installing automatic gas shutoff devices in industrial, commercial and/or residential applications assure that <b>shutoff</b> <b>valves</b> meet {{the provisions of}} the most currently available revision of ANSI/ASCE/SEI Standard 25 (Earthquake-Actuated Automatic Gas Shutoff Devices) and be installed in conformance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions. The cost versus benefit of turning gas on after an event or the analysis of false activation is left to the jurisdiction. The policy only advocates that if a decision is made to proceed with earthquake actuated automatic gas shutoff devices that the current state-of-the-art provisions be utilized. Executive Summary Natural gas piping and appliances may be damaged during earthquakes, causing gas leaks. These leaks, if ignited, can result in fires and explosions which may jeopardize personal safety as well as resulting in significant damage to structures. Fires and explosions may be more destructive to buildings than the earthquake itself. The ability to manually shut off a gas valve after an earthquake may be difficult or impossible due to debris or ground movement. Risk of gas related damage is further exacerbated if structures are unoccupied, thus placing the burden of shutting off gas service upon utilities or government agencies. The reliability of automatic gas <b>shutoff</b> <b>valves</b> has been greatly improved with the adoption o...|$|R
25|$|The main {{circulating}} pumps {{have the capacity}} of 5,500–12,000m³/h and are powered by 6kV electric motors. The normal coolant flow is 8000m³/h per pump; this is throttled down by control valves to 6000–7000m³/h when the reactor power is below 500MWt. Each pump has a flow control valve and a backflow preventing check valve on the outlet, and <b>shutoff</b> <b>valves</b> on both inlet and outlet. Each of the pressure channels in the core has its own flow control valve so that the temperature distribution in the reactor core can be optimized. Each channel has a ball type flow meter.|$|R

Neither valve could maintain line pressure beyond 11 min in a fire that reached temperatures between 50020 and 70020 C.
