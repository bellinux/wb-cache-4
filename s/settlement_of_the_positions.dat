40|$|<b>The</b> {{territorial}} behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marsh Warbler Acrocephalus palustris was studied during four seasons (1974 - 1977) in a colourringed population breeding in the Liège valley, eastern Belgium. Adapted to <b>the</b> exploitation <b>of</b> thick herbaceous vegetation, Marsh Warblers occupy small and clustered territories (of 5 - 10 ares, or 0. 1 - 0. 2 acre on average) which contain suitable nest-sites (figs 1 and 4). Pair formation takes place when a female stops in a territory {{to select a}} nest-site. Most pairs of this singlebroo ded species continue to defend a territory until <b>the</b> hatching <b>of</b> their young, by which time <b>settlements</b> <b>of</b> newly-arrived birds h ave almost come to an end. Late breeding pairs stop defending a territory relatively earlier in the bree ding cycle. The food for the young is largely searched for outside the initial territory (fig. 1 C); even before the nestling stage, extraterritorial excursions are frequent, especially by males. The Reed Warbler A. scirpaceus is the only other species that Marsh Warblers systematically expel from their territories. Males (whose full song has a territorial function) play the main role in territorial defence, but females also show some territorial aggression, especially when their partners are (temporarily or not) absent. <b>The</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defended territory varies according to <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>settlement,</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territory {{in relation to the}} neighbours, <b>the</b> temperament <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owners, <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> vegetation contained in it, and <b>the</b> stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breeding cycle. Territories of early settlers (mid-May) are initially larger than thos e of birds arriving in the middle or near <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>settlement</b> period (late May). On average, the territory is most extensive a t pair formation (Fe in fig. 5), then shrinks p rogressively until <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> incub ation. <b>The</b> average size <b>of</b> a territory is smallest where nest-sites are most dense. In the exceptionally dry 1976 season, suitable nest-sites were more spaced out and the breeding density (10. 6 pairs/ha) was the lowest observed in <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> study. This adjustment was achieved despite the very wide variety of individual temperaments in territoria] aggression. The possession by males of a territory rich in nest-sites seems indisp ensable for p air form ation to succeed; during courtship, the territory protects the pair against interference from male neigbours. There is some evidence that territoriality limits breeding density, but <b>the</b> adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breeding population to the local ressources can only be approximate as discussed in some detai...|$|R
