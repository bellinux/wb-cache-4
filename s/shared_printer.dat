50|$|Some {{examples}} of shareable resources are computer programs, data, storage devices, and printers. E.g. shared file access (also known as disk sharing and folder sharing), <b>shared</b> <b>printer</b> access (printer sharing), shared scanner access, etc. The shared resource {{is called a}} shared disk (also known as mounted disk), shared drive volume, shared folder, shared file, shared document, <b>shared</b> <b>printer</b> or shared scanner.|$|E

Following the new printer the format {{was changed to}} berliner and the office was upgraded, {{to be able to}} handle the introduction of computers. Failed negotiations on a <b>shared</b> <b>printer</b> were held with Hallandsposten.|$|E
5000|$|The fileserver, {{sometimes}} referred to as the LexICON, was a simple box with an internal 10MB hard drive and a 5.25" [...] floppy drive opening to the front, and parallel port for a <b>shared</b> <b>printer.</b> Later Lexicons included a 64MB hard disk, divided into two partitions. Unlike the PET's floppy system, however, users of the ICON used Unix commands to copy data to their personal floppy disks from its [...] "natural" [...] location in the user's home directory on the hard drive.|$|E
50|$|A {{network share}} {{can become a}} {{security}} liability when access to the shared files is gained (often by devious means) by those who should {{not have access to}} them. Many computer worms have spread through network shares. Network shares would consume extensive communication capacity in non-broadband network access. Because of that, <b>shared</b> <b>printer</b> and file access is normally prohibited in firewalls from computers outside the local area network or enterprise Intranet. However, by means of virtual private networks (VPN), shared resources can securely be made available for certified users outside the local network.|$|E
50|$|Document {{and photo}} imaging {{controllers}} - Conexant offers products for single-function and multi-function printers, photo printers, and other advanced printers. The chips integrate input/output features, including USB and serial, and embedded firmware allows printing to <b>shared</b> <b>printers</b> using tablets or smartphones. The technology is compatible using Wi-Fi with several cloud computing printing services.|$|R
50|$|Home servers often act as {{network-attached storage}} (NAS) {{providing}} the major benefit that all users' files can be centrally and securely stored, with flexible permissions applied to them. Such files {{can be easily}} accessed from any other system on the network, provided the correct credentials are supplied. This also applies to <b>shared</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|For homeowners, {{wireless}} technology {{is an effective}} option compared to Ethernet for <b>sharing</b> <b>printers,</b> scanners, and high-speed Internet connections. WLANs help save the cost of installation of cable mediums, save time from physical installation, and also creates mobility for devices connected to the network.Wireless networks are simple and require as few as one single wireless access point connected directly to the Internet via a router.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft offers simple {{access control}} {{features}} built into their Windows operating system. Homegroup is {{a feature that}} allows shared disk access, <b>shared</b> <b>printer</b> access and shared scanner access among all computers and users (typically family members) in a home, {{in a similar fashion}} as in a small office workgroup, e.g., by means of distributed peer-to-peer networking (without a central server). Additionally, a home server may be added for increased functionality. The Windows HomeGroup feature was introduced with Microsoft Windows 7 in order to simplify file sharing in residences. All users (typically all family members), except guest accounts, may access any shared library on any computer that is connected to the home group. Passwords are not required from the family members during logon. Instead, secure file sharing is possible by means of a temporary password that is used when adding a computer to the HomeGroup.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{resources}} that users can redirect from the remote server machine {{to the local}} client, depending upon {{the capabilities of the}} client software used. For instance, [...] "File System Redirection" [...] allows users to use their local files on a remote desktop within the terminal session, while [...] "Printer Redirection" [...] allows users to use their local printer within the terminal session as they would with a locally or network <b>shared</b> <b>printer.</b> [...] "Port Redirection" [...] allows applications running within the terminal session to access local serial and parallel ports directly, and [...] "Audio" [...] allows users to run an audio program on the remote desktop and have the sound redirected to their local computer. The clipboard can also be shared between the remote computer and the local computer. The RDP client in Windows XP can be upgraded to 7.0. The Remote Desktop Web Connection component of Internet Information Services 5.1 also allows remote desktop functionality over the web through an ActiveX control for Internet Explorer.|$|E

Imprint is a casual information visualization kiosk that supports workers in seeing, exploring, and reflecting upon their printing activity. The Imprint kiosk is a large touchscreen display that augments the existing social space around <b>shared</b> <b>printer</b> facilities. My hope is draw workgroup members in extended reflections and conversations around their consumption behaviors and the social data that is inherent in printed data. I suggest an evaluation metric to measure the innate curiosity of individuals and hypothesize that curiosity is a key determinant of the success of personal and group informatics systems...|$|E
50|$|LANSPool was {{network printer}} {{administration}} software developed by Intel. The package was {{designed specifically for}} the Novell NetWare network operating system. The software allowed users to <b>share</b> <b>printers</b> and faxes and for administrators to modify LAN printing operations. The software {{takes its name from}} the acronym for local area network (LAN) and the spooling technique by which computers send information to slow peripherals such as printers.|$|R
50|$|A {{print server}} {{may be a}} {{networked}} computer {{with one or more}} <b>shared</b> <b>printers.</b> Alternatively a print server may be a dedicated device on the network, with connections to the LAN and one or more printers. Dedicated server appliances tend to be fairly simple in both configuration and features. Print server functionality may be integrated with other devices such as a wireless router, a firewall, or both. A printer may have a built-in print server.|$|R
50|$|Networking cables are {{networking}} hardware used {{to connect}} one network device to other network devices or to connect {{two or more}} computers to <b>share</b> <b>printers,</b> scanners etc. Different types of network cables, such as coaxial cable, optical fiber cable, and twisted pair cables, are used depending on the network's physical layer, topology, and size. The devices can be separated by a few meters (e.g. via Ethernet) or nearly unlimited distances (e.g. via the interconnections of the Internet).|$|R
40|$|Arising {{from recent}} changes in Irish third-level {{education}} {{there has been a}} new paradigm in the provision of IT education at the National College of Ireland. Owing to the importance of student development a need has been identified and satisfied for a dynamic learning environment, which aims to facilitate the studentsâ€™ maximum learning potential. This student-centered learning space is achieved through the employment of state-of-the-art Studio Classrooms. This progressive learning environment encompasses aspects of the traditional classroom along with a computer laboratory, which allows students to interact via a Local Area Network. It also supports a lecturer Workstation, <b>shared</b> <b>printer</b> as well as access to the college intranet. Multimedia capabilities are also catered for. The benefits of this learning space are twofold. Benefits for the student include active experimentation, increased motivation, collaborative learning and the potential for maximum participation. In terms of the lecturer, benefits include higher retention and attendance rates, increased enthusiasm and student participation as well as a noticeable improvement in student assessment grades achieved. We will discuss our efforts at integration of modules within this unique learning space and identify other factors that contribute to the success of our teaching...|$|E

50|$|Novell NetWare shared {{disk space}} {{in the form of}} NetWare volumes, {{comparable}} to DOS volumes. Clients running MS-DOS would run a special terminate and stay resident (TSR) program that allowed them to map a local drive letter to a NetWare volume. Clients had to log into a server in order to be allowed to map volumes, and access could be restricted according to the login name. Similarly, they could connect to <b>shared</b> <b>printers</b> on the dedicated server, and print as if the printer was connected locally.|$|R
50|$|Users {{and network}} administrators {{typically}} have {{different views of}} their networks. Users can <b>share</b> <b>printers</b> and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means {{they are in the}} same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running.

Typically a WLAN offers much better speeds and delays within the local network than an average consumer's Internet access. Older systems that provide WLAN functionality include DECT and HIPERLAN. These however {{are no longer in}} widespread use. One typical characteristic of WLANs is that they are mostly very local, without the capability of seamless movement from one network to another.|$|R

AirPrint does not require printer-specific drivers. It was originally intended for iOS devices and connected via a Wi-Fi network only, and thus required a Wi-Fi access point. However, with the introduction of AirPrint to the macOS desktop platform in 2012, Macs connected to the network via ethernet connection could also print using the AirPrint protocol--not just those connected via Wi-Fi. Direct Wi-Fi connection between the device and the printer is not supported by default, but has appeared as the 'HP ePrint Wireless Direct AirPrint' feature.|$|R
