5|$|In June 2016, Shueisha {{announced}} the series {{will have a}} live-action adaptation of the series. It is slated to premiere in 2017. Direction of the film {{as well as the}} <b>script</b> <b>is</b> being handled by Yūichi Fukuda. Additionally, Shueisha said that Gintoki will be portrayed by Shun Oguri.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{is written}} with the Khmer script, an abugida {{developed}} from the Pallava script of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared. Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, the Khmer <b>script</b> <b>is</b> similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, {{both of which were}} based on the Khmer system. The Khmer <b>script</b> <b>is</b> also distantly related to the Mon script, the ancestor of the modern Burmese script. Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than Hindu-Arabic numerals. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.|$|E
5|$|The Sinhalese <b>script</b> <b>is</b> a Brahmi derivate, and was {{imported}} from Northern India, around the 3rd century BCE, but was influenced {{at various stages}} by South Indian scripts, manifestly influenced by the early Grantha script.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to their}} conquest of north China and the {{establishment}} of the Liao dynasty, the Khitans had no written language. In 920 the first of two Khitan scripts, the Khitan large <b>script,</b> <b>was</b> developed. A second script, the Khitan small <b>script,</b> <b>was</b> developed in 925. Both <b>scripts</b> <b>are</b> based on the same spoken language, and both contain a mix of logographs and phonographs. Despite the similarities to Chinese characters, the Khitan <b>scripts</b> <b>were</b> functionally different from Chinese.|$|R
50|$|Tawqi‘ (التوقيع) is a calligraphic {{variety of}} the Arabic <b>script.</b> It <b>is</b> a {{modified}} and smaller version of the thuluth <b>script.</b> Both <b>scripts</b> <b>were</b> developed by Ibn Muqlah. The tawqi‘ <b>script</b> <b>was</b> further refined by Ibn al-Bawwab.|$|R
5|$|At least twenty-five {{treatments}} and <b>scripts</b> <b>were</b> drafted for Labyrinth between 1983–85, and the film's shooting <b>script</b> <b>was</b> only ready shortly before filming began.|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Georgian <b>script</b> <b>is</b> to this date poorly known, and no full {{agreement}} exists among Georgian and foreign scholars as to its date of creation, who designed the script and the main influences on that process.|$|E
5|$|For the 20th {{anniversary of}} Final Fantasy, Square Enix remade Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II for the PlayStation Portable. The games were {{released}} in Japan and North America in 2007, and in European territories in 2008. The PSP version features higher-resolution 2D graphics, full motion video sequences, a remixed soundtrack, {{and a new}} dungeon {{as well as the}} bonus dungeons from Dawn of Souls. The <b>script</b> <b>is</b> the same as in the Dawn of Souls version, aside from the new dungeon.|$|E
5|$|Ganesha was {{depicted}} as a householder married to Riddhi and Siddhi {{and the father of}} Santoshi Ma (Devanagari: संतोषी माँ), a new goddess of satisfaction, in the 1975 Hindi film Jai Santoshi Maa. The movie <b>script</b> <b>is</b> not based on scriptural sources. The fact that a cult has developed around the figure of Santoshi Ma has been cited by Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen as evidence of Ganesha's continuing evolution as a popular deity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the <b>script</b> <b>was</b> based purely on {{the name of the}} episode [...] "Cash and Curry", from that the <b>script</b> <b>was</b> devised.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourteen}} edicts contain {{text in the}} Kharosthi <b>script</b> which <b>is</b> {{an ancient}} <b>script</b> used in the Gandhara. The Kharoṣṭhi <b>script</b> <b>was</b> first deciphered by James Prinsep after which the Edicts of Ashoka in Kharosthi <b>script</b> <b>were</b> translated.|$|R
50|$|From July 15 to August 22, 1983, 12 <b>scripts</b> <b>were</b> produced, {{including}} five during one 48-hour non-stop weekend. Kennedy estimates that between 30-40 <b>scripts</b> <b>were</b> turned out.|$|R
5|$|In February 2017, James Mangold {{stated that}} with the {{introduction}} of Laura / X-23 in Logan, {{there is a possibility that}} the character will appear in future films. Later that month, Kinberg said that a film for Laura Kinney / X-23 is in development. By October of the same year, it was announced that <b>script</b> <b>is</b> being co-written by Craig Kyle and James Mangold; creator of the character, and director of The Wolverine and Logan, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} cast, George Sewell stars as Mark Neuman, a German Operations Chief in EUROSEC who uncovers Dr Hassler's dealing with Communist China and whose parallel self directs the interrogation of Ross after the Dove crash. His surname {{in the draft}} <b>script</b> <b>is</b> Hallam. Finally, Ed Bishop stars as David Poulson, a NASA official. Bishop replaced English actor Peter Dyneley, who had voiced characters for Thunderbirds (1965–66), after the producers decided that Dyneley bore {{too much of a}} resemblance to Wymark and that scenes featuring both the characters of Poulson and Webb would confuse audiences.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} late February 2006, Jason McElwain {{and his family}} started {{receiving}} inquiries from over twenty-five film companies, including The Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros., about making a film based on his story. In April 2006, {{it was announced that}} Columbia Pictures had bought the rights to produce the film. Laura Ziskin, producer of the Spider-Man film series, was signed on to produce the film about McElwain's life. Magic Johnson has also been attached as producer, while two-time Academy Award winner Alvin Sargent is in talks to write the film. However, there currently is no timetable for the movie as contracts are being finalized and the <b>script</b> <b>is</b> still being written.|$|E
50|$|After Moll's death, <b>scripts</b> <b>were</b> {{written by}} the Rev. Clarence R. Rahn. These <b>scripts</b> <b>are</b> {{archived}} in the Shadek-Fackenthal Library of Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster.|$|R
50|$|Several {{automated}} <b>scripts</b> <b>were</b> {{developed to}} aid in the detection of 'false links' and redundant copies of links. These <b>scripts</b> <b>are</b> activated periodically to effectively clean the database.|$|R
50|$|Waterloo <b>Script</b> <b>was</b> {{created at}} the University of Waterloo later. One version of <b>SCRIPT</b> <b>was</b> created at MIT and the AA/CS at UW took over project {{development}} in 1974. The program {{was first used}} at UW in 1975. In the 1970s, <b>SCRIPT</b> <b>was</b> the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer. By the late 1980s, the <b>SCRIPT</b> system had <b>been</b> extended to incorporate various upgrades.|$|R
5|$|As {{with many}} post-Soviet states, {{the change in}} writing system and the debates {{surrounding}} it is closely intertwined with political themes. Although not having been used since the adoption of Cyrillic, the Latin <b>script</b> <b>is</b> supported by {{those who wish to}} bring the country closer to Uzbekistan, which has adopted the Latin-based Uzbek alphabet. The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those who wish to maintain the status quo, and not distance the country from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Dixon was {{primarily}} hired {{to tone down}} much of the campiness inherent in the stage musical. The 2007 film's <b>script</b> <b>is</b> based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arvin Hodgepile (the role Mr. Spritzer fills), Velma's husband Franklin, Corny's assistant Tammy, the beatniks, et al.), removing the Tilted Acres amusement park from the story, and placing Velma {{in charge of the}} station where The Corny Collins Show is filmed.|$|E
5|$|Few {{documents}} {{written in}} either the Khitan large or small script survive to this day. Most surviving specimens of both Khitan scripts are epitaph inscriptions on stone tablets, {{as well as a}} number of inscriptions on coins, mirrors and seals. Only a single manuscript text in the Khitan large <b>script</b> <b>is</b> known (Nova N 176), and no manuscripts in the Khitan small script are known. The Liao emperors could read Chinese, and while there were some Chinese works translated into Khitan during the Liao dynasty, the Confucian classics, which served as the core guide to the administration of government in China, are not known to have been translated into Khitan.|$|E
50|$|The eastern nāgarī <b>script</b> <b>was</b> a {{precursor}} to devanāgarī. This hypothesis states that {{a version of this}} <b>script</b> <b>was</b> introduced to the Philippines via Bengal, before ultimately evolving into baybayin.|$|R
40|$|Chapter 9 of the Unicode {{standard}} [1] {{describes the}} representational model for encoding Indic <b>scripts.</b> Devanagari <b>is</b> described in Section 9. 1; {{the principles of}} Indic <b>scripts</b> <b>are</b> covered in some detail {{in the introduction to}} Devanagari.

5000|$|As {{a common}} practice, all {{configure}} <b>scripts</b> <b>are</b> named [...] "configure". Usually, configure <b>scripts</b> <b>are</b> {{written for the}} Bourne shell, {{but they may be}} written for execution in any desired shell.|$|R
5|$|For some readers, Arthur C. Clarke's more {{straightforward}} novelization of the <b>script</b> <b>is</b> key to {{interpreting the}} film. Clarke's novel explicitly identifies the monolith {{as a tool}} created by an alien race that has been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic form to biomechanical, and finally achieving a state of pure energy. These aliens travel the cosmos assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Conversely, film critic Penelope Houston wrote in 1971 that because the novel differs in many key respects from the film, it perhaps should not {{be regarded as the}} skeleton key to unlock it.|$|E
5|$|Fredrik Malmberg told Deadline.com in an {{interview}} that the sequel could lead to a cinematic universe of Howard's creations for film and TV. On January 28, 2016, Schwarzenegger confirmed that the third film would be Conan the Conqueror. He revealed the details about the film at a Q event in Scotland. According to Sandy Schaefer writing for Screenrant.com in August 2016 the <b>script</b> <b>is</b> collaboratively honed by Chris Morgan and Will Beall. In April 2017, producer Chris Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, although there was a possibility of a TV show. The story of the film was supposed to be set 30 years after the first, with some inspiration from Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.|$|E
5|$|McDowell's {{original}} <b>script</b> <b>is</b> {{far less}} comedic and much darker; the Maitlands' car crash is depicted graphically, with Barbara's arm being crushed {{and the couple}} screaming for help as they slowly drown in the river. A reference to this remained in all versions of the script, as Barbara remarks that her arm feels cold upon returning home as a ghost. Instead of possessing the Deetzes and forcing them to dance during dinner, the Maitlands cause a vine-patterned carpet to come to life and attack the Deetzes by tangling them to their chairs.|$|E
5000|$|RoboCop 2—Miller's {{original}} <b>script</b> <b>was</b> heavily edited through rewrites as it {{was deemed}} unfilmable. The original <b>script</b> <b>was</b> adapted in 2003 by Steven Grant into the comics series, Frank Miller's RoboCop.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The <b>script</b> <b>was</b> partly rewritten to {{acknowledge}} the September 11 attacks, which took place after the <b>scripting</b> <b>was</b> passed; it was made in order {{to acknowledge}} the series' genre of battling terrorism.|$|R
50|$|Sundanese <b>script</b> <b>was</b> {{added to}} the Unicode Standard in April 2008 {{with the release of}} version 5.1. In version 6.3, the support of pasangan and some {{characters}} from Old Sundanese <b>script</b> <b>were</b> added.|$|R
5|$|The {{first team}} of writers {{assembled}} {{for the show}} consisted of Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker. The writing process of Family Guy generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a <b>script</b> <b>is</b> finished it {{is given to the}} rest of the writers to read. These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason. The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.|$|E
5|$|The show's writers begin {{each day}} with a morning meeting where they review {{material}} that researchers have gathered from major newspapers, the Associated Press, cable news television channels and websites, and discuss headline material for the lead news segment. Throughout the morning they work on writing deadline pieces inspired by recent news, as well as longer-term projects. By lunchtime, Noah — who describes his role {{as that of the}} captain of a team — has begun to review headline jokes. The <b>script</b> <b>is</b> submitted by 3 pm, and at 4:15 there is a rehearsal. An hour is left for rewrites before a 6 pm taping in front of a live studio audience.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of {{published}} and unpublished studies in the 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic. While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, J.E.S. Thompson, strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a linguistic analysis. Whorf {{argued that it was}} exactly the reluctance to apply linguistic analysis of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within the elements of the specific signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya <b>script</b> <b>is</b> now known to have been misguided, his central claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by Yuri Knorozov's syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Prescribed <b>scripts</b> <b>are</b> highly {{detailed}} <b>scripts</b> which specify precise phrases {{to be used}} in given situations. Prescribed <b>scripts</b> <b>are</b> {{widely used}} in a variety of contexts including direct selling, market research, fast food service.|$|R
50|$|The {{literary}} tradition of Oirat reaches back to 11th century when the Uyghur <b>script</b> <b>was</b> used. The official Kalmyk alphabet, named Clear Script or, in Oirat, Todo bicig, {{was created in}} the 17th century by a Kalmyk Buddhist monk called Zaya Pandita. In 1924 this <b>script</b> <b>was</b> replaced by a Cyrillic <b>script,</b> which <b>was</b> abandoned in 1930 in favor of a Latin script. The Latin <b>script</b> <b>was</b> in turn replaced by another Cyrillic script in 1938. These script reforms effectively disrupted the Oirat {{literary tradition}}.|$|R
50|$|Fox {{placed an}} order for seven episodes in October 2010. On July 12, 2011, Fox ordered six {{additional}} scripts of the series. Although unknown if the <b>scripts</b> <b>were</b> ever finished, the <b>scripts</b> <b>were</b> never produced into episodes.|$|R
