During the process of {{multi-point}} <b>straightening,</b> the peak value of the <b>straightening</b> strain rate will appear at each <b>straightening</b> point. If the strain rate is too large, the <b>straightening</b> cracks will appear. Solidification and heat transfer of a slab is analyzed and the generation of the solidified shell and the three-dimension temperature field of the slab are calculated by using three-dimensional finite element method (FEM). Based on the finite element analysis of five-point <b>straightening</b> of the curved slab, the strain and strain rate of each <b>straightening</b> point were obtained, which is a base of the analysis of <b>straightening</b> cracks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to determine <b>straightening</b> stroke precisely for automatic <b>straightening</b> machines. The existing calculation method of <b>straightening</b> stroke is based on <b>straightening</b> curvature equation. Because the initial curvature is obtained by curve fitting method, the method is inconvenient to use and its accuracy is not well. In this paper, a method to calculate <b>straightening</b> stroke based on <b>straightening</b> process model is put forward. So the mathematic load-deflection model of <b>straightening</b> process must be established at first. The <b>straightening</b> process model for shafts is developed according to the elastic-plastic mechanics theory. By using the model, the <b>straightening</b> stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. It is advantageous to use and to decrease errors. Comparing with FEM results and experimental results, the calculation results by the model are exact and the errors are small. So the validity and the accuracy of the method are verified. It will be helpful to the development of automatic <b>straightening</b> machines...|$|R

Halcombe was suspected of throwing, meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player <b>straightens</b> his arm {{in the process of}} delivering the ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of his elbow in delivering the ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George Giffen. To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and elbow were encased in splints, so that he could not move his elbow position. He delivered balls at varying speeds, and the experts failed to detect an illegal action.|$|E

40|$|Impacts between over-height {{vehicles}} and steel bridges are common throughout North America {{and the resulting}} bridge damage is unpredictable and sudden. Heat <b>straightening</b> is an alternative to replacing steel members and mechanical <b>straightening</b> for repairs. In many cases, bridges remediated using heat <b>straightening</b> require fewer disruptions to traffic and lower repair costs compared to repairs replacing steel members. Heat <b>straightening</b> limitations and practices have been developed with American steel grades and climates in mind. Often heat <b>straightening</b> is described as an art {{as much as a}} science; this repair method has relied on experienced practitioners using heat <b>straightening</b> patterns designed to cause rotations or shortening in members. Heat <b>straightening</b> of impact-damaged steel bridges can be modelled with finite element analysis (FEA). Heat <b>straightening</b> is a thermo-mechanical process. Existing studies modelling heat <b>straightening</b> with FEA do not fully explain the modelling techniques and material parameters used. A workflow defining steps and material parameters can be used to facilitate modelling of impact and heat <b>straightening</b> on bridges. This study proposes a workflow using FEA to model the heat <b>straightening</b> of impact-damaged steel bridges. The proposed workflow will be used to study heat <b>straightening</b> of CSA 350 W steel – a commonly used Canadian steel grade. The workflow is developed by investigating modelling techniques for impact and heat <b>straightening</b> separately. The developed finite element models include material parameters accounting for work hardening, thermal effects and strain-rate sensitivity of steel. The presented research demonstrates that the proposed workflow is viable for modelling impact and heat <b>straightening</b> of steel bridges. Although this study involved the application of the developed modelling techniques for a hypothetical bridge, the exercise has provided valuable insight into methods of expediting heat <b>straightening</b> repair and the modelling process. For instance, it has provided insight into the following: the introduction of jacking forces without causing mechanical <b>straightening,</b> the removal of plastically deformed stiffeners to reduce deformations, and the treatment of residual stresses from heat <b>straightening...</b>|$|R
