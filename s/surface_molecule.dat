5|$|Developing neurons travel {{toward the}} {{olfactory}} bulb along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark {{the division between}} the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons. Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe {{this is not the}} case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells. The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell <b>surface</b> <b>molecule,</b> a polysialylated (PSA) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb. With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation. The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E

Nicotine associated with traces of LPS efficiently enhanced endosomal translocation of internalized ovalbumin (OVA) and increased TAP-OVA colocalization. Importantly, the upregulation of nicotine-increased <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> upregulation was significantly abrogated by the inhibition of Akt kinase.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new theory of cell surface capping based on the {{principles}} of nucleation. When antibody interacts with cell <b>surface</b> <b>molecules,</b> the molecules initially form small aggregates called patches that later coalesce into a large aggregate called a cap. While a cap can form by patches being pulled together by action of the cell's cytoskeleton, in the case of some molecules, disruption of the cytoskeleton does not prevent cap formation. Diffusion of large aggregates on a cell surface is slow, and thus we propose that a cap can form solely through the diffusion of small aggregates containing just one or a few cell <b>surface</b> <b>molecules.</b> Here we consider the extreme case in which single molecules are mobile, but aggregates of all larger sizes are immobile. We show that a set of patches in equilibrium with a "sea " of free cell <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> can undergo a nucleation-type phase transition in which the largest patch will bind free cell <b>surface</b> <b>molecules,</b> deplete the concentration of such molecules in the "sea, " and thus cause the other patches to shrink in size.

40|$|Many of the {{molecules}} identified {{on the surface}} of both bone marrow-derived (B) 1 and thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes can be displaced from their original position on the surface membrane after reaction with one or more ligands. The displaced molecules can form multiple complexes on the membrane or can agglutinate into a single compact mass at one pole of the cell, the cap. For example, the surface immunoglobulin (Ig) on murine B lymphocytes usually agglutinates in a cap upon reaction with anti-Ig (1, 2) or specific multivalent antigen (1, 3). Other <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> such as the antigens that react with heterologous antilymphocyte antibodies (2), the concanavalin A (Con A) receptors (2), histocompatibility antigens (4), and the theta isoantigen (1) are also redistributed after reaction with appropriate ligands.

40|$|The <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> that mediate {{activation}} of different subsets of T or NK cells have been reviewed. A suitable {{approach to the}} study of different lymphocyte activation pathways is provided by mAbs specific for these molecules. MAbs directed to the CD 3 <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> mediate a polyclonal T-cell activation, whereas mAbs to "clonotypic" structures of TCR only trigger cells bearing the corresponding clonotypic determinant (thus mimicking the effect of antigen/MHC). MAbs directed to appropriate epitopes of CD 2 molecules or to CD 28 molecules mediate polyclonal T-cell activation, leading to triggering of the functional program of the cell (i. e. proliferation, lymphokine production or {{activation of}} the cytolytic machinery). Interaction of specific mAbs with CD 3 /TCR <b>molecules</b> leads to <b>surface</b> modulation of these molecules which lasts for 48 - 72 h. During this interval the cell is refractory to any further activation stimulus. No such refractoriness occurs following mAb-induced modulation of CD 2 or CD 28 <b>surface</b> <b>molecules.</b> The mechanisms by which CD 3 /TCR modulation results in the inactivation of T-cell function appears to involve the early metabolic steps of T-cell activation, as neither Ca++ mobilization nor IP 3 formation could be further induced by any stimulus. The <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> and mechanisms involved in the activation of TCR gamma/delta cells {{are similar to those of}} TCR alpha/beta + cells. TCR gamma/delta molecules are heterogeneous in size and charge mobility. MAbs directed to one or another form of TCR gamma/delta trigger the functional program of the cell (primarily cytolytic function). However, a receptor form composed of a heavy form (55 kD) of the gamma chain appears to be relatively inefficient in signal transduction upon binding with anti-TCR mAbs. Evidence has also been provided that TCR gamma/delta + cells are capable of (allo) antigen responses and that polymorphic determinants of class I can be recognized (specific lysis of P 815 cells transfected with HLA-A 24 allele). Although the mechanisms and the <b>surface</b> receptor <b>molecules</b> involved in (CD 3 -, CD 16 +) NK cell activation are still poorly understood, several <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> have been identified that mediate NK-cell triggering. These include CD 2 and CD 16 and the novel GL 183 molecule which is selectively expressed by a fraction of NK cells and thus identifies a well-defined NK subsets. Under appropriate conditions, mAbs to CD 16 or GL 183 mediate an inhibitory effect on the NK cell activation. These data suggest that also NK cells are characterized by <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> capable of initiating distinct pathways of cell activation and that, similarly to T lymphocytes, mechanisms exist which regulate NK cell function...|$|R

CD40, a key <b>surface</b> <b>molecule</b> in the activation of the innate immune response, can induce Smad7 expression to reverse the growth inhibition of B cells induced by TGF-β.
