When the KMT government retreated to Taiwan after the loss of mainland China in the Chinese Civil War, it brought part of the precious metal and foreign currency reserve of mainland China to the island. Although war-ravaged China had held only a very small reserve, some $170 million in all, those reserves helped to establish a gold-standard reserve currency in Taiwan, which in turn helped to stabilize prices and reduce hyperinflation. More importantly, many of the Chinese intellectual and business elites moved with KMT to the island. The Japanese had built up the agricultural and industrial infrastructure as well as chemical, material, and food reserves on the island that allowed the elite of the KMT supporters to jump start their own economic endeavors.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare the effect of different types of public support for R&D projects on firms’ technological capabilities. We distinguish be-tween low-interest loans and subsidies and between national and European sup-port. Using data on 2, 319 Spanish firms during the period 2002 - 2005, we estimate a multivariate probit to analyse the determinants of firms’ participation in public R&D programmes and, later, the impact of this participation on firms’ technologi-cal capabilities using different indicators. The results provide evidence of the ef-fectiveness of all treatments for improving firms’ innovative performance. Specif-ically, although the three kinds of public aid stimulate the intensity of R&D in-vestment, the highest impact corresponds to <b>soft</b> <b>credits.</b> In addition, national sub-sidies have a higher impact on internal R&D intensity than EU grants, but the op-posite relation is found as regards total R&D intensity. With respect to innovation outputs, apart from the indirect effect of public support by stimulating R&D in-tensity, we also find evidence of a direct effect of participation in the CDTI credit system and in the European subsidy programme on the probability of obtaining product innovations and applying for patents. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} whether gradual privatization with a <b>soft</b> <b>credit</b> constraint to enterprises with state ownership (ESOs) implies slow restructuring. The transition economics literature does not study restructuring and financial constraints to investment jointly. We provide {{such an analysis}} using a panel of Latvian firms in the years 1993 - 1997. We find that firms have been downsizing their inputs while their productivity has not been improving. ESOs started up with a below-average productivity that deteriorated over time. The availability of external and internal finance did not increase investment to physical capital in the whole sample. Nevertheless, ESOs had better access to credit than did privatized firms. We conclude that there was virtually no technological restructuring and external finance for investment was scarce. Further, postponed or incomplete privatization implied slower restructuring in Latvian companies...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} general {{equilibrium}} model of a subprime economy characterized by limited recourse mortgages, asymmetric borrower credit quality information, and mortgage lenders that either own or sell the loans they originate. We identify sev-eral components in the equilibrium mortgage rate, including the access to <b>soft</b> <b>credit</b> information, the foreclosure recovery rate, and the liquidity in the securitized invest-ment market. We show that the equilibrium size of the subprime lending market can expand and contract depending on the access to liquidity in the securitized invest-ment market and the predictive power of the credit scoring technology. Our theory rationalizes {{the emergence of the}} subprime conduit mortgage market and subsequent collapse of the traditional lending model, and also the recent {{rise and fall of the}} subprime conduit mortgage market. In addition, the model sheds some light on the access to and fragmentation of the rental and owner-occupied segments of the housing market.

We test the possibility that this higher than average foreign investment may exacerbate other firms credit constraints by crowding them out of domestic capital markets. Of course one must control for that foreign firms may simply be more profitable and have access to more collateral, hence be a better investment for lending institutions. All firms (foreign, private and domestically owned, and State-owned) are credit rationed, including foreign firms. State-owned firms {{do not have an}} investment behaviour compatible with profit maximisation, a result which emphasises the soft budget constraint persistence (but not through the providing with <b>soft</b> <b>credit).</b> For these firms, wages increase together with investment.

40|$|The Soviet ruble {{has become}} the common {{currency}} for 14 independent states with their own policies on credit expansion and budget deficits. The built-in inflationary bias of the present arrangement can be redressed if the common ruble makes way for separate currencies. However, if major successor states of the Soviet Union switch to their own monies, trade between the former Soviet republics may be further disrupted {{as long as the}} new currencies are not convertible for current transactions. The European Payments Union (EPU) of the 1950 s is often presented {{as a model for the}} successor states of the Soviet Union with separate currencies. However, the EPU clearing mechanism and its facility for <b>soft</b> <b>credits</b> were mere second-best devices to mitigate the harm that was caused by the inconvertibility and the collective overvaluation of the West European currencies against the dollar. In the 1950 s, a sufficient devaluation of West European currencies would have removed the rationale for restrictions on trade and payments and would thus have made the EPU obsolete. Today, the former Soviet republics need not waste their time in a payments union, i. e. in a halfway house on the road to convertibility, unless they opted for a gross overvaluation of their currencies. In recent years, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have made their currencies convertible at least for most current transactions of their residents. This minimum convertibility has promoted their integration into the worldwide division of labour; it has been maintained because exchange rate policy has not led to a sustained misalignment. Instead of copying Western Europe's post-war mistake, the post-Soviet republics should follow the example of the East-Central European countries and make their currencies convertible at realistic and sufficiently flexible exchange rates. Regardless of their currency arrangements, the successor states of the Soviet Union have to transform their banking systems and establish an efficient system to clear payments between banks. Technical help from abroad could promote this process. However, the states need no mechanism that discriminates between interstate payments and payments between the states and third countries. Proponents of a special post-Soviet payments arrangement sometimes argue that such an institution would promote the cooperation between the successor states of the Soviet Union; it would thus be politically useful regardless of economic considerations. However, the strained political relations between many post-Soviet countries suggest that the readiness for a reliable cooperation is limited. Hence, special arrangements that inflate rather than economize on the need for cooperation are likely to be unstable. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Since {{the late}} 1990 s {{the economy has}} become an {{important}} part of the football club activities. With increased revenues, a financial framework was needed and in 2002 the "Elitlicens" introduced for this purpose. Elitlicensen is divided into different criteria, the study dealt only with the economic criteria, the requirement that clubs in Allsvenskan should maintain a positive shareholders' equity. Aim: The study aims to study items and key figures in the annual financial reports of the clubs that participated in Allsvenskan every year during the period 2010 - 2014 to examine whether and how the clubs reached Elitlicensens criterion for positive shareholders´ equity. Furthermore, the aim is to explain the club's actions based on Elitlicensens criterion of positive shareholders´ equity. Method: A case study of the AIK, BK Häcken, Djurgårdens IF's, Helsingborgs IF's, IF Elfsborg, IFK Gothenburg, Kalmar FF and Malmö FF's annual financial reports during the period 2010 - 2014 where selected items and key figures audited. Through the theoretical framework with Soft budget constraint and the Fund theory the clubs actions tries to explain. Result: All clubs have reported positive shareholders´ equity 2010 - 2014. This has been maintained through player sales, money from the UEFA Europa Cups and capital contributions from stakeholders. There have been clear hints of soft budget constraint through both <b>soft</b> <b>credit</b> and soft subsidy AIK, Djurgårdens IF, Helsingborgs IF and IFK Gothenburg. A tendency to use of the Fund theory could be seen some years in BK Hacken, IF Elfsborg, IFK Gothenburg and Kalmar FF. Conclusion: The study shows that all audited clubs reached Elitlicensens requirements in positive shareholders´ equity 2010 - 2014. Selected theories provide no coherent picture of the clubs' actions regarding shareholders´ equity. Further research is needed in this area, which also take into sporting success and club financial strategies...|$|E
40|$|Three {{institutional}} pillars {{form the}} foundations of sustainable financial markets: The existence of a pool of profitable and diverse rural clients {{with the ability to}} service loans, well-run financial institutions which are financially self supporting and an enabling policy environment. Ukraine has not been successful in developing robust rural financial markets because it has consistently undermined these three institutional pillars through soft government-provided or government-subsidized directed credits that have had an overwhelming role in rural policies in the post- Soviet period. Instead of a pool of profitable clients, the Ukrainian countryside is dominated by unprofitable farm enterprises which employ the overwhelming majority of rural residents. Second, financial institutions serving agricultural enterprises in Ukraine have largely distributed government directed <b>soft</b> <b>credit</b> at unsustainable interest rates to financially troubled farms in order to cover losses. Third, there has been abiding opposition to policies to ensure clear property rights, enforceable contracts and transparent farm restructuring and privatization, because such policies would imply the dissolution of large scale farms which are the object of most rural policies. Instead of creating sustainable rural financial markets, Ukrainian policies were instrumental in causing a substantial accumulation of bad debt by agricultural enterprises {{by the end of the}} 1990 s. Partly as a response to this problem, the Government of Ukraine privatized agricultural enterprises in a four month period in 2000 and wrote off or rescheduled much of farm debt. The government also subsequently changed its main form of financing agricultural input markets from direct state involvement to substantial credit subsidies. In these policy changes the government of Ukraine adhered to its well-established legacy of addressing the symptoms of financial problems without altering fundamental causes.

The main objective is to reveal {{the evidence of the}} both phenomena, soft budget constraints and credit rationing, investigating investment behaviour of large farms in Ukraine. Our empirical analysis is based on unbalanced panel data containing 529 agricultural enterprises from three Ukrainian regions between 2001 and 2005. Estimates of the Euler investment equation for several sub-samples reveal a dissimilar level of financial constraints. We confirm the presence of the soft financial environment (soft budget constraints) for the Ukrainian large farms being in an unconstrained financial regime. The farms belong to this regime if they receive credits after being unprofitable in two consecutive years. The other farms defined a priori as being in an constrained financial regime face evidence of credit rationing. With regard to the empirical results, we derive macroeconomic implications of financial constraints in the agriculture of Ukraine. transition agriculture, investment, <b>soft</b> budget constraints, <b>credit</b> rationing, Ukraine, Agricultural Finance,...|$|R

If relationship managers have an incentive to manipulate credit ratings, the ratings cannot be easily compared, rating fairness is reduced. Psychometric methods such as Latent Trait and Latent Class Models allow the user to identify patterns in the data, representing different rating strategies. By making use of this information, i. e. by considering the entire data matrix instead of total sums, the classification power of soft data can be considerably increased.

Indicators measuring firm’s profitability (net profit, return on assets, and return on equity) suggested a negative influence of the programme and the variable representing debt ratio further indicated that firms that were supported by the programme reported on average higher debt ratio in comparison with the control group.

40|$|E-commerce now {{constitutes}} {{a significant part}} of all commercial activity; however the increase in transactions is also leading to more disputes. These disputes are becoming more frequent, more technologically complicated and more difficult in terms of traceability. This thesis focuses specifically on dispute problems related to soft products, i. e. those that are intangible and therefore requiring no physical delivery. With the growing demand for these types of products, e. g. downloadable films, music, software, and prepaid calling time, the prevention of fraudulent transactions is becoming increasingly important. Reasons for the {{rise in the number of}} fraudulent transactions include merchants being unable to see the customer to verify an ID or signature and E-commerce enabling soft-products and services to be acquired via soft delivery methods: email, download or logging in. The introductory section provides a critique of current e-commerce fraud detection and prevention techniques and shows that not all are suitable for e-commerce, especially soft-products, and therefore unable to provide complete protection against fraud. The future relating to the detection and prevention of e-commerce fraud is then discussed, leading to suggestions regarding the improvement of the current state-of-the-art technique, the Address Verification Service (AVS), which is used to accommodate the introduction of soft-products. Apart from the exchange process problems, i. e. those involving money and goods, attention is also paid to other important factors such as timing and quality that are usually neglected in these detection and prevention techniques. Dispute scenarios from many different perspectives have been analysed, viz. computer science, business, legal and that of the participants themselves. From the analyses, all possible dispute cases have been formally listed using the 'Truth Table' approach. This analysis has then led to the design of a comprehensive taxonomy framework for dispute in e-commerce. The term Online Dispute Resolution (ODR), is the online technology applied to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) which is resolving disputes other than via litigation in the courts. Current ODR systems and their suitability for the e-commercial world have been examined, concluding that not all are appropriate for e-commerce situations (since most still involve a human element and often make the resolution process more costly than the actual item under dispute). The proposed solution to the problem is by automating the online dispute resolution process. The total solution is described in two parts (i) an E-commerce Transaction Protocol (ETP) forming the infrastructure where the transaction will take place and be able to accommodate any new improvements in the future, and (ii) an Automated Online Dispute Resolution (AODR) system which should automatically resolve any dispute occurring within the proposed e-commerce model. In order for the AODR to resolve any dispute, a product/payment specific plug-in (add-on) has been incorporated into the system. For illustration purposes, credit cards as a payment method has been selected and the appropriate plug-in specification for <b>soft</b> products and <b>credit</b> cards created. The concept of providing every soft product with a quality certificate has also been discussed. A concluding case study of e-commerce in Saudi Arabia has been used to test the viability of both the e-commerce dispute taxonomy and the proposed model. The case study shows the suitability of using ETP with AODR in order to resolve soft-product disputes automatically. Limitations of the work and further research possibilities have then been identified.

40|$|All honors {{programs}} {{face the}} problem of making their institution’s student body aware of the program’s existence, its eligibility requirements, curriculum, and benefits. Directors who are already comfortable {{with the number of}} the program’s members and applicants do not need to think much about awareness, publicity, and advertising. For example, the college’s admissions department assists many honors programs in their recruitment. However, some directors must think hard and carefully about campus-wide awareness. These directors will naturally consider some type of advertising method. However, both before and after turning to advertising, directors need to address two important questions. Before embarking on an advertising campaign, they need to know why eligible students are not applying. After the campaign, they need to know how effective the advertising methods were. We will provide a template for other honors programs to use in answering both of these questions by describing a planned marketing research evaluation of a program’s image among the student body and of our advertising efforts. Advertising is defined as the communication of persuasive information about products, services, or ideas by identified sponsors through the various media (Bovee 2 ̆ 6 Thill 9). Typical examples of advertising seen on campuses include advertisements from external sources (<b>soft</b> drink and <b>credit</b> card companies) and advertisements from internal sources (the registrar’s office), and they may take the form of fliers, posters, displays, informational tables at school events or in common areas, or announcements on campus closed-circuit television. Daniel Starch explained in 1923 that, regardless of the medium, advertisers historically have recognized that, to be effective, advertising must be seen, read, believed, remembered, and acted upon. Since Starch, researchers and practitioners in advertising have developed advanced methods to understand the target audience’s attitudes about a product or brand and also the effects of exposure to advertising. These methods are called, respectively, brand equity research and advertisement tracking. Brand equity {{is a measure of the}} strength of a consumer’s attachment to a brand (Feldwick 37) and includes measures of brand awareness, perceived quality and other consumer associations with the brand (Aaker 27). In the context of honors, brand awareness is an important marketing measure. We can ask students to recall the program name if prompted (“What programs for academically gifted students exist at York?”), and we can ask them to recognize the program name from a list (“Which program, from this list, requires a thesis for graduation?”). Measuring associations to an honors brand is another element of brand equity. A list can be developed of suspected selling points of the program (“classes with only other honor students”) and also a list of fears concerning student beliefs (“only nerds are in the program”). Students can then be asked to select all statements which they feel are advantages of the program and to select all statements which they feel are disadvantages of the program. Honors brand quality can be measured by statements regarding the benefits of the brand (“The honors program improves the image of the college to the public” and “The honors program encouraged higher academic standards for the entire college”) and by asking students to respond to Likert response scales (one-to-seven-point numerical scales). While brand equity methods generally examine pre-existing attitudes about a brand, ad tracking research determines the effectiveness of advertising by examining the consumer’s response to advertising (McDonald 119). Useful ways of measuring consumers’ responses vary and include recognition of advertising (McDonald 120), recall of advertising, awareness of brand, perceptions of brand, attitude toward brand, and reported consumer behavior (Feldwick 114). In the context of honors, ad tracking can be measured by asking students how often they heard their instructors talking about the program or whether they remember an honors student coming to their class to speak about the program. Another way to measure student awareness would be to question students about the content of advertisement messages. For example, students can be given a list of statements about the program (“Honors students take special classes just for honors students”) and asked how confident they are that the statement is true. These marketing research techniques can be applied to the publicity work of any honors program but are especially useful for those that must rely on self-generated advertising...|$|R
