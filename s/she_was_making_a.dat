25|$|Municipalities held by pro-'Yes' {{parties have}} {{also sought to}} limit the {{campaign}} events of 'No' voters by denying them rights to hold rallies in public spaces of community halls. Meral Akşener, a leading nationalist politician {{and one of the}} most prominent campaigners for a 'No' vote, was stopped from holding speeches when her campaign venues in Yalova and Edirne were abruptly shut down shortly before her events, with posters advertising her events in Eskişehir being ripped down. On 11 February while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> speech at a hotel hall in Çanakkale, the venue suffered a power cut and was perceived by the pro-opposition media to be a symbol of the oppressive tactics against the 'No' campaign. After initially being obstructed by riot police, attendees at the conference used their phone lights to allow the event to continue.|$|E

2500|$|Arfwedson {{found it}} [...] "absolutely exhausting" [...] {{to portray the}} condition. She {{admitted}} {{it was hard to}} get out of character because when she got home she would be learning lines for the following day. To avoid feeling manic herself, she would socialise, meditate and do yoga to forget about Zosia. The storyline had positive outcomes for viewers. People with the condition contacted the actress to credit her portrayal with saving their lives. Arfwedson said she found it [...] "quite moving" [...] to think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> difference in real life.|$|E

[...] During Anna Bethell's regime (Mrs. Sydney Granville), {{there had}} been growing signs of discontent and suggestions of favouritism.... But to appoint not only {{a woman who had}} for fifteen years worked in the chorus alongside several who were now principals, but the wife of one of the main principals, {{seemed to me to be}} a psychological error of the first magnitude. [...] I felt that ... she would, rightly or wrongly, be accused of that very same favouritism. [...] My views made no impression on Miss Carte, but time was to prove that I was right.... Production is done to a plan that takes no consideration of the individual, his personality or his histrionic ability – a stereotyped plan that results in a clockwork performance devoid of spontaneity.|$|E
2500|$|I {{had heard}} {{there was some}} {{possibility}} of [...] happening and ... told Miss Carte that I thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> great psychological error.

But to appoint not only a woman who had for fifteen years worked in the chorus alongside several who were now principals, but the wife of one of the main principals, seemed to me to be a psychological error of the first magnitude. [...] I felt that ... she would, rightly or wrongly, be accused of that very same favouritism. [...] My views made no impression on Miss Carte, but time was to prove that I was right. [...] Discontent grew, changes were constantly taking place, and criticism became rampant. [...] Nor did it stop at the methods of production; it went so far as to suggest a complete lack of knowledge, evidenced ... by constant self-contradiction. [...] There were other accusations levelled against her, of a more serious nature.... in control ... apparently assumed in the first place that the performers are little more than automatons and are completely devoid of brains or the ability to think for themselves.

6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} could live here," [...] said Mrs. Vincent as though <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> great admission. [...] "I don't think {{that there would be}} any law to turn him out of the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{words were}} explicit," [...] he replied, feeling {{at the moment}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> mock of him, and this duplicity hurt him.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman was}} pleased with the compliment. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> coat at the time, of a dressed deer-skin, using a fish-bone needle, with a sinew for a thread.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, my dear,' said Mrs. Edmonstone, 'I see {{no reason}} against it. But--' and {{she felt as if}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> desperate plunge, 'there is {{something}} I want to say to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And for her too. We can't {{tell what}} is going on inside her breast. I believe that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> great effort because <b>she</b> thinks it <b>is</b> right. You will be kind to her when she comes?" ...|$|R

60|$|Gradually {{she grew}} weak from loss of blood, which poured from her like rain; and at last, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> charge, she {{staggered}} round and sank down {{dead in a}} kneeling posture.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me with those {{pleasant}} eyes of hers, which had remained as candid and as sympathetic as they had been more than twenty years before. I wondered if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> fool of me.|$|E
60|$|The thought {{returned}} {{several times}} that morning, for it was truly a bitter day, and, {{in spite of his}} bear-skin coat, the Doctor shivered. But he had great faith in Rose's good sense, and it never occurred to him that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> little Casabianca of herself, with the difference of freezing instead of burning at her post.|$|E

60|$|All {{the time}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> social {{estimate}} of him. He was {{not by any}} means impossible. On the contrary there was no reason why he should not become a success. That he was interested in her was already obvious, but that had become her intention. The task began to seem almost easy as she sat and listened to him.|$|E
6000|$|Past her {{shot the}} {{little old lady}} in the bonnet, running {{incredibly}} fast, but otherwise still alertly respectable, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> strange threatening sound as she ran, such as one would use in driving ducks out of a garden--"B-r-r-r-r-r--!" [...] and pawing with black-gloved hands. The policemen were closing in from the sides to intervene. The little old lady struck like a projectile upon the resounding chest of the foremost of these, and then Ann Veronica had got past and was ascending the steps.|$|E
60|$|One of them, {{let me say}} at once, {{produced}} a very disagreeable impression on me. I have unexpectedly discovered Mrs. Tenbruggen--in <b>a</b> postscript. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> living as a Medical Rubber (or Masseuse), and is in professional attendance on Mr. Dunboyne the elder. More of this, a little further on.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a brief}} {{pause in}} the {{conversation}} {{they were trying to}} get started. Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek. Even as she asked, he realized that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>an</b> effort to talk his talk, and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Miss Norman <b>is</b> sorry <b>she</b> can't see you to-day as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> visit; but <b>she</b> {{has given}} me a message for you, or rather a {{commission}} to discharge.

60|$|He demanded {{from her}} {{the writing of}} the letter almost {{immediately}} after the conversation which has been given above, and of course the letter was written,--written and recopied, for the paragraph about the money was, of course, at last of his wording. And she could not make the remainder of the letter pleasant. The feeling that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> demand for money on her father ran through it all. But the reader need only see the passage in which Ferdinand Lopez made his demand,--through her hand.|$|E
60|$|Emily, in her full-blooded beauty, was at home. It is rare now {{to feel a}} kinship {{between a}} room {{and the one who}} inhabits it, a close bond of blood relation. Emily had at last found her place, and had escaped from the torture of strange, complex modern life. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> pie, and the flour was white on her brown arms. She pushed the {{tickling}} hair from her face with her arm, and looked at me with tranquil pleasure, as she worked the paste in the yellow bowl. I was quiet, subdued before her.|$|E
60|$|Heavy rains lashed {{the windows}} at Appleyard and a wild west wind buffeted the house. Between the gusts one {{could hear the}} wail of storm-tossed trees and the distant roar of the flood tide foaming across the Solway sands. It was, however, warm and bright within the thick granite walls, and Andrew lounged {{in a corner of}} the billiard-room after dinner, {{watching}} Elsie knit. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> soldier's woolen belt, and he noted the precise neatness of the work. Elsie was conscientious in all she did, but he thought this view of the matter did not go far enough. The care with which she linked up the stitches was deepened by love.|$|E
6000|$|... "Unjust I maybe, Evandale, but I {{should not}} have dreamt," [...] glancing her eye at a mirror, [...] "of being thought envious without better cause.
