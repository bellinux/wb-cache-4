5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly figure, a <b>status</b> <b>that</b> he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E

Currently, the city is the largest in the Nord-Vest development region, which is equivalent to NUTS-II regions in the European Union and is used by the European Union and the Romanian Government for statistical analysis and regional development. The Nord-Vest development region is not, however, an administrative entity. The Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area became operational in December 2008, and comprises a population of 411,379. Besides Cluj-Napoca, it includes seventeen communes: Aiton, Apahida, Baciu, Bonțida, Borșa, Căianu, Chinteni, Ciurila, Cojocna, Feleacu, Florești, Gârbău, Gilău, Jucu, Petreștii de Jos, Tureni and Vultureni.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{response}} to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Yatsenyuk announced his intentions to resume the bid for NATO integration on 29 August 2014, and in December 2014, Ukraine's parliament voted to drop the non-aligned <b>status</b> <b>that</b> it adopted in 2010. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has stated that NATO membership is still an option for Ukraine, and support for NATO membership has risen to 63.9 percent in government-controlled Ukraine according to a July 2015 poll. Previous polls had shown that the decline in opposition to membership was linked to the ongoing Russian intervention.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Olivia were from an {{extended}} area of convection, or thunderstorm activity, that persisted southwest of Mexico in late October. Following {{the development of}} a circulation, the system formed into a tropical depression early on October22 about 430mi (690km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Olivia as it tracked northwestward, although further strengthening was slowed. The circulation became much better defined on October23 and after Olivia turned northeastward, it attained hurricane <b>status</b> <b>that</b> evening.|$|E

5|$|Artisans and {{craftsmen}} {{during the}} Han had a socio-economic status between that of farmers and merchants. Yet some {{were able to}} obtain a valuable income, such as one craftsman who made knives and swords {{and was able to}} eat food fit for nobles and officials. Artisans and craftsmen also enjoyed a legal <b>status</b> <b>that</b> was superior to merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, artisans were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred artisans from becoming officials. An artisan painter who worked at the Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants.|$|E
5|$|Despite the storm's extreme intensity, {{it quickly}} began to weaken as it {{approached}} the Philippines on October 6. Within ten hours, the pressure rose to 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg) and later dropped below Category 5 <b>status.</b> <b>That</b> morning, Nora turned more northwesterly {{in response to}} a weakening in a subtropical ridge and an approaching shortwave trough over China. Steady weakening continued over the following days, with the storm brushing the northeastern tip of Luzon, Philippines, with winds of 175ndash&185 km/h (110ndash&115 mph) on October 7. Nora's intensity leveled out around 130 km/h (80 mph) on October 8 as it tracked between the Philippines and Taiwan. After passing within 95 km (60 mi) of Taiwan, Nora turned more northerly before making landfall near Xiamen, Fujian as a minimal typhoon early on October 10. Once onshore, the storm rapidly degenerated into an area of low pressure before dissipating the following day.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} settlement, Augustus was also granted {{the power of}} a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the {{official}} title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a <b>status</b> <b>that</b> Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.|$|E

5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised {{by a large}} production run, {{and the fact that}} the US was shouldering the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the position of a subcontractor, instead of the full partner <b>status</b> <b>that</b> would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone turned northward and {{accelerated}} on August 8 while reaching major hurricane <b>status</b> <b>that</b> evening. Early on August 9, Belle achieved its peak intensity with maximum estimated surface winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 957 mb (hPa; 28.26 inHg). At higher altitudes within the storm, recon reported winds up to 150 mph (240 km/h). Turning to {{just east of}} due north, Belle began weakening shortly thereafter with its eye becoming obscured. Late on August 9, the hurricane passed within 60 mi (95 km) of Hatteras Island, North Carolina. Contrary to most storms which threaten the northeastern states, Belle did not accelerate tremendously as it neared land. Accordingly, it weakened quickly in response to cooler waters in the region. Around 05:00 UTC on August 10, Belle made landfall as a minimal hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds along Jones Beach, Long Island, New York. Briefly crossing the Long Island Sound, Belle made a second landfall as a strong tropical storm near Bridgeport, Connecticut. Once inland over New England, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while traversing New Hampshire. The remnants accelerated northeast and later due east across Atlantic Canada before emerging over the Labrador Sea on August 12. While situated between the Azores and Greenland, ex-Belle turned north-northeast and ultimately dissipated south of Iceland on August 15.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakening}} trend ended {{early on}} September26 and Bonnie regained tropical storm <b>status</b> <b>that</b> afternoon as deep convection re-established itself. Bonnie continued its change in direction, {{turning to the}} southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a high-shear environment. It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September27 as it made the turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm, and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September28. During that period, Bonnie actually strengthened back into a high-end tropical storm. Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charley's path towards the Azores thereafter. The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear, although it only weakened slightly on September29 as it accelerated towards the northeast. The storm crossed over the Azores on September30 as a strong tropical storm with 65mph (100km/h) winds. After that, Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon, {{just east of the}} Azores. The extratropical low drifted back to the southwest in a clockwise loop, actually approaching the Azores once again while dissipating. It dissipated on October2.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Western Han, {{imperial}} relatives and some military officers {{who had served}} Emperor Gaozu were made kings who ruled over large semi-autonomous fiefs, but once the non-related kings had died off, an imperial edict outlawed all non-Liu family members from becoming kings. The emperor's brothers, paternal cousins, brother's sons, and emperor's sons—excluding the heir apparent—were made kings. The emperor's sisters and daughters were made princesses with fiefs. Although the central government eventually stripped away {{the political power of}} the kings and appointed their administrative staffs, kings still had a right to collect a portion of the taxes in their territory as personal income and enjoyed a social <b>status</b> <b>that</b> ranked just below the emperor. Each king had a son designated to be heir apparent, while his other sons and brothers were given the rank of marquess and ruled over small marquessates where a portion of the taxes went to their private purse. Although kings and marquesses enjoyed many privileges, the imperial court was at times aggressive towards them to check their power. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, thousands of noble families, including those from the royal houses of Qi, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Han, and Wei from the Warring States period, were forcibly moved to the vicinity of the capital Chang'an. In the first half of Western Han, resettlement could also be imposed on powerful and wealthy officials as well as individuals who owned property worth more than a million cash.|$|E
