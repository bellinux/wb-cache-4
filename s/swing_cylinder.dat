40|$|Abstract. The pin-rack gearing is a {{particular}} type of cycloidal gearing which transforms a rotation motion to a linear one. Comparing with rack and pinion gearing and hydraulic <b>swing</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the pin-rack gearing has a more compact structure, less mass and lower cost. Nevertheless, designers always worry about vibration, noise and low use life as pin-rack mechanism working caused by deficiency of design theory. The present research derived the pin-rack gearing tooth profile equation and studied the geometry relationship among design parameters. The results can help to improve the pin-rack gearing design. Instruction The pin-rack gearing is {{a particular}} type of cycloidal gearing which transforms a rotation motion to a linear one, as shown in Fig. 1. Although involute gearing has replaced cycloidal gearing in many areas, the pin-rack gearing still has broad applications, such as gate devices applying pin-rack gearing to raise or lower the gate [1] and military bridges using pin-rack gearing to erect or retract bridge sections [2]. Comparing with rack and pinion gearing and hydraulic <b>swing</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the pin-rack gearing has a more compact structure, less mass and lower cost. Nevertheless, designers always worry about vibration, noise and low use life as pin-rack mechanism working caused by deficiency of desig...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Zig-zag revolver had a {{solid frame}} and loading gate. It was developed in 1878, {{and was the first}} German military handgun to fire modern brass cartridges. It replaced the earlier needle-fire and pinfire revolvers. [...] The C78 was designed for the 1879 German trials to provide the first metallic cartridge handgun. The design evolved into a top break, and a <b>swinging</b> <b>cylinder</b> design and also include a rifle version. It performed well in the trials but was rejected for being too complex to manufacture. This was Paul Mauser's first handgun design.|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{control systems}} of {{butterfly}} valves are presently valve-controlled and pump-controlled. Valve-controlled hydraulic systems have serious power loss and generate much heat during throttling. Pump-controlled hydraulic systems have no overflow or throttling losses but {{are limited in}} the speed adjustment of the variable-displacement pump, generate much noise, pollute the environment, and have motor power that does not match load requirements, resulting in low efficiency under light loads and wearing of the variable-displacement pump. To overcome these shortcomings, this article designs a closed hydraulic control system in which an AC servo motor drives a quantitative pump that controls a spiral <b>swinging</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder,</b> and analyzes and calculates the structure and parameters of a spiral <b>swinging</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder.</b> The hydraulic system adjusts the servo motorâ€™s speed {{according to the requirements}} of the control system, and the motor power matches the power provided to components, thus eliminating the throttling loss of hydraulic circuits. The system is compact, produces a large output force, provides stable transmission, has a quick response, and is suitable as a hydraulic control system of a large butterfly valve...|$|R

If a flail strikes the ground above a buried mine, the impact will cause the mine to safely detonate. The vehicle can clear a lane 4.7 m wide and 120 m long in 10 minutes. An automatic system fixed on the rear of the hull marks the cleared lane.|$|R

50|$|Both {{hydraulic}} and {{pneumatic power}} {{may be used}} to drive an actuator, usually the larger and more powerful types. As their internal construction is generally similar (in principle, if not in size) they are often considered together as fluid power actuators. Fluid power actuators are of two common forms: those where a linear piston and cylinder mechanism is geared to produce rotation (illustrated), and those where a rotating asymmetrical vane <b>swings</b> through a <b>cylinder</b> of two different radii. The differential pressure between {{the two sides of the}} vane gives rise to an unbalanced force and thus a torque on the output shaft. Vane actuators require a number of sliding seals and the joints between these seals have tended to cause more problems with leakage than for the piston and cylinder type.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{interest}} in unmanned excavator is growing {{more and more}} {{for the sake of}} work efficiency and safety of the operator. It is general understanding that an optimal working path planning and inverse dynamic control should be resolved first for the realization of the unmanned excavator. In this paper, the methods to determine the optimal working path based on minimum torque or time and to simulate digging works tracking on the designed working path are proposed. In case of the minimum torque, the optimal working path is determined to minimize the joint torques of attachments. On the other hand, in case of minimum time, the optimal working path is decided to minimize time duration for one-cycle working considering the hydraulic constraints such as oil flow rate and relief pressure etc. In order to verify the inverse dynamic code used in the optimization and the optimized path, field measurements were carried out for the various parameters such as <b>swing</b> angle, <b>cylinder</b> lengths, and pressures of a swing motor and hydraulic cylinders during digging works. The modified FEE(Fundamental Earthmoving Equation) is adopted for the modeling of soil-tool interaction in digging process and the inverse dynamics with external force such as constant and reducing lifting weights is used in lifting and dumping process. Finally, all the simulated data were compared with the measured data in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods in view of the development of the unmanned excavator...|$|R
40|$|Human-induced {{wake flow}} {{characteristics}} and its interaction with thermal conditions was investigated by performing CFD simulations with dynamic-meshing of a moving manikin model. The manikin motion {{with and without}} swinging limbs was achieved by the re-meshing method to update the grid with each time step. The results focused on determining what discrepancies are produced in the flow field by a simplified geometry {{in the form of}} a <b>cylinder,</b> <b>swinging</b> limbs and thermal conditions; and whether such assumptions can be made for larger multi-body analysis. Using a cylinder showed differences in the velocity field behind the head and leg gap. The flow field between the rigid motion and swinging limb motion, showed significant discrepancies which corresponded to the gait phase. There were increased airflow disturbances at the hands and ankles (furthest body parts from the pivot point). The influence of thermal plume on the wake flow was minor during walking motion because of the walking speed of 1. 2 m/s which dominated the buoyant thermal plume velocity. However, after the manikin stopped moving the thermal plume velocity became comparable to the residual wake...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{chambered}} for an 8mm black-powder cartridge closely {{resembling the}} [...]32-20 WCF round, later models issued during World War I and thereafter fired the same 8mm cartridge loaded with smokeless powder. The Mle 1892 revolver is a double-action solid-frame design, with chambers being accessed by <b>swinging</b> out the <b>cylinder</b> to the right. The fired cases {{can then be}} pushed out of the cylinder at the same time. After reloading, the cylinder is swung back into the frame and locked into place with the case-hardened loading gate located {{on the right side}} of the frame. In addition, the left sideplate of the frame can be swung back on a hinge to give access to the gun's internal parts for oiling or cleaning. These parts were individually numbered to indicate the order in which they can be disassembled.

40|$|Abstract. A new testing {{form was}} designed, {{in which the}} screens having gray scales and some solid blocks were included. The screens consist of gray scales from 0 to 100 % of dot {{coverage}}, and the solid blocks also have coverage scales from 0 to 100 %. Printing experiment was performed, and densities and dot coverage of specific places were measured and recorded. Based on the testing data, density or dot coverage undulation with printing impressions was indicated by curves. Furthermore analysis was taken. Dot gains in the same prints are not constant, which cause that saddle shape in prints. Some reasons from construction of press such as the gap of <b>cylinder,</b> <b>swing</b> of transferring roller and oscillation of oscillating rollers were brought out. Same values of ink presetting can not get the same printing quality in the ink zones which have the same graphic coverage. The traditional press has a long make-ready time in printing running, which can reduce the efficiency of press. Shaft-less technology of inking system is put forward to cut down the make-ready time and to decrease the power consumption. New algorithm research is necessary for ink zone presetting {{in order to get}} more precise ink feeding. Some research on the press construction is also important for the press having some inherent defects...|$|R
