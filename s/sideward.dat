5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and <b>sideward</b> translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E
25|$|As the war went on, the T-34 {{gradually}} {{lost some}} of its initial advantage. The Germans responded to the T-34 by fielding large numbers of improved anti-tank weapons such as the towed 75mm gun, while hits from 88mm-armed Tigers, anti-aircraft guns and PaK 43 88mm anti-tank guns usually proved lethal. A Wa Pruef 1 report estimated that, with the target angled 30° <b>sideward,</b> a Panther tank could penetrate the turret of a T-34-85 from the front at ranges up to 2000m, the mantlet at 1200m, and the frontal hull armour at 300m. According to the Pantherfibel, the T-34's glacis could be penetrated from 800m and the mantlet from 1500 m at 30° <b>sideward</b> angle. Ground trials by employees of NIBT Poligon in May 1943 reported that the KwK 36 88mm gun could pierce the T-34 frontal hull from 1,500 metres at 90 degrees and cause a disastrous burst effect inside the tank. The examined hull showed cracks, spalling, and delamination due to the poor quality of the armour. It was recommended to increase and improve the quality of welds and armour.|$|E
25|$|The colour {{of light}} emitted by vehicle lights is largely {{standardised}} by longstanding convention. It was first codified in the 1949 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic and later specified in the 1968 United Nations Convention on Road Traffic. Generally, but with some regional exceptions, lamps facing rearward must emit red light, lamps facing <b>sideward</b> and all turn signals must emit amber light, while lamps facing frontward must emit white or selective yellow light. No other colours are permitted except on emergency vehicles.|$|E
40|$|Growth and {{morphology}} {{of potato}} (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Benimaru) plantlets in the {{vessels in the}} <b>sidewards</b> lighting were compared {{with those in the}} vessels in conventional downwards lighting with and without addition of sugar to the medium. The amount of electricity for lighting per plantlet in the <b>sidewards</b> lighting was set to be the same as that in the downwards lighting. When sugar was added to the medium, dry weight, fresh weight, leaf area, and the maximum diameter of stem of the plantlets on day 28 in the <b>sidewards</b> lighting were 1. 4, 1. 9, 1. 8, and 1. 1 times greater than those in the downwards lighting, respectively. When sugar was not added to the medium, these values were 1. 7, 1. 9, 1. 7, and 1. 2, respectively. On the other hand, shoot length of the plantlets in the <b>sidewards</b> lighting was 600 f that of the plantlets in the downwards lighting regardless of sugar treatments. The <b>sidewards</b> lighting promoted the growth of potato plantlets, therefore, the <b>sidewards</b> lighting could reduce the relative consumption of electricity for lighting by shortening the culture period and produce the plantlets with reduced stems...|$|R

25|$|One, the WEEKLY frame, {{consists}} of a simple downward movement. It combines with the signs for {{the days of the}} week, which then lose their inherent movement. For example, 'Monday' {{consists of}} an M/O hand made with a circling movement. 'MondayWEEKLY' (that is, 'on Mondays') is therefore signed as an M/O hand that drops downward, but without the circling movement. A similar ALL DAY frame (a <b>sideward</b> pan) combines with times of the day, such as 'morning' and 'afternoon', which likewise keep their handshape and location but lose their original movement. Numeral incorporation (see above) also uses frames. However, in ASL frames are most productively utilized for verbal aspect.|$|E
25|$|Modelling {{indicates}} {{a system where}} andesitic melts coming from the mantle rise through the crust and generate a zone of mafic volcanism. Increases in the melt flux and thus heat and volatile input causes partial melting of the crust, forming a layer containing melts reaching down to the Moho that inhibits the ascent of mafic magmas because of its higher buoyancy. Instead, melts generated in this zone eventually reach the surface, generating felsic volcanism. Some mafic magmas escape <b>sideward</b> after stalling in the melt containing zone; these generate more mafic volcanic systems {{at the edge of}} the felsic volcanism, such as Cerro Bitiche. The magmas are mixtures of crust derived and mafic mantle-derived melts with a consistent petrological and chemical signature. The melt generation process may involve several different layers in the crust.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} postural behaviour in static reaching <b>sidewards,</b> and {{the role}} of the trunk in particular. It turned out that the trunk (chest, pelvis) is not involved when reaching <b>sidewards</b> up to roughly 40 - 50 °(depending on the reach distance). At greater angles the arm, the chest, and the pelvis each contribute at a particular rate to get the index finger onto target. These rates are reasonably similar to the average contributions of the arm, chest, and pelvis to the total of the range of motions of the arm, chest, and pelvis, suggesting that these segments share the musculoskeletal load equally.

40|$|We {{study the}} recent {{claim that the}} intranuclear cascade model {{exhibits}} collective <b>sidewards</b> flow. 4000 intranuclear cascade simulations of the reaction Nb(400 MeV/nucleon) +Nb are performed employing bound and unbound versions of the Cugnon cascade. We show that instability of the target and projectile nuclei in the unbound cascade produces substantial spurious <b>sidewards</b> flow angles, for spectators {{as well as for}} participants. Once the nuclear binding is included, the peak of the flow angle distributions for the participants alone is reduced from 35 ° to 17 °. The theoretical ‘‘data’’ are subjected to the experimental multiplicity and efficiency cuts of the plastic ball 4 &# 960; electronic spectrometer system. The flow angular distributions obtained from the bound cascade—with spectators and participants subjected to the plastic ball filter—are forward peaked, in contrast to the plastic ball data. We discuss the uncertainties encountered with the application of the experimental efficiency and multiplicity filter. The influence of the Pauli principle on the flow is also discussed. The lack of flow effects in the cascade model clearly reflects the absence of the nuclear compression energy that can cause substantially larger collective <b>sidewards</b> motion—there is too little intrinsic pressure built up in the cascade model...|$|R

5000|$|In aeronautics, keel {{effect is}} the result of the sideforce-generating {{surfaces}} being above (or below) the center of mass (which coincides with the center of gravity) in any aircraft. Examples of such surfaces are the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and parts of the fuselage. When an aircraft is in a sideslip, these surfaces generate <b>sidewards</b> lift forces. If the surface is above or below the center of gravity, the <b>sidewards</b> lift forces generate a rolling moment. This [...] "rolling moment caused by sideslip" [...] is [...] "dihedral effect". Keel effect is the contribution of these side forces to rolling moment (as sideslip increases), i.e. keel effect is the contribution of the side forces to dihedral effect. Sideforce producing surfaces above the center of gravity will increase dihedral effect, while sideforce producing surfaces below the center of gravity will decrease dihedral effect.|$|R

5000|$|A {{continuous}} system having imaginary poles, i.e. having zero real {{part in the}} pole(s), will produce sustained oscillations in the output. For example, an undamped second-order system such as the suspension system in an automobile ( [...] a mass-spring-damper system), from which the damper has been removed and spring is ideal, i.e. no friction is there, will in theory oscillate forever once disturbed. Another example is a frictionless pendulum. A system with a pole at the origin is also marginally stable {{but in this case}} there will be no oscillation in the response as the imaginary part is also zero (jw = 0 means w = 0 rad/sec). An example of such a system is a mass on a surface with friction. When a <b>sidewards</b> impulse is applied, the mass will move and never returns to zero. The mass will come to rest due to friction however, and the <b>sidewards</b> movement will remain bounded.|$|R
