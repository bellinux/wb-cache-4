50|$|Electric motors need {{overcurrent}} protection to prevent damage from over-loading the motor, or {{to protect against}} short circuits in connecting cables or internal faults in the motor windings. The overload sensing devices are a form of heat operated relay where a coil heats a bimetallic strip, or where a <b>solder</b> <b>pot</b> melts, releasing a spring to operate auxiliary contacts. These auxiliary contacts are in series with the coil. If the overload senses excess current in the load, the coil is de-energized.|$|E

5000|$|Miniature wave {{selective}} solder fountain(s): This typically uses a round miniature pumped solder wave, {{similar to the}} end of a pencil or crayon, to sequentially solder the PCB. The process is slower than the two previous methods, but more accurate. The PCB may be fixed, and the wave <b>solder</b> <b>pot</b> moved underneath the PCB; alternately, the PCB may be articulated over a fixed wave or solder bath to undergo the selective-soldering process. Unlike the first two examples, this process is toolless.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonic {{soldering}} is {{a distinctly}} different process than ultrasonic welding. Ultrasonic welding uses ultrasonic energy to join parts without adding {{any kind of}} filler material while ordinary soldering uses external heating to melt filler metal materials, namely solders, to form a joint. Ultrasonic soldering {{can be done with}} either a specialized soldering iron or a specialized <b>solder</b> <b>pot.</b> In either case the process can be automated for large-scale production or can be done by hand for prototyping or repair work. Initially, U/S soldering was aimed at joining aluminum and other metals; however, with the emergence of active solders, a much wider range of metals, ceramics and glass can now be soldered.|$|E
5000|$|Flux-less {{soldering}} with aid {{of conventional}} soldering iron, ultrasonic soldering iron or specialized <b>solder</b> <b>pot</b> and active solder that contains an active element, most often Ti, Zr or Cr. [...] The active elements, owing to mechanical activation, react with {{the surface of}} the materials generally considered difficult to solder without premetallization. The active solders can be protected against excessive oxidation of their active element by addition of rare earth elements with higher affinity to oxygen (typically Ce, La). Another common additive is Ga - usually introduced as a wetting promoter. Mechanical activation, needed for active soldering, can be performed by brushing (for example with use of stainless wire brush or steel spatula) or ultrasonic vibration (20 - 60 kHz). Active soldering has been shown to effectively bond ceramics, aluminium, titanium, silicon, graphite and carbon nanotube based structures [...] at temperatures lower than 450 °C or use of protective atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|South Carolina Electric & Gas (SCE&G) submits {{this letter}} in {{accordance}} with the requirements of 10 CFR 21. 21 (a) (2) as a final report of an identified defect which was potentially associated with a substantial safety hazard. During the monthly surveillance test STP 0125. 002 A on 12 / 21 / 00, the "A " diesel generator experienced load swings during unloading. Replacement of the Woodward Governor EGA unit eliminated the load swing problem. Following removal of the EGA unit, an on-site bench test and inspection was performed. Although the EGA successfully passed the bench test, the inspection identified some questionable solder joints on the stability potentiometer (pot). This pot has three ring terminal connections through which wire leads are looped and then soldered. One of the connections had the wire lead looped through it, but did not appear to have any solder on it. It was suspected that if contact between the lead and terminal were intermittent on the stability pot, then the output signal from the EGA would be erratic and cause load swings and instability, as was experienced on 12 / 21 / 00. Since all of the pots in an EGA were replaced during refurbishment by Power Control Services (PCS) of Engine Systems, Inc. (a Woodward governor nuclear supplier), adequate <b>soldering</b> of the <b>pot</b> terminals during a previous refurbishment was questioned. The EGA was sent to PCS for inspection, testing and refurbishment to determine if it caused the problems experienced during the surveillance testing. ~j 3 ~gj/c 7...|$|R
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. <b>Solder</b> <b>pot</b> heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{three-dimensional}} finite volume-based analysis on the effects of propeller blades on fountain flow in a wave soldering process and performs an experimental validation. Design/methodology/approach – <b>Solder</b> <b>pot</b> models with various numbers of propeller blades were developed and meshed by using hybrid elements and simulated by using the FLUENT fluid flow solver. The characteristics of the fountain, such as flow profile, velocity vector, filling time, and fountain advancement, were investigated. Molten solder (Sn 63 Pb 37) material, a temperature of 250 °C, and a propeller speed of 830  rpm were applied in the simulation. The predicted results were validated by the experimental fountain profile. Findings – The use of a six-blade propeller in a <b>solder</b> <b>pot</b> increased the fountain thickness profile and reduced the filling time. Moreover, a six-blade propeller design resulted in a stable fountain profile and was considered the best choice for current wave soldering processes. Practical implications – This study provides a better understanding of the effects of propeller blades on the fountain flow in the wave soldering process. Originality/value – The study explores the fountain flow behavior and provides a reference to the engineers and designers in order to improve the fountain flow of the wave soldering. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} the effects of temperature on the wave soldering of printed circuit boards (PCBs) using three-dimensional finite volume analysis. A computational <b>solder</b> <b>pot</b> model consisting of a six-blade rotational propeller was developed and meshed using tetrahedral elements. The leaded molten solder (Sn 63 Pb 37) distribution and PCB wetting profile were determined using the volume of fluid technique in the fluid flow solver, FLUENT. In this study, the effects of five different molten solder temperatures (456 K, 473 K, 523 K, 583 K, and 643 K) on the wave soldering of a 70 mm × 146 mm PCB were considered. The effects of temperature on wetting area, wetting profile, velocity vector, and full wetting time were likewise investigated. Molten solder temperature significantly affected the wetting time and distribution of PCBs. The molten solder temperature at 523 K demonstrated desirable wetting distribution and yielded a stable fountain profile and was therefore considered the best temperature in this study. The simulation results were substantiated by the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Plastic {{electronic}} {{packages are}} known to absorb moisture when exposed to humid ambient conditions during storage in tape and reel in the factory. Reliability becomes a concern when packages are exposed to a humid environment for a prolonged time and then processed through a reflow oven. Thermo-mechanical and moisture induced interfacial stresses generated between the die attach and die may lead to die delam-ination and package cracking. Current package level moisture evaluation methods are based on experimental weight gain mea-surements and visual inspection after reflow for cracking or delamination. This study presents a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation of the moisture weight gain or loss in plastic ball grid array (PBGA) packages {{as a function of}} time, including the effects of package geometry and material selection. Experimental weight gain and bake-out data for a 68 I/O PBGA package are shown to closely match FEA model predictions. Diffusivity and solubility property data for common packaging materials are given as a function of temperature from 23 to 210 C. <b>Solder</b> <b>pot</b> dip tests performed at 230 C indicate that popcorn failures result when the moisture concentration in the die attach region exceeds 0. 0048 g/cm 3 for the specific package tested.

40|$|Developing {{lead free}} {{connector}} products involves {{at least two}} distinct steps: removing the lead from the product and ensuring the product has sufficient thermal stability. Lead is most commonly found in terminal finishes and {{has been removed from}} most thermoplastic materials used in connectors. Ensuring sufficient thermal stability requires knowledge of the thermal excursions involved in soldering and how these excursions translate into product performance metrics. For reflow soldering, we know the maximum soldering temperatures will increase by 20 to 30 C. The magnitude of this change is not large, however, the temperature value, 260 C, exceeds the melt point of many engineering thermoplastics. Since the cost of these plastics typically scales with melt temperature, an increase in thermal requirements can mean a significant cost increase. In this paper we strive to understand the fundamental response of the plastics to the transient thermal excursions involved in wave soldering. FEM simulations demonstrate the thermal gradients that exist during these processes. These results can be used to understand the heat transfer and then to engineer the products to ensure reliability. Wave solder process simulation shows that the pin to plastic interface resides at a temperature very near to that of the solder. Connector terminals, made from copper based alloys, often have very high thermal diffusivities, increasing heat flow from the <b>solder</b> <b>pot</b> into the plastic. FEM results are compared to experimental results from lab and production manufactured testing of solderable interconnects. A test method for evaluating plastic performance in wave solder applications is proposed...|$|E
