40|$|The {{business}} services sector plays {{an increasingly important}} role in enhancing a country’s competitiveness. Reduced product cycles times, prompt delivery, and improved customer services are crucial {{for the survival of}} firms, and in particular exporters, in a competitive environment. As a result, the service content of final exports is increasing. In traditional and high-labor intensive sectors, it is the creation of a brand, design and marketing to play a central role, whereas in technology-intensive sectors, this role is played by R&D and after sale assistance. Recently, in line with developments at world level, the Italian economy has witnessed a significant increase of {{business services}}. In the EU’s total <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> however, Italy still occupies a relatively weak position, and the average size of Italian business services firms is below the European one. Such features, given the relevance of services in firms’ competitiveness and in internationalization trends may represent a factor of weakness for the Italian economy. This book recommends to invest resources in business services to “support” production activities: it highlights which services may “contribute” the most to the internationalization process; therefore helping to formulate adequate economic policies. The book also shows that the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> is highly diversified across regions and categories, in terms of both endowment and access. Only by reducing these differences, the country’s competitiveness can be improved.

40|$|Abstract. Business-service {{activities}} are poorly represented in provincial {{areas of the}} British economy, and this acts as a constraint on the economic growth of these locations. This argument is developed in a survey investigation of business-service offices in the conurbations of Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham. It is argued that external control is an important feature of the business-service sector, and that the organisational structure of multisite service firms influences the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> The importance of indigenous employment growth and industrial movement in provincial cities is examined. It is suggested that some business services generate regional exports, and should therefore, be given regional policy support. 1 Business services and regional economic development The way in which firms use business-service activities has an important effect on their economic performance. Johnston (1963) suggests that firms using management consultants can achieve a 53 % increase in labour productivity. Freeman (1979) also argues that the failure of UK firms to exploit research-and-development opportunit ies contributes to their poor performance in international trade. There is an important regional dimension {{to the impact of}} business-service activity on firm performance...|$|E

A postal survey of selected industries considers {{the impact of a}} number of industrial and organisational determinants of spatial variations in manufacturing service demands. The study suggests that external control is not the only important predictor of service linkage; previous research has neglected the influence of spatial differences in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> services on the pattern of manufacturing industry demand. Research relating variations in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>service</b> activities to differences in regional economic growth is critically reviewed. It is suggested that the economic growth of provincial regions could be improved by expanding key services in selected provincial centres at differing levels of the urban hierarchy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} public <b>business</b> <b>services</b> (PBSs) for early-stage small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in northern sparsely populated areas (NSPAs) of Northern Finland. These areas face challenges of globalisation, structural changes and demographic change. PBSs of these areas face special challenges including limited resources, remoteness, heterogeneous customer base, and long distances. This study describes how PBSs are organised and what kind of services is available for early-stage technology intensive companies in the three case NSPAs. The focus is on analysis and comparison <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> public <b>business</b> <b>services</b> in the three subregions of Oulu South region.

These include predictive mechanisms such as input-output analysis, assessment mechanisms such as choice modelling and experimental workshops, and engagement mechanisms such as extended stakeholder analysis...|$|R
40|$|Household {{and small}} {{manufacturing}} industries (HMIs and SMIs) {{are very important}} {{especially in terms of}} employment generation in the densely populated areas of Indonesia like Java. This is because in 1996 they accounted for 44 % and 17 % of manufacturing industry employment respectively, but only 6 % and 5 % of manufacturing industry value-added. They were even more important in rural areas because 95 % and 59 % of HMI and SMI employees were in rural areas and 92 % and 44 % of their value-added. Many of the establishments in rural areas processed imported raw materials instead of locally produced materials. The rates of growth of household and small manufacturing industries real value-added were high from 1986 to 1996 in spite of unfavourable government policies, 7. 2 % and 12. 3 % per annum, but lower than medium/large establishments at 16. 4 %. HMS and SMIs were hit hard by the economic crisis of 1997, especially those selling fully or partially non-tradeable goods using fully tradable inputs, although they recovered quite quickly. There is a good potential for firther development of HMIs and SMIs that can be facilitated by the expansion and improvement of financial institutions and <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> privately delivered <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> and improved foreign direct investment and marketing, micro-establishment retailing, and local government economic policies...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{an analytical}} model for maximizing social welfare, {{which can be}} used for finding the optimal offering of a set of software services. The analytical model also explains the impact of service flexibility on customer¡¯s selection <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> and on the revenue of service providers. The analytical model is based on a utility model and a cost model. The cost model uses the number of lines of code as the basic measure for cost and applies linear and polynomial cost functions. The utility model is derived from a customer-provider relationship model, which relates the user¡¯s utility to the functionality <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> The result <b>of</b> the analytical model shows that the distribution of functions <b>of</b> an existing <b>business</b> <b>service</b> to a large number <b>of</b> new <b>business</b> <b>services</b> does not generate any additional revenues for the service provider from existing customers. Instead, additional revenue is generated through the offering <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> with fewer functions at lower price. This <b>business</b> <b>services</b> attract customers, which could not afford the original software service of the provider.

40|$|If <b>business</b> <b>services</b> {{have any}} {{potential}} {{to function as}} basic industries that access autonomous sources of demand outside the region or nation, it hinges on {{the degree to which}} these activities can be sold to distant, and preferably international, export markets. It is essential to understand the factors that make <b>business</b> <b>services</b> more or less tradeable over distance. In this paper, empirical evidence concerning the extent <b>of</b> producer and <b>business</b> <b>service</b> exports is reviewed, and the more qualitative dimensions of the tradeability <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> are explored in greater detail in order to identify factors that both limit and encourage exports <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> Research in the software product segment of the computer services sector suggests that it may not actually be the 'need' for face-to-face interaction with clients that keeps some types <b>of</b> suppliers <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> from exporting. The traditional rationale regarding the importance of proximity to markets, the impact of information technology, and the dynamics of producer - user interaction is examined in order to identify when it is most important for suppliers to 'be there', close to customers. Based on research with software products, it is possible to identify other attributes <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> that may be more critical to determining tradeability and explaining sectoral differences in export intensity than the need to 'be there' for clients. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{accounts}} for the determinants of inward foreign direct investment in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> across the EU- 27 regions. Together with the traditional variables considered in the literature (market size, market quality, agglomeration economies, labour cost, technology, human capital), {{we focus on the}} role of forward linkages with manufacturing sectors and other service sectors as attractors <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> FDI at the regional level. This hypothesis is based on the evidence that the growth <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> is mostly due to increasing intermediate demand by other services industries and by manufacturing industries and on the importance of geographical proximity for forward linkages in services. To our knowledge, there are no studies investigating the role of forward linkages for the location of FDI. This paper aims therefore to fill this gap and add to the FDI literature by providing a picture of the specificities of the determinants <b>of</b> FDI in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> at the regional level. The empirical analysis draws upon the database fDi Markets, from which we selected projects having as a destination NUTS 2 European regions in the sectors <b>of</b> <b>Business</b> <b>services</b> over the period 2003 - 2008. Data on FDI have been matched with data drawn from the Eurostat Regio database. Forward linkages have been constructed using the OECD Input/Output database. By estimating a negative binomial model, we find that regions specialised in those (manufacturing) sectors that are high potential users <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> attract more FDI than other regions. This confirms the role of geographical proximity for forward linkages in services and shows the role played by the existing structure of domestic production for the localisation <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>service</b> FDI, particularly in the case of manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{determine}} what are the main factors which stand behind the diversity in performance <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> measured by their contribution to growth in the EU Member States. We show that in addition to typical growth factors which enhance labor productivity, also the extent <b>of</b> interconnectedness <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> with upstream industries is important to explain service-based economic growth. Our analysis yields two interesting results. Firstly, we show that patterns of industrial interconnectedness <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> are considerably diversified across the EU Member States indicating large differences in the integration of services as supplier with other sectors on a country level. Secondly we show that the diversified growth performance <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> across the EU 25 countries can be explained by differences in labor productivity and differences in forward linkages. Our results indicate the fundamental role <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> as the main engine of growth in the European economy. This service-based growth is channeled mainly through increases in labor productivity and forward interconnectedness of services with downstream industries. On the policy making level our results indicate that investment in human and intangible capital are crucial for the service-dominated economy as they not only enhance economic growth inside knowledge intensive services but also facilitate transmission of growth impulses to downstream industries by increasing diffusion and integration of services as suppliers of high value added inputs to the economy...|$|R
