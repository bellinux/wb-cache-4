5|$|X-ray {{astronomy}} uses X-ray wavelengths. Typically, X-ray {{radiation is}} produced by <b>synchrotron</b> <b>emission</b> (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), thermal emission from thin gases above 107 (10million) kelvins, and thermal emission from thick gases above 107 Kelvin. Since X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, all X-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons, rockets, or X-ray astronomy satellites. Notable X-ray sources include X-ray binaries, pulsars, supernova remnants, elliptical galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the longer-wavelength {{afterglow}} emission (ranging from X-ray through radio) that follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself {{takes the form of}} matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, it creates a relativistic shock wave that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as <b>synchrotron</b> <b>emission</b> across most of the electromagnetic spectrum. This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.|$|E
25|$|In the few radio-loud Seyfert {{galaxies that}} have been observed, the radio {{emission}} is believed to represent <b>synchrotron</b> <b>emission</b> from the jet.

25|$|In the Crab Nebula X-ray {{spectrum}} {{there are}} three features that differ greatly from Scorpius X-1: its spectrum is much harder, its source diameter is in light-years (ly)s, not astronomical units (AU), and its radio and optical <b>synchrotron</b> <b>emission</b> are strong. Its overall X-ray luminosity rivals the optical emission and could be that of a nonthermal plasma. However, the Crab Nebula appears as an X-ray source that is a central freely expanding ball of dilute plasma, where the energy content is 100 times the total energy content of the large visible and radio portion, obtained from the unknown source.|$|E
25|$|Synchrotron {{radiation}} {{is not confined}} to radio wavelengths: if the radio source can accelerate particles to high enough energies, features that are detected in the radio wavelengths may also be seen in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet or even X-ray. In the latter case the responsible electrons must have energies in excess of 1 TeV in typical magnetic field strengths. Again, polarization and continuum spectrum are used to distinguish the synchrotron radiation from other emission processes. Jets and hotspots are the usual sources of high-frequency <b>synchrotron</b> <b>emission.</b> It is hard to distinguish observationally between the synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation, making them a subject of ongoing research.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{emission}} from radio-loud active galaxies is <b>synchrotron</b> <b>emission,</b> as inferred from its very smooth, broad-band nature and strong polarization. This {{implies that the}} radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons with relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors of ~104) and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. There {{is no way of}} determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, {{there is no way to}} determine the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation: the same synchrotron emissivity may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, or something in between. It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given emissivity can have, but for many years there was no particular reason to believe that the true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.|$|E

40|$|The {{energetic}} electromagnetic eruptions {{observed during}} the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts {{are attributed to}} <b>synchrotron</b> <b>emissions.</b> The internal shocks moving through the ultrarelativistic jet, which is ejected by an imploding supermassive star, are the likely source of this radiation. <b>Synchrotron</b> <b>emissions</b> at the observed strength require the simultaneous presence of powerful magnetic fields and highly relativistic electrons. We explore with 1 -D and 3 -D relativistic particle-in-cell simulations the transition layer of a shock, which evolves out of the collision of two plasma clouds at a speed 0. 9 $c$ and {{in the presence of}} a quasi-parallel magnetic field. The cloud densities vary by a factor of 10. The number densities of ions and electrons in each cloud, which have the mass ratio 250, are equal. The peak Lorentz factor of the electrons is determined in the 1 -D simulation, as well as the orientation and the strength of the magnetic field at the boundary of the two colliding clouds. The relativistic masses of the electrons and ions close to the shock transition layer are comparable as in previous work. The 3 -D simulation shows rapid and strong plasma filamentation behind the transient precursor. The magnetic field component orthogonal to the initial field direction is amplified in both simulations to values that exceed those expected from the shock compression by over an order of magnitude. The forming shock is quasi-perpendicular due to this amplification. The simultaneous presence of highly relativistic electrons and strong magnetic fields will give rise to significant <b>synchrotron</b> <b>emissions.</b> © 2010 IEEE.

40|$|By solving {{radiative}} transfer equations, we examine three-dimensional radiative properties of a magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow model confronting with the observed spectrum of Sgr A*, {{in the vicinity}} of supermassive black hole at the Galactic centre. As a result, we find that the core of radio emission is larger than the size of the event horizon shadow and its peak location is shifted from the gravitational centre. We also find that the self-absorbed <b>synchrotron</b> <b>emissions</b> by the superposition of thermal electrons within a few tens of the Schwartzschild radius can account for low-frequency spectra below the critical frequency ν_c≈ 10 ^ 12 Hz. Above the critical frequency, the <b>synchrotron</b> self-Compton <b>emission</b> by thermal electrons can account for variable emissions in recent near-infrared observations.
