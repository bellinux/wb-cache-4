40|$|Flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> (FWA) {{has become}} an {{important}} aspect in Human Resource Management policy for organization {{to attract and retain}} talented employees in the organization. The low female participation in labour workforce has motivated this study to be conducted. It aimed to provide insight to the employers on female employees special needs and their readiness to embrace flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> if the resources were made available to them. “Readiness” to embrace flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangement</b> was not previously studied in the flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> field, hence a considerable amount of {{attention has been paid to}} construct the theoretical framework. An instrument is developed based on a critical review of Person-Environment (PE) fit theory that is able to explain the readiness of female employees depending on the situation surroundings them. Thus, this study postulates into three microsystems that are family (family responsibility, perceived benefits), work (career advancement, company policy), and community (supportive workplace) in PE fit theory that creates demands and resources (readiness on flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements).</b> The integrated approach has explained how the independent variables family responsibility, perceived benefits, career advancement, company policy impact on the readiness on flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> and the mediating role of supportive workplace. The results shown that hypothesised relationships were partially supported, i. e family responsibility and perceived benefits was positively related to readiness to embrace flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Besides, supportive workplace mediated the relationship between perceived benefits and company policy in relation to readiness to embrace flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements.</b> These findings have also demonstrated that women with different experience have different demands in flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Findings have shown that 60 percent of the respondents were ready to embrace flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> except for part time work options.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is {{to shed light on}} {{possible}} reasons for the stagnation in the participation rate of women in the Malaysian workforce by focusing on the phenomenon of flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements.</b> This is researched {{in the context of the}} possibility of flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> helping women achieve work-life balance and how such work affects their well-being. Using a mixed method approach, the study addresses three main questions:- are Malaysian women interested in flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements?</b> would flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> be useful in bringing more women into the labour force? and what impacts do flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> have on their well-being? The study was conducted in the Klang Valley, which has a total population of over seven million people and is the heartland of Malaysia's industry and commerce. It employed both quantitative and qualitative methods. For the quantitative approach, self-administered questionnaires were distributed to women employees working in seven organisations which have flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> and seven organisations with fixed <b>working</b> <b>arrangements.</b> A random sample of 415 female employees from 14 selected organisations in the services sector were identified. To complement the statistical data, 30 women were interviewed. Findings from the logistic regression analysis revealed that flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> at the workplace are preferred by women who are more educated, earning a higher income and are at the higher end of the occupational status. It further revealed that flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> will encourage more women to work in paid labour since they have a better work-life balance and more empowerment. The information gathered from the qualitative interviews concerned women’s wellbeing in terms of work-life balance, empowerment and lifestyles. While most of the women experienced work-life balance barriers, some common threads and themes revealed that flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> will be a good option towards achieving work-life balance and had a positive effect on women’s well-being in terms of work-life balance and household empowerment. The qualitative interviews showed that workplace flexibility can improve the working women’s work-life balance, especially among married women with young children and hence, encourage women to participate in paid labour. In adopting a combination of theoretical approaches, it is argued that there is a greater tendency for Malaysian married women to exit the labour force after having children compared to most other countries and this is primarily due to their caring responsibilities, lack of an enabling environment and the cultural and social factors particular to Malaysia. The study found that flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> are very varied in type and cannot be treated as a single, comprehensive package which might be suitable for all women. Further, the implementation of flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> at the workplace would not be alone sufficient to bring in more women into the labour force...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> and the gender pay gap is explored in this article, {{based on a}} study of flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> among Chartered Accountants in Britain. Individual interviews with 50 participants provided details on working patterns, flexibility policies and practices, and experiences of flexible working. The article considers whether gender-neutral discourses of flexible working succeed in encouraging more men and non-parents to use flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements,</b> thereby potentially reducing the gender pay gap. The study highlighted gendered patterns of take-up of flexible working. Women who worked flexibly or part time typically did so to combine working with caring commitments, in ways that damaged their career prospects. In contrast, men typically deferred working flexibly to a later stage when their career had progressed further. There was therefore a clear impact on current and future salary for women taking up flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements,</b> which was not equivalent for the men who did so.

The adoption level of flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> is predicted to keep increasing in the future. However, some obstacles will emerge when flexible working policies are carried out in companies. The results such as low participation of staff in flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> may fail to live up organizations’ expectation. Accordingly, employers’ and employees’ evaluation of flexible working policies {{may be helpful to}} remove these obstacles and plays a vital role in improving the implementation of flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Considering that change of the implementation of flexible working policies will have direct impacts on employers and employees, these two groups of people are chosen as respondents to investigate. The respondents of this thesis are from foreign and multinational companies in China. Since documental data on flexible working policies are quite few, the researchers have collected both qualitative and quantitative data by doing interviews and a survey. The findings of the interviewees’ opinions and the survey data show both similarities and differences between employers’ and employees’ evaluations, which may pave the way for improvement of the implementation of flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The findings of this research show that the implementation of flexible working policies is affected by two categories, “the content of policies” and “the external factors influencing the implementation of policies” such as facilities provided by companies, trust and support from supervisors. Furthermore, employers and employees tend to hold similar or different opinions on the concepts included in these two categories related to their different positions in their companies.

The challenge for Australian workplaces is to normalise flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements,</b> including varying start and finish times, part-time work and compressed work weeks, so they can reap the benefits of a more engaged and productive workforce.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} the incidence and impact of FWAs in smaller businesses in Scotland, as an integral part of a recent European Social Fund project. From theoretical perspectives it discusses the influences on, and impacts of, flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The focus is then placed on the smaller business sector as regards its distinctive features and flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The papers presents the findings from empirical work comprising a large-scale survey of, and series of interviews with, owner-managers of smaller businesses in Scotland. Findings – Part-time work, time off in lieu, staggered working hours and shift swapping are the main types of flexible work in smaller businesses. In many incidences flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> are requested by employees, operated informally, and centred on the business needs. There is significant scope for greater uptake of flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> in smaller businesses, especially in services sector businesses. Positive impacts of flexible work arrangements in recruitment and retention, enhanced employee relations, commitment and loyalty are found, together with disadvantages of operational problems and administrative burdens. It is proposed that the gap between the potential for, and current practice in, flexible <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> may be narrowed by targeting information and guidance on such arrangements specifically to the owner-managers of smaller businesses. Originality/value – The literature on flexible working mainly concentrates on large organisations.
