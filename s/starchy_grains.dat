The idea of a Paleolithic diet can be traced to a 1975 book by gastroenterologist Walter Voegtlin, which in 1985 was further developed by Stanley Boyd Eaton and Melvin Konner, and popularized by Loren Cordain in his 2002 book The Paleo Diet. The terms caveman diet and stone-age diet are also used, as is Paleo Diet, trademarked by Cordain.|$|R

40|$|This {{editorial}} warns {{the industrialized}} animal agriculture of overmodernizing production systems based on over feeding of energy-producing <b>starchy</b> <b>grains.</b> Feeding {{high levels of}} extensively processed cereal grains increases risks of subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) and rumen malfunction [1]. As a result, likelihood for asynchronous ATP, carbon skeleton and nitrogen compounds release increases in a perturbed environment. High rumen volatile fatty acids (VFA) absorption rates by feeding much rapidly fermentable starch may raise blood insulin and depress milk production [2 - 5]. There have been major confusions in defining ‘extensive fermentation ’ and how that relates to rumen acidosis and reduced productivity. It is traditionally believed that finely ground grains are very likely to depress feed intake by increasing ration dustiness and starch exposure to microbial adherence. Although, grinding has never been considered alongside more important factors, such as dietar...|$|E

40|$|The nutritive {{reserves}} in angiosperm pollen grains and the pollen and ovule numbers of single flowers {{are considered to}} be correlated with the pollinating vectors. In this paper, we studied the relationships between pollen histochemistry, pollen grain number, ovule number and pollinators in Phyllanthaceae. Hymenoptera- and Diptera-pollinated species tend to have starchless, lipid-rich pollen while most Lepidopteran-pollinated species have <b>starchy</b> pollen <b>grains.</b> No correlation was found between pollinator-types and pollen number of single flowers. Flowers of fly-pollinated species have much fewer ovules than flowers of moth-pollinated species. It is suggested that the decrease in ovule number may be an adaptation to the pollinating flies, which have relatively poorer pollen-transferring ability and which transfer pollen less precisely in comparison with other pollinating insects such as moths or butterflies. Pollen grains in single flowers of shrub species were found to be almost ten times as many as that of herbs, while the treespecies also have higher pollen grain numbers than congeneric shrub species. This {{may be due to the}} different flower size in plants with different life forms.

40|$|Few microscopical {{studies have}} been made on lipid storage in oat grains, with {{variable}} results as {{to the extent of}} lipid accumulation in the <b>starchy</b> endosperm. <b>Grains</b> of medium- and high-lipid oat (Avena sativa L.) were studied at two developmental stages and at maturity, by light microscopy using different staining methods, and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Discrete oil bodies occurred in the aleurone layer, scutellum and embryo. In contrast, oil bodies in the starchy endosperm often had diffuse boundaries and fused {{with each other and with}} protein vacuoles during grain development, forming a continuous oil matrix between the protein and starch components. The different microscopical methods were confirmative to each other regarding the coalescence of oil bodies, a phenomenon probably correlated with the reduced amount of oil-body associated proteins in the endosperm. This was supported experimentally by SDS-PAGE separation of oil-body proteins and immunoblotting and immunolocalization with antibodies against a 16 kD oil-body protein. Much more oil-body proteins per amount of oil occurred in the embryo and scutellum than in the endosperm. Immunolocalization of 14 and 16 kD oil-body associated proteins on sectioned grains resulted in more heavy labeling of the embryo, scutellum and aleurone layer than the rest of the endosperm. Observations on the appearance of oil bodies at an early stage of development pertain to the prevailing hypotheses of oil-body biogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the {{developing}} world boiled <b>starchy</b> <b>grains</b> and roots are given as weaning food to millions of children. Boiled starch is so thick and pasty {{that it is difficult}} for the very young to swallow enough to gain adequate nourishment. But the technique of malting, as used for brewing, provides a quick and simple solution for turning boiled starches into liquid. Malting is nothing more than sprouting. In the temperate zones barley is used in malting to break down starch into sugar for producing beer, whisky, vodka etc. Finger millet and sorghum also work well. Germinated grains release enzymes that break down starch. The enzymes (amylases) are catalysts that can work repeatedly to hydrolyze the bonds that hold glucose molecules together in the long, complex strands that make up starch. Therefore a little of the sprouted grains can be ground up and used to break down and liquefy other starches. A very small quantity of malted millet/sorghum flour added to a pot of hot mush made from maize meal, cassava arrowroot potato or other boiled staples, turns it to liquid in minutes. This process produces food liquid enough (or a baby to swal-low but dense enough to be filling. The starch has become predigested by the process and palatable because it is mostly in the form of sugar. The advantages are that the process can be carried out in any household, rural or urban. It requires no imported or manufactured ingredients. In many communities malted grains are already available for making beer and only a little need be set aside to make a digestible food for babies and young children.

40|$|Regression models {{including}} chemical composition, {{in vitro}} digestibility and {{near infrared reflectance}} spectroscopy (NIRS) were compared in order to predict the energy value of several feed ingredients for poultry. The nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolisable energy content (AMEn) in cockerels and its proportion on total gross energy (AMEn/GE) were determined in 94 batches from six <b>starchy</b> <b>grains</b> and six cereal byproducts. Two preliminary trials were also designed to adapt in vitro methods for prediction of in vivo energy values for poultry. Mean concentrations of AMEn of the ingredient studied ranged from 2, 464 to 3, 595 kcal kg - 1 DM, and those of AMEn/GE from 53. 7 to 80. 0 %. The most precise model of prediction of AMEn and AMEn/GE values was that based on NIRS equations (R 2 cv = 0. 823 and 0. 861, respectively). The best single chemical predictor of these energy values was the neutral detergent fibre concentration (R 2 = 0. 616 and 0. 736, respectively). Further inclusion of ether extract and ash contents in the AMEn model and those of starch and ether extract in the AMEn/GE model allowed increasing coefficients of determination up to 0. 791 and 0. 839, respectively. A model including linear and quadratic effects of in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMd) provided a similar prediction of AMEn/GE values (R 2 = 0. 833). However the prediction of AMEn from IVOMd was worse (R 2 = 0. 62), as variations among batches of GE concentration (from 4, 225 to 5, 896 kcal kg – 1 DM) were little related to in vitro digestibility values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Corn grain is an {{important}} renewable source for bioethanol production in the USA. Corn ethanol is currently produced by steam liquefaction of starch-rich grains followed by enzymatic saccharification and fermentation. Corn stover (the non-grain parts of the plant) is a potential feedstock to produce cellulosic ethanol in second-generation biorefineries. At present, corn grain is harvested by removing the grain from the living plant while leaving the stover behind on the field. Alternatively, whole corn plants can be harvested to cohydrolyze both starch and cellulose after a suitable thermochemical pretreatment to produce fermentable monomeric sugars. In this study, we used physiologically immature corn silage (CS) and matured whole corn plants (WCP) as feedstocks to produce ethanol using ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis (at low enzyme loadings) and cofermentation (for both glucose and xylose) using a cellulase-amylase-based cocktail and a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae 424 A (LNH-ST) strain, respectively. The effect on hydrolysis yields of AFEX pretreatment conditions and a starch/cellulose-degrading enzyme addition sequence for both substrates was also studied. Results AFEX-pretreated starch-rich substrates (for example, corn grain, soluble starch) had a 1. 5 - 3 -fold higher enzymatic hydrolysis yield compared with the untreated substrates. Sequential addition of cellulases after hydrolysis of starch within WCP resulted in 15 - 20 % higher hydrolysis yield compared with simultaneous addition of hydrolytic enzymes. AFEX-pretreated CS gave 70 % glucan conversion after 72 h of hydrolysis for 6 % glucan loading (at 8 mg total enzyme loading per gram glucan). Microbial inoculation of CS before ensilation yielded a 10 - 15 % lower glucose hydrolysis yield for the pretreated substrate, due to loss in starch content. Ethanol fermentation of AFEX-treated (at 6 % w/w glucan loading) CS hydrolyzate (resulting in 28 g/L ethanol at 93 % metabolic yield) and WCP (resulting in 30 g/L ethanol at 89 % metabolic yield) is reported in this work. Conclusions The current results indicate the feasibility of co-utilization of whole plants (that is, <b>starchy</b> <b>grains</b> plus cellulosic residues) using an ammonia-based (AFEX) pretreatment to increase bioethanol yield and reduce overall production cost. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a part of a larger project aiming to produce new, healthy, and tasty food {{ingredients}} from oat. Germination and different heating processes can be used to improve the texture and flavour of cereals. In this study effects of germination and wet and dry heating on the microstructure, instrumental structure and sensory properties of two oat varieties were assessed. The microstructure of native, germinated, autoclaved and extruded grains of the hulled cv. Veli and hull-less cv. Lisbeth was examined by light microscopy, the texture was measured by determining the milling energy and hardness of the grains and sensory characteristics were evaluated with descriptive sensory profile analysis. In cv. Veli the cells of the starchy endosperm were smaller than in cv. Lisbeth and ß-glucan was concentrated in the subaleurone layer. In cv. Lisbeth ß-glucan was evenly distributed in the <b>starchy</b> endosperm. The <b>grains</b> of cv. Lisbeth were more extensively modified in the germination process than the grains of cv. Veli, otherwise the effects of processing on the grains of the two cultivars were similar. Germination caused cell wall degradation, autoclaving and extrusion cooking caused starch gelatinization. Autoclaving resulted in the hardest perceived texture in oat. Gelatinization of starch appeared to contribute more to the hardness of oat groats than the cell wall structure. Of the instrumental methods used in this study the milling energy measurement appeared to be the most useful method for the analysis of the effects of processing on grain structure. ...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Nature Publishing Group and can be found at: [URL] Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, diabetes and kidney disease. The objective was to describe dietary intake, the dominant source of exposure to AGEs, with carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), a major AGE, in serum and urine, respectively. Subjects/Methods: Serum and urinary CML were measured in 261 adults, aged 21 - 69 years, and compared with diet as assessed by six separate 24 -h dietary recalls. Results: Median (25 th, 75 th percentile) serum and urinary CML concentrations were 686 (598, 803) mu g/l and 1023 (812, 1238) mu g/gm creatinine. There was no correlation between serum and urinary CML (r = - 0. 02, P = 0. 78). Serum CML was positively correlated with intake of soy, fruit juice, cold breakfast cereal, non-fat milk, whole grains, fruit, non-starchy vegetables and legumes, and negatively correlated with intake of red meat. Intake of fast food was not significantly correlated with serum CML. Urinary CML was positively correlated with intake of <b>starchy</b> vegetables, whole <b>grains,</b> sweets, nuts/seeds and chicken, and negatively correlated with intake of fast foods. Intake of AGE-rich foods such as fried chicken, French fries, bacon/sausage and crispy snacks were not significantly correlated with serum or urinary CML, except for a significant negative correlation between fried chicken and serum CML. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the high consumption of foods considered high in CML is not a major determinant of either serum or urinary CML. Further work is needed to understand the relationship of AGEs in blood and urine with the metabolism of dietary AGEs...|$|R
40|$|Extrusion cooking {{technology}} is a popular technique for generating {{a wide range of}} ready-to-eat products, from snacks, breakfast cereals, pasta and instant noodles to pet food. Extrusion cooking involves inserting raw materials – minimally <b>starchy</b> <b>grains</b> and water – at one end of an extruder barrel. The starch-based raw materials are conveyed through the barrel, typically by a worm drive, to an exit die that forms the final shape. The high pressure, shear forces and friction that develop towards the die end of the extruder generates heat which cooks the product, in turn producing an extruded dry, shelf stable product. Existing commercial extruders require a three-phase power supply to run the high torque motors, which, are used to provide enough energy to generate the amount of pressure and forces required for industrial production. Millbank Group of Mangere, Auckland has developed a single phase extruder. The advantage of using a single phase powered extrusion cooker is that ready-to-eat snacks can be produced on site by cafes, restaurants or even cinemas, which seldom have a three-phase power supply. Disaster relief is another application, where portable generators are most commonly single phase. The primary objective of this research is to create products and evaluate their physiochemical properties and to evaluate is consistent viable products can be produced using single phase power. The first phase {{of this study was to}} produce, analyse and compare the extrudates created by this single phase extrusion cooker by using maize, wheat and brown rice as the primary grains. In the second phase of this study, new grains were introduced to create some new combinations. They were peanut, oat, mung bean, soy and amaranth. Although the addition of the new grains was in a relatively low ratio, ranging from 5 to 10 %, they brought a huge impact on the extrudates texture and bulk density. Extrusion cooking is a rapid yet complex process. There are process parameters, such as screw speed and nose temperature, that impact on the outcome of the extrudate properties which include texture and bulk density. The performance parameters data from Phase 1 and 2 showed variation from a statistical perspective, either due to subtle changes to the extruder and/or changes to the grain specifications. Therefore in the third phase of this study, a designed experiment was conducted which focused on the nose temperature on three basic grains that were often used in Phase 1 and 2, which were brown rice, maize and wheat, to examine whether the physicochemical aspect and texture of the extrudates would be different under the controlled nose temperatures. It was concluded that the higher nose temperatures significantly decreased the moisture content of all extrudates while the lower nose temperatures made the extrudates more difficult to break...|$|E
