50|$|Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain is a {{real-time}} strategy computer game. The game emphasizes empire {{building and}} customization. Instead {{of using a}} single large map as {{do most of the}} current real-time strategy games, Pax Imperia revolves around star systems connected by wormholes or jump points, which connect a system of star systems in a large web.The game allowed for the player to customise the species that they were to play to a high degree. Players could focus on construction, reproduction, research, espionage, or the acquisition of money. Players could <b>select</b> <b>special</b> <b>qualities,</b> such as having psychic powers or an aquatic physiology, and could tailor their species to be better at peaceful colonisation or conquest.|$|R

25|$|Formerly, {{within six}} months after Parliament first met after any general election, it had to decide whether there would be any NMPs during the term of that Parliament. With effect from 1 July 2010, such a {{decision}} became unnecessary as NMPs were made a permanent feature in Parliament. A <b>Special</b> <b>Select</b> Committee of Parliament chaired by the Speaker of Parliament is established, and invites the general public to submit names of persons who may be considered for nomination by the Committee. From these names, the <b>Special</b> <b>Select</b> Committee then nominates not more than nine persons for appointment by the President as NMPs. The persons to be nominated must have rendered distinguished public service, or have brought honour to Singapore, or have distinguished themselves {{in the field of}} arts and letters, culture, the sciences, business, industry, the professions, social or community service or the labour movement; and in making any nomination, the <b>Special</b> <b>Select</b> Committee must have regard to the need for NMPs to reflect as wide a range of independent and non-partisan views as possible. Subject to rules on the tenure of MPs in general, NMPs serve for a term of two and a half years. The first two NMPs sworn in on 20 December 1990 were cardiologist Professor Maurice Choo and company executive Leong Chee Whye. On 6 July 2009, the <b>Special</b> <b>Select</b> Committee announced that it had submitted the names of nine individuals to the President for appointment as new NMPs.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the topic of fulfilment of <b>selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards for social services in care homes for the elderly. The theoretical part of the piece of work deals with defining the terms pertaining to the quality standards of social services in care homes for the elderly. These are the terms ?old age?, ?need?, ?care home for the elderly?, ?social services?, ?quality standards?, and ?client?. The aim of the dissertation was to map the fulfilment and realisation of <b>selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards in care homes for the elderly. Partial aims were {{to determine the extent of}} fulfilment of quality standards from the point of view of the client and to compare the individual levels of application of the quality standards for social services. Two care homes were chosen for the study, the Care Home for the Elderly Tep in Veselí nad Lužnicí and the Care Home for the Elderly in Horní Stropnice. Two hypotheses were established. Quantitative research was chosen to facilitate reaching the aims and verifying the hypotheses, utilising questioning methods, interviewing techniques and questionnaire enquiry. Furthermore, analysing the data was accomplished using secondary document analysis. The research file contained the clients and staff of both selected care homes for the elderly. Following the evaluation of the results I believe that the aims of the dissertation were fulfilled. <b>Selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards are realised well in both care homes for the elderly and the essential criteria of individual quality standards are fulfilled as well. In addition, the research study proved both hypotheses to be correct. <b>Selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards are fulfilled from the point of view of the clients and at the same time applied in accordance with their needs. The dissertation can provide the selected care homes for the elderly with feedback regarding the fulfilment and realisation of <b>selected</b> <b>quality</b> standards of social services. It can also equally serve as guidance for potential clients in choosing their social services provider...|$|R
