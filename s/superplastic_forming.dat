50|$|High-strain-rate {{superplasticity}} {{has been}} observed in aluminium-based and magnesium-based alloys. But for ceramic materials, superplastic deformation has been restricted to low strain rates for most oxides, and nitrides {{with the presence of}} cavities leading to premature failure. Here we show that a composite ceramic material consisting of tetragonal zirconium oxide, magnesium aluminates spinal and alpha-alumina phase exhibit superplasticity at strain rates up to 1.0 s−1. The composite also exhibits a large tensile elongation, exceeding 1050% or a strain rate of 0.4 s−1.Superplastic metals and ceramics have the ability to deform over 100% without fracturing, permitting net-shape forming at high temperatures. These intriguing materials deform primarily by grain boundary sliding, a process accelerated with a fine grain size. However, most ceramics that start with a fine grain size experience rapid grain growth during high temperature deformation, rendering them unsuitable for extended <b>superplastic</b> <b>forming.</b> One can limit grain growth using a minor second phase (Zener pinning) or by making a ceramic with three phases, where grain to grain contact of the same phase is minimized. A research on fine grain three phase alumina-mullite(3Al2O3•2SiO2)-zirconia, with approximately equal volume fractions of the three phases, demonstrates that superplastic strain rates as high as 10−2/sec at 1500 °C can be reached.

The new criterion is used to design optimum variable strain rate forming paths for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V SP alloy. The effects of void fraction, grain size and strain rate sensitivity on the optimum forming paths are also examined. In addition, FE analysis of <b>superplastic</b> blow <b>forming</b> of a hemisphere is carried out using the optimum forming path {{and the results are}} compared with those obtained using constant strain rate forming paths.

The analysis of the present paper was performed to estimate the error in predicted stress that results from using the short specimens. Stress correction factors were developed and an improved constitutive relation was implemented in the MARC finite element code to simulate the forming of a long, rectangular tray.

50|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry, Titanium alloys such as Ti—6 Al—4V find extensive use in aerospace applications, {{not only because}} of their specific high temperature strength, but also {{because of the fact that}} a large number of these alloys exhibit superplastic behavior.

Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of bottom die), gas pressure was stopped and the furnace switched off.

As the bulge forming process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. An ultrasonic technique was used to measure the thickness distribution on the profile of the formed component.
