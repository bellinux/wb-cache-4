5000|$|Most of Narcotics Anonymous early {{literature}} {{was written by}} Jimmy Kinnon and is still used worldwide today in over 62,800 NA meetings. He was the main contributor to the Yellow Booklet and Little White booklet that were used throughout the 1960s and 1970s. From 1953 to 1977 Narcotics Anonymous was {{a safe haven for}} addicts to meet in their NA meetings, to help each other get and stay clean from all substances, including alcohol. From 1979-1982 hundreds of Narcotics Anonymous members expanded on this literature and created the Basic Text. Kinnon also designed the NA logo, The Group Logo, The <b>Service</b> <b>Symbol</b> and wrote the Gratitude Prayer and [...] "Fruit of the Harvest" [...] statement found {{in the beginning of the}} NA book [...] "The Basic Text". This book was the first ever known that was written by recovering addicts for recovering addicts. It was first published in 1982.9.3 million copies of the Basic Text have been published since 1982, and are in 31 languages. It is currently in its 6th Edition.|$|E

50|$|The <b>service</b> mark <b>symbol</b> (℠), {{the letters}} SM in {{superscript}} style) {{is a symbol}} used in the United States to provide notice that the preceding mark is a <b>service</b> mark. This <b>symbol</b> has some legal force, and is typically used for service marks not yet registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; registered service marks are instead marked with the same symbol used for registered trademarks, the registered trademark symbol ®.

This paper empirically investigates the Islamic features that influence the use of Islamic websites by Muslim users. The identified Islamic factors were grouped under five factors: beliefs, ethics, <b>services,</b> <b>symbols,</b> and values. A survey of 246 Muslim Islamic website users was conducted between November and December 2012 at the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). The study develops and tests a path measurement model to confirm the psychometric properties of the five identified factors. The study found that Islamic features significantly influence Muslims to use Islamic websites.

30|$|We propose {{combining}} channel estimation and optimal power allocation {{approaches for}} a multiple-antenna orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in high-speed transmission applications. We develop a least-square channel estimation approach, derive the performance bound of the estimator, and investigate the optimal training sequences for initial channel acquisition. Based on the channel estimates, the optimal power allocation solution which maximizes the bandwidth efficiency is derived under power {{and quality of}} <b>service</b> (Qos) (<b>symbol</b> error rate) constraints. It is shown that combining channel tracking and adaptive power allocation can dramatically enhance the outage capacity of an OFDM multiple-antenna system when severing fading occurs.|$|R

Forty-five percent of the symbol users sampled had a policy specifically addressing the employment of PWDs; only 17 percent of the random sample had a policy.

50|$|As {{retailing}} {{increased in}} scope, so did service economy, including {{not only the}} staff of retail stores but also workers in the hospitality industry and other sites of consumption.

Easy credit arose as a lubricant for consumption, sometimes enabling unsupportable spending binges. In cases such as Wanamaker v.
