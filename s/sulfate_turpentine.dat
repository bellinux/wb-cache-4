5000|$|When {{producing}} chemical {{wood pulp}} from pines or other coniferous trees, <b>sulfate</b> <b>turpentine</b> may be condensed from the gas generated in Kraft process pulp digesters. The average yield of crude <b>sulfate</b> <b>turpentine</b> is 5-10 kg/t pulp. [...] Unless burned at the mill for energy production, <b>sulfate</b> <b>turpentine</b> may require additional treatment measures to remove traces of sulfur compounds.|$|E
50|$|The main {{byproducts}} of kraft pulping are crude <b>sulfate</b> <b>turpentine</b> {{and tall}} oil soap. The availability {{of these is}} strongly dependent on wood species, growth conditions, storage time of logs and chips, and the mill's process. Pines are the most extractive rich woods. The raw turpentine is volatile and is distilled of the digester, while the raw soap is separated from the spent black liquor by decantation of the soap layer formed on top of the liquor storage tanks. From pines the average yield of turpentine is 5-10 kg/t pulp and of crude tall oil is 30-50 kg/t pulp.|$|E
40|$|Background: alpha-Pinene is an {{important}} natural product that is widely used in flavorings, fragrances, medicines, fine chemicals and high-density renewable fuels. Currently, alpha-Pinene used in industry is mainly produced either by tapping trees (gum turpentine) or as a byproduct of paper pulping (crude <b>sulfate</b> <b>turpentine,</b> CST). However, the extraction of it from trees is tedious and inefficient and requires substantial expenditure of natural resources. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} seek sustainable technologies for alpha-pinene production...|$|E
40|$|The {{innervation}} of {{the skirt}} of hairless mice {{has been studied}} following induction of epidermal hyperplasia by physical and chemical methods. Physical stimuli comprised ultraviolet irradiation, heat, wounding, and friction. Effective chemicals included benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, creosote, formaldehyde, hexadecane, hydrobromic acid, sodium lauryl <b>sulfate,</b> and <b>turpentine.</b> Epidermal hyperplasia, however produced, was associated with growth of sensory nerve fibers into the outer part of the epidermis. Following a single 10 -min exposure to an ultraviolet sunlamp at 40 cm, the nerves extended into the epidermis within 24 hr and disappeared during the second week as the epidermis reverted to its normal thickness. Repeated irradiation (until tumors appeared) was accompanied by persistent hyperplasia and neural invasion. Of 32 papillomas examined, intraepithelial nerves were found in 28. The presence and location of nerves in the tumor epithelium {{were related to the}} incorporation of tactile hair disc epithelium. The hyperplastic regenerative epithelium at the margins of skin ulcers were also invaded by nerves which sometimes followed the migrating epithelium across the ulcer floor. Since the regenerative epithelium was not directly treated, it was concluded that the proliferation of nervous tissue in response to skin injury {{was the result of the}} hyperplasia per se, regardless of the method used to produce it...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} activity of Pd and Pd-M bimetallic catalysts (M = Cr, Cu, Pt, Ag) on different solid supports for isomerization in gas {{phase of a}} mixture of pinenes poisoned with 4000 pmm of sulfur as thiophene was studied. This mixture {{was used as a}} model of crude <b>sulfate</b> <b>turpentine</b> (CST), which is a cheap and valuable source of pinenes. The major product of this reaction is p-cymene, an important product in chemical industry. It was found that Pd-Pt/ SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 gives a selectivity of 65 - 70 % and a conversion of 98 %. Molecular sieves as catalyst support were also investigated but the activity was not as better as the SiO 2 or SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 for the targeted reactio...|$|E
40|$|A {{decision}} support tool has been developed, which uses global multi-objective optimisation based on: (i) the environmental impacts, evaluated {{within the framework}} of full life cycle assessment, and (ii) process costs, evaluated using rigorous process models. This approach is particularly useful in developing the bio renewable-based energy solutions and chemicals manufacturing, where multiple criteria must be evaluated and where the optimisation-based decision making process is particularly attractive. The framework is demonstrated using a case study of conversion of terpenes derived from bio-waste feedstocks into reactive intermediates. A two-step chemical conversion/separation sequence was implemented as a rigorous process model and combined with a life cycle model. A life cycle inventory for crude <b>sulfate</b> <b>turpentine</b> was developed, as well as a conceptual process of its separation into pure terpene feedstocks. The performed single- and multi-objective optimisations demonstrate the functionality of the optimisation-based process development and illustrate the approach. Most significant advance is the ability to perform multi-objective global optimisation, resulting in identification of a region of Pareto-optimal solutions...|$|E
40|$|Background: α-Pinene is an {{important}} natural product that is widely used in flavorings, fragrances, medicines, fine chemicals and high-density renewable fuels. Currently, α-Pinene used in industry is mainly produced either by tapping trees (gum turpentine) or as a byproduct of paper pulping (crude <b>sulfate</b> <b>turpentine,</b> CST). However, the extraction of it from trees is tedious and inefficient and requires substantial expenditure of natural resources. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} seek sustainable technologies for α-pinene production. Results: To construct the microbial synthetic pathway of α-pinene in E. coli, we co-expressed native geranyl diphosphate synthase (IspA) from E. coli and α-pinene synthase (Pt 30) from Pinus taeda, and then to increase the geranyl diphosphate (GPP) content in the cells, a suitable geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS 2) was selected from two different origins. Furthermore, to enhance α-pinene production, a novel biosynthetic pathway of α-pinene was assembled in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) with the heterologous hybrid mevalonate (MVA) pathway, GPPS 2 and α-pinene synthase (Pt 30). The final genetic strain, YJM 28, harboring the above novel biosynthetic pathway of α-pinene, accumulated α-pinene up to 5. 44 mg/L and 0. 97 g/L under flask and fed-batch fermentation conditions, respectively. The conversion efficiency of glucose to α-pinene (gram to gram) in the metabolically engineered strain reached 2. 61 %. Conclusions: In this paper, by using metabolic engineering techniques, the more efficient biosynthetic pathway of α-pinene was successfully assembled in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) with the heterologous hybrid MVA pathway, GPPS 2 and α-pinene synthase (Pt 30). In addition, this is the first report on α-pinene fed-batch fermentation, and our results represent improvements over previous reports...|$|E
