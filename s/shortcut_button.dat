50|$|The game {{offers two}} methods of control. The first, {{and the one}} upon which the game was {{primarily}} marketed, is a system developed specifically for the game and uniquely adapted for touchscreen devices. To shoot, the player taps the screen with two fingers and the player character fires at the middle point between the two taps. To zoom, the player pinches and expands their fingers on the screen. To move, the player taps on the screen {{where they want to}} go and the character automatically moves around obstacles until he reaches the designated spot. To strafe, the player swipes left or right on the screen using two fingers. To look around, the player swipes in any direction with one finger, although there is also a <b>shortcut</b> <b>button</b> for instant 180 degree turns. To switch weapons, the player taps on the character's weapon. A more traditional touchscreen first-person shooter setup is also available, with two virtual joysticks, one for moving, one for shooting.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Many {{organizations}} had employed {{interactive media}} systems to facilitate ecology education in natural science museum or through websites based on touch screen technologies. Since the mapping issue between input modes and digital contents is very important, {{the objective of}} this research is to study the effects of touch input modes and navigation bar styles on the usability of an ecology education system. In this research, three types of navigation menu, i. e., global fisheye menu, local fisheye menu, and tabbed menu were constructed for comparison. In addition, two touch modes for the backward <b>shortcut</b> <b>button</b> from the detailed page to the main menu were constructed. In the experiment, participants carried out typical tasks to locate assigned pages for searching information. Video recording were employed {{to keep track of the}} behaviors. After that, the participant was asked to complete system component usability and overall workload questionnaire. The result revealed that tabbed menu with long touch was superior in usability...|$|E
40|$|Some {{educational}} {{communities and}} organizations {{have recognized the}} possibilities of mLearning. mLearning may provide tools {{to respond to the}} demands of working life and information society. One way to enhance mLearning is to raise the usability of mobile terminals as good usability is the basis for the meaningful and effective learning. Poor usability disturbs the learning processes because the energy of users is directed {{to the use of the}} system instead of learning. In this paper the usability of Nokia 7110 mobile phone is evaluated. Researchers located the problem points of the user interface and navigation system. In fact, there were several obstacles in the user interface of the tested mobile phone that need improvement. First of all, the Navi Roller confuses users and they prefer to use it even in the tasks that could be done more easily with the other buttons. Secondly, the inconsistency of the Navi Roller and the <b>shortcut</b> <b>button</b> caused some problems. WAP services need improvement as well. The navigating structures were hard to understand and feedback of actions was insufficient. As a conclusion, there is a lot usability work to be done before mobile terminals can be effectively adapted as a part of education. 1...|$|E

SwiftFile uses a text classifier to predict where each new message {{is likely to}} be filed by the user and provides <b>shortcut</b> <b>buttons</b> to quickly file messages into one of its predicted folders. One of the challenges faced by SwiftFile is that the user's mail-ling habits are constantly changing [...] users are frequently creating, deleting and rearranging folders to meet their current ling needs. In this paper, we discuss the importance of incremental learning in SwiftFile. We present several criteria for judging how well incremental learning algorithms adapt to quickly changing data and evaluate SwiftFile's classifier using these criteria. We find that SwiftFile's classifier is surprisingly responsive and does not require the extensive training that is often assumed in most learning systems...|$|R

40|$|MailCat is an {{intelligent}} assistant that helps users organize their e-mail into folders. MailCat uses a text classifier to predict where each new message {{is likely to}} be filed by the user and provides <b>shortcut</b> <b>buttons</b> to quickly file messages into one of its predicted folders. MailCat operates in a dynamic environment in which it must adapt to the user's continually changing mail-filing habits. MailCat uses incremental learning to cope with these changes. This paper evaluates the performance of MailCat's incremental learning algorithm. We investigate how incremental learning performs over time during simulated usage. We find that MailCat's incremental learning algorithm performs well. MailCat can almost instantly learn about a new user's mail-filing habits and maintains over an 80 % to 90 % accuracy level throughout our trials. We observe several interesting dynamical behaviors including an inverted learning curve and the ability to learn from single examples. Keywords: IR agents, filte [...] ...|$|R
40|$|While most e-mail clients allow {{users to}} file {{messages}} into folders, the process they {{must go through}} to file each message is often tedious and slow. For each message, the user must first decide which folder is most appropriate. Then, the user must inform the e-mail reader of that choice by selecting the appropriate icon or menu item from among what is typically a set of several dozen choices. The combined effort of choosing a folder and conveying that choice to the application often discourages users from filing their mail, resulting in unmanageable inboxes that contain hundreds or even thousands of unfiled messages. SwiftFile encourages users to file their mail by simplifying the task. Using an adaptive classifier, it predicts the three folders that {{are most likely to}} be appropriate for a given message and provides <b>shortcut</b> <b>buttons</b> that permit the user to effortlessly file it into a predicted folder. For typical users, SwiftFile's predictions are accurate over 80 % to [...] ...|$|R

50|$|A {{common and}} {{easy way to}} {{generate}} VBA code is by using the Macro Recorder.The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code {{in the form of}} a macro. These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro. The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard <b>shortcuts,</b> a command <b>button</b> or a graphic. The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options. The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompts by their own properties, and some graphical display items, cannot be recorded, but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer. Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program, or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed.|$|R
