6000|$|... 'Tut, tut, child!' {{said the}} Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, {{if only you}} can find it.' And <b>she</b> <b>squeezed</b> herself up closer to Alice's side as she spoke.|$|E
60|$|She {{heard nothing}} {{that was said}} about her, {{and she did not}} know <b>she</b> sat <b>squeezing</b> Carl's arm.|$|R

6000|$|Oh, how my hand trembled as I {{placed it}} round the waist of Dorothea! With {{my left hand}} I took her right--did <b>she</b> <b>squeeze</b> it? I think she did--to this day I think she did.

[...] Then I heard the voices humming and buzzing about. [...] "Il danse bien, l'Anglais." [...] "Ma foi, oui," [...] says another. On we went, twirling and twisting, and turning and whirling; couple after couple dropped panting off. Little Klingenspohr himself was obliged to give in.
