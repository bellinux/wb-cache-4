40|$|Indirectly {{processed}} UHT milk was {{packaged in}} Intasept (TM) aseptic pouches with (treatment) or without (control) oxygen-scavenging film and stored for 14 weeks at 26 +/- 0. 3 degrees C. Samples were analysed at 0, 4, 8 and 14 weeks for dissolved oxygen, <b>stale</b> <b>flavour</b> volatiles (methyl ketones and aldehydes) and free fatty acids. Discriminative subjective analysis of odour by a consumer panel was also conducted. The oxygen-scavenging film {{was shown to}} significantly (p < 0. 05) reduce dissolved oxygen content by 23 - 28 % during storage. Significant reductions of 23 - 41 % were also observed for some <b>stale</b> <b>flavour</b> volatiles, including three methyl ketones and two aldehydes. Free fatty acid levels remained far below threshold values, indicating that lipolytic rancidity would {{not interfere with the}} subjective analysis. However, the consumer panel failed to detect a significant difference in odour between the treatment and control samples. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Solid phase microextraction (SPME) {{offers a}} solvent-free and less {{labour-intensive}} alternative to traditional flavour isolation techniques. In this instance, SPME was optimised for {{the extraction of}} 17 <b>stale</b> <b>flavour</b> volatiles (C 3 - 11, 13 methyl ketones and C 4 - 10 saturated aldehydes) from the headspace of full-cream ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) -processed milk. A comparison of relative extraction efficiencies was made using three fibre coatings, three extraction times and three extraction temperatures. Linearity of calibration curves, limits of detection and repeatability (coefficients of variation) were also used in determining the optimum extraction conditions. A 2 cm fibre coating of 50130 gm divinylbenzene/Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane {{in conjunction with a}} 15 min extraction at 40 degrees C were chosen as the final optimum conditions. This method can be used as an objective tool for monitoring the flavour quality of UHT milk during storage. (c) 2005 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E
50|$|Seafood {{is a major}} {{staple of}} Mediterranean cuisine, the Ligurian variety being no exception, as the sea {{has been part of}} the region's culture since its beginning. Ciuppin soup is made from fish {{leftovers}} and <b>stale</b> bread, <b>flavoured</b> with white wine, onion, and garlic.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{the main}} quality problem of beer {{is the change}} of its {{chemical}} composition during storage, which alters the sensory properties. A variety of flavours may arise, depending on the beer type and the storage conditions. In contrast to some wines, beer aging is usually considered negative for flavour quality. The main focus of research on beer aging has been {{the study of the}} cardboard-flavoured component (E) - 2 -nonenal and its formation by lipid oxidation. Other <b>stale</b> <b>flavours</b> are less described, but may be at least as important for the overall sensory impression of aged beer. Their origin has been increasingly investigated in recent years. This review summarizes current knowledge about the chemical origin of various aging flavours and the reaction mechanisms responsible for their formation. Furthermore, the relationship between the production process and beer flavour stability is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Hydrolysis, {{oxidation}} and polymerization {{may occur}} during the deep-frying process, and these influence the sensory and chemical {{qualities of the}} product (Choe and Min 2007). Hydrolysis and oxidation may cause production of free fatty acids and hydroperoxides which are unstable and may break down further into various compounds which consequently produce off-flavours, leading to a <b>stale,</b> rancid <b>flavour</b> in foods (Angelo 1992). The residual fat in the final products increases susceptibility to oxidative and hydrolytic deterioration during storage.|$|R
