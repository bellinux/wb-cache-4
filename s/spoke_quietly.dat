5|$|Kennedy's {{appearance}} {{had been}} anticipated; {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} address, the City Club sold over 1,400 tickets for people wishing to attend the luncheon event at the Sheraton-Cleveland Hotel. Local channels 3 and 5 interrupted their coverage of the King assassination to televise Kennedy's speech. It was delivered before approximately 2,200 members of the City Club of Cleveland (most rich and white) and lasted only for 10 minutes. Kennedy <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly</b> and solemnly, incorporating tragic themes.|$|E
25|$|As Justinian rallied himself, {{he created}} a plan that {{involved}} Narses, a popular eunuch, {{as well as the}} generals Belisarius and Mundus. Carrying a bag of gold given to him by Justinian, the slightly built eunuch entered the Hippodrome alone and unarmed, against a murderous mob that had already killed hundreds. Narses went directly to the Blues' section, where he approached the important Blues and reminded them that Emperor Justinian supported them over the Greens. He also reminded them that the man they were crowning, Hypatius, was a Green. Then, he distributed the gold. The Blue leaders <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly</b> with each other and then they spoke to their followers. Then, in the middle of Hypatius's coronation, the Blues stormed out of the Hippodrome. The Greens sat, stunned. Then, Imperial troops led by Belisarius and Mundus stormed into the Hippodrome, killing the remaining rebels.|$|E
500|$|Warner {{learned from}} twelfth man Leo O'Brien that Woodfull was badly injured. Later in the afternoon, while Ponsford and Richardson were still batting, Warner and Palairet visited the Australian {{dressing}} {{room with the}} intention of enquiring about Woodfull's health. Accounts vary about what followed. According to the original newspaper reports and Fingleton's later description, Woodfull was lying on the masseur's table, awaiting treatment from a doctor, although this may have been an exaggeration for dramatic effect. Leo O'Brien described Woodfull as wearing a towel around his waist, having showered. Warner expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner recalled saying, [...] "Apart from all that, we most sincerely hope you are not too badly hurt," [...] to which Woodfull replied, [...] "The bruise is coming out." [...] Embarrassed and humiliated, Warner and Palairet turned and left. Fingleton noted that Woodfull <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly</b> and calmly, which increased the effectiveness of his words. He also pointed out that Warner prided himself on sportsmanship, so an accusation of [...] would have stung the Englishman. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.|$|E

2500|$|As Burbank’s life {{drew to a}} close, the {{question}} arose as to who would carry on his work, and naturally there were many interested in doing so. Before his death in April 1926, Luther Burbank <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly</b> to his wife, and said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Kurkjian's caller said Donati visited Ferrara at {{the federal}} lockup in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was being held, after his January 1990 arrest on {{racketeering}} charges. The two <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly,</b> using short and vague language, aware their conversations were likely being monitored. Donati told Ferrara he would get him out; Ferrara pleaded with him not to try anything. [...] "No matter what you do, it's {{not going to get}} me out of here", he said. [...] "They will for these; you'll see", Donati responded.|$|E
60|$|He <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly,</b> {{but there}} was a strain in his voice, and Nares guessed what he felt.|$|E
60|$|He <b>spoke</b> very <b>quietly,</b> {{but it was}} unfortunate {{for both}} of them that the other man, who was growing {{slightly}} nettled, did not know when to stop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who? What, Ellen? Are you accusing my boy?" [...] said Caroline, {{her limbs}} {{beginning}} to tremble {{and her eyes}} to flash, though she <b>spoke</b> as <b>quietly</b> as she could.|$|R
60|$|He <b>spoke</b> quite <b>quietly,</b> {{like a man}} who is {{arranging}} the details of a picnic. A sudden glow of admiration for this quietly consistent man warmed her impulsive heart.|$|R

60|$|Bagheera's back {{began to}} curve like a bamboo {{in a high}} wind, but Hathi lifted up his trunk and <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Lucilla was {{trembling}} {{from head to}} foot, and a light gleamed in her eyes; but she <b>spoke</b> so <b>quietly</b> that her cousins did not apprehend her intention in the question-- ...|$|R
60|$|WHEN Magdalen {{appeared}} in the parlor shortly before seven o'clock, not a trace of discomposure was visible in her manner. She looked and <b>spoke</b> as <b>quietly</b> and unconcernedly as usual.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Grace {{waited a}} little, but <b>spoke</b> as <b>quietly</b> {{as if she}} had been prepared. [...] "Has the {{question}} a bearing on the promise you a short time ago demanded of me?" ...|$|R
60|$|She was not upbraiding him, she <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly,</b> {{in a tone}} almost lifeless, yet the {{emotional}} effect of it was tremendous.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sh! don't {{raise the}} neighbors. I'm {{going to marry}} her." [...] He <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly,</b> {{but there was a}} {{peculiar}} numbness creeping over him.|$|E
60|$|There {{was some}} extra color in Andrew's face {{and pride in}} his voice, though he <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly,</b> and Frobisher sat silent a moment or two.|$|E
60|$|He <b>spoke</b> very <b>quietly</b> and reassuringly, as {{if being}} shut up in a fallen tunnel between two masses of earth were {{a matter that}} needn't cause one the {{slightest}} uneasiness; but his words suggested to Elma's mind a fresh and hitherto unthought-of danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{will tell}} you {{everything}} {{that has happened to}} me," [...] said Mr. Burke, [...] "and it won't take long; but first let me ask you something, Mrs. Cliff?" [...] and as he <b>spoke</b> he <b>quietly</b> rose and shut the parlor door.|$|R
6000|$|Deane {{shook his}} head. He <b>spoke</b> very <b>quietly</b> and very distinctly. Except {{that he was}} unusually pale, his manner {{showed no signs of}} emotion. And yet, all the time he felt that he was being stifled! In his ears was the singing of tragedy! ...|$|R
60|$|The tenant of {{the room}} nodded. He had taken off his glasses and their absence {{revealed}} a face of strong individuality. He <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly</b> but distinctly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{and though}} Hetty <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly</b> {{her voice was}} not quite her usual one, [...] "what are you and Tom longing for just now more than anything?" ...|$|E
60|$|Violet made {{a sign of}} assent, and Nasmyth <b>spoke</b> <b>quietly</b> for {{a minute}} or two. Then a faint flush crept into the girl's cheeks and a sparkle into her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Surely thou wouldst {{not have}} the heart to fulfil thy threat,' said the stranger, 'although 'tis true I have but one shoe to be soiled by the mud.' And as he <b>spoke</b> he <b>quietly</b> crossed his legs, and Jeremiah {{perceived}} a hideous cloven foot.|$|R
60|$|Violet rose, {{outwardly}} {{very calm}} and cold, though {{her heart was}} throbbing painfully. There {{was something in the}} man’s face she had never seen there before, and though he <b>spoke</b> very <b>quietly</b> the little thrill in his voice was not without its effect on her.|$|R
60|$|He <b>spoke</b> so <b>quietly</b> and at {{the same}} time so convincingly that both Arthur and Uncle John {{accepted}} his explanation unquestioningly.

60|$|Dom Pedro had cargo for the steamer, and it {{was late}} when Dane said good-by to Bonita on the moonlit veranda. It {{may have been due}} to the silvery light, but she seemed to have changed, and Dane shrank a little from meeting her. Bonita, however, <b>spoke</b> very <b>quietly.</b>|$|R

[...] Then--for {{his voice}} had been irritated--Van <b>spoke</b> more <b>quietly.</b> [...] "Only I see her here--though on his wish of course--handling things quite {{as if they were}} her own and paying him a visit without, apparently, any calculable end.
