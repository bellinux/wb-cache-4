40|$|Ruminant {{microbiology}} {{has been}} studied {{for more than a}} century, initially via microscopic examinations of rumen fluid providing morphological and compositional descriptions of the microbiota. Cultivation techniques for obligate anaerobes were developed in the mid- 20 th Century, and the principal way of studying rumen microbiology shifted, to culture and isolate as many species as possible then study select physiological processes. In the late ‘ 80 s and ‘ 90 s, with the development of tools such as PCR, and the application of reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerases, the field of rumen microbial ecology was transformed to a largely cultivation-independent field of inquiry, using 16 S rRNA and/or the gene encoding that molecule as a <b>semantide.</b> During this period, recombinant DNA technologies also made an impact on the field of rumen microbiology, principally via a level of reductionism that provided deeper knowledge about fewer rumen microbial interactionsand processes. In {{the first decade of the}} 21 st Century, microbialbiology has advanced from the sequencing of individual genomes, to comprehensive assessments of microbial diversity and the genetic potential resident within entire microbial communities. This has been driven largely by the appreciation that culturable microbes represent only a small percentage of the microbial world and advances in high throughput sequencing technologies. As such, there has been a renewed interest in the interrogation of rumen and other gut microbiomes via (meta) genomic approaches. So, are these efforts resulting in more of the same, or something “new” in relation to our understanding of the microbial biology underpinning rumen function, nutrient availability, and animal growth and development; and from which, new opportunities might emerge? This presentation will examine some of the latest observations and findings arising from the study of individual rumen bacteria, as well as rumen microbiomes. The field of rumen microbiologystill has something to offer the animal industries, as well as other sectors of science and industry...|$|E
50|$|<b>Semantides</b> (or semantophoretic molecules) are {{biological}} macromolecules {{that carry}} phylogenetic information about evolutionary history. <b>Semantides</b> may be further classified into three categories: the genes themselves {{are known as}} 'primary semantides' , the mRNA transcripts 'secondary semantides', and polypeptides 'tertiary semantides'. The terms were coined by Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl and used to contrast to episemantic and aposemantic molecules when discussing the phylogenetic evolutionary history contained in macromolecular sequences. Although <b>semantides</b> are the major type of data used in modern phylogenetics the term itself is not commonly used.|$|R
50|$|The above <b>semantides</b> {{can yield}} {{different}} phylogenetic trees, {{but if the}} genetic relatedness is correct for 2 or more, that correlation could mean that the evolutionary tree is correct.|$|R
40|$|Exponents of {{chemical}} paleogenetics have been faced {{at the present}} meeting by two disapproving scientific communities, the organismal evolutionists and taxonomists on the one hand, and some pure (very unorganismal) biochemists on the other hand. Some of the biochemists point out, or imply, that the interest in the biochemical foundation of evolutionary relationships between organisms is a second-rate interest. According to them (and to us), what most counts in the life sciences today is the uncovering of the molecular mechanisms that underly the observations of classical biology. The concept of mechanism should, however, not be applied exclu-sively to short-timed processes. The type of molecules that have been called informational macromolecules (68) or <b>semantides</b> (758) (DNA, RNA, proteins) has a unique {{role in determining the}} properties of living matter in each of three perspectives that differ by the magnitude of time required for the processes involved. These processes are the short-time...|$|R

In 1963, he and Pauling invented the term [...] "semantides" [...] for biological sequences—DNA, RNA, and polypeptides—that have evolutionary information and argued that such sequences could {{be the basis for}} constructing molecular phylogenies, suggesting that the [...] "molecular clock" [...] method might be useful for other <b>semantides</b> besides proteins. Emanuel Margoliash's first publication of sequence data for cytochrome c allowed comparison of the rates of molecular evolution for different proteins (cytochrome c seemed to evolve faster than hemoglobin), which Zuckerkandl discussed at a 1964 conference in Bruges. Zuckerkandl also adjusted the mathematics of the [...] "clock" [...] to account for the observation that some positions in an amino acid sequence were more stable than others, and the likelihood of multiple substitutions at the same position. In September 1964, he attended the important Evolving Genes and Proteins symposium, where he and Pauling presented their most influential paper ("Evolutionary Divergence and Convergence in Proteins", published in the conference proceedings the next year). The paper, primarily Zuckerkandl's work, named the [...] "evolutionary clock" [...] and presented a derivation of its basic mathematical form. Though Zuckerkandl and Pauling saw the clock as compatible with natural selection, it would later become the basis of the neutral theory of molecular evolution, in which genetic drift rather than selection is the driving force of evolution at the molecular level.|$|R
40|$|Current {{limitations}} in culture-based methods have {{lead to a}} reliance on culture- independent approaches, based principally on the comparative analysis of primary <b>semantides</b> such as ribosomal gene sequences. DNA can be remarkably stable in some environments, so its presence does not indicate live bacteria, but extracted ribosomal RNA (rRNA) has previously been viewed {{as an indicator of}} active cells. Stable isotope probing (SIP) involves the incorporation of heavy isotopes into newly synthesized nucleic acids, and can be used to separate newly synthesized from existing DNA or rRNA. H 2 18 O is currently the only potential universal bacterial substrate suitable for SIP of entire bacterial communities. The aim of our work was to compare soil bacterial community composition as revealed by total versus SIP-labeled DNA and rRNA. Soil was supplemented with H 2 18 O and after 38 days the DNA and RNA were co-extracted. Heavy nucleic acids were separated out by CsCl and CsTFA density centrifugation. The 16 S rRNA gene pools were characterized by DGGE and pyrosequencing, and the sequence results analyzed using mothur. The majority of DNA (~ 60 %) and RNA (~ 75 %) from the microcosms incubated with H 2 18 O were labeled by the isotope. The analysis indicated that total and active members of the same type of nucleic acid represented similar community structures, which suggested that most dominant OTUs in the total nucleic acid extracts contained active members. It also supported that H 2 18 O was an effective universal label for SIP for both DNA and RNA. DNA and RNA-derived diversity was dissimilar. RNA from this soil more comprehensively recovered bacterial richness than DNA because the most abundant OTUs were less numerous in RNA than DNAderived community data, and dominant OTU pools didn’t mask rare OTUs as much in RNA.
