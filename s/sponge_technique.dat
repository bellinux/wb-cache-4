40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes inflow and outflow {{boundary}} conditions for direct computation of airfoil noise {{under the influence}} of impinging gusts with a particular interest in the high frequency response. The proposed {{boundary conditions}} are based on an existing zonal <b>sponge</b> <b>technique</b> that has been used mostly to attenuate outgoing disturbances and absorb reflections from computational boundaries. A modified form of the <b>sponge</b> <b>technique</b> is presented in this paper in order to specify an incoming disturbance. The proposed boundary conditions still maintain the genuine non-reflective features that lead to accurate calculations of far-field sound intensity and directivity. It is also shown that the proposed boundary conditions enable the use of a significantly smaller domain size, and hence fewer grid cells, than used in conventional airfoil calculations, which enables the calculation of high-frequency gust-airfoil noise at a much lower computational cost. The proposed boundary conditions are validated against CAA (computational aeroacoustics) benchmark solutions after a variety of parametric tests, through which an optimal combination of the domain size, sponge thickness and a sponge coefficient is obtained for the highest efficiency. The proposed boundary conditions yield more accurate and consistent solutions particularly at the far field than the conventional ones. Further applications to high-frequency gust responses are performed to observe and demonstrate significant changes in the sound intensity and directivity varying with different frequencies and gust incidence angles...|$|E

Then, hydroxyapatite/Baghdadite (HA/Bagh) scaffolds were prepared by the replacing the polyurethane polymeric <b>sponge</b> <b>technique.</b> Afterwhile, the ceramic scaffolds were sintered at 1150 ºC for 3 h. The prepared scaffold was then coated by polycaprolactone/bioglass (PCL/BG) polymer nanocomposite. Results: Bioactivity and biomineralization in the simulated body fluid (SBF) revealed that the nanocomposite scaffolds coate with PCL/BG had significant bioactivity properties. The morophology and microstructure investigation of soaked samples in SBF indicate that bone-like apatite formed on the surfaces. Also, ion release in SBF containing the scaffolds was measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis.

The new generation of bioceramics can applied in bone tissue engineering to substitute with infected bone. However, these zirconium-silicate bioceramics have proper features; they can be used as additive with calcium phosphates (CaPs) like hydroxyapatite (HA). These composite may enhance the weak properties of pure HA powders. Materials and Methods: In the current study, the Hr powder with sol-gel method was synthesized. Then, hydroxyapatite-hardystonite (HA/Hr) scaffolds with various amount of Hr in HA (0, 5, 10, and 15 wt. %)  were prepared by the replacing the polyurethane polymeric <b>sponge</b> <b>technique.</b> Then, the ceramic scaffolds were sintered at 1150 ºC for 3 hours. The result of the scaffold nanocomposite specimens were tested for compressive strength and bioactivity behaviour. The phase and morphology of the specimens were analysis with X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scan Electron Microscope (SEM) techniques. Results: The bioactivity, sinterability and compressive strength (CS) properties of HA-Hr scaffold nanocomposite has been developed by addition of 15 wt. % Hr in HA matrix.

[...] Now, as research has increased into the transmission of culture in animals, the role of teaching among animal groups has become apparent. Teaching is not merely limited to mammals either. Many insects, for example have been observed demonstrating various forms of teaching in order to obtain food. Ants, for example, will guide each other to food sources through a process called [...] "tandem running," [...] in which an ant will guide a companion ant to a source of food. It has been suggested that the [...] "pupil" [...] ant is able to learn this route in order to obtain food in the future or teach the route to other ants. There have been various recent studies that show that cetaceans are able to transmit culture through teaching as well. Killer whales are known to [...] "intentionally beach" [...] themselves in order to catch and eat pinnipeds who are breeding on the shore. Mother killer whales teach their young to catch pinnipeds by pushing them onto the shore and encouraging them to attack and eat the prey. Because the mother killer whale is altering her behavior in order to help her offspring learn to catch prey, this is evidence of teaching and cultural learning.

40|$|In current practice, {{surgeons}} use suction {{and irrigation}} {{to clear the}} field of view during procedures. Devices designed for suction often employ a strong negative pressure (vacuum). This negative pressure may result in tissue damage and/or occlusion of the de-vice lumen [1]. This occlusion significantly compromises the abil-ity to suction, creating inefficiencies and delays in the surgical procedure. To prevent this problem, some surgeons will place a sponge on the target area before applying suction, thereby reduc-ing the negative pressure to which tissue is exposed. In laparo-scopic surgery, sponges are inserted through laparoscopic-size incisions or ports and then tracked to ensure eventual removal. This process may be time consuming and may make control of hemorrhage more difficult [2].

In the present study, an attempt {{has been made to}} develop porous alumina ceramics with wide porosity (10 - 80 %) using three different fabrication methods. The three methods are starch consolidation casting (SCC), polymeric <b>sponge</b> replica <b>technique</b> (SRT) as well as the combination of the two methods (SCC+SRT). A theoretical model has also been developed and validated with the experimental data to predict the porosity of the samples prepared by SCC theoretically. Alumina loading, starch content, starch types are used as the tools to develop different porosity in the samples made by starch consolidation casting. TiO 2 has been used as sintering additives to improve high strength in the starch consolidated samples without compromising the porosity. The viscosity of the slurry in the range 0. 05 - 1. 19 Pa. s was found to be optimum to fabricate defect free samples by starch consolidation casting. The porosity of the samples could be varied from 20 - 70 % in this technique. TiO 2 as sintering aid was able to reduce the sintering temperature of the samples in the tune of 300 oC without compromising the strength and porosity of the samples fabricated by this technique.

Methods: Initially in the porcine model and later in patients, we developed a laparoscopic technique with a mechanical arm used to mechanically elevate the abdominal wall, creating a working cavity. Conventional vascular instruments were used in combination with laparoscopic devices. Five to seven ports were needed for the procedures (four to six ports of 0. 5 to 1. 5 cm and one incision of 4. 0 cm). Exposure was maintained by use of roticulating fan retractors and laparotomy <b>sponges.</b> End-to-side <b>technique</b> was used for all graft anastamoses (cross-clamp time of 40 to 70 minutes). Distal anastamoses were performed through an open femoral incision. Operative time was 5 hours (iliac procedure) and 7 hours (aortic procedure). Results: All patients were ambulating and tolerating a regular diet within 24 hours (iliac procedures) or 48 hours (aortic procedures) after operation. They were discharged home on the second (iliac procedures) or third (aortic procedures) postoperative day. Within 1 week they had resumed normal daily activities. No complications occurred, and no blood bank products were transfused. When compared with the standard surgical approach, gasless laparoscopic technique gave a faster postoperative recovery with less pain and decreased the risk of wound herniation, dehiscence, and infection. From a laparoscopic standpoint, the use of disposable instruments was minimized and the theoretical risk of CO 2 embolism eliminated. Conclusion: These four cases demonstrate that laparoscopic vascular bypass procedures are feasible and that the accepted advantages of laparoscopy can be extended to patients undergoing vascular surgery.

Current methods to detect C. difficile spores on surfaces are not quantitative, lack sensitivity, and are protracted.

Sponge swabbing was compared to contact plate sampling to assess the in vitro recovery of C. difficile ribotype 027 contamination (100, 101, or 102 CFU of spores) from test surfaces (a bed rail, a stainless steel sheet, or a polypropylene work surface). Sponge swab contents were concentrated by vacuum filtration, and the filter membrane was plated onto selective agar. The efficacy of each technique for the recovery of C. difficile from sites in the clinical environment that are touched at a high frequency was evaluated. Contact plates recovered 19 to 32 % of the total contam-ination on test surfaces, whereas sponge swabs recovered 76 to 94 % of the total contamination, and contact plates failed to detect C. difficile contamination below a detection limit of 10 CFU/ 25 cm 2 (0. 4 CFU/cm 2). In use, contact plates failed to detect C. diffi-cile contamination (0 / 96 contact plates; 4 case wards), while sponge swabs recovered C. difficile from 29 % (87 / 301) of the sur-faces tested in the clinical environment.

When fully grown sponges {{belonging to the}} same species are brought into contact, either naturally or by an experimental process, they fuse into a single organism. In {{the absence of any}} circulatory system, the ability for cellular recognition resides in the cell surface and is expressed when cells come into contact. This characteristic of sponges and the readiness, with which the sponges can be dissociated into cellular suspension, led to the main experimental work on cellular recognition in these organisms— that is, the studies on the aggregating behavior of dissociated <b>sponge</b> cells. The <b>technique</b> of cell aggregation is very useful, as it allows the mixing of cell suspensions of different kinds and proportions, and because a large number of cells can be brought simultaneously into contact. Purification and characterization of sponge cell aggregating factors was first attempted in Microciona prolifera and Haliclona occulata. Glycopeptides extracted from whole sponges with trichloroacetic acid were antigenic and that they elicited in rabbits precipitating and agglutinating antisera specific for the homologous cells. Some phenomena, involved in sponge cell recognition, were investigated during the reaggregation of the dissociated cells. It is pointed out that in sponges cell, recognition occurs at three levels—namely, cell type specificity, intraspecific recognition, and interspecific recognition. © 1975, Academic Press Inc.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to cryopreserve cells allows for wide opportunities of flexible handling of cell cultures from different sponge species. Primmorphs model, a multicellular 3 D aggregate formed by dissociated sponge cells, {{is considered one}} of the best approaches to establish sponge cell culture but, in spite of the available protocols for freezing sponge cells, there is no information regarding the ability of the latter to form primmorphs after thawing. In the present work, we demonstrate that, after a freezing and thawing cycle using dissociated Petrosia ficiformis cells as a model, cells viability was high but it was not possible to obtain primmorphs. The same protocol for cryopreservation was then used to directly freeze primmorphs. In this second case, after thawing, viability and the cellular proliferative level were similar to unfrozen standard primmorphs. Spiculogenesis in thawed primmorphs was evaluated by quantifying the silicatein gene expression level and by assaying the silica amount in the newly formed spicules, then compared with the correspondent values obtained in standard unfrozen primmorphs. Results indicate that the freezing cycle does not affect the spiculogenesis rate. Finally, the expression level of heat shock protein 70, a wellknown stress marker, was assayed and the results showed no differences between frozen and unfrozen samples. These findings are likely to promote relevant improvements in <b>sponge</b> cell culture <b>technique,</b> allowing for a worldwide exchange of living biological material, paving the way for cell banking of Porifera...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} environmentally {{and economically}} viable ways {{to manage a}} sponge that is bioeroding the pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima, in pearl oyster farms throughout north-western Australia. The sponge is causing a massive loss in revenue to the pearling industry {{as a result of}} damage to the half-shell, the pearl and, often, death of the oyster. The information arising from this study is important for pearl producers and the Australian pearling industry, to ensure that the best quality P. maxima can be grown {{in a way that will}} not have adverse effects on the pristine environment in which these sensitive organisms live. It is of uttermost importance to the pearl oyster farms that solutions to the problem are environmentally appropriate. Control of the sponge, of the family Clionidae and the genus Cliona in addition to other related genera, was based on knowledge of its reproductive cycle, so that a deterrent to egg release can be applied at a time when the sponge is at a vulnerable stage in its life cycle. The reproductive cycle of the sponge was examined using light microscopy, after the sponge samples had been processed using histological methods. The reproductive cycle of the sponge was examined over a 12 -month period at five different pearl oyster farms in north-western Australia. Reproductive activity was correlated with environmental parameters, including water temperature and salinity. The results of these studies were integrated and management recommendations based on these results were made, The study on reproduction of the sponge found no indication of reproductive activity for three of the farms (Morgan Pearl farm and both Paspaley Pearl farms at Vansittart Bay and Port Bremer) participating in the study. The samples from Maxima Pearl presented some reproductive activity, while Arrow Pearl had relatively high reproductive activity. Additionally, reproduction occurred at two different times of the year. This study concluded that management of the bioeroding sponge can be improved with knowledge of its reproductive cycle. Other longer-term studies are, however, essential for improved management recommendations. The current management technique recommended, the application of a paint that will smother and kill the sponge infestation, is thought to be environmentally benign and has the potential for pearl producers to reduce the revenue lost as a result of the <b>sponge.</b> This <b>technique</b> should be continued with modifications on the timing of the application to coincide with reproductive activity of the sponge, thereby reducing sponge settlement and consequently reducing farm costs. For the recommended management strategies to be effectively utilised, further research is needed into the origins and reproductive cycle of this bioeroding sponge...|$|R
40|$|Synchronization {{techniques}} {{outside the}} normal breeding season were evaluated on 85 Boer goats with intravaginal progestagen sponges, sponges plus prostaglandin, and two injections of prostaglandin, {{with or without}} 500 IU PMSG. Oestrous response following the double prostaglandin injection regime was significantly (P < 0. 01) lower than in the intravaginal sponge and sponge plus protaglandin groups (with and without exogenous PMSG). The PMSG led to a higher (P < 0. 01) oestrous response in goats treated with intravaginal sponges only (100. 0 % vs. 53. 3 %). Administration of 500 IU PMSG led to a shorter time interval (P< 0. 01) from cessation of treatment to the onset of oestrus in the intravaginal sponge and sponge plus prostaglandin groups (40. 0 vs. 72. 1 hr and 39. 3 vs. 71. 3 hr, respectively). Time interval from treatment to the LH peak was shorter (P< 0. 01) in the groups (excluding the double injection prostaglandin groups) receiving 500 IU PMSG, with {{no significant difference between}} the two intravaginal sponge treated groups. No significant differences in the time interval between LH peak and onset of the oestrous period was recorded between treatment groups. There was no significant difference in fertility between the intravaginal sponge and sponge plus prostaglandin groups (73. 3 vs. 66. 7 % with PMSG and 53. 3 vs. 60. 0 % without PMSG). Intravaginal sponge and <b>sponge</b> plus prostaglandin <b>techniques</b> (with PMSG) are effective as synchronizing agents outside the breeding season in Boer goat does.

40|$|Bioerosion {{is a major}} {{process that}} affects the {{carbonate}} balance on coral reefs, and excavating sponges from the genus Cliona {{are some of the}} most important bioeroders on Caribbean reefs. The orange boring sponge, Cliona delitrix, is an abundant excavating sponge offshore southeast Florida that frequently colonizes dead portions of live stony corals, killing live coral tissue as it grows. With the recent decline in coral cover attributed to combined environmental and anthropogenic stressors, the increasing abundance of excavating sponges poses yet another threat to the persistence of Caribbean coral reefs. In the first part of this study, I explored distributional patterns of C. delitrix offshore southeast Florida and compared yearly sponge growth/corresponding coral tissue loss rates across habitats of different depths. C. delitrix densities and growth rates were significantly higher on the outer reef, where coral colonies also showed some of the fastest tissue retreat rates. More sponge individuals were found on sites with higher coral densities, likely resulting from the higher availability of preferred coral skeleton substrate. C. delitrix showed a clear preference for boulder stony coral species, which could alter the coral community composition in the future and allow an increase in branching and foliose species. The growth rates of C. delitrix offshore southeast Florida are slower compared to rates from other locations, likely a result of intense fouling of the coral-sponge interface by other spatial reef competitors. These results suggest that outer reef sites with high boulder coral density offshore southeast Florida are most vulnerable to C. delitrix colonization and may continue to suffer the greatest impacts of coral bioerosion. Excavating sponges are also strong competitors for space on coral reefs; able to colonize, excavate, and kill entire live stony corals. Despite the known negative effects of excavating sponges on stony corals very few studies have experimentally tested the competitive nature of this interaction. In the second part of this study, I examined the effect of manual removal of the excavating sponge, Cliona delitrix (Pang 1973), on tissue loss of the stony coral Montastrea cavernosa (Linnaeus 1767), and its possibility as a restoration technique. A total of 33 M. cavernosa colonies colonized by small C. delitrix sponges (up to 10 cm in diameter) were examined. Sponges were removed using a hammer and chisel from 22 of the affected colonies, and 11 colonies were left alone as controls. After sponge removal, the resultant cavities in the coral skeletons were filled to minimize future colonization by other bioeroders and promote coral tissue growth over the excavation. Cement was used as fill material on 11 of the colonies, and the remaining 11 cavities were filled with epoxy. Standardized photos of each colony were taken immediately, at 6 months and 12 months after sponge removal. Results show a significant reduction in coral tissue loss in colonies where sponge was removed, and both fill materials performed similarly reducing coral tissue loss. I also found that a majority of experimental corals showed no return of C. delitrix to the colony surface a year after removal. This study demonstrates that eliminating the bioeroding sponge competitor may promote recovery of the affected stony coral. Additionally, the <b>sponge</b> removal <b>technique</b> can be applied to any stony coral colonized by C. delitrix to preserve, or at least slow the loss of, remaining live tissue...|$|R
40|$|Sponges produce {{secondary}} metabolites, which play several ecological roles (McClintock & Baker 2001) such us {{competition for}} the space (Martí 2005), antifouling activity (Martin & Uriz 1993, Becerro 1994), and deterrence from predators (e. g. Becerro et al. 2003). The secondary metabolites produced by sponges have an enormous potential {{to be used in}} applications as medical drugs and cosmetics. Most medicines have their origin from natural resources, traditionally from terrestrial plants and, more recently, from marine organisms. Especially, sponges are the origin of a huge number of bioactive compounds, which are chemically very diverse (McClintock & Baker 2001). To supply the market with sufficient amounts of sponge bioactive compounds is a bottleneck currently unsolved. Sponge culture, both at sea and under controlled conditions, is the most assayed method to produce sponge biomass. The cultivation of intact sponges and fragments at sea prevent the control of the environmental conditions, which may not be the optimal for sponge growth. Thus, to control the external variables, cultures of sponge fragments (explants) have been performed in semi-open and closed systems (e. g. Barthel & Theede 1986, Osinga et al. 2003, Sipkema et al. 2006).   Cultures of sponge cells and aggregates (primmorphs) have also been intensely studied although a continuous cell line is still far from being obtained (e. g. Pomponi & Willoughby 1994, Müller et al. 1999). Until now, only short-term primary cell cultures have been developed due to contamination problems and low cell division. However, cell cultures are becoming promising due to recent advances, especially in the genetic field (transfected cells) (e. g. Thomson et al. 2007). The aim of this thesis was to gain new knowledge on biology and ecology of sponges (particularly of Corticium candelabrum) that {{can be applied to the}} culture sponges for biotechnological purposes. In chapter II, we aimed to assess the growth capacity of C. candelabrum in the field. We monitored monthly survival, growth, shrinkage, regeneration, fusion, and fission of 45 individuals of this species for three years. In parallel, experiments of clearance rates on natural food particles were performed seasonally. The clearance rates of C. candelabrum on the different types of food particles available in the water column provided us with information on the preferable food type to be further used for the sponge culture. In chapter III, in vitro sponge culture of C. candelabrum explants was assayed in part based on the information acquired from chapter II.   In the first part, we attempted to define a protocol for obtaining healthy sponge explants by examining explant survival under several biological and environmental conditions. In the second part, an explant culture was implemented. The effect of several cultivation conditions: with and without addition of antibiotics, and algae and bacteria as a food, were analyzed to find the best conditions for explants survival and growth. Survival and growth of C. candelabrum in culture were compared with those of sponges at sea (chapter II). In chapter IV, a new in vitro <b>sponge</b> culture <b>technique,</b> based on juveniles from larvae, was investigated. The experimental design was based on the results obtained in chapters II and III, where a general pattern of slow and variable growth was observed, with the smallest individuals growing at the highest rates at sea. Starting from larvae, we wanted to take benefit of the high growth capacity of juveniles. Moreover, by culturing individuals of the same age (same cohort), we expected to reduce the growth variability among individuals. Due to the difficulty to obtain C. candelabrum larvae in sufficient amounts, the experiments were performed with larvae of Crambe crambe,Dysidea avara, Ircinia oros and Hippospongia communis, which were easier to obtain. After larval settlement in the laboratory, juveniles were cultured under different conditions of flow and food. In addition, juveniles were tran spla nted into the sea to compare survival and growth in both environments (sea and laboratory). This study showed the potentiality of sponge larvae as a source of sponges to culture. In chapter V, we studied, through transmission and scanning electron microscopy, the developmental process involved in the formation of the C. candelabrum larva, which is a cinctoblastula type. After the success obtained with the culture of juveniles from larvae of several sponge species (chapter IV), a more in deep study on larval development of C. candelabrum, which was poorly known, appeared to be necessary as a basis for a massive larval supply in the future. The species selected for this study was C. candelabrum because their larvae were poorly known and because this species is a promising species to culture (chapter III). In chapter VI the different symbiotic bacteria types in C. candelabrum and their transmission to the larvae were described through transmission and scanning electron microscopy for a better understanding of their possible role in the sponge fitness and the consequent repercussions in the success of the sponge culture. We investigated whether all the bacteria types present in an adult were transmitted to the larvae, and whether these bacteria are really used as a food by the sponge (as it had been reported occasionally in the literature). To conclude, in chapter VII, the state of the art on the sponge cell culture is shortly reviewed, and new proposals for future research are outlined. We suggest the use of embryos and larvae instead of adults (archeocytes) as a new source of stem cells due to their greater potential, and to focus on apoptosis to obtain a continuous sponge cell line...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, as a {{consequence}} of the increase in average life expectancy, we witness an increased occurrence of age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, which is predominant in humans older than 50 [1]. Osteoporotic bone is characterised by loss of bone mass and micro-architectural skeletal deterioration, with higher porosity and bigger pores compared to the normal bone, resulting in increased fragility and a higher risk of bone fracture when a fall occurs. Osteoporosis is the result of an imbalance of the bone tissue homeostasis, which is normally regulated by the synergic action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts [2]. Nevertheless, all the molecular mechanisms driving osteoporosis onset and progression have not been fully clarified yet. To study the basic mechanisms driving to osteoporosis, two approaches are usually employed: animal models and cell culture on classic plastic two-dimensional (2 D) supports. The animal models have shown limits in the reproduction of human conditions, implying at the same time high costs, significant level of complexity, and a limited control of the local environment. On the other hand, traditional 2 D cultures lack in the imitation of the three-dimensional (3 D) environment of the native bone, which is fundamental for the regulation of the cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. In this context, the tissue engineering (TE) approach represents a straightforward alternative, which offers suitable tools for the in vitro replication of bone environment. This research work developed tissue engineered in vitro 3 D models of normal and osteoporotic bone, which were subsequently employed to study the influence of the pathologic architecture on cell response. These models can help to gain new knowledge on the effect of the environment on osteoporosis progression, as well as to support the development of new therapeutic approaches. The first step in the design of bone in vitro models was the biomaterials selection for the scaffolds fabrication. Bone inorganic phase was mimed through a bioactive glass-ceramic deriving from a SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 -CaO-MgO-Na 2 O-K 2 O parent glass (CEL 2). CEL 2 glass-ceramics (CEL 2 -GC) substrates are bioactive, leading to the deposition of a hydroxyapatite layer, similar to the mineral phase of bone. To mimic the bone organic phase, the CEL 2 -GC substrate was surface functionalised with a type I collagen-based coating. Type I collagen was isolated from rabbit bone in the native triple helix conformation, with a high degree of purity, and it was blended with a newly synthesised water-soluble polyurethane (PUR) in order to improve the long-term stability of the coating. In fact, PURs bring the advantages of tuneable chemical and mechanical properties, and biocompatibility [3]. The PUR was synthesised from poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and N-BOC-serinol, and it was designed to expose amino groups on the polymeric chain, which can be exploited for the blend stabilisation through crosslinking. Consecutive steps of functionalisation were performed to link the polymeric coating on the CEL 2 -GC surface, which was thoroughly characterised at each stage, in order to select the optimal conditions. Firstly, the surface was cleaned for both eliminating eventual contaminants and exposing -OH groups, without negatively influencing the bioactivity of the glass-ceramic substrate. Consecutively, a uniform silanisation on the surface was obtained and the bioartificial blend was linked to the surface using genipin as a bridge between the silane and the polymer amino groups. A further addition of genipin to stabilise the blend through crosslinking showed to improve the cell response. In vitro tests were performed on the glass-ceramic 2 D substrate functionalised with the bioartificial blend in order to evaluate the ionic release, the coating stability and the bioactivity. Thanks to the presence of the PUR, the bioartificial coating allowed incorporating a higher amount of collagen on the surface of the CEL 2 -GC, and its stabilisation for long-term incubation (up to 28 days). Biological test performed using human periosteal derived precursor cells (PDPCs) demonstrated that the proposed material was a good substrate for bone cell adhesion and growth, thus maintaining the biological and structural integrity of the ECM. The selected biomaterials were then employed for the scaffold fabrication. 3 D porous glass-ceramic scaffolds were produced through the <b>sponge</b> replication <b>technique.</b> The processing parameters were systematically varied, allowing a good control over the morphological and microstructural characteristics of the scaffold, which closely mimicked the ones of normal and osteoporotic trabecular bone. In particular, the porosity, pore size, and structure thickness were very close to the ones of normal and osteoporotic bones harvested from femoral head [4, 5]. The developed scaffolds were functionalised by the collagen-PUR bioartificial blend, allowing to obtain bone-like model substrates for advanced in vitro investigations. Even though to overcome the limits of the animal models human primary cells must be included in the in vitro model, in these initial stages of the model development rat derived primary cells were employed as a cheaper and easier accessible cell sources for a preliminary biological characterisation. Thus, the effect of 3 D porous CEL 2 -GC scaffolds mimicking the normal and osteoporotic bone architectures on the osteogenic differentiation of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was evaluated. CEL 2 -GC scaffolds functionalised with the bioartificial blend demonstrated to be a suitable support for MSCs osteogenic differentiation, which showed a good adhesion and morphology, alkaline phosphatase activity, and the synthesis of proteins specific of bone ECM (osteocalcin and osteopontin). The MSCs were cultured on the 3 D scaffolds with and without the addition of osteogenic factors to the medium. Osteogenic factors have shown to improve the osteogenic effect imparted by the scaffold. The architecture of the osteoporotic-like scaffold affected MSCs differentiation, since cells synthetized slightly lower amount of osteopontin compared to the cells cultured on the scaffold mimicking the osteoporotic bone tissue. These results suggest the hypothesis that, in an osteoporotic bone, MSCs may have a reduced differentiation ability due to the altered bone architecture induced by this pathology. This research opens the door to new approaches in osteoporosis studies, highlighting i) the importance of considering the 3 D environment in in vitro studies due to the influence of architecture on cells response; ii) the need of well-timed screening of this pathology, since the results suggest that the architecture of the osteoporotic bone enhances the disease progression, iii) the possibility to investigate therapeutic approaches that address the MSCs, e. g. by inducing their differentiation. Finally, a preliminary evaluation on the scaffolds ability to support Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) viability in co-culture with osteoblast-like cell was performed, constituting the proof of concept for a future long-term experiment for the evaluation of the influence of endothelial cells on the remodelling process in healthy and pathological conditions. 1 Chen, H., Zhou, X., Shoumura, S., Emura, S. & Bunai, Y.
