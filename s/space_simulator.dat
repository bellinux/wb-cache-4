500|$|FreeSpace was Volition's first project {{after the}} split from Parallax Software, which also spawned Outrage Entertainment. It {{is not part}} of the canon of the Descent {{computer}} game series, and contained none of its ideas and only small portions of its code. It was only prefixed with Descent to avoid trademark issues with Mijenix Corporation's [...] "FreeSpace", a disk compression utility. Volition also used the term [...] "FreeSpace" [...] in the game to initially describe what became later known as subspace. The game was conceived by Adam Pletcher, with all the features of <b>space</b> <b>simulator</b> games his team had found to be fun. The games [...] and Wing Commander were their primary inspirations, and those influences made their way into the game's flight model, along with the influence of historical WWII dogfights. Themes from the fiction of Star Wars, , and Ender's Game form a part in shaping the background and story of the FreeSpace world. The chaotic battles between masses of ships commonly found in science-fiction anime became one of the features of FreeSpace.|$|E
500|$|Descent 3 is {{the first}} project {{developed}} by Outrage Entertainment. The company was founded when Parallax Software, creators of previous Descent games, decided to split in two: Outrage Entertainment and Volition. Volition would focus on creating the combat <b>space</b> <b>simulator</b> FreeSpace games, while Outrage would continue with the Descent series. Development on Descent 3 began in November 1996 {{with a team of}} eight people. According to programmer Jason Leighton, one of the major problems during the game's development cycle was a lack of direction and control. He explained that the team had [...] "No code reviews, no art reviews, [...] no way of saying, 'This is bad and we should be going in a different direction'". This [...] "anarchistic" [...] development environment worked for Descent and Descent II because they were developed by small groups that worked closely together and often in the same room. However, as Outrage started to grow from eight people to almost 20 {{by the end of the}} project, the developers did not introduce enough management to control the process. As Leighton recalls, [...] "we literally had to build the team and company at the same time we started production on the game".|$|E
2500|$|Handheld game consoles, however, {{particularly}} Nintendo handhelds {{such as the}} Nintendo DS, have {{featured a}} number of innovative RPGs during the late 2000s. Square Enix's The World Ends with You (2007) featured a unique dual-screen action combat system that involves controlling two characters at the same time. Level-5's Inazuma Eleven (2008) introduced unique soccer football RPG gameplay incorporating sports game elements. The Atlus title [...] (2009) blends together both traditional and tactical RPG gameplay along with non-linear adventure game elements {{as well as an}} innovative demon auction system and a death clock system where each character has a specified time of death and the player's actions has consequences on who lives and dies. On the PlayStation Portable (PSP), Half-Minute Hero (2009) is a role-playing shooter featuring self-referential humour and a 30-second time limit for each level and boss encounter. Infinite Space (2009) by PlatinumGames is a hybrid of tactical role-playing game, real-time strategy and <b>space</b> <b>simulator</b> elements, and features a non-linear branching narrative with numerous choices that can have dramatic consequences, and an epic scale spanning hundreds of planets.|$|E

50|$|As {{space is}} a natural {{extension}} of airspace, <b>space</b> flight <b>simulators</b> may be treated as an extension of flight simulators' genre. There is a considerable interdependence between those two kinds of simulators, as some flight simulators feature spacecraft as an extension and some <b>space</b> flight <b>simulators</b> may feature realistic atmospheric flight simulation engines. For instance, in 2013 a hobbyist <b>space</b> flight <b>simulator</b> project was realized under usage of Pioneer simulation software.|$|R
