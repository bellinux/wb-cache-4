25|$|A {{large and}} still {{growing number of}} {{attempts}} to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as GDP. Some {{of the most prominent}} of these include the Human Development Index (HDI) of the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP); the Ecological footprint of Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations; the Environmental Sustainability Index(ESI) and the pilot Environmental Performance Index(EPI) reported under the World Economic Forum(WEF); or the Genuine Progress Index(GPI) calculated at the national or sub-national level. Parallel to these initiatives, political interest in producing a green GDP that would take at least the cost of pollution and natural capital depletion into account has grown, even if implementation is held back by the reluctance of policymakers and <b>statistical</b> <b>services</b> arising mostly from a concern about conceptual and technical challenges.|$|E

40|$|The network {{calculus}} {{offers an}} elegant framework for determining worst-case bounds on delay and backlog in a network. This paper extends the network calculus to a probabilistic framework with <b>statistical</b> <b>service</b> guarantees. The {{notion of a}} <b>statistical</b> <b>service</b> curve {{is presented as a}} probabilistic bound on the service received by an individual flow or an aggregate of flows. The problem of concatenating per-node <b>statistical</b> <b>service</b> curves to form an end-to-end (network) <b>statistical</b> <b>service</b> curve is explored. Two solution approaches are presented that can each yield <b>statistical</b> network <b>service</b> curves. The first approach requires the availability of time scale bounds at which arrivals and departures at each node are correlated. The second approach considers a service curve that describes service over time intervals. Although the latter description of service is less general, it is argued that many practically relevant service curves may be compliant to this description...|$|R
