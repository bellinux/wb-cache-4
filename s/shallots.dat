5|$|This group {{contains}} <b>shallots</b> {{and potato}} onions, {{also referred to}} as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. <b>Shallots</b> are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from <b>shallots</b> in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E
5|$|Considerable {{differences}} exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content, particularly for polyphenols, with <b>shallots</b> having the highest level, {{six times the}} amount found in Vidalia onions. Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content, an amount 11 times higher than in white onions. Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments, with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10% of total flavonoid content.|$|E

The alternative of <b>shallot</b> processing is <b>shallot</b> paste. The aims of this study wereto develop <b>shallot</b> paste formula which had a strong aromaas well as determination of shelf life in a glass jar. This study has several steps, i. e. preparation and characterization of fresh <b>shallot,</b> processing <b>shallot</b> paste, and determination of shelf life <b>shallot</b> paste in glass jar with the ESS (Extended Storage Studies) method. This main research used completely randomized design with two factors: first, the ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> and shortening, and second, emulsifier concentration. The ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> and shortening were 2 : 1, 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 with emulsifier concentration of 2, 3 and 4 % for each ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> and shortening. The statistical analysis showed that the ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> and shortening affected theFFA (free fatty acid) value. Concentration of emulsifier and interaction between emulsifier concentration and ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> and shortening affected VRS (volatile reducing substance) content of <b>shallot</b> paste. The best <b>shallot</b> paste treatment determined was the ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> and shortening of 3 : 1 with emulsifier concentration of 4 %. Shelf-life of packaged <b>shallot</b> paste in glass jar was 10 days at temperature 30, 40 and 50 oC. During the storage, FFA value increased and VRS value decreased along {{with the increase in}} storage temperature. The increased of FFA value was caused by fat hydrolysis during storage, while the VRS value decreased due to the evaporation of sulfur compounds as flavor components in <b>shallot</b> paste during stir frying...|$|R

Stability of antimicrobial activity of <b>shallot</b> extract at different pH and temperature, solubility in different solvent, determination of shelf life and susceptibility to enzymes and detergents were evaluated. Results: <b>Shallot</b> extract was active against microbes at pH 4 - 8. Relative activities of <b>shallot</b> extract at temperature – 7 to 121 °C were 88 to 100 %.

40|$|Summary The {{present study}} {{has been carried out}} to {{investigate}} the effect of aqueous extract of <b>shallot</b> (Allium ascalonicum) and garlic (Allium satium) on the fasting insulin resistance index (FIRI) and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) of fructose-induced insulin resistance rats. Male albino Wistar rats were fed either normal or high-fructose diet for a period of eight weeks. Fasting blood glucose level, fasting blood triglyceride level, FIRI, and the area under the glucose tolerance curve were significantly elevated in fructose-fed animals. Fructose-induced insulin resistance rats treated by aqueous <b>shallot</b> or garlic extract (500 mg/ kg body weight/day, i. p.) for duration of eight weeks. Control animals only received normal saline (0. 9 %). The results showed that neither <b>shallot</b> nor garlic extracts significantly altered the FIRI and the IPGTT at the fourth week after treatment. The fasting blood glucose in fructose-induced insulin resistance animals has been significantly decreased in 8 -week treated animals by both <b>shallot</b> and garlic extracts. <b>Shallot</b> extract administration, but not garlic extract, for a period of eight weeks can significantly improve the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance and diminish the FIRI. These results indicate that <b>shallot</b> and garlic extracts have a hypoglycemic influence on the fructose-induced insulin resistance animals and aqueous <b>shallot</b> extract is a stronger hypoglycemic agent than the garlic extract.

Of the 62 single-alien deletion plants, 60 could be identified as six different single-alien deletion lines (AAF- 1 F, - 3 F, - 4 F, - 6 F, - 7 F, and - 8 F) out of the eight possible types. Several single-alien deletion lines were classified {{on the basis of}} leaf and bulb characteristics. AAF- 8 F had the largest number of expanded leaves of five deletion plants. AAF- 7 F grew most vigorously, as expressed by its long leaf blade and biggest bulb size. AAF- 4 F had very small bulbs. AAF- 7 F and AAF- 8 F had different bulbs from those of <b>shallot</b> as well as other types of single-alien deletion lines in skin and outer scale color. Regarding the sugar content of the bulb tissues, the single-alien deletion lines showed higher fructan content than <b>shallot.</b> Moreover, <b>shallot</b> could not produce fructan with degress of polymerization (DP) 12 or higher, although the single-alien deletion lines showed DP 20 or higher. The content of S-alk(en) yl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (ACSO) in the single-alien deletion lines was significantly lower than that in <b>shallot.</b> These results indicated that chromosomes from A. fistulosum might carry anonymous factors to increase the highly polymerized fructan production and inhibit the synthesis of ACSO in <b>shallot</b> bulbs.
