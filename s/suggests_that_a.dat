5|$|Evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> native pony {{existed in}} Wales before 1600 BC. The {{original}} Welsh Mountain Pony {{is thought to}} have evolved from this prehistoric Celtic pony. Welsh ponies were primarily developed in Wales, and their ancestors existed in the British Isles prior to the arrival of the Roman Empire. Bands of ponies roamed in a semi-feral state, climbing mountains, leaping ravines, and running over rough moorland terrain.|$|E

5|$|The {{most likely}} cause of {{collapse}} at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure.

5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations.

Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
5|$|Even if {{an ancient}} and {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity, humans could {{suffer from a}} loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity {{in such a way}} as to minimize unintended consequences. Michael A. G. Michaud <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like humanity, to ensure that the less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; this is known as the zoo hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 is a M-class dwarf star, {{meaning that}} it is small, emits reddish light, and has a {{relatively}} low temperature for a star. The star is 0.45 times the mass of and 0.43 times the radius of the Sun. Gliese 3634 is 0.020 times as luminous as the Sun, {{meaning that it}} radiates about 2% {{of the amount of}} energy that the Sun does. It was described as an intermediately active star in its discovery paper. Gliese 3634 lies 19.8 parsecs (approximately 64.6 light years) away from Earth, a relatively close star. Gliese 3634 b is the only planet to have been confirmed in the star's orbit, although initial analysis of the data <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> secondary body of an unknown nature also exists, with an orbit of more than 200 days and a mass approximately twice that of Neptune's.|$|E

Another configuration <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> right hand holds a trishula (trident) and another makes a varada mudra (gesture of blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a varada mudra. He may also hold a skull. In the Badami relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a parashu and the female one a lotus.|$|E
5|$|Later inhabitation of Southcote was {{discovered}} at Anslow's Cottages {{south of the}} Kennet, where excavation <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Bronze Age waterfront was made on {{a branch of the}} river. A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England—now known as English Heritage—detailed the discovery of fragments of twined basketry at Anslow's Cottages, showing that eel or fish traps were used on the river near Southcote. Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to the trap suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century. Later discoveries, made in the 1980s during gravel extraction in the area, also uncovered evidence of a landing stage or jetty on the river channel.|$|E

The focus of the report is on the latitude at which recent tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are reaching maximum intensity.

Each volume also contains {{information on the}} series' universe; detailed spaceship and planet descriptions; and character profiles. A Chinese version of the manga was published in Hong Kong by Sharp Point Press. The series has also been published in German and Italian by Planet Manga.

5|$|The Persian {{force was}} {{primarily}} based around 200 triremes. It {{is not clear}} whether there were additional transport ships. The standard complement of a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines. In the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines, and this was probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes. Furthermore, the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> trireme could probably carry a maximum of 4045 soldierstriremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight. If the Persian force at Naxos was similarly made up, then it would have contained somewhere in the region of 8,000 to 9,000 soldiers (in addition to many unarmed rowers).|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> synod, or ecclesiastical {{conference to}} discuss church affairs and rules, {{was held at}} London {{during the early years}} of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated on marriage, which he discussed with Pope Gregory III in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for clarifications on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. Nicholas Brooks, another historian, is not so sure that there was such a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.|$|E

5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in Papilio polytes is controlled by the doublesex gene.|$|E

5|$|Zigrasimecia {{is known}} for its unusual morphology, and most likely had habits no longer seen in extant species. It has a highly movable head that {{suggests}} mobility was an important factor for them (this is probably for feeding behavior). The morphology of the mandibles would have prevented nest excavation, so the rugose projections on the head may have provided assistance. There is no evidence that Cretaceous ants exhibited nesting behavior, although the queen caste in Z. tonsora <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> dealate queen was needed for creating nests. Also, Zigrasimecia and Gerontoformica ants coexisted with each other; this is evident as a recovered piece of amber showed both genera trapped inside. This means that the two ants may have shared some of their ecological niches and possibly interacted with each other through fighting.|$|E
