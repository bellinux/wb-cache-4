Undisturbed soil samples were taken from 3 different soils including <b>silty</b> <b>clay,</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> and loam, with 3 replications. The soil samples were puddled by a laboratory apparatus with different intensities.

Detailed hydropedological investigations were carried out in 2000 and a soil map of the region was produced (scale = 1 : 10000) using universal kriging. Soil investigations identified six pedosystematic units: alluvial-gley, semigley-pseudogley, eugley hypogley, humogley, eugley amphigley and drained soils. Based on permanent monitoring of piezometer groundwater (piezometer depth up to 4. 0 m) in the period from 2001 to 2006, the following major soil moistening types and subtypes of the separated soil units were determined: semigley-pseudogely, hypogley, humogley, amphigley and drained.

General Description. —Mallow ninebark, also known as ninebark, mallow-leaved ninebark, mountain ninebark, few-flowered ninebark, and shallow ninebark, is a multistemmed, deciduous shrub 1 to 2 m (rarely 3 m) in height. The stems and branches are slender {{and covered with a}} brown bark that exfoliates in papery strips on older branches. The 3 - to 5 -cm, alternate leaves are round to ovate, three to five lobed, and doubly serrate or crenate. The petioles are 1 to 2 cm long. Inflorescences are terminal, corymbose with five to 30 flowers. The hypanthium of the flowers is stellate-pubescent; twigs, petioles, and leaf blades vary from pubescent to glabrous. The flowers have five sepals and five white, rounded petals 3. 5 to 6. 5 mm long. Each produces two inflated, brown follicles united for two-thirds their length. Each fruit may contain one to several shiny, pairshaped, straw-colored seeds (Abrams 1950, Welsh and others 1987). Ecology. —Mallow ninebark grows {{on a wide variety of}} soils derived from igneous, metamorphic, and calcareous and noncalcareous sedimentary rocks.

40|$|Advisor: George L. Graef Drought is {{the most}} {{significant}} abiotic stress affecting agricultural production. Improving seed yield under water stress is an important breeding objective. Soybean cultivars that tolerate water stress could help improve and stabilize production in water-stressed environments. “Drought” needs to be defined, because water stress can vary in intensity, timing, and duration. Other factors including ambient temperature, soil texture, depth, and fertility will influence the impact of limited water on crop productivity. This research addresses the impact of water stress on soybeans adapted to the north-central US, where the majority of soils are relatively deep, fertile silt <b>loams</b> or <b>silty</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loams</b> with good water-holding capacity. We hypothesized that selection for seed yield in a high-yielding environment without water stress would concordantly generate lines that also display improved seed yield in drought environments. To test this hypothesis, nine populations of 70 lines each from the NAM soybean collection were evaluated for yield in a single, high-yield, irrigated environment at the University of Nebraska Research Center at Clay Center, NE during 2011. The seven highest-yielding lines and seven lowest-yielding lines were selected from the respective high and low tails of each population. The selected recombinant inbred lines plus the parents from nine populations were evaluated during 2012 and 2013 in irrigated and water-stress environments. The high-yield selected group performed better than the low-yield selected group for grain yield, in both irrigated and dry environments. This result indicated that differences in yield between the two groups when selected in an irrigated environment retained a consistent high versus low-yield pattern in subsequent irrigated and drought environment tests. Average genotypic correlation for seed yield in non-stress and water-stress conditions was positive and significant (0. 71 ± 0. 09), suggesting that selection for high yield in non-stress environments will result in simultaneous improvement of yields under water stress environments. On average, drought stress reduced soybean seed yield by 60. 1 %, 100 -seed weight by 12. 5 %, plant height by 30 %, lodging 64 %, and days to maturity by 8 days. While some populations showed significant effects of water treatment on seed composition, overall, seed protein and oil concentration did not change with water treatment. ...|$|R
