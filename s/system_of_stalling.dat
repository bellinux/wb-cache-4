50|$|Another {{technique}} {{that has become}} more popular recently is multithreading. In multithreading, when the processor has to fetch data from slow <b>system</b> memory, instead <b>of</b> <b>stalling</b> for the data to arrive, the processor switches to another program or program thread which is ready to execute. Though this does not speed up a particular program/thread, it increases the overall system throughput by reducing the time the CPU is idle.|$|R
40|$|In {{the aim of}} {{research}} about retreating blade dynamic stall control for helicopter performance improvement, a new experimental rig has been designed consisting in a blade section model supported by a motorized strut that can move it in pitch around its quarter chord. The design and performance of the experimental rig have been purposely conceived to reproduce the deep dynamic <b>stall</b> condition <b>of</b> a full-scale retreating rotor blade section at 75 % radius at high forward flight speed, {{in order to test}} real control <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> the dynamic <b>stall</b> phenomenon on helicopter blade sections. Several measurement techniques as, for instance, fast unsteady pressure measurements, hot wire anemometer and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), can be employed to completely characterise the time dependent flowfield. The paper describes the first series of experiments carried out on a NACA 23012 blade section to validate the rig performance and the measurements set up. The analysis of the comprehensive data set enabled to complete the description <b>of</b> the dynamic <b>stall</b> phenomenon for the NACA 23012 airfoil and can be suitable to be taken as a reference to validate CFD tools. After the validation tests, the experimental rig will enable to test real control <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> the dynamic <b>stall</b> phenomenon on helicopter blade sections...|$|R
40|$|Micro-{{recovery}}, {{or failure}} recovery at a fine granularity, is a promising approach {{to improve the}} recovery time of software for modern storage <b>systems.</b> Instead <b>of</b> <b>stalling</b> the whole <b>system</b> during failure recovery, micro-recovery can facilitate recovery by a single thread while the system continues to run. A key challenge in performing micro-recovery {{is to be able}} to perform efficient and effective state restoration while accounting for dynamic dependencies between multiple threads in a highly concurrent environment. We present Log(Lock), a practical and flexible architecture for performing state restoration without re-architecting legacy code. We formally model thread dependencies based on accesses to both shared state and resources. The Log(Lock) execution model tracks dependencies at runtime and captures the failure context through the restoration level. We develop restoration protocols based on recovery points and restoration levels that identify when micro-recovery is possible and the recovery actions that need to be performed for a given failure context. We have implemented Log(Lock) in a real enterprise storage controller. Our experimental evaluation shows that Log(Lock) -enabled micro-recovery is efficient. It imposes < 10 % overhead on normal performance and < 35 % overhead during actual recovery. However, the 35 % performance overhead observed during recovery lasts only six seconds and replaces the four seconds of downtime that would result from a system restart. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{observations on}} compressors, in particular those of Rannie and Iura, have clarified some {{features of the}} phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>stall</b> propagation. Using these observations as a guide, the process <b>of</b> <b>stall</b> in an airfoil cascade has been characterized by a static pressure loss across the cascade which increases discontinuously at the stall angle, the turning angle being affected in only a minor way. Deductions from this simple model yield the essential features <b>of</b> <b>stall</b> propagation such as dependence of the extent <b>of</b> <b>stalled</b> region upon operating conditions, the pressure loss associated with stall, and the angular velocity <b>of</b> <b>stall</b> propagation. Using two-dimensional approximation for a stationary or rotating blade row, free from interference of adjacent blade rows, extent <b>of</b> the <b>stalled</b> region, the total pressure loss and stall propagation speed are discussed in detail for a general cascade characteristic. Employing these results, the effect <b>of</b> <b>stall</b> propagation upon {{the performance of a}} single-stage axial compressor is illustrated and the mechanism of entering the regime <b>of</b> <b>stall</b> propagation is discussed. The essential points of the results seem to agree with experimental evidence...|$|R
40|$|A small {{perturbation}} analysis <b>of</b> rotating <b>stall</b> in inviscid, {{incompressible flow}} is developed from {{an analysis of}} Yeh.
