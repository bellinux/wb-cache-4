5|$|Although {{an urban}} revolt in Aleppo {{did not take}} place in the {{aftermath}} of the city's occupation by French forces, many of Aleppo's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu's rebels fighting in the rural areas west of the city. In addition to the rebels' propaganda campaign, anti-French sentiment in Aleppo was growing due to socio-economic factors. These included the disruption of trade routes between Aleppo and its countryside, the hoarding and profiteering of flour and rising unemployment that was partially a result of an influx of Armenian refugees who had fled their villages in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide. The latter led to <b>soaring</b> <b>prices</b> for bread and subsequent food riots and famine in some of the city's neighborhoods. The French authorities also declared martial law, restricting travel and speech, further frustrating the inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|Many Indian {{provinces and}} princely states imposed inter-provincial trade {{barriers}} beginning in mid-1942, preventing other provinces from buying domestic rice. One underlying cause was the anxiety and <b>soaring</b> <b>prices</b> {{that followed the}} fall of Burma, but a more direct impetus in some cases (for example, Bihar) was the trade imbalances directly caused by provincial price controls. The power to restrict inter-provincial trade had been conferred on provincial governments in November 1941 as an item under the Defence of India Act, 1939. Provincial governments began erecting trade barriers that prevented the flow of foodgrains (especially rice) and other goods between provinces. These barriers reflected a desire to see that local populations were well fed, thus also forestalling civil unrest.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, Syria's economy worsened; by mid-1984, the food crisis was severe, {{and the press}} was full of complaints. Assad's {{government}} sought a solution, arguing that food shortages could be avoided with careful economic planning. The food crisis continued through August, despite government measures. Syria lacked sugar, bread, flour, wood, iron and construction equipment; this resulted in <b>soaring</b> <b>prices,</b> long queues and rampant black marketeering. Smuggling goods from Lebanon became common. Assad's government tried to combat the smuggling, encountering difficulties due to the involvement of his brother Rifaat in the corruption. In July 1984, the government formed an effective anti-smuggling squad to control the Lebanon–Syria borders. The Defense Detachment commanded by Rifaat al-Assad {{played a leading role}} in the smuggling, importing $400,000 worth of goods a day. The anti-smuggling squad seized $3.8million in goods during its first week.|$|E

In addition to the rise in sales of photovoltaic panels, the business of wind turbines is also surging despite <b>soaring</b> <b>prices</b> on international markets because of the growing demand. To work towards a programme of sustainable development, a number of technological updates need to be made, including improvements to automobiles, the quality of energy products and {{increasing the number of}} renewable energy-producing plants. The government also needs to promote water conservation and efficiency in order to prevent further scarcity. Despite these challenges, Morocco is working to conserve and protect its environment and its efforts were recognised when its Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment won the environmental prize National Energy Globe Award in Brussels in 2007.|$|E
