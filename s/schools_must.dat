5|$|Public {{schools in}} Manitoba {{fall under the}} {{regulation}} of one of thirty-seven school divisions within the provincial education system (except for the Manitoba Band Operated Schools, which are administered by the federal government). Public schools follow a provincially mandated curriculum in either French or English. There are sixty-five funded independent schools in Manitoba, including three boarding schools. These <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> follow the Manitoban curriculum and meet other provincial requirements. There are forty-four non-funded independent schools, which {{are not required to}} meet those standards.|$|E

25|$|As {{required}} by Hong Kong law, <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> have two examinations every year: mid-year and final examination.

25|$|Charter <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> {{participate}} at no {{lower than}} the classification of the smallest {{high school in the}} district where the charter school resides; for example, a charter school within the Dallas ISD must participate in at least Class AAAA, as DISD has high schools which participate at this level.|$|E

25|$|Non-government <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> satisfy stipulated {{standards}} {{to be eligible}} to join the scheme. The standards include requirements regarding the mode of operation (unisessional), class size, teacher's qualifications and facilities etc. For example, schools need a permanent school premises, more than 70 per cent of teachers had to be degree-holders, {{and they had to}} have sufficient facilities such as computer, music and language labs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{facet of}} this {{controversy}} is {{the effectiveness of}} the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students who are struggling. Gifted Education is not mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for. Many lower-achieving districts and <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> make crisis decisions on programs that are not high priorities. As a result, gifted students at these schools are not served, or not served effectively.|$|E

25|$|The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is {{responsible}} for the policies and methods that <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. However, playschools, primary schools, and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities. The government does allow citizens to Home educate their children, however under a very strict set of demands. Students must adhere closely to the government mandated curriculum, and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate.|$|E
25|$|Maryland has a {{broad range}} of private primary and {{secondary}} schools. Many of these are affiliated with various religious sects, including parochial schools of the Catholic Church, Quaker schools, Seventh-day Adventist schools, and Jewish schools. In 2003, Maryland law was changed to allow for the creation of publicly funded charter schools, although the charter <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> be approved by their local Board of Education and are not exempt from state laws on education, including collective bargaining laws.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{has three}} levels of education: primary, {{secondary}} and higher education. The education systems are largely {{under the direction of}} the Government via the Minister for Education and Skills. Recognised primary and secondary <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> adhere to the curriculum established by the relevant authorities. Education is compulsory between the ages of six and fifteen years, and all children up to the age of eighteen must complete the first three years of secondary, including one sitting of the Junior Certificate examination.|$|E

25|$|The UIL governs {{only public}} schools and 2 private high schools. Activities for most Texas private schools are governed by {{separate}} bodies, the largest of which is TAPPS. However, private schools are allowed to join the UIL only if 1) they meet UIL's definition of a high school, 2) they are accredited by the Texas Private School Accreditation Commission, and 3) they are ineligible for membership in any league similar to UIL (such as TAPPS or the Southwest Preparatory Conference). Furthermore, private <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> compete at one classification higher than their enrollment would otherwise dictate.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 {{the school}} was criticised in the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) report for lacking 'a daily act of {{collective}} worship' and not reporting pupils' ICT progress in years 10 and 11, {{both of which are}} statutory requirements. All maintained English <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> provide daily worship that is broadly Christian, although parents can remove their children and sixth formers may decline to attend. Since the school is now an academy (not a maintained school) this requirement does not necessarily apply. The report also found that not all subject department heads have good enough monitoring systems {{to improve the quality of}} teaching and learning.|$|E
25|$|The Health / Hauora curriculum, {{including}} the sexuality education component, {{is the only}} part of the New Zealand Curriculum / Te Matauranga o Aotearoa (the former for English-medium schools, the latter for Māori-medium schools) in which state and state-integrated <b>schools</b> <b>must</b> legally consult with the school community regarding its delivery, and the consultations must occur at least once every two years. Parents can ask for their children to be removed from the sexuality education component of the health curriculum for any reason, provided they apply in writing to the school principal, and do so at least 24 hours beforehand so alternative arrangements can be made. However, this does not prevent a teacher answering sexuality education questions if a student, excluded or not, asks them.|$|E
