Trials were performed in a greenhouse using corn plants in 20 -dm³ pots. Three P rates (0, 50 and 150 mg dm- 3) were applied in the form of powder triple superphosphate and the soil was incubated for 90 days. After this period, soil samples were collected for routine chemical analysis and P content determination by the extraction methods resin, Mehlich- 1 and remaining P.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis work has been to further our {{understanding}} of the growth and removal of inclusions in gas- and induction-stirred ladles. The primary focus has been on alumina inclusions. Growth mechanisms were studied using data from fundamental mathematical models of gas- and induction-stirred ladles. The results showed the turbulence mechanism to be the most dominant in alumina inclusion growth. The dynamic growth and removal of inclusions in a gas-stirred ladle was studied using mathematical modelling. The model results showed concentration gradients of inclusions. The effect was most obvious in the steel flow past the removal sites: top <b>slag,</b> <b>ladle</b> refractory, and gas plume (bubble flotation). A new removal model was developed for large spherical caps bubbles. In order to verify the predicted concentration gradients for the size population of inclusions, three experiments were carried out in production. The sampling equipment enabled sampling at five different positions and different locations at the same time. The results showed that concentration gradients of inclusions do exist both in induction-stirred and gas-stirred ladles. A theoretical analysis showed that the drag force on the inclusions to be the dominating force and that therefore inclusions follow the fluid flow. The cluster behaviour of alumina inclusions were examined on steel samples taken in an industrial-scale deoxidation experiment in a ladle. The samples were examined by microscope and the results used to study cluster growth. It was found that there was rapid cluster growth due to collision during stirring and {{that at the end of}} the deoxidation experiment a majority of the small inclusions were bound in clusters. The cluster growth data determined using the microscopic results were compared with predicted cluster-growth data.

More specifically, two plant trial campaigns covering in total 83 heats, whereof 47 with ladle-slag additions and 36 without ladle-slag additions, were performed.  Slag and steel sampling of the process were performed at tapping as well as during blowing at 15, 35, and 65 % of the total blowing time. During the first campaign, <b>ladle</b> <b>slag</b> was added through the chute and lime reductions were made manually to correct for the ladle-slag addition.  In the second campaign, a development of the approach was made to suite a normal production practice. More specifically, the <b>ladle</b> <b>slag</b> was added through the weight-hopper system and implemented in the process-control system. In this way, the lime additions were reduced automatically by approximately 260 kg per heat. Moreover, the heat balance was compensated with a reduction in the iron-ore consumption.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{some aspects of}} slags related to {{secondary}} metallurgy in the steelmaking process. More specifically the focus is given to sulfur and nitrogen in <b>ladle</b> <b>slags.</b> Even though slags have been fairly well-researched in the past, the available data for these elements in typical <b>ladle</b> <b>slag</b> compositions is rather scarce. In some cases the available data is in discordance. There are also inconsistencies between the literature data and what is commonly observed in the industrial processes. Sulfide capacities were measured at steelmaking temperatures, 1823 – 1873 K, in <b>ladle</b> <b>slags.</b> The data {{was found to be}} in reasonable agreement with the industrial process norms. The sulfide capacity was found to increase with the basic oxides CaO and MgO; and decrease with the acidic components Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2. The sulfide capacity was also found to increase with temperature. The dependence of sulfide capacity on the oxygen partial pressure, for slags containing multivalent elements, was investigated experimentally at 1873 K with a slag containing vanadium oxide. A strong dependence of oxygen partial pressure was observed. The sulfide capacity increase by more than two orders of magnitude when the oxygen partial pressure was increased from 4. 6 × 10 - 16 atm to 9. 7 × 10 - 10 atm. The nitrogen solubility and the effect of carbon was investigated in typical <b>ladle</b> <b>slags</b> and the CaO–MgO–SiO 2 system at 1873 K. Carbon increases the nitrogen solubility substantially. In the absence of carbon, the nitrogen solubility is extremely low. Low concentrations of cyanide was detected in the carbon saturated slag. This was much lower than the total nitrogen content and formation of cyanide cannot explain the large increase. The possibility of removing sulfur with oxidation from used <b>ladle</b> <b>slag</b> was investigated experimentally at 1373 – 1673 K.

40|$|The Swedish {{steelmaking}} industry produces {{large amounts}} of by-products. In 2006, {{the total amount of}} slag produced reached approximately 1 375 000 metric tons, of which 30 % was deposited. Due to its strength, durability and chemistry, steel slag is of interest in the field of construction due to it's similarities with ordinary ballast stone. However, some steel slags face an array of quality concerns that might hinder their use. These concerns generally involve the following physical and chemical properties: Volume expansion, Disintegration, Leaching of metals By controlling and modifying process parameters during slag handling in liquid state, the physical properties of steel slags can be adequately modified to obtain a high-quality product for external application. The present work was undertaken as a research project within the Minerals and Metals Recycling Research Centre, MiMeR. The major objectives of this work have been to investigate how different cooling methods and cooling rates influence the properties of slag products. Four types of steel <b>slags,</b> <b>Ladle</b> <b>slag,</b> BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace) slag and two different EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) slags, were characterized and modified by semi-rapid cooling in crucibles and rapid cooling by water granulation. Experiments were conducted in laboratory scale using an induction furnace. Analysis techniques used in this investigation include: thermodynamic calculations using FactSageTM, X-ray diffraction analyses (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a standard leaching test (prEN 12457 - 2 / 3). The experimental results show that disintegrating <b>ladle</b> <b>slag</b> is volume stabilized by water granulation resulting in a product consisting of 98 % glass. However EAF slag 1, EAF slag 2 and the BOF slag formed only 17 %, 1 % and 1 % glass, respectively. The leaching tests showed that water granulation did not prevent leaching of minor elements from the modified slags. The solubility of chromium, molybdenum and vanadium varied in the different modifications, probably due to their presence in different minerals. Variations in crystal size as well as phase composition and distribution were observed in the different materials as a result of different cooling methods. The magnesium content of the wustite-type solid solution (Fe,Mg,Mn) O in BOF slag increased when rapid cooling was used. The reactivity factor, á, was calculated for the BOF and EAF slag 1. A majority of the elements of interests in the slags became more reactive when cooled rapidly. The reactivity for silica in BOF and EAF slag 1 was increased by ~ 4700 % and ~ 1200 %, respectively, and for chromium by ~ 5300 % and ~ 1500 %. Godkänd; 2007; 20071121 (ysko...|$|R

Foaming is {{an important}} phenomenon in steelmaking, but limited information is available on the effect of slag composition on foaming. Optical basicity values, for different slags, were calculated from the chemical composition – following the approach of Duffy and co-workers. The calculated values were then applied to follow the trends in foaming, bath smelting and <b>ladle</b> <b>slags.</b> The results demonstrate the potential use of optical basicity in this area, but the trends could be investigated further with respect to structure and the ionic concentrations...|$|R

The <b>slag</b> in the <b>ladle</b> of a <b>slag</b> transporter is measured {{at a distance of}} several meters during a short stop of the transporter. The slag surface with temperatures from ≈ 600 to ≈ 1400 °C consists of liquid slag and solidified slag parts. Automatic measurements at varying filling levels of the ladle are realized, and the duration amounts to 2 min including data transmission to the host computer. Analytical results of the major components such as CaO, Fe, SiO 2, MgO, Mn, and Al 2 O 3 are compared with reference values from the steel works laboratory for solid pressed slag samples as well as for samples from the liquid slag. Stable 24 / 7 operation during the first three-month test run was achieved...|$|R
