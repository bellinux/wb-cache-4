40|$|One {{of the key}} {{problems}} faced by traffic management operators of large urban traffic networks {{is the lack of}} sufficient data to compute performance indicators. These indicators, such as travel time, queue length, loss hours, total time spent, are useful for both offline evaluation purposes, as well as online traffic control applications. In the latter case, such data is particularly of use in coordination algorithms that require information on the number of vehicles present or queuing in certain areas. This information in turn is used for example to assess the amount of buffer space available to temporarily store or reroute vehicles from more densely used parts of the network. Computing the amount of vehicles present or queuing in a certain area requires, of course, counting the number of vehicles that enter or exit that area. In this extended abstract we show how through fusing vehicle counts and travel times (measured by any means available), the well-known drift-error can be reduced to virtually zero. In the complete paper we show how this algorithm fits in a wider suite of data fusion tools to compute urban traffic performance indicators on the basis <b>of</b> multiple <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>dat...</b>|$|R

40|$|Judging the {{significance}} and reproducibility of quantitative research requires {{a good understanding}} of relevant uncertainties, but it is often unclear how well these have been evaluated and what they imply. Reported scientific uncertainties were studied by analysing 41000 measurements of 3200 quantities from medicine, nuclear and particle physics, and interlaboratory comparisons ranging from chemistry to toxicology. Outliers are common, with 5 σ disagreements up to five orders of magnitude more frequent than naively expected. Uncertainty-normalized differences between multiple measurements of the same quantity are consistent with heavy-tailed Student-t distributions that are often almost Cauchy, far from a Gaussian Normal bell curve. Medical research uncertainties are generally as well evaluated as those in physics, but physics uncertainty improves more rapidly, making feasible simple significance criteria such as the 5 σ discovery convention in particle physics. Contributions to measurement uncertainty from mistakes and unknown problems are not completely unpredictable. Such errors appear to have power-law distributions consistent with how designed complex systems fail, and how unknown systematic errors are constrained by researchers. This better understanding may help improve analysis and meta-analysis of data, and help scientists and the public have more realistic expectations of what scientific results imply.

The sera were obtained from non-tuberculosis-infected individuals (282 serum samples) and tuberculosis patients (74 serum samples). Non-tuberculosis-infected individuals were healthy people (120 serum samples; positive purified-protein-derivative skin test, 60 patients; negative purified-protein-derivative skin test, 60 patients) patients with nontuberculosis lung disease (59 serum samples), contacts of sputum-smear-positive tuberculosis patients (57 serum samples), and human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with nontuberculosis lung disease (46 serum samples). Of the 74 patients with tuberculosis, 14 were human immunodeficiency virus infected. The sensitivity of the method using DATT was 44. 5 %, and that with DATF was 48. 6 %.

40|$|Abstract. Semantic Web {{technologies}} {{are becoming more}} interleaved with geospatial databases, which should lead to an easier integration and querying of spatial data. This is fostered by a growing amount of publicly available geospatial data like OpenStreetMap. However, the integration can lead to geographic inconsistencies when combining multiple knowledge bases. Having the integration in place, users might not just issue a points-of-interest search, but rather {{might be interested in}} regions with specific attributes assigned to them. Though, having large amounts of spatial data available, standard databases and reasoners do not provide the means for (quantitative) spatial queries, or struggle to answer them efficiently. We seek to combine spatial reasoning, (nonmonotonic) logic programming, and ontologies for integrating geospatial databases with Semantic Web technologies. The focus of our investigation will be on a modular design, on efficient processing of large amounts of spatial data, and on enabling default reasoning. We propose a two-tier design related to HEX-programs, which should lead to a plausible trade-off between modularity and efficiency. Furthermore, we consider suitable geo-ontologies to semantically annotate and link different sources. Finally, the findings should lead to a proof-of-concept implementation, which will be tested for efficiency and modularity in artificial and real-world use cases. 1 Background and Problem Statement Fostered by a popular demand for location-aware search applications, linking and querying spatial data has become an active research field.

40|$|Dopamine {{levels in}} the brain are {{controlled}} by the plasma membrane dopamine transporter (<b>DAT).</b> The amount <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> at the cell surface {{is determined by the}} relative rates of its internalization and recycling. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) leads to acceleration <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> endocytosis. We have recently demonstrated that PKC activation also results in ubiquitylation <b>of</b> <b>DAT.</b> To directly address the role <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> ubiquitylation, lysine residues in DAT were mutated. Mutations of each lysine individually did not affect ubiquitylation and endocytosis <b>of</b> <b>DAT.</b> By contrast, ubiquitylation of mutants carrying multiple lysine substitutions was reduced in cells treated with phorbol ester to the levels detected in nonstimulated cells. Altogether, mutagenesis data suggested that Lys 19, Lys 27, and Lys 35 clustered in the DAT aminoterminus are the major ubiquitin-conjugation sites. The data are consistent with the model whereby at any given time only one of the lysines in DAT is conjugated with a short ubiquitin chain. Importantly, cell surface biotinylation, immunofluorescence and down-regulation experiments revealed that PKC-dependent internalization of multilysine mutants was essentially abolished. These data provide the first evidence that the ubiquitin moieties conjugated to DAT may serve as a molecular interface of the transporter interaction with the endocytic machinery...|$|R
40|$|Protein kinase C (PKC) is an {{important}} enzyme that helps govern cell metabolism and growth. The enzyme is physiologically activated when an (S) -diglyceride binds to its own regulatory domain. The saturable binding site of the regulatory domain can also be bound by any {{of a group of}} structurally diverse tumor promoters, including debromoaplysiatoxins (DATs), phorbol esters, ingenols, teleocidins, and bryostatins. The question of how the same binding site can be the target of these structurally diverse molecules is of considerable importance and is addressed in this article. The relatively rigid structure <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> {{and the fact that it}} possesses a diglyceride moiety renders it an ideal starting template. Structure-activity studies with PKC reveal that the C 29 but not the C 30 stereocenter <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> is critical for activity. Furthermore, 3 -deoxy-DAT and DAT are equipotent as PKC activators, hence the C 3 hydroxyl group <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> is not critical for activity. Straightforward structural considerations show that the C 30 hydroxyl group <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> matches the C 3 hydroxyl group of diglyceride, the C 29 stereocenter <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> matches the C 2 stereocenter of (S) -diglyceride, and the C 1 ester moiety <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> matches the C 2 ester moiety of diglyceride. Based on these studies and on published structure-activity observations on other tumor promoters, a structural hypothesis is developed to account for the chemical mechanism of tumor promoter action.

40|$|There {{are three}} known high-affinity targets for cocaine: the {{dopamine}} transporter (DAT), the serotonin transporter (SERT), and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Decades of studies support the dopamine (DA) {{hypothesis that the}} blockade <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> and the subsequent increase in extracellular DA primarily mediate cocaine reward and reinforcement. Contrary to expectations, DAT knockout (DAT-KO) mice and SERT or NET knockout mice still self-administer cocaine and/or display conditioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine, {{which led to the}} reevaluation of the DA hypothesis and the proposal of redundant reward pathways. To study the role <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> in cocaine reward, we have generated a knockin mouse line carrying a functional DAT that is insensitive to cocaine.

In striatal synaptosomes and transfected cells, DAT was in cholesterol-rich membrane fractions after mild detergent extraction. After increasing the membrane cholesterol content by treatment of water-soluble cholesterol (cholesterol mixed with methyl-β-cyclodextrin), we observed an increase in DAT binding Bmax values for cocaine analogs [3 H]WIN 35428 and [125 I]RTI- 55, but similar levels <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> proteins on the cell surface were shown by surface biotinylation assays. Membrane cholesterol addition also markedly enhanced the accessibility of cysteine sulfhydryl moieties in DAT as probed by a membrane-impermeable maleimide-biotin conjugate.

The mechanisms for the effects of RSV in brain are not fully understood, but RSV may affect the expression of various gene products. RSV is structurally related to the synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol so the effects of RSV may be gender-specific. Here we studied the role of RSV in the regulation <b>of</b> dopamine transporter (<b>DAT)</b> in the striatum using male and female mice. The basic levels <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> in the striatum showed no sex difference, but the levels increased significantly by RSV (20 mg/kg i. p.) in female but not in male mice.

Similar data was also obtained in culture using human MESC 2. 10 and mouse SN 4741 dopaminergic cells after treatment with RSV. Data further showed that RSV specifically induced gene transcription <b>of</b> <b>DAT</b> in the dopaminergic cells.

ResultsDAT was positive in 70 / 2695 (2. 59 %) cases. In 64 / 70 (91. 43 %) cases, DAT positivity was attributed to ABO incompatibility. There were 50 / 218 (22. 93 %) DAT (+) cases in the A/O group and 13 / 97 (13. 40 %) cases in the B/O group (p =  0. 0664). Two DAT (+) cases were attributed to maternal alloimmunization (anti-Fya and anti-JKb, respectively), and one to maternal IgG autoantibodies that developed after methyldopa treatment. Among the 70 DAT (+) cases, 30 (42. 86 %) cases required phototherapy with no difference between the A/O and B/O groups.

40|$|Dolphin-Assisted Therapy (DAT) is a {{field of}} therapies that have been {{developed}} to enable humans with disabilities to achieve improved lives.
