Herbert made his only pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> the same lap {{although he}} stalled and rejoined in twelfth place. Gené, Mazzacane, Ralf Schumacher and Verstappen made pit stops between laps 28 and 29. Villeneuve tried to retake fourth position from Häkkinen on the 30th lap but overshot the manoeuvre. Häkkinen made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 35, emerging behind Villeneuve and Irvine. Coulthard managed to close to within 2 seconds of Michael Schumacher {{when he made his}} second pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 38. Michael Schumacher made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> the following lap and remained in the lead. Barrichello became the leader for one lap and made his pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 41. This allowed Michael Schumacher to reclaim the first position. By the start of lap 45, Coulthard had closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher was called into his garage by his team to retire on the 45th lap. Zonta pulled off the race track with an blown engine two laps later.|$|E

5|$|On lap 28, Kimi Räikkönen was {{the first}} of the top runners to pit, coming out in fourth, but spun at the hairpin in a repeat of an {{incident}} from 2014. The incident cost him twelve seconds and allowed Valtteri Bottas to stay ahead of him in third after he made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 30. Hamilton made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> the same lap with Rosberg following suit two laps later, both without incident. At this point, Rosberg was about 1.5 seconds behind his teammate. Another four laps later, Sebastian Vettel came in for his second and final stop of the race. Massa came in for his only <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 38, putting on the super-soft tyres, and dropped from sixth to ninth. Räikkönen made a pit stop again on lap 42, staying in fourth position ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean.|$|E

5|$|Alesi, {{the first}} front-runner {{to make a}} {{scheduled}} pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 18, rejoined in tenth. During the next two laps Salo passed Irvine for twelfth, whilst Barrichello made a pit stop from sixth position and came out in eleventh. By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and {{during the next two}} laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made a pit stop from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit boards) to speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a pit <b>stop,</b> <b>on</b> lap 33.|$|E

5|$|Michael Schumacher, the {{eventual}} Drivers' Champion, led the Championship {{going into the}} race and started from fourth position alongside Barrichello. At the first corner BAR's Ricardo Zonta ran into the rear of Michael Schumacher. The incident forced the German to retire and caused a safety car deployment. After the safety car pulled in after one lap Häkkinen and Coulthard extended a comfortable lead {{over the rest of}} the field. When Häkkinen made his pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 38, he rejoined behind Coulthard, but ahead of Barrichello. Coulthard made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 41, allowing Häkkinen back into the lead which he held to clinch his second victory of the 2000 season.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> the 32nd lap.|$|E

5|$|Montoya {{maintained}} his start-line advantage and led {{until he was}} passed by Barrichello on the ninth lap. Barrichello pulled away from Montoya and held the lead until his one and only pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 19 which proved problematic because of a faulty refuelling rig. Montoya was utilising a one-stop strategy and made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 29, which allowed his teammate Ralf Schumacher to lead for six laps. Barrichello regained the lead on lap 36, until Montoya took over the position on lap 42 when Barrichello made a pit stop for the second time. Barrichello started to reduce the gap between himself and Montoya {{but was unable to}} challenge the Williams driver who won his first Formula One victory.|$|E

Michael Schumacher made his second pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 40, and dropped behind Ralf Schumacher. Montoya moved back into the lead position when Barrichello made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 41 and rejoined right behind Ralf Schumacher. At the completion of lap 42, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the order was Montoya, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, de la Rosa, Villeneuve, Räikkönen, Alesi, Panis, Fisichella, Heidfeld, Bernoldi, Enge, Alonso and Yoong. Further down the field, Enge passed Bernoldi for twelfth on lap 43. Barrichello ran in the slipstream of Ralf Schumacher down the start/finish straight and Schumacher cut the Variante Goodyear chicane after attempting to defend his position, allowing Barrichello to take over second on lap 47. Yoong retired from the race on the same lap after he spun his car into a gravel trap. Bernoldi became the final retirement of the race when his car developed a crankshaft sensor problem on the same lap.|$|E

Häkkinen regained the lead after Coulthard made his pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 32, who came out in third position. Fisichella retired with further brake problems on lap 32. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:20.028 on lap 33, {{as he continued to}} stretch his lead over Michael Schumacher. Coulthard, who was on fresh tyres, gradually began to close the gap to Michael Schumacher by lap 39. Michael Schumacher increased the gap when Coulthard lost two seconds; the result of being held up by Genè who was later issued a 10-second stop-go penalty. Barrichello pitted for the second time on lap 47. Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher made their pit stops on lap 50, one lap ahead of Coulthard.|$|E
5|$|Salo and Alesi {{became the}} first drivers to make {{scheduled}} pit stops on lap 16. Coulthard made a pit stop one lap later to remove the debris from his radiator and rejoined in sixth. Button became the race's fifth retirement because of an engine failure on lap 19. Michael Schumacher continued to set consecutive fastest laps, as he built an 8.8-second gap to Barrichello by his first pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 24. Barrichello took over the lead for one lap before his pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> the following lap handing it back to Michael Schumacher. By the end of lap 26, all of the leading drivers on two-stop strategies had taken their pit stops. The race order was Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Herbert, Verstappen, Villeneuve, Häkkinen, Wurz, Irvine, Zonta, Fisichella, Salo, Gené, Ralf Schumacher, Mazzacane, Alesi and Trulli.|$|E

The gap between Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher fell by one second after the McLaren driver {{encountered}} lapped traffic on lap 30. Ralf Schumacher lost sixth position to teammate Button after making a mistake on the same lap, while Frentzen pulled off the track at the entry of First Curve to retire from a hydraulic pump issue which caused his gearbox to fail. Michael Schumacher closed the gap to Häkkinen by 0.7 seconds by lap 31, although he made minor contact with Zonta two laps later. Further down the order, Heidfeld overtook Trulli for 13th position on lap 34. The second round of pit stops began on the same lap when Irvine made a pit stop. Häkkinen made his second <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap 37, and {{came out of the}} pit lane 25.8 seconds behind rival Michael Schumacher but ahead of Coulthard. Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull away from Häkkinen. Coulthard, Barrichello and Button remained in third, fourth and fifth positions respectively, during their second stops on lap 38 and 39. Wurz went into retirement when he spun sideways near the entry of the pit lane on lap 40. Michael Schumacher took his final pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> the same lap, and emerged 4.1 seconds in front of Häkkinen.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{began to}} pull away {{from the rest of the}} field. Trulli made a pit stop for a {{replacement}} nose cone at the start of the second lap after another car made contact with the rear end of his car and his front wing was removed. Webber battled Hülkenberg for eighth position but was unable to overtake the latter. Trulli made a second pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> the fifth lap to allow his mechanics to rectify a problem with his car's gearbox and turned off his engine to allow for repairs to occur. Vettel set a fastest lap of the race on lap five, a 1:43.055, and was three seconds ahead of Hamilton, who in turn was being caught by Alonso. It was reported by Red Bull on the following lap that eighth-placed Webber had no mechanical issues. Webber made an early pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> lap seven for the medium compound tyres but his crew had a minor problem fitting his left-front wheel which meant he was stationary for 7.9 seconds, and rejoined in 18th position. Rosberg made a similar <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> the next lap but he overshot his pit stall and rejoined in 19th place.|$|E
