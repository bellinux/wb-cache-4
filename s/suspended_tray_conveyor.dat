30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} and reliability of the mechanized transplanting, a vegetable seedling automatic conveying system was designed. The functional execution component of the system consists of a tank-wheel storage seedling mechanism, a seedling <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor,</b> and a hanging cup circulating conveying mechanism. Combined with the communication technology between host computer and programmable logic controller (PLC), the user interface software of automatic conveying system for potted vegetable was developed by using Visual Studio to control and monitor the transmission progress. The PVDF pressure sensor was used to detect the pressure change of the seedling storage disk to obtain the information of the loading seedling tray. The limit switch and stroke switch were combined to obtain the information of the push rod and feed plate. The timing of each component {{is controlled by the}} PLC controller combined with the feedback information of each sensor. The test results show the effect of taking an individual seedling is excellent, the error rate of the pushing mechanism is about 2.08 %, and the success rate was 97.91 %.|$|R

However, such systems can be expensive and have a rigid structure so cannot be folded and easily stored when not in use. In general, plastic trays are mostly used for temporary storage of scallops and for transportation of spat.|$|R
30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable seedling tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the seedling tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the seedling tray is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the seedling tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the seedling <b>tray</b> enters the <b>conveyor</b> belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted vegetable seedling is taken out from the seedling tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted vegetable seedling in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the design of}} novel two-phase fingers to passively reorient objects while picking them up. Two-phase refers {{to a change in}} the finger-object contact geometry, from a free spinning point contact to a firm multipoint contact, as the gripping force increases. We exploit the two phases to passively reorient prismatic objects from a horizontal resting pose to an upright secure grasp. This problem is particularly relevant to industrial assembly applications where parts often are presented lying on <b>trays</b> or <b>conveyor</b> belts and need to be assembled vertically. Each two-phase finger is composed of a small hard contact point attached to an elastic strip mounted over a V-groove cavity. When grasped between two parallel fingers with low gripping force, the object pivots about the axis between the contact points on the strips, and aligns upright with gravity. A subsequent increase in the gripping force makes the elastic strips recede into the cavities letting the part seat in the V-grooves to secure the grasp. The design is compatible with any type of parallel-jaw gripper, and can be reconfigured to specific objects by changing the geometry of the cavity. The two-phase gripper provides robots with the capability to accurately position and manipulate parts, reducing the need for dedicated part feeders or time-demanding regrasp procedures.

30|$|The {{loading and}} {{unloading}} detection system mainly detects the position change of the seedling plate from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling plate conveyor belt and obtains the position signal as the action control signal of {{loading and unloading}}. The system includes PVDF pressure sensor, travel switch, limit sensor, and a single lamp. The PVDF pressure sensor is arranged {{in the middle of}} the slot wheel-type seedling storage tray and is in the same vertical plane with the push rod mechanism, which is used to detect whether the seedling storage tray is empty or not. It also lights the single lamp and instructs the start of the sprocket drive motor. The stroke switch mainly detects the displacement of the sprocket drive of the seedling storage tray and determines whether the seedling storage tray reaches the feeding position. Its signal is used to instruct the push rod mechanism to push the seedling <b>tray</b> to the <b>conveyor</b> belt. The limit sensor is installed at the starting position of the conveyor belt, and its signal is used to control the reset action of the pushing mechanism.|$|R
30|$|The {{original}} RIL {{population was}} derived from a cross of IR 29 with “Pokkali B” made at IRRI in 1992 (IR 66946). Subsequently, seeds of the Pokkali parent used in the cross were deposited in the IRRI Genebank in 2003 (IRGC 108921). The original population consisted of 276 F 8 RILs (Gregorio 1997), and a subset of 140 lines was selected for the current study. The population was evaluated for seedling stage salinity tolerance using a hydroponic system under controlled conditions of 29 / 21 °C day/night temperature, natural sunlight and 70 % RH in the IRRI phytotron in April 2006 (Experiment 1) and November 2006 (Experiment 2). Pre-germinated seeds were sown in holes on styrofoam floats with a net bottom <b>suspended</b> on <b>trays</b> filled with Yoshida nutrient solution (Yoshida et al. 1976). Three replications were used for each experiment, with nine individual plants per line evaluated for each replication. For Experiment 1, salt stress was imposed 14  days after germination by adding NaCl to an EC of 12  dS m− 1 in Yoshida nutrient solution until final scoring. For Experiment 2, 5 -day-old seedlings were salinized to EC 6  dS m− 1 for 5  days, then EC 12  dS m− 1 for 5  days, followed by EC of 18  dS m− 1 until the final scoring. IR 29 (sensitive) and FL 478 (highly tolerant) were used as checks. The pH of the nutrient solution was adjusted daily to 5.0, and the culture solutions were replaced weekly. Entries were scored based on visual symptoms using IRRI’s SES for rice, with ratings from 1 (highly tolerant) to 9 (highly sensitive; IRRI 1996). In addition, Na+ and K+ concentrations in leaves and roots, seedling height and chlorophyll content in leaves were assessed.|$|R

5000|$|Sea-water {{contains}} around 3.5 {{per cent}} solids on average, 2.7 per cent being salt, with 96.5ccs of sea-water {{having to be}} evaporated {{in order to obtain}} 2.7 g of salt. This would have been done by transferring water from the tanks to large rectangular <b>trays</b> <b>suspended</b> over fires that would have evaporated off the water. For the first batch of water the tray would have been filled before the fire was lit, {{to reduce the risk of}} cracking, after which water would have been constantly added from the tanks whilst salt crystals would have been constantly ladled out. Lime and gypsum hard-scale would form first, as pan-scale at the base of the trays. Then, as the salt content in the trays rose from 2.7 per cent to 28 it would start to form crystals in the boiling water (meaning that 90ccs out of an original 100ccs of water would have needed to evaporate before salt crystals form). Removing crystals before all of the water had evaporated from the tray was the intention, as it meant that impurities would have been left in the tray and the process could be continued all day without having to close the evaporation process down whilst salt was collected. In theory the tray vessel could have been topped up with water roughly one hundred times before the concentration of the bittern impurities and pan-scale left behind became too high.

40|$|Chiloglanis pretoriae is a rock catlet, {{indigenous}} to southern Africa. The {{aim of the}} study was to develop a technique to culture C. pretoriae as an alternative to harvesting and selling wild caught fish on the international aquarium trade. As nothing was known about the culture of African rock catlets an investigation into the biology and ecology of the species was necessary to develop the culture protocol. Chiloglanis pretoriae inhabits fast flowing rapids (current speeds over 0. 6 metres per second). It is a serial interstitial gravel spawner, that spawns during the summer months. Chiloglanis pretoriae is a carnivorous fish species, feeding on aquatic insects. The natural growth rate is relatively fast in the first two years where after it levels off. Sexual maturity (50 %) is attained within the first year (44 mm total length). From the four cell stage, embryos took seven days to hatch, 16 days to first feeding and 75 days to reach the juvenile phase. The free embryos were well developed and readily accepted artificial feed at first feeding. The fish spawned readily, without hormone induction, in a continuous raceway. spawning in the 801 retangular glass aquaria was irregular. The substrate within the raceway consisted of gravel and large rocks. The current was maintained at 0. 6 m/sec, temperature at 26 ± 0. 6 °C, dissolved oxygen concentrations at 7. 1 ± 0. 3 mg/l, pH at 6. 9 ± 0. 2 and photoperiod at 16 L: 8 D. Conductivity was monitored and remained within the acceptable range of C. pretoriae (84 ± 10 uS/m). The optimum broodstock density for maximum egg production was found to be 20 fish per 350 l raceway at a sex ratio of 1 : 1. Larval survival rates were highest when fertilised eggs were artificially incubated in gauze <b>trays</b> <b>suspended</b> in well aerated glass tanks. Oxheart was found to satisfy the dietary requirements of adult c. pretoriae. In addition, Daphnia were provided, when available, to supply a "live food" element. The larvae were successfully reared on Tetra Larval Food while juveniles readily accepted oxheart. Chiloglanis pretoriae was successfully reared from egg to market size (40 mm total length) in 98 days. ...|$|R
