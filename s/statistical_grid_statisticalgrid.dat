40|$|International audienceAs low target {{strength}} objects can {{be detected}} by {{the new generation of}} mine hunting sonar systems, more and more non mine like objects are passed on to the classification process. In the past, the mine hunting performance was mainly driven by the performance of the mine detector. With this improved detection capability, the mine hunting system performance is now driven by classification. The classification decision process, based on sonar images including shadows and echoes features, corresponds to the discrimination between MILCO (MIne Like Contact) and NON MILCO. This paper describes the operational incidence of a new theoretical approach used for shadow and image based classification performance evaluation. This approach is named DMC for Delta-Mask based Classification as it assumes the knowledge of specific objects images characteristics, represented with a specific <b>statistical</b> <b>grid</b> named the Delta-Mask. This theory leads to the computation of COC (Classification Operational Characteristics) curves, which give the probability of classification (Pc) and the probability of false classification (Pfc) as functions of sonar characteristics and operational conditions.

40|$|A {{desirable}} {{feature of}} bathymetric sonar systems is {{the production of}} statistically independent soundings allowing a system to achieve its full capability in resolution and object detection. Moreover gridding algorithms such as the Combined Uncertainty Bathymetric Estimator (CUBE) rely on the statistical independence of soundings to properly estimate depth and discriminate outliers. Common methods of filtering to mitigate uncertainty in the signal processing of both multibeam and phase-differencing sidescan systems (curve fitting in zero-crossing detections and differential phase filtering respectively) can produce correlated soundings. Here we propose an alternative method for the generation of soundings from differential phase measurements made by either sonar type to produce statistically independent soundings. The method extracts individual, non-overlapping and unfiltered, phase-difference measurements (from either sonar type) converting these to sonar-relative receive angle, estimates their uncertainty, fixes the desired depth uncertainty level and combines these individual measurements into an uncertainty-weighted mean to achieve the desired depth uncertainty, and no more. When the {{signal to noise ratio}} is sufficiently high such that the desired depth uncertainty is achieved with an individual measurement, bathymetric estimates are produced at the sonar’s full resolution capability. When multiple measurements are required, the filtering automatically adjusts to maintain the desired uncertainty level, degrading the resolution only as necessary. Because no two measurements contribute to a single reported sounding, the resulting estimated soundings are statistically independent and therefore better resolve adjacent objects, increase object detectability and are more suitable for <b>statistical</b> <b>gridding</b> methodologies...|$|R

We use the Helsinki metropolitan area (Finland) as our case study region to demonstrate the effects of temporality and modality on the results. Methods Spatial analyses were carried out on 250  m <b>statistical</b> <b>grid</b> squares. We measured travel times between the home location of inhabitants and open grocery stores providing healthy food at 5  p. m., 10  p. m., and 1 a. m. using public transportation and private cars. We applied the so-called door-to-door approach for the travel time measurements to obtain more realistic and comparable results between travel modes. The analyses are based on open access data and publicly available open-source tools, thus similar analyses can be conducted in urban regions worldwide. Results Our results show that both time and mode of transport have a prominent impact {{on the outcome of}} the analyses; thus, understanding the realities of accessibility in a city may be very different according to the setting of the analysis used. In terms of travel time, there is clear variation in the results at different times of the day. In terms of travel mode, our results show that when analyzed in a comparable manner, public transport can be an even faster mode than a private car to access healthy food, especially in central areas of the city where the service network is dense and public transportation system is effective. Conclusions This study demonstrates that time and transport modes are essential components when modeling health-related accessibility in urban environments. Neglecting them from spatial analyses may lead to overly simplified or even erroneous images of the realities of accessibility.

40|$|Shale is {{a common}} type of {{sedimentary}} rock formed by clay particles and silt inclusions, and, in some cases, organic matter. Typically, shale formations serve as geological caps for hydrocarbon reservoirs. More recently, various shale formations {{have been identified as}} prolific sources of oil and natural gas and as host lithologies for the disposal of CO 2 and nuclear waste. Despite its abundance, the characterization of shale rocks remains a challenging task due to their complex chemistry, heterogeneous microstructure, and multiscale mechanical behaviors. This thesis aims at establishing the link between the composition and mechanics of shale materials at grain scales. A comprehensive experimental program forms the basis for the characterization of the chemical composition and mechanical properties of shale at micrometer and sub-micrometer length scales. The chemical assessment was conducted through a novel experimental design involving grids of wave dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) spot analyses and statistical clustering of the chemical data generated by the experiments. This so-called <b>statistical</b> <b>grid</b> WDS technique was coupled with grid nanoindentation experiments as a means to assess the nanochemomechanics of shale rocks. The similar microvolumes probed by both methods ensure a direct relation between the local chemistry and mechanics response of shale materials. The results of this investigation showed that the grid WDS technique provides quantitative means to determine the chemistries of silt-size inclusions (mainly quartz and feldspars) and the clay matrix. The mineralogy assessments obtained by grid WDS analysis were validated through comparisons with results from X-ray image analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments. The direct coupling of the grid WDS and indentation techniques revealed that the porous clay phase, previously inferred from the mechanistic interpretation of indentation experiments, corresponds to the response of clay minerals. The coupling technique also showed that clay minerals located nearby silt inclusions exhibit enhanced mechanical properties due to a composite action sensed by nanoindentation. The new understanding developed in this thesis provides valuable insight into the chemomechanics of shale at nano and microscales. This coupled assessment represents valuable information for the development of predictive models for shale materials which consider the intricate links of composition, microstructure, and mechanical performance. by Amer Deirieh.

Using actual data from two real-world power <b>grids,</b> <b>statistical</b> analyses are performed to extract some useful statistics on transformers and transmission lines electrical parameters including per unit reactance, MVA rating, and their X/R ratio. It is found that conversion of per unit reactance calculated on system common base to transformer own power base will significantly stabilize its range and remove the correlation between per unit X and MVA rating. This is fairly consistent for transformers with different voltage levels and sizes and can be utilized as a strong validation metric for synthetic models. It is found that transmission lines exhibit different statistical properties than transformers with different distribution and range for the parameters. In addition, statistical analysis shows that the empirical PDF of transmission network electrical parameters can be approximated with mathematical distribution functions which would help appropriately characterize them in synthetic power networks.

All three methods of application performed similarly for a range of rainfall characteristics, with directly downscaled catchment average rainfall producing a relatively better result for extreme daily rainfall indices. However, hydrological simulation indicated that the direct downscaling of catchment average rainfall did not have any advantages over the other two downscaling application methods in terms of the runoff statistics evaluated. In addition, all three methods of downscaling application could simulate the spatial correlation of daily and annual runoff across the nine focus catchments investigated. The advantages and limitations of applying statistical downscaling to the assessment of hydrological response to climate change are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{discharge}} {{observations are}} lacking for most rivers globally. Discharge {{can be estimated}} from remotely sensed floodplain and channel inundation area, but there is currently no method that can be automatically extended to many rivers. We examined whether automated monitoring is feasible by statistically relating inundation estimates from moderate to coarse (> 0. 058) resolution remote sensing to monthly station discharge records. Inundation extents were derived from optical MODIS data and passive microwave sensors, and compared to monthly discharge records from over 8000 gauging stations and satellite altimetry observations for 442 reaches of large rivers. An automated <b>statistical</b> method selected <b>grid</b> cells to construct ‘‘satellite gauging reaches’’ (SGRs). MODIS SGRs were generally more accurate than passive microwave SGRs, but there were complementary strengths. The rivers widely varied in size, regime, and morphology. As expected performance was low (R 0. 6. The best results (R> 0. 9) were obtained for large unregulated lowland rivers, particularly in tropical and boreal regions. Relatively poor results were obtained in arid regions, where flow pulses are few and recede rapidly, and in temperate regions, where many rivers are modified and contained. While discharge variations produce clear changes in inundated area and gauge records are available {{for part of the}} satellite record, SGRs can retrieve monthly river discharge values back to around 1998 and up to present.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a nonstationary spatio-temporal <b>statistical</b> model for <b>gridded</b> {{data on the}} sphere. The model specifies a computationally convenient covariance structure that depends on heterogeneous geography. Widely used statistical models on a spherical domain are nonstationary for different latitudes, but stationary at the same latitude (axial symmetry). This assumption has been acknowledged to be too restrictive for quantities such as surface temperature, whose statistical behavior is influenced by large scale geographical descriptors such as land and ocean. We propose an evolutionary spectrum approach that is able to account for different regimes across the Earth's geography, and results in a more general and flexible class of models that vastly outperforms axially symmetric models and captures longitudinal patterns {{that would otherwise be}} assumed constant. The model can be estimated with in a multi-step conditional likelihood approximation that preserves the nonstationary features while allowing for easily distributed computations: we show how the fit of a data sets larger than 20 million data can be performed in less than one day on a state-of-the-art workstation. Once the parameters are estimated, it is possible to instantaneously generate surrogate runs from a common laptop. Further, the resulting estimates from the statistical model can be regarded as a synthetic description (i. e. a compression) of the space-time characteristics of an entire initial condition ensemble. Compared to traditional algorithms aiming at compressing the bit-by-bit information on each climate model run, the proposed approach achieves vastly superior compression rates...|$|R
40|$|Imbalance PRice is {{the staple}} food {{for more than}} 50 % of the world’s {{population}} 1 - 3. Reliable prediction of changes in rice yield is thus central for maintaining global food security. Here, we compare the sensitivity of rice yield to temperature increase derived from field warming experiments and three modelling approaches: statistical models, local crop models and global gridded crop models. Field warming experiments produced a substantial rice yield loss under warming, with an average temperature sensitivity of - 5. 2 ± 1. 4 % K- 1. Local crop models gave a similar sensitivity (- 6. 3 ± 0. 4 % K- 1), but <b>statistical</b> and global <b>gridded</b> crop models both suggest less negative impacts of warming on yields (0. 8 ± 0. 3 % K- 1 and - 2. 4 ± 3. 7 % 38 K- 1, respectively). Using data from field warming experiments, we further propose a conditional probability approach to constrain the large range of global gridded crop model results for the changes in future yield in response to warming {{by the end of}} the century (from - 1. 3 % K- 1 to - 9. 3 % K- 1). The constraint implies a more negative response to warming (– 8. 3 ± 1. 4 % K- 1) and reduces the spread of the model ensemble by 35 %. This yield reduction exceeds that estimated by the International Food Policy Research Institute assessment (- 4. 2 to - 6. 4 % K- 1) 4. Our study suggests that without CO 2 fertilization, effective adaptation and genetic improvement, severe rice yield losses are plausible under intensive climate warming scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a statistical methodology whereby the probability limits associated with CFD grid resolution of inlet flow analysis {{can be determined}} which provide quantitative information {{on the distribution of}} that error over the specified operability range. The objectives of this investigation is to quantify the effects of both random (accuracy) and systemic (biasing) errors associated with grid resolution in the analysis of the Lockheed Martin Company (LMCO) N+ 2 Low Boom external compression supersonic inlet. The study covers the entire operability space as defined previously by the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) High Speed Research (HSR) program goals. The probability limits in terms of a 95. 0 % confidence interval on the analysis data were evaluated for four ARP 1420 inlet metrics, namely (1) total pressure recovery (PFAIP), (2) radial hub distortion (DPH/P), (3)) radial tip distortion (DPT/P), and (4)) circumferential distortion (DPC/P). In general, the resulting +/- 0. 95 delta Y interval was unacceptably large in comparison to the stated goals of the HSCT program. Therefore, the conclusion was reached that the "standard grid" size was insufficient for this type of analysis. However, in examining the statistical data, it was determined that the CFD analysis results at the outer fringes of the operability space were the determining factor in the measure of <b>statistical</b> uncertainty. Adequate <b>grids</b> are grids that are free of biasing (systemic) errors and exhibit low random (precision) errors in comparison to their operability goals. In order to be 100 % certain that the operability goals have indeed been achieved for each of the inlet metrics, the Y+/- 0. 95 delta Y limit must fall inside the stated operability goals. For example, if the operability goal for DPC/P circumferential distortion is 0. 06, then the forecast Y for DPC/P plus the 95 % confidence interval on DPC/P, i. e. +/- 0. 95 delta Y, must all be {{less than or equal to}} 0. 06...|$|R
