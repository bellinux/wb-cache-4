5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state.|$|E

The influx of foreign manufactures into the U. S. in the seventies and eighties provided a unique opportunity to study their locational strategies within the U.

By investigating the locational <b>strategies</b> <b>of</b> domestic manufacturers also, we were able to make a rare comparison <b>of</b> the locational <b>strategies</b> <b>of</b> the foreign and domestic manufacturers. Further, the study investigated if locational <b>strategies</b> <b>of</b> both domestic and foreign manufacturers changed with time. Of the many findings, the most notable ones are: market size, as defined by the number of manufacturing establishments in a state, is strongly associated with the locational decisions of foreign manufacturers in the U. S., and secondly, with time, foreign manufactures tend to become more like their domestic counterparts. © 1990 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1990) 21, 301 – 317...|$|R

5|$|During the Cold War, and {{particularly}} in the late 1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China adopted a <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> destabilisation of Western powers by disruption of their hold on African colonies.

5|$|Except for nautiloids (represented by {{the modern}} order Nautilida) and coleoids (which had already diverged into modern octopodes, squids, and cuttlefish) all {{other species of}} the {{molluscan}} class Cephalopoda became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These included the ecologically significant belemnoids, {{as well as the}} ammonoids, a group of highly diverse, numerous, and widely distributed shelled cephalopods. Researchers have pointed out that the reproductive <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> the surviving nautiloids, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in outsurviving their ammonoid counterparts through the extinction event. The ammonoids utilized a planktonic <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> reproduction (numerous eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have been devastated by the K–Pg extinction event. Additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota, nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids.|$|E
