40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} are to know the implementation, the parties that involved and documents that published includes the obstacles that faced in Cargo Shipment process in CV Nova Furniture Boyolali. This research used method of primary and secondary collecting data. While, techniques of collecting data are with internship observation (interview) to staffs of CV Nova Furniture Boyolali. The result of {{this research}} can be concluded that {{the implementation of the}} Cargo Shipment on the process of outdoor furniture to Denmark in CV Nova Furniture Boyolali in starting of the sales contract, booking container, the process of stuffing, trucking, shipment, documents negotiation and retrieval of goods. The parties that involved are exporters, banks, customs and tax, Department of Industry and Trade, freight forwarder, ship freight forwarding, <b>surveyor,</b> <b>shipping</b> companies and documents that involved are the approval of exports of goods, invoice, packing list, bill of lading, Certificate of Origin, and permits uploading of goods. The obstacles that encountered in Cargo shipment process is changing of the schedule, delay and leakage of the truck come on container. Suggestion that is proposed to CV Nova Furniture Boyolali is to increase of consistency of delivering of goods so that the goods arrive of the destination on time. Then, to reducing the risk of damage to be borne by company during the trip, the company should use insurance services. In addition, cooperation between CV Nova Furniture Boyolali and Freight Forwarder should remain intact so that the cooperation between buyers becomes better.

50|$|The Tory was a 382 ton barque {{built at}} Yarmouth in 1834 and {{acquired}} by the New Zealand Company for ₤5250 from Joseph Somes, a wealthy shipowner {{and member of the}} committee. The New Zealand Company fitted out for sailing to Wellington under Captain Edward Chaffers and conducting land acquisitions and surveys. Colonel William Wakefield was the expedition's commander. By 12 May 1839, when the Tory left England, the company had already begun advertising and selling land in New Zealand, {{and by the end of}} July—months before the company had even learned the Tory had arrived in New Zealand—all available sections for its first settlement had been sold.

25|$|The Tory was {{the first}} of three New Zealand Company <b>surveyor</b> <b>ships</b> sent off in haste to prepare for {{settlers}} in New Zealand. In August the Cuba, with a surveyors' team headed by Captain William Mein Smith, R.A., set sail, and a month later—still with no word on the success of the Tory and Cuba—on 15 September 1839 it was followed from Gravesend, London, by the Oriental, the first of five 500-ton immigrant ships hired by the company. Following the Oriental were the Aurora, Adelaide, Duke of Roxburgh and Bengal Merchant, plus a freight vessel, the Glenbervie, which all sailed with instructions to rendezvous on 10 January 1840 at Port Hardy on D'Urville Island where they would be told of their final destination. It was expected that by that time William Wakefield would have bought land for the first settlement and had it surveyed, and also inspected the company's land claims at Kaipara and Hokianga.|$|R

40|$|It {{is highly}} {{desirable}} that ships operate safely 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. To achieve this, ship classification societies supply ship owners and operators with suites of IT-supported services, increasingly web-based and highly personalized. Access to such services is required worldwide and timely by <b>ship</b> owners, <b>ship</b> <b>surveyors</b> and head-office staff. Depending on connectivity and context, {{a variety of}} different working environments has to be supported: offline and online, mobile and stationary, public and private etc. The project reported here investigates suites of services for several classes of use cases: − web-based ship information and calculation services for classification society staff, − web- and mobile interface-based ship status checking for ship owners, and − offline and re-synchronized task execution for <b>ship</b> <b>surveyors</b> with mobile devices. State-of-the-art web and mobile system technology has proven to be suitable for the design and realization of integrated portal systems supporting such suites of services.

40|$|A good {{inspection}} plan {{is crucial in}} order to detect defects in time and {{to make decisions about}} how quickly they must be repaired. Inspection planning may be based on experience (determined by class rules) which will, by default, treat all ships with the same inspection program or on first principal reliability-based methods. In the first case, only some of the knowledge {{that could be used to}} predict structural problems in case of ship-to-ship variation (construction or use) is gained from the data gathered. In the second case, reliability models (methods) can deal reasonably well with individual part but they do not give a good estimate of the overall reliability of the ship and they lack the 'experience database' that the experience-based, methodology uses so the reliability models are not calibrated by reality. This work will attempt to develop a method to calibrate the reliability models using the data from experience-based methods. The expected outcome of this work is a methodology to calibrate the reliability models, which will be produced as a report and as a computer program. The system, which will target the critical structural details in the ship, is intended to be used by the inspection companies, class <b>surveyors,</b> <b>ship</b> managers and ship designers and for the calibration of the {{inspection plan}}ning and reliability models as a decision support system tool to improve the safety of the ship and make inspections cost-effective.

50|$|A {{government}} <b>surveyor</b> performs <b>ship</b> registration surveys, {{surveys of}} foreign-going ships and local draft, and generally enforces ship safety standards to insure marine industrial safety. Government-appointed marine surveyors, also called marine inspectors in some countries, belong to two {{groups that are}} not mutually exclusive: Flag State surveyors report to the government with whom the vessel is registered, and Port State surveyors report to the government into whose territory the vessel has entered. The Port State surveyors usually {{have the authority to}} detain vessels considered to have defects that may result in adverse impacts on life or the environment. Based on their government's legal framework, Flag State surveyors can impose conditions on the vessel such that failure to comply will result in the registration of the vessel being suspended or withdrawn. In this event, the vessel will find it almost impossible to trade.|$|R

50|$|A {{classification}} <b>surveyor</b> inspects <b>ships</b> to {{make sure}} that the ship, its components and machinery are built and maintained according to the standards required for their class. Classification surveyors often have two roles: one is as a representative of the classification society; and the other as an inspector on behalf of the country with which the vessel is registered (the flag state). The classification role is to ensure that during construction the vessel initially complies with the classification society's rules for construction and outfitting, and thereafter is maintained fit to proceed trading. The Flag State role is based on a clear set of guidelines issued by the registering country. On satisfactory completion of any survey, the classification surveyor makes recommendations to the classification society and/or the flag state. These may be that the vessel has a clean bill of health, or that various defects must be corrected within a given time.|$|R
