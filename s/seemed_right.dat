5|$|The false {{story of}} the {{execution}} of the Ho-Chunk prisoners, along with the incessant American trespassing, convinced some Ho-Chunks to take up arms against the United States. The timing <b>seemed</b> <b>right,</b> since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness. Another grievance was the news that some Ho-Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews along the Mississippi River, although this story, like the one about the executions, may have been a false rumor. The Ho-Chunks broke off diplomatic relations with the United States by not showing up for a scheduled treaty conference, and prepared for war.|$|E
25|$|After the 1968 General Assembly, the Administrative Committee {{charged a}} {{sub-committee}} {{with the task}} of proposing a symbol for the church. Hundreds of designs were submitted, but none <b>seemed</b> <b>right.</b> By November the Deputy General Minister and President, William Howland, suggested that the committee's staff consultant and chairperson agree on a specific proposal and bring it back to the committee: that meant Robert L. Friedly of the Office of Interpretation and Ronald E. Osborn.|$|E
25|$|The ongoing {{fight between}} the Teamsters and UFW {{and its effect}} on UFW's {{organizational}} viability led César Chávez to seriously consider legal reform as a solution to his union's problems. Chávez had rejected legislative solutions in the past by arguing that a truly successful union movement must be built from the ground up rather than rely on top-down activity. But Chávez began to reconsider this stand in light of the attacks by the Teamsters. Additionally, the time <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> for a legislative program: Jerry Brown, long an avid supporter of the UFW, had been elected Governor of California in November 1974. Brown had even hired LeRoy Chatfield, a former high-level UFW staffer, as one of his key aides.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} primarily positive reviews, with critical attention mostly {{going to}} Veronica and Logan's relationship. Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a positive review, noting that [...] "bviously {{the most notable}} aspect of this episode was the Logan-Veronica hookup. Again, it seemed really sudden, but {{in the sense that}} they are both mercurial teenagers it <b>seemed</b> <b>right,</b> particularly when they didn't know how to handle themselves afterward." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+", writing that [...] " [...] kisses Logan! You heard me! How could you not, with all the exclamation points!" ...|$|E
500|$|Hammerstein {{included}} an incident {{he had seen}} {{when he was a}} neophyte assistant stage manager: a chorus boy came up to a chorus girl and asked to use some of her mascara—to disguise a hole in the boy's black socks. Hammerstein stated, [...] "we were religious in keeping away from the trite things—the kindly old stage door man named Pop, the pretty little understudy who replaces the star on opening night. We steered clear, too, of the backstage story of a company putting on a new show, with all the anxieties of the actors and producers... It <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> to focus on a show which is already running because we wanted to tell a story about a community, the backstage community, and this community becomes settled and established after a show opens." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} on Coronation Street, the {{character}} has {{become synonymous with}} her signature dish at the Rovers Return Inn, Betty's hotpot. ITV have described the dish as [...] "the stuff of legends", and in 1995, pie manufacturer Holland's Pies launched a real-life range of hotpots and pies based on the dish, called [...] "Betty's Kitchen". The idea for the range originated with the firm's marketing director, Dilys Day, who explained: [...] "I was brought up on hotpot and Coronation Street. So when I joined Holland's a year ago, it <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> to put the two together with Betty's hotpot." [...] Day added that: [...] "We are all very excited about Betty's Kitchen products. Holland's is a strong northern brand, with mass market appeal and wholesome, honest values - {{the same can be}} said for The Street." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} of actor Nicholas Courtney, the Doctor learns in the episode that Courtney's {{character}} Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart has died peacefully in a nursing home. Moffat said of the reference, [...] "In {{a story about the}} Doctor going to his death, it <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> and proper to acknowledge one of the greatest losses Doctor Who has endured." [...] Moffat has confirmed that the eyedrives are also a tribute to Courtney, who wore an eye patch when playing an alternative version of the Brigadier in Inferno (1970). Several characters reappear in the episode, including Charles Dickens (Simon Callow) from [...] "The Unquiet Dead", Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) from [...] "Victory of the Daleks", the Silurian doctor Malohkeh (Richard Hope) from [...] "The Hungry Earth"/"Cold Blood", the Teselecta and Captain Carter (Richard Dillane) from [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", and the Headless Monks and Dorium (Simon Fisher-Becker) from [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". McNeice felt there was room for his character to return, as [...] "Victory of the Daleks" [...] had hinted that he and the Doctor knew each other well.|$|E
2500|$|Lea also {{revealed}} in a 1976 fan club interview: [...] "We {{just got a}} terrific buzz when {{we were working on}} the album. We were more relaxed than we've ever been, more willing and able to be more experimental in the studios, and we took it easy and relaxed. Certainly we felt we had a good product in the making, so it <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> to put everything we had into it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a September 29, 2013 Kickstarter Backer's Interview video, Sain and Blue cited {{many reasons}} for {{bringing}} back Trance to the Sun. Sain noted that [...] "the whole culture of music has changed where it seems somehow right, now, to do a Trance to the Sun album where {{it might not have}} <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> even five years ago.... music is comprehensively changed in how people view it.... Now every genre co-exists. Trance to the Sun needs to make another album in that climate".|$|E
2500|$|Two {{sites in}} Belle Vue, East Manchester were suggested, {{but neither was}} deemed sufficient. To many City fans east Manchester was {{regarded}} as City's home and a move to Belle Vue <b>seemed</b> <b>right.</b> But the site was just [...] and an available lease of 50 years was deemed too short by the club, so {{it was decided that}} City would move to Moss Side. The move to a larger stadium at Maine Road was backed by then manager Ernest Mangnall.|$|E
2500|$|Rose {{discussed}} the regrouping in a June 2016 interview, stating [...] "It was always {{looked at as}} a possibility, but it never <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> or felt right". During the interview, Rose also reiterated his intention to release new Guns N' Roses music in the future. Slash later commented on the tour, telling Aerosmith's Joey Kramer {{in an interview with}} WZLX that [...] "We all were pretty positive (the reunion) would never happen, so it’s still sort of blowing our minds.... But everybody’s really getting along great and I think everybody’s come a long way, and it’s all cool." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{offers from}} A.S. Roma and A.C. Milan, moving to Italy <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> and a four-million dollar proposal from Udinese {{was on the}} table. Such amount of money made bigger clubs pressure the FIGC (Italian Football Federation) that blocked the transfer expecting financial guarantees. This caused a commotion in Udine as enraged Friulians flocked {{to the streets in}} protest against the Italian federation and the federal government. Historical reasons would make them shout [...] "O Zico, o Austria!" [...] ("Either Zico or Austria"). At the end of the controversy, the deal went through and though leaving Flamengo fans in sadness, Zico made the Friulians fans finally dream of better days.|$|E
2500|$|The final track, [...] "Journeyman", is Iron Maiden's {{first and}} only fully {{acoustic}} song. According to Dickinson on the Death on the Road live album, it is about [...] "the whole process of writing and being a musician," [...] although Mick Wall describes it as [...] "a wistful tale of carpe diem." [...] The song was originally recorded with electric instruments, however, as Dickinson states, [...] "after all the battering that we've given the listener over the last hour of music it just <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> to play out with something totally unexpected and left field." [...] The original version appears on the No More Lies EP.|$|E
2500|$|Under that idea, the enterprise's central {{designing}} {{office would}} apportion the shipbuilding {{work to the}} yards best able to take it, to better compete with European shipyards. Although American shipbuilding was not considered a highly profitable venture, the political environment <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> for improvement. [...] President William McKinley and his new Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt, had endorsed federal subsidies for American shipbuilding industries, {{to compensate for the}} subsidies provided by European governments, but Congress had not yet approved such a measure. [...] A renowned naval architect [...] and public servant, Lewis Nixon, was chosen to lead the venture, and helped to attract several major shipyards to participate.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson's textual {{work was}} characterised by {{considerable}} boldness {{and confidence in}} his own judgement. His work on the complicated matter of the transmission of Shakespeare's texts—none of Shakespeare's manuscripts survive and no published edition of any play was supervised directly by the playwright, so all of the texts are mediated by compositors and printers—was highly respected, though some of his theories have since been eclipsed by new scholarship. However, when the textual principles he painstakingly established {{did not support the}} reading that <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> to him, he would depart widely from them, earning him a reputation for both brilliance and capriciousness; Stanley Edgar Hyman refers to the [...] "valuable (sometime weird)" [...] New Shakespeare. In his interpretations that juxtaposition was heightened without the support of his arduous textual work. These interpretations included a reading of the famous bedroom scene between Hamlet and his mother that remains influential (if frequently questioned) to this day, but also peculiar ideas about covert Lutheranism and almost completely unsourced speculation about Shakespeare's relationship with his son-in-law. The influential Shakespearean W. W. Greg, Wilson's nemesis, once referred to Wilson's ideas as [...] "the careerings of a not too captive balloon in a high wind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, we realized that we either had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but nobody <b>seemed</b> <b>right.</b> For a while it looked like Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was going to join, but he couldn't get it together, so that never happened." [...] Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke, whom Slash credited for saving the band.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, {{where the first}} five years of The X-Files had been filmed and produced before the series had moved to Los Angeles, was an early idea; one that <b>seemed</b> <b>right</b> to both Chris Carter and David Duchovny. According to Duchovny, [...] "It all makes sense. You know, when Chris and I first talked about doing this movie, we kind of unconsciously both said, 'You know, I guess it should be in Vancouver, it really should be,' and it just felt like you know, almost superstitiously like the right thing to do." [...] Filming in Vancouver also facilitated the return of many former crew members who had previously worked on The X-Files, as well as individuals who had worked on the other series that Ten Thirteen Productions had created. Frank Spotnitz said that [...] "In terms of making of the movie, we've brought together as many people as we can, not just from The X-Files but from all the shows that we did here in Vancouver – Harsh Realm, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen – and our crew is populated with all these faces that we'd worked with, over the past fifteen years. And there's even some people from the L.A. crew." ...|$|E
