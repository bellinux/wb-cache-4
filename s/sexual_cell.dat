40|$|AbstractSexual {{reproduction}} is a trait {{shared by all}} complex life, but the complete account of its origin is missing. Virtually all theoretical work {{on the evolution of}} sex has been centered around the benefits of reciprocal recombination among nuclear genes, paying little attention to the evolutionary dynamics of multi-copy mitochondrial genomes. Here I develop a mathematical model to study the evolution of nuclear alleles inducing cell fusion in an ancestral population of clonal proto-eukaryotes. Segregational drift maintains high mitochondrial variance between clonally reproducing hosts, but the effect of segregation is opposed by cytoplasmic mixing which tends to reduce variation between cells in favor of higher heterogeneity within the cell. Despite the reduced long-term population fitness, alleles responsible for <b>sexual</b> <b>cell</b> fusion can spread to fixation. The evolution of sex requires negative epistatic interactions between mitochondrial mutations under strong purifying selection, low mutation load and weak mitochondrial-nuclear associations. I argue that similar conditions could have been maintained during the late stages of eukaryogenesis, facilitating the evolution of <b>sexual</b> <b>cell</b> fusion and meiotic recombination without compromising the stability of the emerging complex cell...|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in fungi requires induction of signaling pheromones within {{environments that}} are conducive to mating. The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans {{is currently the}} fourth greatest cause of infectious death in regions of Africa and undergoes mating in phytonutrient-rich environments to create spores with infectious potential. Here we show that under conditions where sexual development is inhibited, a ∼ 17 -fold excess of MFα pheromone transcript is synthesized and then degraded by a DEAD box protein, Vad 1, resulting in low steady state transcript levels. Transfer to mating medium or deletion of the VAD 1 gene resulted in high level accumulation of MFα transcripts and enhanced mating, acting {{in concert with the}} mating-related HOG 1 pathway. We then investigated whether the high metabolic cost of this apparently futile transcriptional cycle could be justified by a more rapid induction of mating. Maintenance of Vad 1 activity on inductive mating medium by constitutive expression resulted in repressed levels of MFα that did not prevent but rather prolonged the time to successful mating from 5 – 6 h to 15 h (p < 0. 0001). In sum, these data suggest that VAD 1 negatively regulates the <b>sexual</b> <b>cell</b> cycle via degradation of constitutive high levels of MFα transcripts in a synthetic/degradative cycle, providing a mechanism of mRNA induction for time-critical cellular events, such as mating induction...|$|E

The Rho {{family of}} GTPases {{is a group}} of {{proteins}} conserved among the eukaryotic organisms, which has a central role in regulating actin cytoskeleton organization. Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe undergoes morphogenetic changes during both vegetative and <b>sexual</b> <b>cell</b> cycles that require asymmetric cell growth and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Cdc 42, an essential member of the Rho proteins, provides the coordinated regulation of actin organization, secretion, and endocytosis required for polarized growth. Active Cdc 42 mainly localizes to growth areas of the plasma membrane and regulates For 3, the formin responsible for actin cable nucleation during interphase. Additionally, it regulates secretion, membrane traffic, and exocyst localization during vegetative growth. Like other Rho GTPases, Cdc 42 is positively regulated by GDP-GTP exchange factors (GEFs) and negatively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). These regulators play important roles in the specificity of Cdc 42 function. Scd 1 and Gef 1 are the two described Cdc 42 GEFs in S. pombe, and Rga 4 is the only GAP. We describe here other Rho GAPs that collaborate with Rga 4 in the regulation of Cdc 42 and the maintenance of cell morphology and polarized growth. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} a simplified model describing the evolutionary dynamics {{of a population}} composed of obligate sexually and asexually reproducing, unicellular organisms. The model assumes that the organisms have diploid genomes consisting of two chromosomes, and that the sexual organisms replicate by first dividing into haploid intermediates, which then combine with other haploids, followed by the normal mitotic division of the resulting diploid into two new daughter cells. We assume that the fitness landscape of the diploids {{is analogous to the}} single-fitness-peak approach often used in single-chromosome studies. That is, we assume a master chromosome that becomes defective with just one point mutation. The diploid fitness then depends on whether the genome has zero, one, or two copies of the master chromosome. We also assume that only pairs of haploids with a master chromosome are capable of combining so as to produce <b>sexual</b> diploid <b>cells,</b> and that this process is described by second-order kinetics. We find that, in a range of intermediate values of the replication fidelity, sexually reproducing cells can outcompete asexual ones, provided the initial abundance of <b>sexual</b> <b>cells</b> is above some threshold value.

Methods: Ten groups were assigned to 2 control and 8 experimental groups. On the control groups 1 and 2 no treatment was conducted, but in the control group 2, after 10 days the mice were mated. In experimental groups 1 and 2, the animals received DPP (100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) byoral administration for 10 days. In experimental groups 3 and 4 percentage of mating was evaluatedafter 10 days. Experimental groups 5 and 6 received DPP during gestation. Embryos were removedto evaluate ovaries histology. For experimental groups 7 and 8, DPP was administered until 21 thday after birth. The offspring ovaries were removed to evaluate histological parameters.

We demonstrated previously that in the fungus Podospora anserina different peroxisomal functions are required at distinct stages of sexual development, including the initiation and progression of meiocyte (ascus) development and the differentiation and germination of sexual spores (ascospores). Peroxisome assembly during these processes relies on the differential activity of the protein machinery that drives the import of proteins into the organelle, indicating a complex developmental regulation of peroxisome formation and activity. Here we demonstrate that peroxisome dynamics is also highly regulated during development. We show that peroxisomes in P. anserina are highly dynamic and respond to metabolic and environmental cues by undergoing changes in size, morphology and number. In addition, peroxisomes of vegetative and <b>sexual</b> <b>cell</b> types are structurally different. During sexual development peroxisome number increases at two stages: at early ascus differentiation and during ascospore formation. These processes are accompanied by changes in peroxisome structure and distribution, which include a cell-polarized concentration of peroxisomes at the beginning of ascus development, as well as a morphological transition from predominantly spherical to elongated shapes {{at the end of the}} first meiotic division. Further, the mostly tubular peroxisomes present from second meiotic division to early ascospore formation again become rounded during ascospore differentiation. Ultimately the number of peroxisomes dramatically decreases upon ascospore maturation.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles in cell differentiation. Enzymes belonging to the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family produce superoxide in a regulated manner. We have identified three distinct NOX subfamilies in the fungal kingdom and have shown that NoxA is required for <b>sexual</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation in Aspergillus nidulans. Here we show that Neurospora crassa NOX- 1 elimination results in complete female sterility, decreased asexual development, and reduction of hyphal growth. The lack of NOX- 2 did not affect any of these processes but led instead {{to the production of}} sexual spores that failed to germinate, even in the presence of exogenous oxidants. The elimination of NOR- 1, an ortholog of the mammalian Nox 2 regulatory subunit gp 67 phox, also caused female sterility, the production of unviable sexual spores, and a decrease in asexual development and hyphal growth. These results indicate that NOR- 1 is required for NOX- 1 and NOX- 2 functions at different developmental stages and establish a link between NOX-generated ROS and the regulation of growth. Indeed, NOX- 1 was required for the increased asexual sporulation previously observed in mutants without catalase CAT- 3. We also analyzed the function of the penta-EF calcium-binding domain protein PEF- 1 in N. crassa. Deletion of pef- 1 resulted in increased conidiation but, in contrast to what occurs in Dictyostelium discoideum, the mutation of this peflin did not suppress the phenotypes caused by the lack of NOX- 1.

This paper describes the risk of mutation and sexual trauma and infertility in masculine <b>sexual</b> <b>cell</b> by mobile phone radiations. METHODS In this study, we measured the emitted dose from a radiofrequency device, such as switching high voltage at different frequencies using a scintillation detector. The switching {{high voltage power supply}} (HVPS) was built for the Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) system. For radiation dosimetry, we used an ALNOR scintillator that can measure gamma radiation. The simulation was performed by MATLAB software, and data from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) were used to verify the simulation. RESULTS We investigated the risks that result from the waves, {{according to a report by}} International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), to every organ of the body is defined by the beam and electromagnetic radiation from this electronic device on people. The results showed that the maximum personal dose over a 15 -min period working at the mentioned HVPS did not exceed 0. 31 μSV/h (with an aluminum shield). So, according to other sources of radiation, continuous working time of the system should not be more than 10 hours. Finally, a characteristic curve for secure working with modules at different frequencies was reported.

However, unlike S. cerevisiae, N. crassa strains carrying a Prm 1 deletion exhibited complete sterility as either a male or female mating partner, a phenotype that was not complemented in a heterokaryon with wild type (WT). Crosses with ΔPrm 1 strains were blocked early in sexual development, well before development of ascogenous hyphae. The ΔPrm 1 sexual defect in N. crassa was not suppressed by mutations in Sad- 1, which is required for meiotic silencing of unpaired DNA (MSUD). However, mutations in Sad- 1 increased the number of progeny obtained in crosses with a ΔPrm 1 (Prm 1 -gfp) complemented strain. These data indicate multiple roles for PRM 1 during sexual development...|$|E
40|$|A crucial step in {{the life}} cycle of eukaryotes is sexual reproduction. For {{productive}} sex to occur, the first cellular steps that must be taken are gamete recognition, adhesion, and membrane fusion. However, {{little is known about the}} proteins governing these initial events. Helpful in this regard, are studies on HAP 2 /GCS 1, an ancient and highly conserved gamete membrane protein necessary for successful fertilization in a wide range of eukaryotic species. Efforts have already recognized the necessity of HAP 2 -mediated membrane fusion in the male gametes of multiple species, but they have come short of describing its mechanism of fusion, structure, or potential origins. Here, we investigated the expression, genetic necessity, and fusogenic capacity of HAP 2 during the sexual cycle of the model single-celled ciliate species, Tetrahymena thermophila. Unlike in other species, we found that HAP 2 is expressed in all seven mating types of T. thermophila, and fusion and fertility is only prevented when HAP 2 is deleted from both cells of a mating pair. Along the way, we also functionally examined a hypothetical HAP 2 accessory protein, ZFR 1, probed {{the life cycle of}} a ciliated fish parasite for the presence of a conjugation stage, and accidentally found instances of unexpected parthenogenesis in T. thermophila. Perhaps most importantly, we developed a flow-cytometry-based assay for quantifying <b>sexual</b> <b>cell</b> fusion events in an in vivo model of eukaryotic fertilization, identified a predicted high-confidence structural homology between HAP 2 and class II viral fusogens, and tested the functional extent of this homology through targeted deletions and biophysical tests of the HAP 2 fusion loop. In addition to providing indications of a viral-like fusogenic mechanism for HAP 2, these findings that show a structural and functional similarity between a viral and gamete fusogen harken back to early theories that a “selfish” genetic element promoting membrane fusion as a means for intergenomic transmission led to the origin of eukaryotic sex. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|Sex ratio {{theory is}} a focus in {{evolutionary}} biology that explores how natural selection shapes investment in males and females. It has provided {{some of the}} best quantitative evidence of evolution and could find utility in public health efforts through its application to malaria parasites. These parasites have distinct male and female forms that are produced following massive asexual replication, and they mate within the blood-feeding insects that transmit them between vertebrate hosts. A very similar population structure is assumed by local mate competition (LMC), a model from sex ratio theory that predicts female-biased sex ratios dependent on the degree of selfing within a mating patch. In this dissertation, I test a series of predictions from LMC for the lizard malaria parasite Plasmodium mexicanum. These include: (i) sex ratios have heritable variation that is not constrained by other life history traits; (ii) single-genotype infections have female-biased sex ratios that are determined by male fecundity; (iii) multiple-genotype infections have less biased sex ratios than single genotype infections; (iv) if males are limiting, sex ratios may be less biased when there are fewer parasites present (an extension of LMC called fertility insurance); and (v) less biased sex ratios may also be favored if increased female production yields diminishing returns on transmission to a new vertebrate host. To test these predictions, I combined the study of natural and experimental infections, microscopy (parasite density and sex ratio), molecular genetics (infection genetic diversity), and mathematical modeling (of how transmission patterns might affect sex ratio evolution). Overall, the results were qualitatively consistent with both LMC and my new model predictions. Sex ratios showed evidence of heritable variation that was unlinked to other life history traits measured. Sex ratios in single-genotype infections were female biased and consistent with the male fecundity observed, and were lower than sex ratios in experimental multiple-genotype infections, as predicted. Sex ratios were not less biased with lower <b>sexual</b> <b>cell</b> density, suggesting that males were not limiting. In fact, the opposite trend was sometimes observed: sex ratios were less biased with more sexual cells. This pattern has been observed previously in this and other species, and the only model that currently predicts such a trend is the new transmission model I outline. This dissertation contributes to our understanding of sex ratio evolution for malaria parasites in a number of ways. First, it adds evidence to the idea that the selective forces implicated in LMC are at work in malaria parasites and that malaria parasites are able to detect and respond to relevant cues. Second, it helps account for discrepancies in existing data, which have often reached conflicting conclusions. Third, it offers one of the first detailed studies of malaria parasite male fecundity, an essential piece of the sex ratio puzzle. Finally, it outlines a new theoretical extension of LMC that provides novel predictions and highlights areas of study that may be fruitful for future work on malaria parasites and other organisms...|$|E

40|$|A {{starvation}} and then feeding method {{was developed to}} produce about 100 % marketable sea urchins, Paracentrotus lividus, in 3 1 / 2 months. This method is needed because the reproduction cycle is desynchronized in the conditions imposed during the somatic growth stage in land-based closed systems. The major advantages of starving the animals are resetting the reproductive cycle to the spent stage (gonads almost devoid of <b>sexual</b> <b>cells)</b> and stressing the individuals so that they mobilize and restore the nutritive phagocytes, filling them with nutrients. Batches of sea urchins starved 2 months beforehand were fed ad libitum for 45 days with enriched food under eight combinations of four temperatures (12 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 24 degrees C) and two photoperiods (9 and 17 h daylight). In our system, the best combination was 24 degrees C and 9 h daylight for growth {{as well as for}} gonad quality. The gonadal indices obtained (in dry weight) were over 9 % at 16 degrees C and over 12 % at 24 degrees C, which are better than what is found in the field for this population...|$|R
