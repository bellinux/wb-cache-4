It is easy to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E

Chocano {{noted that}} the series lacks the psychological tension of Buffy, and suggests {{that this might be}} attributable to the episodes being aired out of order. MSN, on the other hand, pointed out that after viewing the DVD boxed set it was easy to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> program had attracted many die-hard fans. [...] "All of Whedon's fingerprints are there: the witty dialogue, the quirky premises and dark exploration of human fallacy that made Buffy brilliant found their way to this space drama".|$|E

500|$|Derek Malcolm in The Guardian {{disliked the}} film, {{saying it was}} [...] "too long... and pretty boring between the stunts", {{although}} he admitted that the stunts were of a high quality. According to Malcolm, Bond [...] "inhabits a fantasy-land of more or less bloodless violence, groinless sex and naivety masked as superior sophistication", with Moore playing him {{as if in a}} [...] "nicely lubricated daze". Although Malcolm tipped the film for international box office success, he observed that he [...] "can't quite <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> series has lasted so long and so strong in people's affections." [...] Writing in The Observer, Philip French commented that [...] "not {{for the first time the}} pre-credits sequence is the best thing about the film." [...] French was dismissive of Moore's Bond, saying that Bond was [...] "impersonated by Moore" [...] and referred to Moore's advancing years.|$|E
500|$|Building and {{enlarging}} the islands, {{along with the}} new Concorde Bridge built to connect them with the site-specific mass transit system known as the Montreal Expo Express, plus a boat pier, cost more than the Saint Lawrence Seaway project did only five years earlier: this was even before any buildings or infrastructure were constructed. [...] With the initial phase of construction completed, {{it is easy to}} <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> budget for the exhibition was going to be larger than anyone expected. In the fall of 1963, Expo's general manager, Andrew Kniewasser, presented the master plan and the preliminary budget of $167 million for construction: it would balloon to over $439 million by 1967. The plan and budget narrowly passed a vote in Pearson's federal cabinet, passing by one vote, and then it was officially submitted on December 23, 1963.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that, after hearing a minute of it being played during Power 105.1 FM's mixshow, the song [...] "felt more like a novelty than like part of a strategy."

500|$|On October 5, 1920, the Control Commission {{presented}} a concrete proposal {{to draw the}} demarcation line up {{to the village of}} Utieka on the Neman River, about [...] south of Merkinė (Merecz), and to establish a [...] wide neutral zone along the line. On October 6, negotiations continued regarding an extension of the demarcation line. The Poles refused to move it past the village of Bastuny, claiming that the Polish army needed freedom to maneuver against the Soviet troops, even though a provisional ceasefire agreement had been reached with Soviet Russia on October 5. The Poles proposed to discuss further demarcation lines in Riga, where Poland and Russia negotiated the Peace of Riga. On the same day fighting west of the Neman River ceased as Polish troops captured the Varėna train station. On October 7, at midnight, the final Suwałki Agreement was signed. On October 8, the Control Commission stated that they could not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> demarcation line could not be extended further than Bastuny and urged another round of negotiations.|$|E
500|$|The divergences {{from the}} {{original}} novella's plot were generally not well received. Tim Teeman, reviewing The Turn of the Screw for The Times, felt the 1920s setting did {{not contribute to the}} story, as it was not properly developed. He compared the film to Sarah Waters's novel The Little Stranger, a ghost story set in the 1920s in which the social upheavals of the decade are explored. Gerard Gilbert, writing both for The Independent and The Arts Desk, felt that Ann's relationship to the Master was [...] "unnecessarily sexed up", and that this element added nothing to the story, and, in fact, detracted from it. In his review of the American DVD release for the Deseret Morning News, Chris Hicks said that he could not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> changes had been made, and that the literalisation of the sex and violence detracted from the film. Whittaker suggested that The Turn of the Screw was [...] "oddly sexually explicit", and that the changes were unnecessary for the plot. The biggest problem, he suggested, was the introduction of the psychiatrist; his discussions with Ann, which could easily be removed, served to remove the mystery from the plot, in Whittaker's eyes. Sutcliffe was critical of the reframing of the story as a stereotypical account of how [...] "a cocky young man of science has his certainties upturned", and said the film took [...] "the terrifying indeterminacies of the original", turning them [...] "into a slightly shabby ghost-train ride".|$|E

Meanwhile, the Jews who gathered in anger over the edict believed that Hierax had come only for the sake of provocation (which, according to Socrates’ text, was Hierax's intent). Upon this assumption, Orestes had Hierax punished for a crime for which [...] "he was wholly guiltless".|$|E
2500|$|William Robinson (no relation) takes a {{very similar}} view to that of his namesake. In his most recent book, Understanding Phenomenal Consciousness, he is unusual as a dualist in calling for {{research}} programs that investigate the relation of qualia to the brain. The problem is so stubborn, he says, that too many philosophers would prefer [...] "to explain it away", but he would rather have it explained and does not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> effort should not be made. However, he does not expect {{there to be a}} straightforward scientific reduction of phenomenal experience to neural architecture; on the contrary he regards this as a forlorn hope. The [...] "Qualitative Event Realism" [...] that Robinson espouses sees phenomenal consciousness as caused by brain events but not identical with them, being non-material events.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2006 coup, the {{military}} junta appointed {{a committee to}} investigate the anti-drug campaign. Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee's results The Economist reported in January 2008: [...] "Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet this week {{he said there was}} insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen.

2500|$|The most {{important}} part of the trial for Mendleson was her final speech in her own defence, which took a day and a half of court time. She urged the jury to understand her political work and lifestyle, which would help them <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> police should have planted guns and explosives on her. She noted that at the time of the Manchester bombing she had been living in Wivenhoe where doors were left open and people borrowed each other's magazines, and she had been able to produce unchallenged alibi witnesses to the fact that she was in Wivenhoe when the bomb was planted. Although she knew others in the case, she asserted that there was no evidence of any plots or conspiracies. Mendleson said that she understood the feelings behind those who would make bomb attacks on cabinet ministers but doing so [...] "isn't going to get rid of the capitalist system, because there is always somebody to step into his place unless the situation and conditions are right". In conclusion she stressed that those in dock [...] "are working together for a happier and more peaceful world".|$|E
