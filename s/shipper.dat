5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the <b>shipper</b> to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} how small, medium and large <b>shippers</b> react to changes in the ocean-liner shipping industry under the Ocean Shipping Reform Act (OSRA) of 1998. The focus is on the importance of negotiating contracts with carriers and the choice to use either a <b>shipper's</b> own leverage or the leverage of a third-party agent. I hypothesize that large <b>shippers</b> wi 11 be more supportive of OSRA when negotiating favorable rates than small <b>shippers.</b> Data were collected from a wide variety of companies that ship from Pacific Coast ports to Asia. Our analysis implies that OSRA forces <b>shippers</b> to rely on their own clout or that of a third-party agent to gain desirable service contracts. Finally, the research describes desirable shipments from the perspectives of both carriers and the <b>shippers...</b>|$|R

Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume <b>shipper,</b> which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products.|$|E

40|$|The Internet service {{attributes}} desired by <b>shippers</b> were examined {{as well as}} a model that seeks to explain the intention of <b>shippers</b> to use Internet services in liner shipping. Using data collected from a survey of a group of <b>shippers</b> in Taiwan, the relationships among the constructs in the model were tested, namely: Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, security and use intention. The results suggest that <b>shippers</b> perceive tracing {{to be the most important}} service attribute of Internet services, followed by checking for customs clearance, vessel schedules and electronic document services. The findings indicate that perceived ease of use is the major factor affecting the intention of <b>shippers</b> to use Internet services, and that perceived ease of use has a strong positive effect on perceived usefulness. The results also indicate that security has a positive effect on a <b>shipper's</b> perception of ease of use. However, the influence of security on use intention and perceived usefulness was not supported in this study. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings on the intention of <b>shippers</b> to use Internet services in liner shipping are discussed.

40|$|Purpose To {{examine the}} {{strategic}} focus of <b>shippers</b> and transport providers (TPs) {{in reducing the}} environmental impact of transportation. Research questions: 1) To what extent are the green practices related to transportation described in literature being realised in practice by <b>shippers</b> and TPs? 2) How do <b>shippers</b> and TPs prioritise transportation compared to other initiatives for greening the supply chains? Design/methodology/approach Empirical data from two TPs and five <b>shippers</b> regarding the adoption of green transport practices and initiatives for greening supply chains were collected. This was compared to green transport practices in literature. Findings The practices are mainly related to short-term environmental gains and technical solutions. Practices that requires organisational or structural changes, collaboration and information sharing between <b>shippers</b> and transport providers have potentials, but are less implemented. The reasons are that green transport practices are not integrated in the company strategy, the TPs lack interest from <b>shippers,</b> and when <b>shippers</b> outsource transportation they focus on other areas. Research limitations/implications The data are from Swedish companies with an international presence. The geographical factor can be reduced by studies in other countries. Practical implications A higher priority of transportation in greening the supply chain requires considerations in strategic decisions. This entails modified mindsets of managers and business models for combining economic and environmental measures. The greatest unused environmental potential for transportation requires collaboration between <b>shippers</b> and TPs. Originality/value Both <b>shippers</b> and TPs are considered. The most common practices for greening transportation are described.

30|$|In addition, it is {{important}} to understand the perspectives of freight forwarders and <b>shippers</b> in port selection. The port selection criteria of <b>shippers</b> are determined by Chinonye et al. (2006) for Nigerian ports, and efficiency, frequency of ship visits, and adequate infrastructure are found to be significant. Grosso and Monteiro (2008) study the port selection criteria of freight forwarders in the port of Genoa, identifying port connectivity, cost and productivity, electronic information, and logistics as a few main criteria. To address competitiveness, Aronietis et al. (2010) use cost, capacity, hinterland connection, reliability, location, flexibility, and other evaluation criteria for Western European ports. The port selections of <b>shippers</b> and forwarders are analyzed by Langen (2007), who focuses on Australia and highlights that <b>shippers</b> and forwarders have similar views, although <b>shippers</b> indicate less price-elastic demand.|$|R
50|$|Large <b>shippers</b> {{of goods}} by rail also wished {{to have more}} {{flexibility}} in the rail market. The net result of compromise between the carriers and the <b>shippers,</b> and the Carter administration’s push for a more competitive transport was the Staggers Act of 1980. The Staggers Act worked from the 4R Act template but extended its provisions. One of the key changes from the 1976 Act was allowance of secret contracts between carriers and <b>shippers,</b> not limited to large-investment situations and not effectively subject to regulatory review. According to former Congressional Budget Office analyst Christopher Barnekov, such contracts allowed the rail carriers and their <b>shippers</b> much more opportunity readily to develop more efficient transport arrangements, which lowered costs for the carriers, yielding better returns for the carriers and lower rates for the <b>shippers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Key words: {{integrated}} hierarchical information integration, part-worth utility, {{preference in}} carrier selection, international freight forwarders.

The study then uses multiple linear regression models to in-vestigate the critical factors that influence the preferences in carrier selection among <b>shippers</b> and IFFs. Through model estimations and part-worth utility analyses, this paper suggests that the critical factors of concern to <b>shippers</b> and IFFs are obviously different. <b>Shippers</b> place much importance on fac-tors related to financial stability, reliability, and accuracy of documents. In contrast, IFFs place more emphasis on rates, including negotiate rates and transportation rates, as well as reputation, space available, and on-time performance. This study also highlights that <b>shippers</b> are more likely to consider a carrier according to its overall performance, while IFFs only value a few of critical factors when choosing a carrier.

On the contrary, the <b>shippers</b> in the two DHL relationships are aware of this environmental practice as offered by the LSPs but {{are not interested in}} it. One can perhaps question the value of the emissions offset programmes if the <b>shippers</b> do not want them. However, even though the case sample in this paper point towards uninterested <b>shippers</b> with regard to these programmes, other cases might show another situation. Further, {{it is also possible that}} the LSPs include these programmes as a part of their larger concept of a “green image”, which would make the interest from <b>shippers</b> in this particular practice less important.|$|R

25|$|The oil, shipped by World Fuel Services {{subsidiary}} Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc., from New Town, North Dakota, {{originated from}} the Bakken Formation. The destination was the Irving Oil Refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick. Shipment {{of the oil}} was contracted to Canadian Pacific Railway, which transported it on CPR tracks from North Dakota to the CPR yard in Côte-Saint-Luc, a Montreal suburb. CPR sub-contracted MMA to transport the oil from the CPR yard in Côte-Saint-Luc to the MMA yard in Brownville Junction. CPR also sub-contracted New Brunswick Southern Railway to transport it from the MMA yard in Brownville Junction to the final destination at the Saint John refinery. Ministry of Transport senior inspector Marc Grignon opined that “When the <b>shipper</b> is based outside Canada, the importer becomes the shipper.” Irving Oil Commercial G.P. is the <b>shipper</b> in this case. 3,830 rail cars of Bakken crude were shipped by 67 trains in the 9-month period preceding the derailment.|$|E
40|$|The project {{examined}} the value {{associated with a}} standing panel of <b>shippers</b> who would contribute carrier evaluation data to a central pool that would be available for wider distribution. The goal would be {{to improve the quality}} of evaluation data available to <b>shippers.</b> Both focus groups and surveys of <b>shippers</b> were used as a data gathering methodology. Major findings of the project include the following: <b>Shippers</b> appear willing to contribute carrier evaluation data to a shared pool of similar data. Larger firms see more value in such an arrangement than do smaller firms—particularly those located in non-metro areas. The type of metrics used by <b>shippers</b> in evaluating carriers are very consistent suggesting that the individual data could be easily combined into a central data base. There are no apparent technological barriers to the efficient pooling of carrier evaluation data. The report concludes that sufficient interest and promise exist to justify a pilot project to address various implementation issues. 17. Document Analysis/Descriptors 18. Availability Statemen...|$|R

40|$|Transport {{management}} is traditionally {{addressed in the}} literature as a process with its flow contextualized in its operating performance and costs. In this paper, transport is considered as service management, seeking to understand the behavioral aspects of the demand of <b>shippers.</b> We conducted a survey of 400 small and mediumsized Brazilian industrial <b>shippers.</b> The differentiation of services, according to the customers, was obtained by Factor Analysis. The {{results indicated that the}} constructs of transport services most valued by <b>shippers</b> were, in order, Security, Reliability, Time, Price, Service for the special needs of customers and Customer Relations, i. e., the <b>shippers</b> showed greater interest in the effectiveness of service. Thus, <b>shippers</b> expect the performance of transport in itself to strengthen the relationship with their customers. Additionally, we detected differences in priorities, according to the groups targeted by the characteristics of customers.
