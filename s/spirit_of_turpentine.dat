60|$|If two plane polish'd Plates of Glass {{three or}} four Inches broad, and twenty or twenty five long, be laid one of them {{parallel}} to the Horizon, the other upon the first, so as at one of their ends to touch one another, and contain an Angle of about 10 or 15 Minutes, and the same be first moisten'd on their inward sides with a clean Cloth dipp'd into Oil of Oranges or <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>Turpentine,</b> and a Drop {{or two of the}} Oil or Spirit be let fall upon the lower Glass at the other; so soon as the upper Glass is laid down upon the lower, so as to touch it at one end as above, and to touch the Drop at the other end, making with the lower Glass an Angle of about 10 or 15 Minutes; the Drop will begin to move towards the Concourse of the Glasses, and will continue to move with an accelerated Motion, till it arrives at that Concourse of the Glasses. For the two Glasses attract the Drop, and make it run that way towards which the Attractions incline. And if when the Drop is in motion you lift up that end of the Glasses where they meet, and towards which the Drop moves, the Drop will ascend between the Glasses, and therefore is attracted. And as you lift up the Glasses more and more, the Drop will ascend slower and slower, and at length rest, being then carried downward by its Weight, as much as upwards by the Attraction. And by this means you may know the Force by which the Drop is attracted at all distances from the Concourse of the Glasses.|$|E
60|$|But {{the truth}} of this Proposition will farther appear by observing, that in the Superficies interceding two {{transparent}} Mediums, (such as are Air, Water, Oil, common Glass, Crystal, metalline Glasses, Island Glasses, white transparent Arsenick, Diamonds, &c.) the Reflexion is stronger or weaker accordingly, as the Superficies hath a greater or less refracting Power. For in the Confine of Air and Sal-gem 'tis stronger than in the Confine of Air and Water, and still stronger in the Confine of Air and common Glass or Crystal, and stronger in the Confine of Air and a Diamond. If any of these, and such like transparent Solids, be immerged in Water, its Reflexion becomes, much weaker than before; and still weaker if they be immerged in the more strongly refracting Liquors of well rectified Oil of Vitriol or <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>Turpentine.</b> If Water be distinguish'd into two parts by any imaginary Surface, the Reflexion in the Confine of those two parts is none at all. In the Confine of Water and Ice 'tis very little; in that of Water and Oil 'tis something greater; in that of Water and Sal-gem still greater; and in that of Water and Glass, or Crystal or other denser Substances still greater, accordingly as those Mediums differ more or less in their refracting Powers. Hence in the Confine of common Glass and Crystal, {{there ought to be a}} weak Reflexion, and a stronger Reflexion in the Confine of common and metalline Glass; though I have not yet tried this. But in the Confine of two Glasses of equal density, there is not any sensible Reflexion; as was shewn in the first Observation. And the same may be understood of the Superficies interceding two Crystals, or two Liquors, or any other Substances in which no Refraction is caused. So then the reason why uniform pellucid Mediums (such as Water, Glass, or Crystal,) have no sensible Reflexion but in their external Superficies, where they are adjacent to other Mediums of a different density, is because all their contiguous parts have one and the same degree of density.|$|E

60|$|Now {{that part}} of the {{resisting}} Power of any Medium which arises from the Tenacity, Friction or Attrition of the Parts of the Medium, may be diminish'd by dividing the Matter into smaller Parts, and making the Parts more smooth and slippery: But {{that part of}} the Resistance which arises from the Vis inerti√¶, is proportional to the Density of the Matter, and cannot be diminish'd by dividing the Matter into smaller Parts, nor by any other means than by decreasing the Density of the Medium. And for these Reasons the Density of fluid Mediums is very nearly proportional to their Resistance. Liquors which differ not much in Density, as Water, Spirit of Wine, <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>Turpentine,</b> hot Oil, differ not much in Resistance. Water is thirteen or fourteen times lighter than Quick-silver and by consequence thirteen or fourteen times rarer, and its Resistance is less than that of Quick-silver in the same Proportion, or thereabouts, as I have found by Experiments made with Pendulums. The open Air in which we breathe is eight or nine hundred times lighter than Water, and by consequence eight or nine hundred times rarer, and accordingly its Resistance is less than that of Water in the same Proportion, or thereabouts; as I have also found by Experiments made with Pendulums. And in thinner Air the Resistance is still less, and at length, by ratifying the Air, becomes insensible. For small Feathers falling in the open Air meet with great Resistance, but in a tall Glass well emptied of Air, they fall as fast as Lead or Gold, as I have seen tried several times. Whence the Resistance seems still to decrease in proportion to the Density of the Fluid. For I do not find by any Experiments, that Bodies moving in Quick-silver, Water or Air, meet with any other sensible Resistance than what arises from the Density and Tenacity of those sensible Fluids, as they would do if the Pores of those Fluids, and all other Spaces, were filled with a dense and subtile Fluid. Now if the Resistance in a Vessel well emptied of Air, was but an hundred times less than in the open Air, it would be about a million of times less than in Quick-silver. But it seems to be much less in such a Vessel, and still much less in the Heavens, at the height of three or four hundred Miles from the Earth, or above. For Mr. Boyle has shew'd that Air may be rarified above ten thousand times in Vessels of Glass; and the Heavens are much emptier of Air than any Vacuum we can make below. For since the Air is compress'd by the Weight of the incumbent Atmosphere, and the Density of Air is proportional to the Force compressing it, it follows by Computation, that at the height of about seven and a half English Miles from the Earth, the Air is four times rarer than at the Surface of the Earth; and at the height of 15 Miles it is sixteen times rarer than that at the Surface of the Earth; and at the height of 22-1/2, 30, or 38 Miles, it is respectively 64, 256, or 1024 times rarer, or thereabouts; and at the height of 76, 152, 228 Miles, it is about 1000000, 1000000000000, or 1000000000000000000 times rarer; and so on.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} tap into the sap {{producing}} layers of the tree, turpentiners used a combination of hacks to remove the pine bark.

Turpentiners wounded trees in V-shaped streaks {{down the length of the}} trunks so as to channel the oleoresin into containers. It was then collected and processed into <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>turpentine.</b> Oleoresin yield may be increased by as much as 40% by applying paraquat herbicides to the exposed wood.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{technique for}} applying pure tung oil is to dilute the oil 1:1 with solvent, then apply {{a succession of}} very thin films with a soft non-fuzzy cloth such as tee-shirt cotton. Diluents range from traditional <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>turpentine</b> to any <b>of</b> the new citrus-based thinners to naphtha. The choice of thinner should be guided by how fast the coating needs to set. Naphtha works well in spray-on applications in well ventilated studios. Primary coats may be laid down at a 1:1 oil-to-thinner ratio, and successive layers, if not absorbed into the wood, at higher solvent to oil concentrations. This technique brings out the deepest color of the wood while maintaining a matte finish.|$|R

50|$|Rosin is the {{resinous}} constituent of the oleo-resin exuded {{by various}} species of pine, known in commerce as crude turpentine. The {{separation of the}} oleo-resin into the essential oil (<b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>turpentine)</b> and common rosin is accomplished by distillation in large copper stills.

Rosin varies in color, according to the age of the tree from which the turpentine is drawn and the degree of heat applied in distillation, from an opaque, almost pitch-black substance through grades of brown and yellow to an almost perfectly transparent colorless glassy mass. The commercial grades are numerous, ranging by letters from A (the darkest) to N (extra pale), superior to which are W (window glass) and WW (water-white) varieties, the latter having about three times the value of the common qualities.|$|E

40|$|Early {{studies of}} the mammary gland and its {{innervation}} led to the belief, {{at least in some}} quarters, that mammary activity is {{under the control of the}} nervous system. 6 With the development of endocrinology, however, growth and function of the mammary apparatus were found to be determined by secretions of the ovaries and hypophysis. In a number of species mammary development identical with that occurring during pregnancy has been induced by the proper administration of ovarian hormones, and in some species full lactation has followed the administration of lactogenic substance from the hypophysis to animals whose mammary glands have grown under the influence of extrinsic ovarian hormones. " 4 In the normal sequence of events in the intact animal, however, full lactation does not occur until the parturient animal has been suckled. Moreover, cessation of suckling is rather promptly followed in the fully lactating animal by termination of lactation and by mammary involution. 14 In explanation of these commonly observed facts it has been suggested 0 11, 12, 13 that irritation of the nipples by suckling sets up centripetal nerve impulses which, by stimulation of the hypophysis, lead to maintenance of the mammary glands and of lactation. If this explanation is correct, adequate irritation of the nipples by artificial means in the complete absence of young should exert the same effect as suckling, without the complicating factor of a possible psychic effect of the mere presence of the young. The experiments reported here were designed to test this assumption, in the belief that retardation of mammary involution by chemical irritation of the nipples would establish nipple irritation as at least one of the means by which suckling maintains the lactating mammary gland. Mice were used as the test animals and <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>turpentine</b> was employed as the irritant.
