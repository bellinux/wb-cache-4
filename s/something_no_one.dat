5|$|Paciorek, {{who was the}} {{starting}} right fielder, began {{the day with a}} walk in the second inning. He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had a walk in the sixth, and ended the day with a leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 134 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He had a perfect major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 {{as a result of his}} performance that day, <b>something</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done.|$|E
500|$|When he {{graduated}} from high school in 1997, Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6' 1". He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I looked at him and said, Well, we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to tell you I saw <b>something</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else did, but he was just better than what we had." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 4, 2010, {{the release}} date was {{announced}} as November 22, 2010. Prior to its release, West initiated the free music program GOOD Fridays through his website on August 20, 2010, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday of the week, {{a portion of}} which were included on the album. Titled after his imprint label GOOD Music, the program generated considerable publicity {{in the months leading}} up to the album's release. Online marketing coordinator Karen Civil said of the program in retrospect, [...] "It's a genius idea. He did <b>something</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had ever done before, and at a point when he was the most hated person in music, he brought excitement back with his Friday releases". G.O.O.D. Fridays was originally intended to continue through December, but was extended by West through January 2011. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was released as a digital download on Amazon.com at a list price of $3.99, which coincided with the site's $3 discount promotional offer on MP3 purchases made valid through the release week.|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} the Ethical Culture School, Marshall spent a year at Columbia University. In 1920, he {{transferred}} to the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. [...] Marshall had decided in his teens {{that he wanted to}} be a forester, writing then about his love of [...] "the woods and solitude;" [...] he wrote that he [...] "should hate to spend the greater part of my lifetime in a stuffy office or in a crowded city". For a while he was unhappy and withdrawn at Syracuse. But, he succeeded academically and was known for his individuality. As one classmate put it, Marshall was [...] "always doing <b>something</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else would ever think of doing. He was constantly rating things—the Adirondack peaks, his best days with George, and dozens of others." [...] Marshall became a member of Alpha Xi Sigma, the forestry college's honor society. He ran on the Syracuse University freshman track team and participated in both junior varsity lacrosse and cross country running. Halfway through school, Marshall had become a class leader; he was elected as class secretary and appointed an associate editor of the Empire Forester, the College's yearbook.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Indian Music and the West (1997), Gerry Farrell {{refers to the}} song when {{discussing}} its author's contribution to popularising Indian classical music, writing: [...] "It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain among the most imaginative and successful examples {{of this type of}} fusion – for example, 'Blue Jay Way' and 'The Inner Light.'" [...] Simon Leng writes of the song: [...] "Harrison was working at a sophisticated level of extrapolating Indian scales to the Western setting, <b>something</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else had done … 'Blue Jay Way' explores the structures of Indian music just as 'Within You Without You' debates its philosophical roots." [...] In her song review for the music website Something Else!, Kit O'Toole describes [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] as one of its composer's [...] "most eccentric and abstract compositions" [...] and [...] "the perfect snapshot of the Beatles' most unusually creative artistic phase". Former Record Collector editor Peter Doggett, writing in Barry Miles' The Beatles Diary, similarly admires the recording, saying that the Beatles rendered the song [...] "an exotic, almost mystical journey" [...] that evokes a mysterious Eastern mood [...] "without a single Indian instrument being employed". Music critic Jim DeRogatis ranks [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] at number 7 in his list of the Beatles' best psychedelic rock songs.|$|E
2500|$|Challenged by Tom Maschler, of the British {{publishing}} firm Jonathan Cape, to [...] "do <b>something</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{has ever}} done before" [...] with a picture book, Williams {{set out in the}} 1970s to create a book of paintings that readers would study carefully rather than flip through and discard. The book's objective, the hunt for a valuable treasure, became his means to this end. Masquerade features fifteen detailed paintings illustrating the story of a hare named Jack Hare, who seeks to carry a treasure from the Moon (depicted as a woman) to her love object, the Sun (a man). On reaching the Sun, Jack finds that he has lost the treasure, and the reader is left to discover its location.|$|E

The witch replied with his grandmother's accent, [...] "Hut tut, what has happened now?" [...] On another occasion, an Englishman stopped to visit and offered to investigate. On remarking on his family overseas, the witch suddenly began to mimic his English parents. Again at early morning, the witch woke him to voices of his parents worried as they had heard his voice as well. The Englishman quickly left that morning and later wrote to the Bell family the entity had visited his family in England and apologized for his skepticism.|$|E
2500|$|Although Kobach's {{campaign}} treasurer, Tom Arpke, possessed campaign experience, {{losing a}} state senate race in 2008, winning a Salina City Council seat the next year, {{and a state}} House seat in 2010, he {{was found to have}} under-reported contributions by $35,000 and nearly $43,000 in expenditures in Kobach's 2010 campaign, resulting in a maximum $5,000 fine. Kobach complained that he was being discriminated against because former Republican Governor Bill Graves received a much smaller fine for similar violations. Kobach alleged, [...] "The only real distinction I can see is that I'm a conservative and he's a moderate." [...] The chair of the Kansas ethics commission said [...] "The commission does not condone lack of candor before the commission." [...] When he obtained convictions of Kansans for interstate voting irregularities in 2016, Kobach said, [...] "The fines are “exactly what I wanted to see in cases like this when I made the case before Kansas Legislature that this authority was needed ... A $5,000 fine is very significant, and hopefully <b>something</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would want to have to pay”, he said.|$|E
2500|$|It took 15 {{minutes for}} Don Canham {{to be sold}} on Bo Schembechler, {{resulting}} in Schembechler becoming the 15th coach in Michigan football history. At the time, Schembechler's current employer, the Miami RedHawks, could have thrown more money at Schembechler, but Canham managed to sell Schembechler on Michigan's tradition and prestige. Schembechler's respect for Michigan was evident early on when assistants complained about how the equipment they had was worse than {{what they had to}} work with at Miami. Schembechler gestured to a rusty chair and said, [...] "See this chair? Fielding Yost sat in this chair. See this nail? Fielding Yost hung his hat on that nail. And you're telling me we had better stuff at Miami? No men, we didn't. We have tradition here, Michigan tradition, and that's <b>something</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else has!" [...] Schembechler immediately got to work in turning around his team. He had a reputation for being hard on his players, causing 65 of his 140 players to quit the team before the season even started. In response, Schembechler promised his team [...] "Those Who Stay Will be Champions," [...] assuring the players that remained that their efforts would be rewarded.|$|E

2500|$|Many experts {{disagree}} with Kramer's assessment of Laver. For example, Dan Maskell, John Barrett, Joe McCauley, Ted Schroeder, and Tony Trabert rank Laver {{as the best}} of all time. Schroeder has been quoted by Alan Trengove as saying, [...] "You take all the criteria – longevity, playing on grass and clay, amateur, professional, his behaviour, his appearance – in all criteria, Laver's the best player of all time." [...] Trabert said in January 2008, [...] "I still maintain that Rod Laver is the best player who ever played the game because he's done <b>something</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has ever done in the 120 or 140-year history of our sport: he won the Grand Slam as an amateur and he won the Grand Slam as a pro. If someone in some other sport held a world record no one else had, you would say that person was the best in that sport. So in my view, you've got to say Laver is the best player of all time." [...] Similarly, the tennis author Peter Bodo wrote in May 2008, [...] "Give him credit? Shoot, the only real issue is whether the GOAT [...] argument is a debate at all, given that posting those two Slams puts Laver in a league of his own." [...] Other experts cite the fact that during his amateur, touring professional, and Open Era careers, Laver won a record 184 singles titles. He also holds the record for most titles won in a single year during the amateur era (22 in 1962), during the touring pro era (19 in 1967), and during the Open Era (18 in 1969). After turning professional in 1963, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times and the Wembley Pro Championship four times from 1964 to 1967. In 1967, Laver won a [...] "Professional Grand Slam" [...] by winning all four of the major professional tournaments: the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championships, the French Pro Championship, and the Wimbledon Pro.|$|E

Nothing fatal had yet happened. The Duke owed Lord Dice about five thousand pounds, and Temple Grace owed him as many hundreds.
