A good economic theory should be built on <b>sound</b> <b>economic</b> <b>principles</b> tested on many free markets, and proven to be valid. However, empirical facts have been alleged to indicate that the principles of economics hold only under very limited conditions that are rarely met in real life, and there is no scientific testing methodology available to validate hypotheses. Decisions based on economic theories that are not scientifically possible to test can give people a false sense of precision, and that could be misleading, leading to build up logical errors.|$|E

40|$|The design, {{selection}} {{and operation of}} food processing equipment should be based not only on <b>sound</b> engineering and <b>economic</b> <b>principles,</b> {{but also on the}} retention of quality and safety of the food product. Recent research and advances in engineering science, food science, and physical chemistry of foods have established food process engineering as a separate engineering discipline similar to chemical engineering. However, due to the complexity and sensitivity of foods, the application of engineering advances to food processing equipment has been slow, and empirical approaches are still used. The increasing need for high quality, nutritious, and safe food products, produced in large quantities at low cost, requires efficient processing equipment, designed and operated on the basis of transport phenomena, physical properties, and chemical/biological kinetics of food processes. Examples are given principally from the processing of fruits and vegetables, which are very sensitive to flavor, color, and texture changes. © 1995 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In most {{countries}} of Central and Eastern Europe {{the process of}} transition to market economy resulted in an increasingly subsistence type of agriculture. The extent of subsistence farming varies {{from one country to}} another, but the phenomenon is universally present. The very existence, yet expansion of subsistence agriculture has been perceived as a paradox. It is sufficient to remind that it simply does not fit the definition of transition, which is viewed as a process that has to bring about the market into economy, the same market that went missing in agriculture. The latter would incline one to consider subsistence agriculture as a temporary phenomenon that will perish as transition advances. The basic textbook economic theory views subsistence agriculture as implicitly irrational and contradicting the <b>sound</b> <b>economic</b> logic and <b>principles.</b> This is also the prevailing opinion on the nature of subsistence agriculture in transition economies, as well as in general. This paper challenges this viewpoint and argues that subsistence agriculture is not only logical consequence from the worsened economic conditions at individual level, but it contributes to the overall market stability. Developing the argument with regard to Bulgaria, which is a country with a large share of subsistence agriculture, as an illustration, it dismisses the claims that subsistence causes waste of production resources and loss of overall welfare. Conversely, it is demonstrates that subsistence agriculture increases both production and consumption. ...|$|R

In recent years, competition between ports and the drive towards commercialisation and privatisation have necessitated the restructuring of the charges in many ports according to <b>sound</b> <b>economic</b> <b>principles.</b> The contention in this thesis is that the charges in South African ports can be restructured in accordance with such principles, provided the monopoly profits at present earned on wharfage are eventually foregone, but that revenue neutrality can be maintained during the phasing-in period. The existing tariffs for all South African ports are then restructured in accordance with the principles involved and examples of the port expenses of ship and cargo owners before and after the restructuring are given. While these examples prove the hypothesis, it is pointed out that conclusions cannot be simplistically derived from such comparisons, because the efficiency in the use of port land and the handling of cargo will increase as an outcome of the incentives to such efficiency, which the new charges will create...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{estimate}} {{a set of}} welfare weights for Turkey, based on per capita regional incomes, and to present them for possible policy consideration by the government. Design/methodology/approach – An {{important component of the}} regional welfare weight measure is the elasticity of marginal utility of income (e), and it is estimated using a tax-based method incorporating the principle of equal absolute sacrifice of satisfaction. Findings – The estimated measure of e for Turkey is 1. 25, and this value, in combination with per capita income levels, produces measured regional welfare weights for the poorest provinces that are over ten times as high as those for the richest provinces. Research limitations/implications – A lack of suitable data makes it difficult to use alternative approaches to the tax-based method for the purpose of cross checking results for e. Results based on these other approaches involving behavioural evidence are presented for some other countries for comparison purposes. Originality/value – This paper presents estimates of regional welfare weights for Turkey based on <b>sound</b> <b>economic</b> <b>principles.</b> It will be of interest to academics who are concerned with issues relating to cost-benefit analysis as well as practitioners who are involved in the allocation of public funds to different regions in Turkey.

The central {{objective of this}} study is to analyze the Indonesian government's banking system policies, identify the causes of the financial crisis and analyze the government's efforts in response to the crisis. This thesis investigates the government's policies and its efforts in reviving the banking sector by using archival research, as well as a literature search of books, magazine articles, Internet articles, newspaper articles, and other library information sources. A program of recapitalization and restructurization of the banking system was a prime factor in the economic recovery in Indonesia. One lesson learned was that the central bank, as the monetary authority was not free from external pressure, especially from the government As a result, policies were adopted to respond to immediate problems as they arose, without consideration of broader economic consequences, which in turn created other unforeseen problems. When a new Indonesian government rose to power, it improved the legal foundation of the monetary authority to make decisions, by clarifying its power and duties, and protecting it from external intervention or pressures.

40|$|Background—Patient-centered {{health care}} interventions, such as heart failure disease {{management}} programs, are under increasing pressure to demonstrate good value. Variability in costing methods and assumptions in economic evaluations of such interventions limit the comparability of cost estimates across studies. Valid cost estimation {{is critical to}} conducting economic evaluations and for program budgeting and reimbursement negotiations. Methods and Results—Using <b>sound</b> <b>economic</b> <b>principles,</b> we developed the Tools for Economic Analysis of Patient Management Interventions in Heart Failure (TEAM-HF) Costing Tool, a spreadsheet program {{that can be used}} by researchers and health care managers to systematically generate cost estimates for economic evaluations and to inform budgetary decisions. The tool guides users on data collection and cost assignment for associated personnel, facilities, equipment, supplies, patient incentives, miscellaneous items, and start-up activities. The tool generates estimates of total program costs, cost per patient, and cost per week and presents results using both standardized and customized unit costs for side-by-side comparisons. Results from pilot testing indicated that the tool was well-formatted, easy to use, and followed a logical order. Cost estimates of a 12 -week exercise training program in patients with heart failure were generated with the costing tool and were found to be consistent with estimates published in a recent study. Conclusions—The TEAM-HF Costing Tool could prove to be a valuable resource for researchers and health care managers to generate comprehensive cost estimates of patient-centered interventions in heart failure or other conditions for conducting high-quality economic evaluations and making well-informed health care management decisions...|$|E

40|$|Economists' {{favorite}} {{remedy for}} traffic congestion is road pricing. Not only is road pricing based on <b>sound</b> <b>economic</b> <b>principles,</b> but also given current technology {{it could be}} implemented at reasonable cost and in a flexible and sophisticated manner. But there are serious obstacles to the widespread adoption of road pricing. There are problems of phase-in: the fixed costs of introducing any system of road pricing, {{as well as the}} problems of coordinating road pricing across jurisdictions, including standardization and the treatment of out-of-towners. Political acceptability is an even more serious obstacle. How can congestion pricing be 'sold' to economically unsophisticated voters who are justifiably suspicious of any new government taxes and charges? This paper will not argue against road pricing, though it will point out some of the difficulties associated with the policy that economists have tended to ignore or to gloss over. Rather, it will examine some of the alternatives to road pricing. More specifically, it will focus on two related questions, one positive, one normative, on the assumption that congestion pricing is not introduced, at least on city streets. The positive question: What are the likely effects of policies other than road pricing on alleviating road congestion? The normative question: What mix of policies (road pricing excluded) would be most effective in alleviating traffic congestion? Throughout the focus will be on urban traffic congestion. Alternatives to road pricing can be grouped into five categories: 1. Expansion and upgrading of existing road capacity; 2. Expansion and upgrading of mass transit; 3. Regulation; 4. Information; 5. Non-road transport pricing. While the emphasis of the paper will be on qualitative analysis, there will be some attempts at quantification via back-of-the-envelope calculations. traffic congestion, road pricing...|$|E
40|$|The {{aggregate}} {{picture of}} world economic growth shows a remarkable diversity in growth performance, both geographically and across time. We find high growth countries and low growth countries; {{countries that have}} grown rapidly throughout time, and countries that have experienced growth spurts {{for a decade or}} two; countries that took off around 1980, and countries whose growth collapsed around 1980. What is the role of policy in this diversity? How can policy help transform this picture? This paper tries to answer these questions, analysing the performance of the high growth developing countries and the way they developed institutional innovations. Analysis of the success story of China, with an astonishing annual growth rate of 8. 0 percent since the late 1970 s, together with other well-known East Asian experiences that have taken place in countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, provide the basis to build some stylised facts about the take-off and the process of sustaining economic growth. On the other hand, the experience of liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation in countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru have offered substantial evidence that allows us to question the standard formulae used to propel and maintain economic growth. The paper puts forth three main conclusions that could be extensive to the growth of sub-national regions: a) Successful reforms are those that put together <b>sound</b> <b>economic</b> <b>principles</b> and local capabilities, constraints and opportunities; b) Economic growth is not the natural order of things, and setting up a fair and levelled ground {{may not be enough to}} stimulate productive dynamism; c) Institutional innovation requires a not be enough to stimulate productive dynamism; pragmatic approach that avoids ideological lock-in.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, 2003. 1. Introduction and Context Oil as {{a source}} of energy is an undisputed reality of the age in which we live. The oil and {{petroleum}} industry is an essential and valuable part of the South African economy. It follows then that transportation in this industry is of crucial importance. Simply put, without the efficient transportation of the various crude and petroleum products, the energy requirements of the country could not be met. While there are various modes of transportation within South Africa servicing this industry, this study will concentrate on the carriage of crude oil and petroleum products by sea, and its handiing in the associated ports. The main objective will be to examine the pricing structure raised by the ports of South Africa against the oil industry for th'a transportation of the crude and petroleum products moving through the various ports. 1. 1 Background During this researcher's tenure as a shipping agent on behalf of the oil majors in the ports of South Africa, the pori authorities' charges were dealt with on a regular basis. The inherent problems with the charges and the resulting conflicts created between the port authorities and the oil majors became quite familiar to the researcher during her years of working with the two parties. 1. 2 Objectives of the Study This study will start by looking at the economic theory and principles of port pricing structures. Chapter Two will work toward outlining the optimal port pricing structure a port authority should adopt, in order to ensure it is working according to <b>sound</b> <b>economic</b> <b>principles</b> as well as meeting the various objectives of the stakeholders utilising the port's infrastructure, superstructure and services. Chapter will focus on the South African oil industry and the importance of crude oil and its petroleum derivates as an energy source. The industry will placed in larger context of SADC, the various role players will be identified and the modes of transport used for the carriage of crude and petroleum products will outlined. The chapter will close with a presentation of the product costing for the petrol price South African consumers' pay at the petrol pumps. Chapter Four presents an overview of the ports South Africa, their facilities, their management arrangements and their pricing structures. A brief. history of the ports will be followed by a discussion of the need a restructuring process and an outline the proposed privatisation process will be Following this, the current management structure related pricing tariffs will be detailed. Chapter Africa and will explore the relationship ben. veen of the ports of South oil industry. history of this relationship will be set out, followed by the current dynamics affecting it. The study will then move on to examine the oil industry infrastructure found in these ports in terms of ownership management of Port tariffs and the question of who actually pays what will be addressed. The that created and continue to create tensions between oil majors and the ports of South Africa will highlighted. The chapter will conclude by presenting an ideal pricing structure, which could work towards resolving some of these issues. Chapter Six will discuss two different international models based on energy demand and supply similar to South African situation. The port pricing structure of these models will then be compared to that of South African ports in order to present a best-working practice. The purpose of this is to bring in an international perspective for the ideal pricing structure presented with the conclusion in Chapter Seven. 1 Methodology of the study The researcher initially used interviews with the various bodies as a means of gathering information.

Conformity of competition law with <b>economic</b> <b>principles</b> is manifested in numerous reforms recently implemented in various areas of competition policy, {{as well as in}} the â? more economic approachâ?T towards European merger control. In the field of market definition, the transition to more economic-based methods was prompted by the promulgation of the 1997 Commissionâ?Ts Notice on the definition of the relevant market, which introduced an economic test to govern its market delineation procedure. Notwithstanding these developments, incorporating <b>economic</b> <b>principles</b> into the existing competition law framework remains a challenging task.
