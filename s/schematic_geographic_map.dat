The first supplement map, which appeared in the May 1918 issue of the magazine, titled The Western Theatre of War, served as a reference for overseas military personnel and soldiers' families alike. On some occasions, the Society's map archives have been used by the United States government in instances where its own cartographic resources were limited.President Franklin D.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the aspect map approach {{to model the}} processing of <b>geographic</b> <b>maps.</b> <b>Geographic</b> <b>maps</b> are described as spatial representation media which {{play an important role}} in many processes of human spatial cognition. We focus on the aspectuality of representation and therefore deal with aspect maps: spatial organization structures in which one or more aspects of geographic entities are represented. The aspect map architecture is presented, an AI model of processing <b>geographic</b> <b>maps.</b> Two processes contained in this model are investigated in more detail. The first is the transformation of one aspect map into another aspect map which only retains selected entities and aspects (extraction). The second process is the combination of two aspect maps, in order to obtain a third aspect map. The results of an empirical study show that the formal approach can describe and distinguish the ways in which people solve this task. ...|$|R

This paper reviews several <b>geographic</b> <b>mapping</b> efforts of SARS on the Internet that employ a variety of techniques like choropleth rendering, graduated circles, graduated pie charts, buffering, overlay analysis and animation. The aim of these mapping services is to educate the public (especially travellers to potentially at-risk areas) and assist public health authorities in analysing the spatial and temporal trends and patterns of SARS and in assessing/revising current control measures. </p...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{applications}} of {{principal components analysis}} (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) in human population genetics have found that "statistical maps" based on the genotypes in population-genetic samples often resemble <b>geographic</b> <b>maps</b> of the underlying sampling locations. To provide formal tests of these qualitative observations, we describe a Procrustes analysis approach for quantitatively assessing the similarity of population-genetic and <b>geographic</b> <b>maps.</b> We confirm in two scenarios, one using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from Europe and one using SNP data worldwide, that a measurably high level of concordance exists between statistical maps of population-genetic variation and <b>geographic</b> <b>maps</b> of sampling locations. Two other examples illustrate the versatility of the Procrustes approach in population-genetic applications, verifying the concordance of SNP analyses using PCA and MDS, and showing that statistical maps of worldwide copy-number variants (CNVs) accord with statistical maps of SNP variation, especially when CNV analysis is limited to samples with the highest-quality data. As statistical maps with PCA and MDS have become increasingly common for use in summarizing population relationships, our examples highlight the potential of Procrustes-based quantitative comparisons for interpreting the results in these maps. ...|$|R
