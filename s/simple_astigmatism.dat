40|$|We {{investigate}} a non-homogeneous layered structure encompassing dual spatial dispersion: continuous diffraction in one transverse dimension and discrete diffraction in the orthogonal one. Such dual diffraction can be balanced out {{by one and}} the same nonlinear response, giving rise to light self-confinement into astigmatic spatial solitons: self-focusing can compensate for the spreading of a bell-shaped beam, leading to quasi- 2 D solitary wavepackets which result from 1 D transverse self-localization combined with a discrete soliton. We demonstrate such intensity-dependent beam trapping in chiral soft matter, exhibiting one-dimensional discrete diffraction along the helical axis and one-dimensional continuous diffraction in the orthogonal plane. In nematic liquid crystals with suitable birefringence and chiral arrangement, the reorientational nonlinearity is shown to support bell-shaped solitary waves with <b>simple</b> <b>astigmatism</b> dependent on the medium birefringence {{as well as on the}} dual diffraction of the input wavepacket. The observations are in agreement with a nonlinear nonlocal model for the all-optical response...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] To {{assess the}} changes in falling risk {{depending}} on the induced axis direction of astigmatism using cylindrical lenses in a static posture. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty subjects (10 males, 10 females; mean age, 23. 4 ± 2. 70 years) fully corrected by subjective refraction participated. To induce myopic <b>simple</b> <b>astigmatism</b> conditions, cylindrical lenses of + 0. 50, + 1. 00, + 1. 50, + 2. 00, + 3. 00, + 4. 00, and + 5. 00 D were used. The direction of astigmatic axes were induced under five conditions with increased cylindrical powers:, 180 °, 90 °, and 45 ° on both eyes; 180 °/ 90 ° right/left eye, and 45 °/ 135 ° right/left eye. Changes in the fall risk index were analyzed using the TETRAX biofeedback system. Measurements were performed for 32 seconds for each condition. [Results] The fall risk index increased significantly from C+ 4. 00 D in 180 °/ 90 ° right/left eye, C+ 3. 00 D in 45 °/ 135 ° right/left eye, and C+ 3. 00 D in 45 ° on both eyes versus corrected emmetropia. Among the five axis conditions with the same cylindri-cal power lenses, {{the increase in the}} fall risk index was highest at 45 ° in both eyes. [Conclusion] Uncorrected oblique astigmatism may increase falling risk compared to with-the-rule and against-the-rule astigmatism. Clinical special-ists should consider appropriate correction of astigmatism for preventing falls, especially for uncorrected oblique astigmatism...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the frequency of}} behavioral disorders in children with significant refractive error and to compare the results with those of emmetropic children. MethodsIn this prospective, comparative study from January to September 2013, refractive errors of all 5 – 12 -year-old children who referred to a general eye clinic were recorded. A validated Persian version of the Rutter A scale was filled out by the parents {{for the evaluation of}} the child's behavioral disorders. The Rutter A scale scores of children with significant refractive error were compared with those of emmetropic eyes. Student t test, Chi square test, and Fisher's exact test were used for analysis. Differences with a P value less than 0. 05 were considered significant. ResultsOne hundred eighty-three patients, including 101 patients with significant refractive error and 82 emmetropic subjects, were studied. Overall, 44 patients (24 %) had behavioral disorders, according to the Rutter A scale scores. Thirty patients (29. 7 %) with significant refractive error and 14 emmetropic subjects (16. 9 %) had behavioral disorders (P =  0. 043).

40|$|Background: The {{magnitude}} of astigmatism among adults {{is not only}} high but also has a wide variation worldwide. 12, 13, 33 The symptoms associated with morbidity of astigmatism pose many challenges in patient’s performance. If astigmatism remains uncorrected, it {{may be associated with}} poor quality of life, employment prospects, productivity and general health. Uncorrected refractive errors especially astigmatism causes frequent hospital visits with unnecessary expenditure for individuals and governments at large. In many developing countries including Tanzania, there is insufficient data on its magnitude among adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between June and December 2011 to determine the {{magnitude of}} astigmatism among adults attending the refraction unit at Muhimbili National Hospital eye clinic. A total of 1250 patients aged 18 years and above attending refraction unit were enrolled. Both presenting and best corrected visual acuities were taken using Snellen’s chart. After thorough evaluation by ophthalmologist, those patients suspected to have refractive error were refracted objectively and subjectively using self illuminated retinoscope and refinement respectively. Cylindrical powers were refined first by the use of Jackson’s cross cylinder at the appropriate axis followed by spherical refinement by fogging technique. Any error, stigmatic (spherical) or astigmatic (cylindrical) of ¼ diopter or more was considered an error and included in the analysis. This exercise was done by principal investigator in collaboration with a senior optometrist. Statistical computer software (SPSS v. 13. 0) package was used for data analysis and processing. Results: A total of 2495 eyes were studied. The prevalence of refractive error was 79. 7 %. The mean age of the study subjects was 52 years. Most patients were in age group 18 – 27 which accounted for 21. 56 % of study population. Male to female ratio was 0. 8 : 1. Emmetropia was found in 20. 3 % subjects. Astigmatism ranked the second among refractive errors. Hypermetropia was the commonest refractive error (43. 4 %) and myopia (17. 4 %) the least. Among those who were found to have astigmatism, 55 % were females and 45 % were males. Most patients had secondary education (46 %) and were found to be in age group 18 – 47 years (χ 2 = 138, df = 18, p = 0. 000). Mixed astigmatism was the commonest type (43. 1 %), followedby <b>simple</b> <b>astigmatism</b> (30. 4 %) and compound astigmatism (26. 4 %). Compound astigmatism occurred more significantly among males (36. 9 %) while mixed astigmatism was more common (53. 1 %) among females (χ 2 = 44. 5, df = 4, p = 0. 000). The proportion of patients with mixed astigmatism decreased with increasing age. This finding was statistically significant (χ 2 = 33. 5, df = 12, p = 0. 001). Majority of patients with compound astigmatism had impaired vision (χ 2 = 65. 0, df = 4, p = 0. 0001). Most patients (95. 8 %) improved with correction from impaired vision and blindness to normal vision. Patients with mixed astigmatism were the most symptomatic. The commonest symptoms were decreased vision, easy ocular fatigability and headache. Conclusion: There is high prevalence of refractive error including astigmatism at MNH...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{investigate}} {{the change in}} visual acuity (VA) produced by different types of astigmatism (on {{the basis of the}} refractive power and position of the principal meridians) on normal accommodating eyes. MethodsThe lens induced method was employed to simulate a set of 28 astigmatic blur conditions on different healthy emmetropic eyes. Additionally, 24 values of spherical defocus were also simulated on the same eyes for comparison. VA was measured in each case and the results, expressed in logMAR units, were represented against of the modulus of the dioptric power vector (blur strength). ResultsLogMAR VA varies in a linear fashion with increasing astigmatic blur, being the slope of the line dependent on the accommodative demand in each type of astigmatism. However, in each case, we found no statistically significant differences between the three axes investigated (0 °, 45 °, 90 °). Non-statistically significant differences were found either for the VA achieved with spherical myopic defocus (MD) and mixed astigmatism (MA). VA with <b>simple</b> hyperopic <b>astigmatism</b> (SHA) was higher than with <b>simple</b> myopic <b>astigmatism</b> (SMA), however, in this case non conclusive results were obtained in terms of statistical significance. The VA achieved with imposed compound hyperopic astigmatism (CHA) was highly influenced by the eye's accommodative response. ConclusionsVA is correlated with the blur strength in a different way for each type of astigmatism, depending on the accommodative demand. VA is better when one of the focal lines lie on the retina irrespective of the axis orientation; accommodation favors this situation...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{understand}} the common conditions {{of visual impairment}} in cerebral palsy children, and to {{provide the basis for}} early screening of eyes, early diagnosis and treatment, and promote the visual rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy. METHODS:Two hundred and twenty-three children with cerebral palsy underwent routine ophthalmologic examination, including the position of eye and eyeball movement, indirect ophthalmoscopy or Retcam II fundus examination, mydriasis optometry check and flash-visual evoked potential(F-VEP) examination, and the results were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Strabismus,ametropia and changes of F-VEP were the mainly impairments in 223 children with cerebral palsy, and some children also were associated with ocular fundus disease. There were 174 children with different types of strabismus, including 121 children with esotropia, 36 children with exotropia, 15 children with vertical strabismus, and 2 children with nystagmus. There were 129 children(247 eyes) with refractive errors, including 118 eyes with compound hyperopic astigmatism, 51 eyes with simple hyperopia, 33 eyes with mixed astigmatism, 19 eyes with compound myopic astigmatism, 21 eyes with <b>simple</b> hyperopia <b>astigmatism,</b> 4 eyes with <b>simple</b> myopia <b>astigmatism,</b> only 1 eye with simple myopia. The F-VEP of 194 children(381 eyes) were abnormal, and performed as delayed latency and reduced amplitude of P 2 wave. In addition, there were 51 children with different types of ocular fundus changes, in which optic nerve atrophy and retinal hemorrhage were the most common. CONCLUSION: Children with cerebral palsy often are associated with different types of visual dysfunction, which seriously affect the visual quality and systemic rehabilitation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Refractive {{error is}} one of the causes of avoidable blindness. Myopia, {{hypermetropia}} and astigmatism are the common types of refractive error. Not many studies are done to detect pattern of refractive error in Western Nepal. So, the study will determine the prevalence and distribution of refractive errors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study of all consecutive patients of age less than 40 years who visited eye department, Gandaki Medical College, between May 2010 and May 2011 was conducted. Visual acuity, naked eye and pin hole examination was done by ophthalmic assistant with cycloplegic refraction when needed. Those who did not turn up for refraction were excluded from the study. RESULTS: A total of 601 patients were seen within the study period. Mean age of male patients was 22. 4 years ± 0. 6 (95 % CI, 21. 2 - 23. 6 years) and mean age of female patients was 24. 2 years ± 0. 5 (95 % CI, 23. 2 - 25. 2 years). Majority of the patients were in age group 11 - 20 years (39. 3 %). Myopia was the most common refractive error (43. 3 %) followed by <b>simple</b> myopic <b>astigmatism</b> (23. 8 %). Refractive errors were more common in females. CONCLUSIONS: Myopia was the commonest refractive compared to hypermetropia. Refractive error was more common in females than in males.

40|$|Purpose. To {{characterize}} {{and compare}} the corneal shapes and monochromatic aberrations in Chinese myopic adults with and without astigmatism. Methods. Forty-six Hong Kong Chinese aged 50 to 70 years with compound against-the-rule myopic astigmatism (n = 18) or simple myopia (n = 28) were recruited. Corneal shapes were measured by a Scheimpflug-based corneal topographer: the semimeridian corneal shape factors at the nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior corneal quadrants measured from the corneal apex to 3 mm midperiphery were analyzed. The ocular aberrations were measured by the COAS (Complete Ophthalmic Analysis System) Shack-Hartmann wavefront aberrometer; the corneal aberrations were computed using the corneal topographic map data measured by the Medmont E 300 corneal topographer; and the internal aberrations were calculated from the ocular and corneal aberrations. Results. Compared with <b>simple</b> myopia, myopic <b>astigmatism</b> had more oblate nasal and temporal corneal shapes and showed significantly more negative Y trefoil and more positive vertical coma.

The aim of our {{study was to determine}} the surgical outcome of children of infantile glaucoma who presented with acute corneal hydrops. In total, 38 eyes of 31 consecutive children of infantile glaucoma presented with acute corneal hydrops who underwent primary combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy (CTT) by a single surgeon from January 1990 to December 2012 at the LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), a tertiary eye care centre in Southern India were enrolled in this retrospective study. Primary outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP) control (IOP ≤ 16 mmHg under anaesthesia or IOP ≤ 21 mmHg without anaesthesia) and clearance of corneal edema. Secondary outcome measures were visual acuity (VA), corneal diameter, bleb appearance, intraoperative and postoperative complications. Mean age at presentation was 6. 4 months (range, 2 - 11 months) and seven eyes (23 %) had bilateral affliction. At presentation, all eyes (100 %) had moderate to severe degree of corneal edema with a mean preoperative IOP of 25. 6 ± 5. 1 mmHg. Postoperatively, the IOP reduced to 12. 0 ± 3. 8 mmHg (difference = - 13. 6, 95 % CI = - 15. 7 to - 11. 5, t = - 13. 18, p< 0. 0001), and the percentage reduction in IOP was 53. 05 %. Preoperatively 83 % of the eyes were on antiglaucoma medication, and postoperatively 2 eyes (5. 3 %) required 1 antiglaucoma medication for control of IOP. Preoperatively, corneal edema was present in all eyes and postoperatively it cleared in all of them. Significant myopic astigmatism was present in 28 eyes (74 %), the commonest being compound myopic astigmatism (75 %) followed by <b>simple</b> myopic <b>astigmatism</b> (21 %). Normal VA (best-corrected VA; BCVA ≥ 20 / 60) was achieved in 44. 4 % of the eyes and 22. 2 % eyes had low vision (BCVA, < 20 / 60 to 20 / 400).
