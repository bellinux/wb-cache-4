25|$|For this {{challenge}} teams were altered due to blue now having 4 members and red being left with 2 after Jason's departure. Ivan and Katie chose Fenton {{to join their}} team and even the stakes. Next the teams were taken to a sausage kitchen. They then made their own <b>sausage</b> <b>meat</b> and ground it up into one long sausage {{that had to be}} rolled into normal sized sausages. Ivan was quite adapt at creating objects out of balloons so he was named the 'balloon man' for the challenge and helped the red team make over 400 sausages and win the round. New red team member Fenton was given the nickname 'bacon' as he had the reputation of 'bringing home the bacon.' The next part to the challenge was to construct a BBQ straight out of a flat-pack box. The blue team came out on top this time. Once assembled, the two teams then had to cook the sausages they had made for children (and their parents) from the local athletics club, who were now cheering the teams on. Each sausage had to be served with a different condiment. Then as part of the presenting aspect of the show, the teams were each given a megaphone which they used to try to persuade the kids to try their sausages over the other teams. It seemed like an out of control bidding war and while Katie and Bill did well at the task, Fenton didn't even need a microphone. In the end the judges differed in their opinions of who won. Ben believed the red team made the better sausage sizzle while Mark thought blue had it in the bag. Blue were selected as the winners and two from the red team were sent home.|$|E

30|$|Duck {{farming is}} on the raise in the current scenario, but {{processed}} products from duck meat are still uncommon to find. Investigating the duck meat qualities during storage will provide information to enhance duck meat utilization. Development of ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook duck meat products {{is expected to increase}} and improve non-chicken meat-based protein. The Study was aimed to evaluate the changes in quality characteristics of duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> preserved by refrigeration (7  ±  1  °C). Duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> were prepared by utilizing raw and partially cooked duck meat with addition of soy flour at 10 % level as a binder. Different quality characteristics like physical and chemical characteristics, proximate composition, and organoleptic characteristics were evaluated. Cooking loss of partially cooked <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> was lower than raw duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages,</b> whereas emulsion stability and 2 -thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values of raw duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> were lesser than partially cooked <b>meat</b> <b>sausages.</b> Cooking loss and emulsion stability decreased in both types of <b>meat</b> <b>sausages,</b> while, 2 -TBA values increased as refrigerated storage progressed for 14  days. Percent moisture content of raw duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> was higher than partially cooked <b>meat</b> <b>sausages,</b> which decreased in both types of <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> as refrigerated storage progressed for 14  days. Percent crude protein (CP) and percent ether extract (EE) content of partially cooked duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> were higher than raw duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages.</b> Regardless of type of meat used, refrigerated storage of sausages increased CP and EE up to 10 th day but decreased upon further storage up to 14 th day. Organoleptic scores for raw duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> were higher than partially cooked duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> and all the scores decreased with an increase in the storage period. However the scores were within the acceptable limits. The findings prove that, duck meat can be effectively acclaimed as an alternative avenue to meet the escalating protein demand in the form of ready-to-eat product. The quality of sausages is also retained during refrigerated storage.|$|R

We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form.

6000|$|I never shall {{want another}} Turkish lunch. The cooking {{apparatus}} {{was in the}} little lunch room, near the bazaar, {{and it was all}} open to the street. The cook was slovenly, and so was the table, and it had no cloth on it. The fellow took a mass of <b>sausage</b> <b>meat</b> and coated it round a wire and laid it on a charcoal fire to cook. When it was done, he laid it aside and a dog walked sadly in and nipped it. He smelt it first, and probably recognized the remains of a friend. The cook took it away from him and laid it before us. Jack said, [...] "I pass"--he plays euchre sometimes--and we all passed in turn. Then the cook baked a broad, flat, wheaten cake, greased it well with the sausage, and started towards us with it. It dropped in the dirt, and he picked it up and polished it on his breeches, and laid it before us. Jack said, [...] "I pass." [...] We all passed. He put some eggs in a frying pan, and stood pensively prying slabs of meat from between his teeth with a fork. Then he used the fork to turn the eggs with--and brought them along. Jack said [...] "Pass again." [...] All followed suit. We {{did not know what to}} do, and so we ordered a new ration of sausage. The cook got out his wire, apportioned a proper amount of sausage-meat, spat it on his hands and fell to work! This time, with one accord, we all passed out. We paid and left. That is all I learned about Turkish lunches. A Turkish lunch is good, no doubt, but it has its little drawbacks.|$|E

30|$|The {{scope of}} Duck meat as a {{potential}} source of protein supply has been explored. Consumption of duck meat can be enhanced by preparing further processed products, which {{can be defined as}} “transformation of raw carcasses into value-added, easy to prepare and convenient foods” like <b>sausages.</b> Raw Duck <b>Meat</b> <b>Sausages</b> had lesser cooking losses and higher organoleptic scores. Partially Cooked Duck <b>Meat</b> <b>Sausages</b> had better emulsion stability, higher 2 -TBA values, Crude Protein and Ether Extract values. Both raw and partially cooked duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> were acceptable up to 14  days of refrigerated storage, as indicated by the sensory scores.

30|$|At every storage interval, {{the mean}} percent ether extract of raw duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> was {{significantly}} (P <  0.01) lower than partially cooked duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages,</b> irrespective of storage period. Similar to crude protein content, the higher percent ether extract in partially cooked duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> {{might be due}} to significant reduction in moisture content in the sausages during storage. In accordance with the present findings, Serdaroglu (2006) detected a higherether extract contentin cooked beef patties compared to raw meat patties.

The lesser mean percent cooking losses of partially cooked duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> might be due to initial loss of moisture in partially cooked meat.

30|$|Irrespective of {{the storage}} period, {{partially}} cooked duck <b>meat</b> <b>sausages</b> yielded significantly higher {{crude protein content}} than the raw <b>meat</b> <b>sausages.</b> This {{can be attributed to}} the presence of lesser moisture content and consequent increase in dry matter content of partially cooked <b>meat</b> <b>sausages,</b> which in turn, reflected in higher percent crude protein. Serdaroglu (2006) in beef patties, Singh and Verma (2000) in chicken meat patties, recordeda higher percent crude protein content in products added with cooked meat.
