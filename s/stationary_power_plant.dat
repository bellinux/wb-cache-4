Evaporative water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas river water can be re-used. In all cases, the steam plant water, which must be kept pure, is kept separate from the cooling water or air, and once the low-pressure steam condenses into water, it is returned to the boiler.|$|R
40|$|Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells are an {{alternative}} source of electricity generation for automobiles and <b>stationary</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> With increasing concerns on environmental issues, {{recent research has}} focused on maximizing the efficiency and durability as well as minimizing the costs of fuel cells. One of the main areas of research is optimizing the structure of the cathode catalyst layer. The main driving force of this thesis was the effective visualization of nanostructure of the ionomer, which is responsible for proton conduction in the cathode catalyst layer. However, challenges regarding sample preparation and radiation damage still need to be well understood. Different sample preparation techniques of catalyst inks and catalyst coated membranes were used for Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy, such as freeze fracturing, ultramicrotomy and Focused Ion Beam. Comparisons of the microstructure and chemical differences of all components, especially the ionomer, prepared by ultramicrotomy and Focused Ion Beam, was done with Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy applied to the same catalyst coated membrane sample. Detailed spectroscopic information regarding components in both specimens was compared with C 1 s and F 1 s near edge X-ray absorption spectra recorded in a Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscope. Focused Ion Beam causes extensive damage to the carbon support and ionomer but prepares thinner sections than ultramicrotomy...|$|R
40|$|The Liquid Tin Anode Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) is {{a direct}} {{conversion}} fuel cell and does not require fuel processing, reforming or water. 1, 2, 3, 4 Power is generated directly from any solid, liquid or gaseous carbonaceous fuel. Sulfur and carbon species are fuel not a poison to the LTA-SOFC. CellTechâ€™s LTA-SOFC is the only known fuel cell capable of direct operation on heavy hydrocarbons such as military logistics fuel. Its versatility and fuel flexibility allow applications ranging from compact sub-kilowatt portable/mobile <b>power</b> units to <b>stationary</b> MW-scale <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> This poster will discuss technology development activities which address major opportunities in direct coal conversion: References...|$|R
