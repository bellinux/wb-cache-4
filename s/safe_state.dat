5|$|The Greenbackers saw {{the impact}} of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes. Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour of the South in July and August. Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general {{at the head of}} the ticket, faced more opposition. The party's courtship of black voters, too, threatened the white Democratic establishment, leading to violent outbursts at Weaver's rallies and threats against his supporters. As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October, Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states. Although Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors, in state-level races, Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates. In the September gubernatorial race in Maine, one such fusion ticket nominated Harris M. Plaisted, who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to be a <b>safe</b> <b>state</b> for that party. The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign, and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving the bloody shirt.|$|E

25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a <b>safe</b> <b>state.</b> All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E

Safely gas-freeing a tank is accomplished by purging hydrocarbon vapors with inert gas until the hydrocarbon concentration inside the tank is under about 1%. Thus, as air replaces the inert gas, the concentration cannot rise to the lower flammable limit and is safe.|$|E

60|$|Again; {{this may}} inform {{us of the}} <b>safe</b> <b>state</b> of the saints as {{touching}} their perseverance, that they shall stand though Hell rages, though the devil roareth, and all the world endeavoureth the ruin of the saints of God, though some, through ignorance of the virtue of the offering {{of the body of}} Jesus Christ, do say a man may be a child of God today, and a child of the devil tomorrow, which is gross ignorance; for what? Is the blood of Christ, the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, of no more virtue than to bring in for us an uncertain salvation? or must the effectualness of Christ's merits, as touching our perseverance, be helped on by the doings of man? Surely they that are predestinated are also justified; and they that are justified, they shall be glorified (Rom 8:30). Saints, do not doubt of the salvation of your souls, unless you do intend to undervalue Christ's blood; and do not think but that He that hath begun the good work of His grace in you will perfect it to the second coming of our Lord Jesus (Phil 1:6). Should not we, as well as Paul, say, I am persuaded that nothing shall separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus (Rom 8). O let the saints know, that unless the devil can pluck Christ out of Heaven, he cannot pull a true believer out of Christ. When I say a true believer, I do mean such an one as hath the faith of the operation of God in his soul.|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for designing hybrid controllers for large scale, multiagent systems is presented. Our approach {{is based on}} optimal control and game theory. The hybrid design {{is seen as a}} game between two players: the control, which is to be chosen by the designer and the disturbances that encode the actions of other agents (in a multi-agent setting), the actions of high level controllers or the usual unmodeled environmental disturbances. The two players compete over cost functions that encode properties that the closed loop hybrid system needs to satisfy (e. g., safety). The control "wins" the game if it can keep the system "safe" for any allowable disturbance. The solution to the game theory problem provides the designer with continuous controllers as well as sets of <b>safe</b> <b>states</b> where the control "wins" the game. The sets of <b>safe</b> <b>states</b> are used to construct an interface to the discrete domain that guarantees the safe operation of the combined hybrid system. The design methodology is il [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Local {{reasoning}} about programs exploits {{the natural}} local behaviour common in programs by focussing on the footprint - {{that part of}} the resource accessed by the program. We address the problem of formally characterising and analysing the footprint notion for abstract local functions introduced by Calcagno, O Hearn and Yang. With our definition, we prove that the footprints are the only essential elements required for a complete specification of a local function. We formalise the notion of small specifications in local reasoning and show that for well-founded resource models, a smallest specification always exists that only includes the footprints, and also present results for the non-well-founded case. Finally, we use this theory of footprints to investigate the conditions under which the footprints correspond to the smallest <b>safe</b> <b>states.</b> We present a new model of RAM in which, unlike the standard model, the footprints of every program correspond to the smallest <b>safe</b> <b>states,</b> and we also identify a general condition on the primitive commands of a programming language which guarantees this property for arbitrary models.
