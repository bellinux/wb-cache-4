40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{principle}} of capturing images of the retina of fundus camera, their features and then preprocessing. The aim of preprocessing is the correction of nonillumination in images of the retina. The model of non-illumination is obtained by using parametric surfaces. Coons surface was selected from a set of surfaces based on the knowledge of retinal images. This has been approximated by a non-uniform illumination. Then the thesis concentrates on describing the methods involving <b>shading</b> corrections. <b>Compensation</b> of non-uniform illumination {{is based on the}} use of parametric surface and selected methods for shading correction. The methods presented in the last chapter were tested on simulated and real data. The results were evaluated subjectively...|$|R
60|$|He {{asked himself}} if, by any chance, before {{he should have}} {{in some way to}} commit himself, he might feel his mind settled to the new vision, might habituate it, so to speak, to the {{remarkable}} truth. But oh it was too remarkable, the truth; for what could be more remarkable than this sharp rupture of an identity? You could deal with a man as himself--you couldn't deal with him as somebody else. It was a small source of peace moreover to be reduced to wondering how little he might know in such an event what a sum he was setting you. He couldn't absolutely not know, for you couldn't absolutely not let him. It was a CASE then simply, a strong case, as people nowadays called such things,' a case of transformation unsurpassed, and the hope was but in the general law that strong cases were liable to control from without. Perhaps he, Strether himself, was the only person after all aware of it. Even Miss Gostrey, with all her science, wouldn't be, would she?--and he had never seen any one less aware of anything than Waymarsh as he glowered at Chad. The social sightlessness of his old friend's survey marked for him afresh, and almost in an humiliating way, the inevitable limits of direct aid from this source. He was not certain, however, of not drawing a <b>shade</b> of <b>compensation</b> from the privilege, as yet untasted, of knowing more about something in particular than Miss Gostrey did. His situation too was a case, for that matter, and he was now so interested, quite so privately agog, about it, that he had already an eye to the fun it would be to open up to her afterwards. He derived during his half-hour no assistance from her, and just this fact of her not meeting his eyes played a little, it must be confessed, into his predicament.|$|R
40|$|Niche {{differentiation}} {{is a major}} hypothesized {{determinant of}} species distributions, but its practical importance is heavily debated and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Trait-based approaches {{have been used to}} infer niche differentiation and predict species distributions. For understanding underlying mechanisms, individual traits should be scaled up to whole-plant performance, which has rarely been done. We measured seven key traits that are important for carbon and water balance for 37 tropical tree species. We used a process-based plant physiological model to simulate the carbon budget of saplings along gradients of light and water availability, and quantified the performance of the species in terms of their light compensation points (a proxy for <b>shade</b> tolerance), water <b>compensation</b> points (proxy for drought tolerance), and maximum carbon gain rates (proxy for potential growth rate). We linked species performances to their observed distributions (the realized niches) at two spatial scales in Bolivian lowland forests: along a canopy openness gradient at local scale (~ 1 km 2) and along a rainfall gradient (1100 – 2200 mm/yr) at regional (~ 1000 km) scale. We show that the water compensation point was the best predictor of species distributions along water and light resource gradients within and across tropical forests. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the stomatal regulation of minimum leaf water potentials, rather than stem hydraulic traits (sapwood area and specific conductivity), contributed to the species differences in the water compensation point of saplings. The light compensation point and maximum carbon gain, both driven by leaf area index and leaf nitrogen concentration, also contributed to differential species distributions at the local scale, but not or only marginally at the regional scale. Trait-and-physiology-based simulations of whole-plant performance thus help to evaluate the possible roles of individual traits in physiological processes underlying species performance along environmental gradients. The development of such whole-plant concepts will improve our ability to understand responses of plant communities to shifts in resource availability and stress under global change...|$|R
40|$|According to Sverdrup's (1953) {{model of}} the spring bloom, {{phytoplankton}} biomass decreases in winter when the mixed layer depth exceeds the critical depth. We have used a one-dimensional mathematical model integrated by the Lagrangian Ensemble method to simulate a population of diatoms during the winter between two growing seasons off the Azores. The model allows us to diagnose the demographic changes in the simulated diatom population {{from a variety of}} perspectives. The total population falls to a minimum of 70 million diatoms m- 2 at the end of February. The vertical distribution of the population dynamics is first analysed in terms of daily Eulerian averages over 1 m depth intervals. Growth starts in February when the diurnal thermocline becomes shallower than 50 m, but while the mixed layer is still 200 m deep. The natural mortality has a minimum in winter because it is reduced (in the model) with temperature and population density. Eulerian analysis suggests that in winter, diatoms have a life expectancy of more than 3 months, so a significant number will survive the months of December, January and February when there is very little growth. Losses to grazing are negligible in winter. Lagrangian analysis shows how an individual diatom responds to its changing ambient environment caused by variation in depth (due to turbulent mixing) and the diurnal and seasonal changes in the photosynthetically active radiance. The different trajectories followed by the thousands of plankton particles simulated by the model produce diversity in growth rate ranging over several orders of magnitude, so care has to be taken in statistical analysis. The paper ends with a re-assessment {{of the value of the}} critical depth and compensation depth as predictors for onset of the spring bloom. The compensation depth was computed by Eulerian averaging over 1 m depth inter-vals each day. For 1 month after the vernal equinox the compensation depth follows the ascent of the mixed layer as it rises from a depth of 100 m to 40 m. Lagrangian analysis reveals that this is due to the photo-adaptation better matching the ambient irradiance experienced by diatoms in the mixed layer compared with those at the same depth in the seasonal thermo-cline. By mid-April the spring bloom has already ad-vanced so far that self <b>shading</b> influences the <b>compensation</b> depth, which then rises into the mixed layer. We conclude that Sverdrup's criterion is not useful for predicting changes in the diatom population simulated by our model...|$|R
