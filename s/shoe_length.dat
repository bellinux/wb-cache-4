The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether people with diabetic sensory neuropathy wear appropriate length footwear. Methods A case–control design was used to compare internal <b>shoe</b> <b>length</b> and foot length differences between a group of people with diabetes and peripheral sensory neuropathy and a group of people without diabetes and no peripheral sensory neuropathy. Shoe and foot length measurements were taken using a calibrated Internal Shoe Size Gauge® and a Brannock Device®, respectively. Results Data was collected from 85 participants with diabetes and 118 participants without diabetes. The mean difference between shoe and foot length was not significantly different between the two groups. However, a significant number of participants within both groups had a shoe to foot length difference that lay outside a previously suggested 10 to 15 mm range. From the diabetic and non-diabetic groups 82 % (70 / 85) and 66 % (78 / 118), respectively had a foot to <b>shoe</b> <b>length</b> difference outside this same range. Conclusions This study shows that although there is no significant difference in shoe-length fit between participants with and without neuropathy, a significant proportion of these populations wear shoes that are either too long or too short for their foot length according to the 10 to 15 mm value used for comparison. The study has highlighted the need for standardised approaches when considering the allowance required between foot and internal <b>shoe</b> <b>length</b> and for the measurement and comparison of foot and shoe dimensions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Wearing <b>shoes</b> of {{insufficient}} <b>length</b> {{during childhood}} {{has often been}} cited as leading to deformities of the foot, particularly {{to the development of}} hallux valgus disorders. Until now, these assumptions have not been confirmed through scientific research. This study aims to investigate whether this association can be statistically proven, and if children who wear <b>shoes</b> of insufficient <b>length</b> actually do have a higher risk of a more pronounced lateral deviation of the hallux. Methods 858 pre-school children were included in the study. The study sample was stratified by sex, urban/rural areas and Austrian province. The hallux angle and the length of the feet were recorded. The inside length of the children's footwear (indoor shoes worn in pre-school and outdoor shoes) were assessed. Personal data and different anthropometric measurements were taken. The risk of hallux valgus deviation was statistically tested by a stepwise logistic regression analysis and the relative risk (odds ratio) for a hallux angle ≥ 4 degrees was calculated. Results Exact examinations of the hallux angle could be conducted on a total of 1, 579 individual feet. Only 23. 9 % out of 1, 579 feet presented a straight position of the great toe. The others were characterized by lateral deviations (valgus position) at different degrees, equalling 10 degrees or greater in 14. 2 % of the children's feet. 88. 8 % of 808 children examined wore indoor footwear that was of insufficient length, and 69. 4 % of 812 children wore outdoor shoes that were too short. A significant relationship was observed between the lengthwise fit of the shoes and the hallux angle: the shorter the shoe, the higher the value of the hallux angle. The relative risk (odds ratio) of a lateral hallux deviation of ≥ 4 degrees in children wearing <b>shoes</b> of insufficient <b>length</b> was significantly increased. Conclusions There is a significant relationship between the hallux angle in children and footwear that is too short in length. The fact {{that the majority of the}} children examined were wearing <b>shoes</b> of insufficient <b>length</b> makes the issue particularly significant. Our results emphasize the importance of ensuring that children's footwear fits properly. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Walking {{distance}} estimation is {{an important}} issue in areas such as gait analysis, sport training or pedestrian localization. A natural location for portable inertial sensors for gait monitoring is to attach them to the user <b>shoes.</b> Step <b>length</b> can be computed by means of a biaxial accelerometer and a gyroscope on the sagital plane. But estimations based on the direct signal integration are prone to error. This paper shows the results achieved by using a multisensor model approach to reduce uncertainty.

The method has been tested, and early experimental results show that it provides an estimation of the walking distance with a standard deviation smaller than with single IMU similar systems. I...|$|R

One hundred and twenty-one female college students were recruited from a large 4 -year U. S. university, and only Caucasian data (n 99) were used for statistical analysis. Prior to 3 D scanning, a short questionnaire was administered to assess the participants ’ footwear selection criteria and satisfaction with the current footwear offerings, as well as demographic information. Anthropometry of the participants ’ feet was measured, using a 3 D foot scanner (INFOOT 1 by I-ware). Results showed that BMI positively affected the increase of anthropometric measurements; as BMI increased, the participants indicated significantly higher scores on <b>shoe</b> <b>length</b> and insole cushion and a lower score on fashion trendiness in the perceived importance of footwear selection criteria; they tended to wear improperly fitting shoes to accommodate wider and thicker feet; and they were significantly less satisfied with the current market than those with a lower BMI.

40|$|Introduction Ill-fitting {{footwear}} {{is one of}} {{the well-known}} risk factors causing foot ulceration in the diabetic population. Current literature for fitness of foot dimensions is insufficient, especially on foot-shoe length and foot-shoe width measurement in absolute numerical differences. The aims of the study were to compare and identify the footwear fitness in diabetic patients with peripheral sensory neuropathy, diabetic patients without peripheral neuropathy and non diabetes. Materials and Method 　　Diabetes patients were assessed for peripheral sensory neuropathy by two sensory tests, 10 -g monofilament test using 10 -g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament and vibration perception threshold test using neurotheisometer. Abnormal results of both tests indicated diabetes sensory neuropathy. The dimensions of foot length and foot width were determined by the Brannock device while internal <b>shoe</b> <b>length</b> and internal shoe width were measured by an inside caliper. The mean of internal shoe-length difference and shoe-width difference of three groups were calculated and compared. Reference ranges of 10 - 15 mm of shoe-length difference and 0 - 7 mm were selected from past literature. The values of shoe-length and shoe-width differences were dichotomized into correct and incorrect fit category. Footwear fitness of the three groups was compared. Demographics of patients, information on self foot care, shoe size check and footwear habit were collected for correlation analysis. Results Data was collected from 20 diabetes patients with sensory neuropathy, 60 diabetes patients without neuropathy and 40 non diabetes controls. There were significant difference in shoe-length difference among three groups, with larger shoe-length difference in diabetic neuropathy group (left: 21. 9 mm, / right: 21. 7 mm), followed by non neuropathy diabetes (left: 15. 2 mm, / right: 15. 5 mm) and controls (left: 13. 4 mm, / right: 14. 5 mm) (left p= 0. 002 / right p= 0. 008). The shoe-length differences of both diabetes groups exceeded the reference range, indicating long footwear. No significant difference was reported related to shoe-width difference. Analysis of shoe fit category showed around 15 - 17 % of diabetes patients were wearing correctly fit shoes in both length and width. A high prevalence of diabetes patient had ill-fitting footwear while nearly half of them wear shoes with correct width but incorrect length. There is nearly no correlations between shoe-length fit, shoe-width fit and frequency of self foot check, frequency of footwear size check and frequency of diabetic footwear education. Discussion Most diabetes patients wear ill-fitting footwear, especially those with peripheral sensory neuropathy when compared to control group. There is significant difference in shoe-length difference among the three groups, with reference to the 10 - 15 mm range as the gap length allowance. Diabetic patients tend to wear long and loose footwear in this study even they had past foot education and practice proper self foot check regularly. These might imply incomprehensive proper diabetic footwear education and self footwear assessment in current diabetes care pathway. These components are essential in diabetes foot care and people with diabetes are highly recommended to select a pair of good fit footwear. Further research is required to standardize the methodologies of measurement in foot dimensions and footwear fitness as well as investigate on relations of additional foot parameters in shoe fitting. published_or_final_versionOrthopaedics and TraumatologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|E

The paper describes the results of field tests undertaken on a 2. 2 m long, by 51 mm diameter, pile, fitted with five different driving shoes and driven into dense sand. Dynamic and static load tests showed good correlations between the type of driving shoe, plug formation rate, and eventual end bearing capacity. It was found that the dynamic measurements provided a lower bound estimate of axial capacity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if minimalist shoes improve time trial performance of trained distance runners and if changes in running economy, <b>shoe</b> mass, stride <b>length,</b> stride rate and footfall pattern were related to any difference in performance. Twenty-six trained runners performed three 6 -min sub-maximal treadmill runs at 11, 13 and 15 km·h⁻¹ in minimalist and conventional shoes while running economy, stride length, stride rate and footfall pattern were assessed. They then performed a 5 -km time trial. In the minimalist shoe, runners completed the trial in less time (effect size 0. 20 ± 0. 12), were more economical during sub-maximal running (effect size 0. 33 ± 0. 14) and decreased stride length (effect size 0. 22 ± 0. 10) and increased stride rate (effect size 0. 22 ± 0. 11). All but one runner ran with a rearfoot footfall in the minimalist shoe. Improvements in time trial performance were associated with improvements in running economy at 15 km·h⁻¹ (r= 0. 58), with 79 % of the improved economy accounted for by reduced shoe mass (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Back ground; Down {{syndrome}} is a genetic disorder that {{is caused by}} an extra chromosome 21 that is present in all {{or some of the}} individual's cells. The presence of an extra chromosome in DS gives rise to certain congnitive deficits and results in significant delays in the onset of motor skills, including qualitative differences in movement patterns, compared with the normal children. In Down syndrome an increased incidence of orthopaedic problems is present. Orthopaedic pathology in DS is mostly secondary to hypotonia, ligamentous laxity, and hyperflexibility of the joints. More common orthopaedic problems are of minor severity and generally involve the lower extremities. Flat foot deformity secondary to ligamentous laxity is observed in more than 90 % of persons with Down syndrome. Feet {{play an important role in}} supporting body weight, reducing the force exerted on lower limbs and related joints, absorbing vibrations, buffering impacts and controlling the balance of body when body is in contact with the ground. Flat foot (Pes planus) is a condition in which the foot does not have a normal medial longitudinal arch, flat foot is associated with pronated foot. It is widely believed that a person with pes planus and pronation foot has an increased susceptibility to mechanical overloading of their leg and/or foot structures flatfoot. Also, it is not only a static alignment problem of the ankle and foot complex but could be the consequence of a dynamic functional change of the lower extremity. If pronation is diagnosed before the age of five it can usually be treated in such a manner that the bones and joints will be aligned properly as growth continues attributable to the young foot is still largely made of cartilage, with less bone than would be present in the adult foot. Most studies available relative to flat foot and gait in DS children concern the effect of orthotics as conservative treatment for pronation and flatfoot. This study have been use two types of intervention to limited and control the flat feet and pronation in down syndrome to improve gait and avoid problems in prolonged stress situations without the limitation in any activity or interfere in muscles strength. Shoe and Taping are widely used for both foot and ankle problems. Shoe influence in both flat foot and pronation [...] A number of studies believe that the medical shoe is most appropriately used for the flexible flat foot children, and found that the medial support in a shoe may provide increased stability to the foot and leg and may reduce the maximal foot pronation. Also, ankle taping can PDF created with pdfFactory trial version www. pdffactory. com be correct malalignment of the foot depends on mechanical and physiological effects by ability of taping to stiffen the ankle joint and limits the hypermobility and improve the gait pattern. Purpose; was to compare between the instant effect of taping and medical shoes on kinematic gait parameters in Saudi children with down syndrome.
