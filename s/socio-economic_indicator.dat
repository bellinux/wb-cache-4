It is an unfortunate reality that in New Zealand there is no equality in access to rights to health, education, and justice due to a various socio-economic obstacles, including structural discrimination. As is acknowledged by the Human Rights Commission, [...] "although frequent citation of negative statistics about inequality can have the unintentional impact of further perpetuating negative messages about Maori and Pacific communities, statistics do provide an evidence base for analysing structural discrimination and encouraging government action." ...|$|E

30|$|Even though {{unemployment}} {{is a key}} <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicator,</b> it only provides a partial view of youth’s situation. For instance, it does not provide information about individuals outside the labor force. While some are inactive, many of those aged 16 to 24 {{are still in the}} education system. As a result, the share of active youth in this age group is often small. Furthermore, in some countries students often combine work and education and therefore are looking for a job. For this reason another useful indicator is the share of youth which is not in employment, education, or training, also called the NEET rate. This category is comprised of youth either looking for a job (while not studying), or inactive (often discouraged).|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to find the quantitative importance of some predictors of mortality among the population aged 70 or over. The predictors are <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicators</b> (income, wealth and education), thirteen health indicators including a history of heart attack or cancer, and subjective probabilities of survival. The estimation is based on mortality between waves 1 and 2 of the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest-Old study. We find that the relationship between <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicators</b> and mortality declines with age 13 health indicators are strong predictors of mortality and that the subjective survival probabilities predict mortality even after controlling for <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicators</b> and the health conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we are trying}} to form {{internally}} homogeneous groups of Slovenian municipalities {{on the basis of their}} <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicators.</b> Because of the small size of municipalities only a limited number of indicators is available and beside that some of them are conceptually inappropriate. The methodological approach is based on cluster analysis. In the first phase, Ward’s hierarchical procedure has been used for identification of the number of clusters and definition of group centroids. In the second phase, centroids have been used as the initial seed points for the K-means nonhierarchical procedure, which has improved the formation of the clusters. Four groups of municipalities are identified on the basis of all considered <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicators.</b> The groups can be clearly ranked with regard to those <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicators</b> that reflect their development characteristics.

Methods This was a cross-sectional survey conducted in the rural district of Hoima, Uganda. Two-stage cluster sampling design was used to obtain 720 child/mother pairs.

Development project may alter existing physical and social situation of the concerned region and its surroundings that may bring unanticipated adverse impacts (Long et al. 2007; Madon 2000; Szirmai 2015) on society. In order to manage the adverse impact, a development indicator is needed to develop for bringing about uniformity in regional development (Akama and Kieti 2007; Choudhury 1992; Dasgupta 1971; Sarker 1994). Development is a multi-dimensional process (Bhattacharya and Mahalanobis 1967; Dreze and Sen 1999) which cannot be fully estimated by a single indicator.

Changing land use, agricultural practices, housing quality, urbanization, climate change, and improved healthcare are among the many factors thought to {{have played a role}} in the declines of malaria seen, but their effects and relative contributions have rarely been quantified. Methods: Spatial datasets on changes in climate, wealth, life expectancy, urbanization, and land use trends over the past century were combined with datasets depicting the reduction in malaria transmission across 31 European countries, and the relationships were explored. Moreover, the conditions in current malaria-eliminating countries were compared with those in Europe at the time of declining transmission and elimination to assess similarities. Results/conclusions: Indicators relating to socio-economic improvements such as wealth, life expectancy and urbanization were strongly correlated with the decline of malaria in Europe, whereas those describing climatic and land use changes showed weaker relationships. Present-day malaria-elimination countries have now arrived at similar <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicator</b> levels as European countries at the time malaria elimination was achieved, offering hope for achievement of sustainable elimination. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Evolutions in {{the power}} system {{challenge}} {{the manner in which}} power system reliability is managed. In particular, currently used reliability criteria, typically the deterministic N- 1 criterion, are increasingly inadequate. Moving to an alternative approach is difficult as quantifying benefits is hard in a multifaceted environment and system operators are reluctant {{to move away from the}} easy and transparent existing criterion. This paper presents a generic framework to evaluate and compare socio-economic and reliability performance of power system reliability criteria, focussing on the short term decision making process of transmission system operators (TSO). The framework can also be used to tune the parameters of reliability criteria. Short term operational planning and real time operation TSO decision making processes are simulated considering various reliability criteria. The framework is applied to a 5 node test system and the 24 node IEEE reliability test system, showing that the applied probabilistic reliability criterion outperforms deterministic N- 0 and N- 1 approaches in those systems in terms of expected reliability and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicator</b> values.

Referral rates were calculated for each ecological area for two referral subgroups: mood/conduct/stress-related concerns and neurophysiologically based concerns.

This paper argues that the apparent lack of progress towards equity of access has been exacerbated due to how socio-economic position (SEP) is measured within higher education. Three major methodological issues are identified: (a) the use of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicator</b> for areas (SEIFA) at an inappropriate unit of geographic area (postcode), (b) an inappropriate choice of index (education and occupation), and (c) using the index of education and occupation as the sole indicator of SEP thereby increasing the risk of misclassification of individuals through the operation of ecological fallacy. This paper argues that to address these methodological deficiencies, alternative methods of determining SEP are required at both the aggregate and individual level. Possible options are proposed for use as replacements for the geographic area (postcode) and index (education and occupation) as well as additional measures at the individual or household level. ...|$|E

Results: One hundred seventy two (25 %) of the studied children were stunted, of which 105 (61 %) were boys (p < 0. 001). Bivariate analysis indicated a higher prevalence of stunting among children of: non-educated mothers compared to mothers educated above primary school (odds ratio (OR) 2. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 4 – 4. 4); non-educated fathers compared to fathers educated above secondary school (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 0. 8 – 3. 5); households belonging in the "poorest" quintile for the asset index compared to the "least poor" quintile (OR 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 3. 7); Land ownership exhibited no differentials with stunting. Simultaneously adjusting all <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicators</b> in conditional regression analysis left mothers' education as the only independent predictor of stunting with children of non-educated mothers significantly more likely to be stunted compared to those of mothers educated above primary school (OR 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 3. 9). More boys than girls were significantly stunted in poorer than wealthier socio-economic strata. Conclusions: Of four <b>socio-economic</b> <b>indicators,</b> mothers' education is the best predictor for health and nutrition inequalities among infants and young children in rural Uganda. This suggests a need for appropriate formal education of the girl child aimed at promoting child health and nutrition.
