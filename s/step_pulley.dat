50|$|In {{addition}} to the spindle and its bearings, the headstock often contains parts to convert the motor speed into various spindle speeds. Various types of speed-changing mechanism achieve this, from a cone pulley or <b>step</b> <b>pulley,</b> to a cone pulley with back gear (which is essentially a low range, similar in net effect to the two-speed rear of a truck), to an entire gear train {{similar to that of}} a manual-shift auto transmission. Some motors have electronic rheostat-type speed controls, which obviates cone pulleys or gears.|$|E
50|$|Bridgeport manual milling {{machines}} {{have come in}} many types and sizes over the years, including (but not limited to) the C head (original), R head (heavy duty C head), M head, J head (and high speed, 5440 RPM version), 2J1 1/2 head (1.5 HP Vari-Speed), 2J2 (2HP Vari-speed), and Series II head (4HP Vari-speed). All of the heads offer variable speeds, the earlier ones via a <b>step</b> <b>pulley</b> (cone pulley) and the later ones via electrically or electronically modulated variable-speed drive. Typical table sizes are 9″ × 49″ (Y and X, respectively) and 10″ × 54″. Machine tapers for toolholding include Morse tapers (on early models) and the R8 taper (a widely used standard that Bridgeport created) on most models. Both Morse and R8 allow for both collets and solid holders; and a drill chuck can be held by either of the latter. Machine slides are of the dovetail type, and rotary bearings are mostly of the roller and ball types.|$|E
50|$|For most drill presses—especially those {{meant for}} {{woodworking}} or home use—speed change {{is achieved by}} manually moving a belt across a <b>stepped</b> <b>pulley</b> arrangement. Some drill presses add a third <b>stepped</b> <b>pulley</b> {{to increase the number}} of available speeds. Modern drill presses can, however, use a variable-speed motor in conjunction with the stepped-pulley system. Medium-duty drill presses such as those used in machine shop (tool room) applications are equipped with a continuously variable transmission. This mechanism is based on variable-diameter pulleys driving a wide, heavy-duty belt. This gives a wide speed range as well as the ability to change speed while the machine is running. Heavy-duty drill presses used for metalworking are usually of the gear-head type described below.|$|R
5000|$|Just as the diameters of gears (and, correspondingly, {{their number}} of teeth) {{determine}} {{a gear ratio}} and thus the speed increases or reductions and the mechanical advantage that they can deliver, the diameters of pulleys determine those same factors. [...] and <b>step</b> <b>pulleys</b> (which operate on the same principle, although the names tend {{to be applied to}} flat belt versions and V belt versions, respectively) are a way to provide multiple drive ratios in a belt-and-pulley system that can be shifted as needed, just as a transmission provides this function with a gear train that can be shifted. V belt <b>step</b> <b>pulleys</b> are the most common way that drill presses deliver a range of spindle speeds.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Variable speed {{belt drive}} for a lathe. The fixed pulley {{on the upper}} shaft is driven at {{constant}} speed by a belt from the power source. The loose pulley ('idler') allows the machine to be stopped in isolation - necessary for changing speed. The <b>stepped</b> <b>pulleys</b> (left) provide three drive speeds for the machine tool (not shown), depending on which pair of pulleys is connected by the belt.|$|R
5000|$|Being both {{larger and}} much more {{powerful}} than routers, shapers can cut much larger profiles than routers [...] - [...] such as for crown moulding and raised-panel doors [...] - [...] and readily drive custom-made bits fabricated with unique profiles. Shapers feature between 1.5 and 5 hp belt-driven motors, which run much more quietly and smoothly than typically 20,000 to 25,000 rpm direct-drive routers. Speed adjustments are typically made by relocating the belts on a <b>stepped</b> <b>pulley</b> system, much like that on a drill press.|$|R
5000|$|The process {{consists}} of two conductive <b>pulleys</b> (<b>step</b> <b>pulleys)</b> which the wire passes across after it is drawn. The two pulleys have an electrical potential across them, which causes the wire to form a short circuit. The Joule effect causes {{the temperature of the}} wire to rise to approximately 400 °C. This temperature is affected by the rotational speed of the pulleys, the ambient temperature, and the voltage applied. Where [...] is the temperature of the wire, [...] is a constant, [...] is the voltage applied, [...] is the number of rotations of the pulleys per minute, and [...] is the ambient temperature: ...|$|R
5000|$|Pulleys were {{constructed}} of wood, iron, steel {{or a combination}} thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example a 40" [...] pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20" [...] pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached ("fast") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that turned freely ("loose") on the shaft (idlers). In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last belt feeding power to a machine, a pair of <b>stepped</b> <b>pulleys</b> {{could be used to}} give a variety of speed settings for the machine.|$|R
50|$|Belt drives are simple, inexpensive, and do {{not require}} axially aligned shafts. They help protect {{machinery}} from overload and jam, and damp and isolate noise and vibration. Load fluctuations are shock-absorbed (cushioned). They need no lubrication and minimal maintenance. They have high efficiency (90-98%, usually 95%), high tolerance for misalignment, and are of relatively low cost if the shafts are far apart. Clutch action is activated by releasing belt tension. Different speeds {{can be obtained by}} <b>stepped</b> or tapered <b>pulleys.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} study investigates {{the effect of}} friction on the efficiency of a pulley system. Efficiency of systems is affected by problems like friction, {{which is also a}} major problem for energy consumption in the world. In a pulley system consisting of an electric motor, fixed pulleys and a load; “Does changing the number of pulleys in a pulley system affect friction and hence efficiency of the system to alter?” question is tested. The experiment was made in two parts. First, revolutions per minute (rev/min – rpm) pattern of the electric motor was plotted on a graph. After deciding the voltage for second part, the effect of friction on the efficiency of the pulley systems was investigated. For that, the number of pulleys attached to the system was increased step by step and how high (meters) the 0. 1 kg mass is pulled in 1 minute time by the electric motor is measured. Comparing theoretical height and measured height values gave the energy loss at the system. According to the law of conservation of energy that loss should be due to the effect of friction. So, the efficiency of the system was calculated using the data gathered. The results were plotted on a graph and they showed that as the number of pulleys in the system increases from 1 blue pulley to 5 black & 5 blue <b>pulleys</b> <b>step</b> by step, the efficiency of the system decreases from 99. 598...|$|R
