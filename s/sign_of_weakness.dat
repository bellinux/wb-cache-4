On 25 November, General Savary {{was sent to the}} Allied {{headquarters}} at Olmutz to deliver Napoleon's message expressing his desire to avoid a battle, while secretly examining the Allied forces' situation. As expected, the overture was seen as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the enemy to occupy the Heights.|$|E
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|Richard's time as {{archbishop}} {{was much}} less stormy than Becket's had been, {{and he seems to}} have had better relations with the king. Richard attended the royal councils, and more than once was with the king in Normandy. Richard was less dogmatic {{on the rights of the}} clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> Pope Alexander III took Richard to task when Richard acquiesced in the election of bishops taking place in the royal chapel. As part of his diplomatic efforts on the king's behalf, Richard escorted Henry's daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. Richard also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin in March 1953, the new {{collective}} Soviet leadership started to advocate a New Course. Moscow favored replacing East Germany's Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and made inquiries about Rau as a potential candidate. In response, the leading SED party ideologist, Rudolf Herrnstadt, a candidate member of the Poliburo, with assistance from Rau drew up a concept for just such a New Course in East Germany. However, the workers' uprising, which was suppressed by the Soviet army on 17June led to a backlash. Three weeks later, during a session of the then eight person Politburo (plus six candidate members) on 8July 1953, Rau made a recommendation that Ulbricht be replaced, while Rau's Spanish Civil War comrade, Stasi chief Wilhelm Zaisser, who in Spain had been known as 'General Gómez', accused Ulbricht of having perverted the party. The majority was against Ulbricht. His only supporters were Hermann Matern and Erich Honecker. At that moment however there was no viable candidate who could replace Ulbricht immediately. Suggested were first Rudolf Herrnstadt and then Heinrich Rau, but both were hesitant, thus a decision was postponed. The very next day after the meeting Ulbricht went by plane to Moscow and the Soviet leadership, who in part also feared that deposing Ulbricht might be construed as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness,</b> now secured Ulbricht's position. Subsequently, five members and candidate members of the Politburo lost their positions.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness</b> among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing {{up to be a}} rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{used the}} respite to ferry in {{additional}} reinforcements from Asia Minor and repair {{the walls of}} Blachernae. When Thomas returned in spring, he decided to focus his attack on the Blachernae sector. Before the offensive, Michael himself ascended the walls and addressed Thomas's troops, exhorting them to abandon their commander and promising amnesty if they would defect. Thomas's army viewed the plea as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness,</b> and advanced confidently to begin the assault, but as they neared the wall, the defenders opened the gates and attacked. The sudden onslaught drove back Thomas's army; at the same time, the Imperial Fleet defeated Thomas's ships, whose crews broke and fled to the shore in panic. This defeat diminished Thomas's naval strength, and although he continued blockading the capital by land, the loss demoralized his supporters, who began defecting. Gregory Pterotos, whose family was in Michael's hands, resolved to desert Thomas, followed by {{a small band of}} men loyal to him. He departed the rebel camp, headed west, and sent a monk to inform Michael of his defection, but the monk failed to circumvent the blockade and reach the capital. Upon learning of this defection, Thomas reacted quickly: with a select detachment, he followed Gregory, defeated his troops and killed the deserter.|$|E

5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

Though Apple's iPhone sales declined to 4.3 million in the subsequent quarter and RIM's increased to 7.8 million, for some investors this indicated a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> Apple's iPhone began to sell more phones quarterly than the BlackBerry in 2010, {{brought on by the}} release of the iPhone 4.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} {{and distribution of}} non-interdigitating sutures in the skull of some reptilian groups, including Dilophosaurus, has been interpreted as indicating {{the presence of a}} system of levers, driven by jaw muscles, as an aid to predation. Welles (1984) rejected this hypothesis and interpreted the potential mobility in the skull of Dilophosaurus as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness,</b> and argued that the loose connection of the premaxilla precluded the capture and subduing of prey. This led to the early hypothesis that Dilophosaurus scavenged off carrion, because its teeth were too weak to bring down large prey. Recently, some researchers have argued that Dilophosaurus may have been piscivorous, due to the presence of Eubrontes-sized swim tracks at some localities, as well as anatomical similarities with spinosaurids.|$|E
25|$|People with NPD tend {{to exaggerate}} {{their skills and}} accomplishments {{as well as their}} level of {{intimacy}} with people they consider to be high-status.

In the course of a conversation, they may purposefully or unknowingly disparage or devalue the other person by overemphasizing their own success. When they are aware that their statements have hurt someone else, they tend to react with contempt and to view it as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>weakness.</b> When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated.

500|$|Scholars {{argue that}} Muhammad {{had already decided}} upon this {{judgment}} before the Qurayza's surrender, and that Sa'ad was putting his allegiance to the Muslim community above that to his tribe.

Maxime Rodinson interprets the massacre as an astute political move that overrode all feelings of humanity, in order to remove a constant source of threat to Medina, and dishearten his enemies.|$|E
