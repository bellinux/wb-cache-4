25|$|Also {{known as}} the on-ball division, the {{followers}} consist of three players - a ruckman, a ruck rover and a rover. They are known as followers because they have traditionally been used as players that follow the ball all around the ground as opposed to playing in a <b>set</b> <b>position.</b> With modern Australian rules football there is a decreased emphasis on set positions, but followers generally cover much more ground than other players on the field.|$|E

40|$|Refrigerator-freezers energy {{consumption}} is greatly affected by room temperature, door opening and thermostat <b>setting</b> <b>position.</b> Two frost free household refrigerator freezers {{of the same}} capacity were tested in the laboratory to determine the sensitivity of their {{energy consumption}} to various usage conditions. The experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of single variables, such as temperature, thermostat <b>setting</b> <b>positions</b> and door opening, and their combined effect on energy consumption. Our investigation reveals that room temperature has the higher effect on energy consumption, followed by door opening. Thermostat <b>setting</b> <b>position</b> has the lower effect on energy consumption. More detailed tests were performed under different room temperature, thermostat <b>setting</b> <b>position</b> arid door opening conditions. With the experimental results, a first order mathematical model has been developed to investigate their combined effect on energy consumption. The test results are discussed and presented...|$|R

These systems {{are designed to}} reduce pilot workload (the AW109 can be flown under single or dual-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR)) and enable the use of night vision goggles (NVG) to conduct day-or-night operations. The AW109 has a forced trim system which can be readily and selectively activated by the controlling pilot using triggers located on the cyclic and collective which hold the control inputs at the last <b>set</b> <b>position</b> if activated. All critical systems are deliberately redundant for fail-safe operations; the hydraulic system, hydraulic actuators, and electrical system are all dual-redundant, while the power inverters are triple-redundant. The AW109 also has reduced maintenance requirements due to an emphasis on reliability across the range of components used.|$|E

25|$|The Indian violin, while {{essentially}} the same instrument as that used in Western music, is different in some senses. The instrument is tuned so that the IV and III strings (G and D on a western-tuned violin) and the II and I (A and E) strings are sa–pa (do–sol) pairs and sound the same but are offset by an octave, resembling common scordatura or fiddle cross-tunings such as C–G–C–G or A–E–A–E. The tonic sa (do) is not fixed, but variably tuned to accommodate the vocalist or lead player. The way the musician holds the instrument varies from Western to Indian music. In Indian music the musician sits on the floor cross-legged with the right foot {{out in front of}} them. The scroll of the instrument rests on the foot. This position is essential to playing well {{due to the nature of}} Indian music. The hand can move all over the fingerboard and there is no <b>set</b> <b>position</b> for the left hand, so it is important for the violin to be in a steady, unmoving position.|$|E

500|$|In combat, a Djinni {{has several}} uses. Each Set Djinni {{has a special}} ability which can be invoked during combat by the {{character}} it is attached to, which can include enhanced elemental attacks, buffing/debuffing spells, healing/restoration spells, and other effects. After a successful invoke, the Djinni shifts to [...] "Standby" [...] mode until it is [...] "Set" [...] on the character again. While in standby, the Djinn do not contribute to statistics or change character classes, but {{can be used for}} summon spells, which are attacks where the player summons a powerful elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy and increases the respective characters affinity for that element for a duration. This is the game's most powerful method of attack, but the required switch to Standby mode is a risky trade-off: Djinn used for summoning must rest for several turns before reverting to the <b>Set</b> <b>position,</b> during which time they cannot bolster statistics or classes. There are sixteen Summon Sequences in Golden Sunfour for each elementand each summon sequence requires between one and four Djinn of the same element on Standby.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features in the Golden Sun series is the collection and manipulation of elemental creatures called Djinn (singular: Djinni), and The Lost Age introduces a host of new Djinn. They can be found scattered in hiding throughout the game. There are eleven Djinn {{for each of the four}} elements (not counting the ones that can only be found in the original Golden Sun) that may be allocated to each character. [...] Djinn form the basis of the game’s statistics enhancement system, and the way they are allocated to different characters modifies the characters' classes, increasing maximum hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, and also alters the available Psynergy that the characters can perform. Djinni may also be used to directly attack an opponent, and once used, Djinn no longer contribute to a character’s class but can be used to summon a powerful elemental spirit to attack an opponent. This is the game’s most powerful method of attack, and also the riskiest, as it requires Djinn to be on standby and therefore not available to bolster the statistics of whichever character the Djinni is equipped to. [...] Once a Djinni on Standby has been used for a Summon Sequence, it takes a number of turns recovering before it restores itself to <b>Set</b> <b>position</b> on a character, but a subsequent increase in the affinity of the element of the attack is bolstered on the character for the duration of the battle.|$|E

In the northern hemisphere, the steady Pole Star (Polaris) was used for the N-S axis; the less-steady Southern Cross had to do for the southern hemisphere, as the southern pole star, Sigma Octantis, is too dim to be easily seen from Earth with the naked eye.

In the latter frame, Shaw walked Williams, and then proceeded to balk him to second, third and home. [...] Shaw's balks were blamed on his difficulty adjusting to a then-new point of emphasis in the rules: umpires were told to enforce {{the section of the}} balk rule strictly that required the pitcher, when going from the stretch to the <b>set</b> <b>position,</b> to come to a complete stop with his hands together for one full second before pitching.
