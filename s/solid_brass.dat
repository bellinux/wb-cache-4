5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version has a <b>solid</b> <b>brass</b> or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E

The company manufactured coffin furniture in <b>solid</b> <b>brass,</b> electro-brass, silver plate and nickel plate, and later from resins with oxy-silver, oxy-bronze and oxy-copper finishes. At its peak, it employed 100 people. The company also made shrouds. By the 1950s, the company was exporting their products to Asia, Africa and North America. The company has also produced coffin furniture for the funerals of Sir Winston Churchill, Joseph Chamberlain and Princess Diana.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is to present a theory for the dynamic {{radiation}} force produced by dual-frequency ultrasound beams in lossless and non-dispersive fluids. A formula for the dynamic radiation force exerted on a three-dimensional object by a dual-frequency beam is obtained stemming from the fluid dynamics equations. Dependence of the dynamic radiation force to nonlinear effects of the medium is analyzed. The developed theory is applied to calculate the dynamic radiation force exerted on <b>solid</b> elastic (<b>brass</b> and stainless steel) spheres by a low-amplitude dual-frequency plane wave. The dynamic radiation force is calculated by solving the dual-frequency plane wave scattering problem for solid elastic spheres. Results show that the dynamic radiation force on the analized spheres presents fluctuations similar to those present in the static radiation force. Furthermore, analysis of the static and the dynamic radiation forces on the stainless steel sphere shows that they have approximately the same magnitude. Comment: 15 page...|$|R

The Mogul himself had waddled into a corn-field, and there he knelt--fantastic wreaths of green twisted round his crankpins; his pilot covered with solid clods of field, on which corn nodded drunkenly; his fire put out with dirt (Evans had done that as soon as he recovered his senses); and his broken headlight half full of half-burnt moths. His tender had thrown coal all over him, and he looked like a disreputable buffalo who had tried to wallow in a general store. For there lay scattered over the landscape, from the burst cars, type-writers, sewing-machines, bicycles in crates, a consignment of silver-plated imported harness, French dresses and gloves, a dozen finely moulded hard-wood mantels, a fifteen-foot naphtha-launch, with a <b>solid</b> <b>brass</b> bedstead crumpled around her bows, a case of telescopes and microscopes, two coffins, a case of very best candies, some gilt-edged dairy produce, butter and eggs in an omelette, a broken box of expensive toys, and a few hundred other luxuries.

So the brakemen, armed with coupler-pins, walked up and down on one side, and the freight-conductor and the fireman patrolled the other with their hands in their hip-pockets. A long-bearded man came out of a house beyond the corn-field, and told Evans that if the accident had happened a little later in the year, all his corn would have been burned, and accused Evans of carelessness. Then he ran away, for Evans was at his heels shrieking: [...] "'T was his hog done it--his hog done it! Let me kill him! Let me kill him!"

The aim is to show how contact between outmost ring, outer ring and the inner core are carried on throughout the upsetting process. Results have shown that, with changing in height, between outmost ring, outer ring and inner core, the Model 1 and Model 2 had very good interaction, and the contact surfaces of models had various interface behaviour.
