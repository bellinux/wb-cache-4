5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prominent}} descendants must be mentioned his son Mariano <b>Saavedra,</b> twice {{governor of the}} Province of Buenos Aires between 1862 and 1865, his grandson Cornelio <b>Saavedra</b> Rodríguez, Chilean military officer {{in charge of the}} Occupation of Araucania, and his great-grandson Carlos <b>Saavedra</b> Lamas, politician and diplomat, Nobel Prize for Peace in 1936.|$|E
5|$|As {{president}} of the first government body created after the May Revolution, <b>Saavedra</b> is considered the first ruler of Argentina. However, as the Spanish juntas were not a presidential system, <b>Saavedra</b> {{was not the first}} President of Argentina; that office would be created a decade afterwards. The Casa Rosada, official residence of the President of Argentina, holds a bust of <b>Saavedra</b> at the Hall of busts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Saavedra's</b> first {{professional}} theatre performances were in roles in plays such as [...] "El Despertar" [...] (1991-1997), [...] "Pervertimientos y Otros Gestos Para Nada" [...] (1993) and [...] "La noche de la Iguana" [...] (The Night of the Iguana) (1994), {{and in a}} Café-chantant called [...] "TV cable 90" [...] (1992). On film, <b>Saavedra's</b> first appearances were in short films, such as [...] "El Bidón" [...] and [...] "Volando Voy" [...] (directed by Miguel Littin). <b>Saavedra's</b> has performed various roles in a several soap operas, sitcoms and TV shows on Chilean and German television.|$|R

5|$|<b>Saavedra</b> was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Primera Junta, which took government after it. The local politics were soon divided {{between him and the}} secretary Mariano Moreno. <b>Saavedra</b> wanted gradual changes, while Moreno promoted more radical ones. <b>Saavedra</b> encouraged the expansion of the Junta with deputies from the other provinces; this left Moreno in a minority, and he resigned. A later rebellion made in behalf of <b>Saavedra</b> forced the remaining supporters of Moreno to resign as well. He left the presidency after the defeat of the first Upper Peru campaign, and headed to lead the Army of the North. His absence was exploited by political opponents, who established the First Triumvirate and issued an arrest warrant against <b>Saavedra.</b> <b>Saavedra</b> stayed in exile until 1815, when all the charges against him were dropped.|$|E
5|$|The historiography of Cornelio <b>Saavedra</b> {{is closely}} related to that of Mariano Moreno. As <b>Saavedra</b> had a {{conflict}} with him in the Junta, the perspectives towards him complement those about Moreno. The first liberal historians praised Moreno {{as the leader of the}} Revolution and a great historical man; <b>Saavedra</b> was treated either as a weak man overwhelmed by Moreno, or as a counter-revolutionary. This perspective did not acknowledge that <b>Saavedra,</b> as head of the Regiment of Patricians, was the most popular and influential man of the city since before the Revolution, and that he was reported to be staunch, cunning and ruthless.|$|E
5|$|<b>Saavedra</b> {{thought that}} the victory {{at the battle of}} Suipacha {{strengthened}} his perspective, as the Junta would have defeated its enemies. He considered that Moreno's animosity was rooted in the aforementioned mutiny of Álzaga, as Moreno took part in it. The victory was celebrated at the barracks of the Patricians, where the officer Anastasio Duarte, who was drunk, made a toast to <b>Saavedra,</b> as if he was the king of the Americas. Moreno drafted the Honours Suppression decree when he knew about it, which suppressed the ceremonies and privileges {{of the president of the}} Junta inherited from the former office of viceroy. However, <b>Saavedra</b> signed it without complaint. The Regiment of Patricians resented Moreno because of this, but <b>Saavedra</b> considered that it was a disproportionated response to a trivial issue.|$|E

50|$|<b>Saavedra's</b> older brother, José Jorge, also a stopper, {{also played}} briefly for Oviedo's first team, {{appearing}} in one top flight match in 1998-99. His career, however, was spent {{largely in the}} lower leagues.|$|R
5|$|Subsequently, revisionist {{authors would}} {{formulate}} accusations against Moreno, depicting {{him as a}} British agent and a man of mere theoretical European ideas without a strong relation with the South American context. <b>Saavedra</b> is depicted instead as a popular caudillo, a predecessor of José de San Martín and Juan Manuel de Rosas. This perspective did not acknowledge that the wealthy citizens were aligned with <b>Saavedra</b> against Moreno, that <b>Saavedra</b> himself was wealthy and aristocratic, and that the 1811 revolution made no requests of a social nature, save {{for the removal of}} Morenist forces from the Junta.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} {{of the supreme}} director Gervasio Antonio de Posadas fostered further hostilities towards <b>Saavedra.</b> Posadas was among the people banished in 1811, and made him a trial of residence as a revenge. <b>Saavedra,</b> defended by Juan de la Rosa Alba, was accused of organizing the 1811 revolution, along with Campana. The sentence ruled that <b>Saavedra</b> should be exiled, but he avoided it by crossing the Andes with his son and seeking political asylum at Chile. Juan José Paso requested the extradition of <b>Saavedra,</b> but the Chilean supreme director Francisco de la Lastra denied it. <b>Saavedra</b> did not stay in Chile for long; a huge royalist attack to Chile (which would end in the Disaster of Rancagua and the royalist reconquest of Chile) made him cross the Andes again and seek refuge at Mendoza, along with Chilean expatriates. José de San Martín, ruling Mendoza at the time, allowed him to settle in San Juan.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros called <b>Saavedra</b> and Martín Rodríguez, and {{requested}} their military {{support in the}} case of a popular rebellion. They refused to give such support, and <b>Saavedra</b> argued that Cisneros should resign because the Junta of Seville that had appointed him did not exist anymore. As a result, Cisneros gave in to the request of Juan José Castelli: to celebrate an open cabildo, an extraordinary meeting of the noteworthy peoples of the city, and discuss the situation. The next day an armed mob, led by Antonio Beruti and Domingo French, occupied the Plaza to demand the making of the open cabildo, doubting that Cisneros would actually allow it. <b>Saavedra</b> addressed the crowd and assured them that the Regiment of Patricians supported their claims.|$|E

50|$|After <b>Saavedra's</b> lost, {{his wife}} and their family {{continued}} this shipping line business so as with the Ever Trading. However, it also resulted to Ever Shipping Lines Inc. to decline their operations by reducing their fleet, routes, and manpower.|$|R
50|$|Hernando Siles Reyes {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the Republican party (1914) and Republican Socialist Party (1921). He was Bautista <b>Saavedra's</b> {{hand-picked}} successor, but once in power he broke from him and formed his own faction which became Nationalist Party.|$|R
5|$|Diego López de Salcedo sailed from Santo Domingo {{with two}} ships, {{carrying}} {{a large number}} of soldiers, as well as provisions and clothing he intended to sell to the colonists. Contrary winds delayed López de Salcedo off Jamaica for a month; he eventually disembarked in Trujillo on 26 October 1526, after a lengthy standoff with <b>Saavedra</b> that almost came to violence. At last <b>Saavedra</b> was convinced that López de Salcedo had been authorised directly by the crown, and allowed him to come ashore.|$|E
5|$|However, the Cabildo {{appointed}} a Junta headed by Cisneros, who {{would stay in}} power, even if under a new office. <b>Saavedra</b> was appointed to this Junta, as well as Castelli and two peninsulars. They made the oath of office, but the Junta was received with strong popular unrest, as it was perceived as going contrary to {{the result of the}} open cabildo. By the night, <b>Saavedra</b> and Castelli resigned, convincing Cisneros to do the same.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this power}} allowed Leiva {{to perform a}} {{maneuver}} that Castelli had not anticipated. Although he approved the end of Cisneros' rule as viceroy, Leiva formed a Junta with Cisneros as its president; Cisneros would stay in power. The {{other members of the}} Junta would have been two peninsulars, the priest Juan Nepomuceno Solá and the merchant José Santos Inchaurregui, and two criollos, <b>Saavedra</b> and Castelli. The bulk of the natives rejected the proposal: they did not accept that Cisneros should remain in power, even under a different title. They were suspicious of the intentions of <b>Saavedra,</b> and believed that with Castelli alone in the Junta, little or nothing could be achieved. Castelli and <b>Saavedra</b> resigned that same day to put pressure on Cisneros and force him to resign, and the Junta never came into power.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{currently}} holds a 94% approval on {{the film}} critics' site Rotten Tomatoes.

50|$|The Maid (La Nana) is a 2009 comedy-drama film, {{directed}} by Sebastián Silva and co-written by Silva and Pedro Peirano. It has won numerous awards since its premiere at the 25th Annual Sundance Film Festival.

50|$|It {{is evident}} that no Europeans traversed the Pacific Ocean {{at the time of}} Kamaloʻohua, and that these white or light-coloured foreigners {{probably}} were the crew of some Japanese vessel driven out of her course, and brought by winds to these shores (or the ships of Álvaro de <b>Saavedra's</b> expedition). That the Hawaiian natives regarded these castaways as of an alien race is evident.|$|R

5|$|The deputies and the Junta met on December 18, {{to decide}} what to do. Funes, who was close to <b>Saavedra,</b> argued that Buenos Aires had no right to appoint {{national}} authorities by itself and expect obedience from the provinces. The nine deputies voted for their incorporation, as did Larrea, Azcuénaga, Matheu and Alberti, founding members of the Junta. <b>Saavedra</b> declared that the incorporation was not fully legal, but that he supported it for public convenience. Only Juan José Paso voted with Moreno against the incorporation of the deputies. Left in a minority within the Junta, Moreno resigned. He was appointed to a diplomatic mission in Europe, but died in high seas, in unclear circumstances. Some historians consider that <b>Saavedra</b> plotted to murder Moreno, others that it was a negligence of the captain, and others that it was because of Moreno's frail health.|$|E
5|$|Angered {{with the}} {{passivity}} of Buenos Aires during the Luso-Brazilian {{invasion of the}} Banda Oriental, Francisco Ramírez from Entre Ríos and Estanislao López from Santa Fe joined forces against the city. <b>Saavedra</b> fled to Montevideo, fearing that Buenos Aires would be obliterated if defeated. Ramírez and López won the battle of Cepeda, but the city was not destroyed, so <b>Saavedra</b> returned. He retired in 1822, and lived {{with his family in}} the countryside. He offered his services {{at the beginning of the}} War of Brazil, despite being 65 years old, but Balcarce declined the offer. He wrote his memoirs, Memoria autógrafa, in 1828.|$|E
5000|$|The Comical History of Don Quixote is {{a three-part}} dramatization of Miguel de Cervantes y <b>Saavedra's</b> celebrated novel Don Quixote. It {{was written in}} 1694, only seventy-eight years {{after the death of}} Cervantes, by Thomas D'Urfey. It {{is one of the first}} stage dramatizations of [...] "Don Quixote" [...] ever written. The piece {{featured}} many songs, most of them by Henry Purcell, but there were some by other noted Restoration composers.|$|R
50|$|Born in Oviedo, Asturias, <b>Saavedra's</b> {{career began}} when he signed a {{professional}} contract with local Real Oviedo, making his first appearance with the first team in 2002. He never appeared in any La Liga games with the club, and moved to CD Numancia in the 2003-04 season; the Sorians promoted from the second division, {{but he did not}} appear one single minute during the (half)campaign, also being sparingly used with the reserves.|$|R
5000|$|The president's {{term was}} set at six years by a decree promulgated in January 1984, during the period when the country had no constitution. Elections held under that decree {{resulted}} in José Daniel Ortega <b>Saavedra's</b> beginning a term as president on January 10, 1985. The 1987 Constitution reaffirmed a six-year term for the president. Esquipulas II, the international peace accord that ended the Contra insurgency, however, set February 25, 1990 as the date for the next election.|$|R
5|$|Buenos Aires {{faced the}} British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806, when British forces led by William Carr Beresford invaded the city. <b>Saavedra</b> {{was still a}} {{civilian}} by then. Santiago de Liniers organized an army in Montevideo to liberate Buenos Aires, and <b>Saavedra</b> was among the civilians that joined Liniers, {{despite the lack of}} military instruction. His role in this battle was a minor one. Liniers successfully liberated Buenos Aires, and organized the resistance against a likely British counter-attack. All the male population of the city aged from 16 to 50 was drafted into the army, and divided in battalions by casta or origin. The largest one was the Regiment of Patricians, made up of volunteer infantrymen born in Buenos Aires. The Regiment was composed of three infantry battalions, commanded by Esteban Romero, Domingo Urien and Manuel Belgrano, who would later pass that command to Juan José Viamonte. Each battalion could elect their own leaders, including their commander, and the Regiment of Patricians elected <b>Saavedra.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cortés {{was troubled}} by news that his enemies in New Spain were gaining control of Mexico; when Cortés {{received}} news that Pedro Moreno would soon be arriving in Honduras with many colonists, and official documents from the Audiencia of Santo Domingo, he decided against further exploration and instead returned to Mexico, leaving on 26 April 1526. He took Pizacura to Mexico with him, where he died not long afterwards of a fatal illness. Gonzalo de Sandoval also returned to Mexico, marching overland via Guatemala. Cortés installed his cousin Hernando de <b>Saavedra</b> as governor of the new territory, and left <b>Saavedra</b> with instructions to treat the natives fairly; however Saavedra's actions reopened underlying divisions between rival groups of colonists. <b>Saavedra</b> rapidly established rule over {{what is now the}} department of Olancho; he sent Bartolomé de Celada inland to find a good location for a new Spanish town. He founded Frontera de Cáceras upon the savannah of the Olancho valley, near the Indian towns of Telica and Escamilpa, within the disputed territory between Honduras and Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the supreme}} {{director}} Juan Martín de Pueyrredón appointed {{a commission to}} discuss the case of <b>Saavedra.</b> By this time, the Congress of Tucumán had made the Argentine Declaration of Independence {{a couple of years}} before. The commission restored <b>Saavedra</b> with the military rank of brigadier, and ordered the payment of all the wages he did not receive during the time he was demoted. A second commission ratified the ruling. The payment was not enough to compensate Saavedra's losses, but he considered it a token of his restored prestige. He was appointed then to help with the protection of the frontier with the natives at Luján.|$|E
40|$|The central {{topic of}} the article Cardenio’s Decorum is the {{depiction}} of madness in words and music. The character of Cardenio, the betrayed and lovesick Andalusian nobleman of Miguel Cervantes <b>Saavedra’s</b> Don Quixote, represents one of many theatrical madmen who could {{be seen on the}} English stage during the Restoration period (1660 – 1700) {{and at the same time}} one of those who used to present their unusual mental condition in the frame of a stage song, the so-called ‘mad song’. The function of music consists here in the transfer of affection and vivid images: bound together with unreal visions, the music generates a kind of ‘mad’ dramaturgy, in which the images appear as an analogue for the character’s inner state and decide how the musical action is to develop...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relations between}} Christians and Muslims throughout Spanish history and the representations of these relations {{in the text of}} Miguel de Cervantes <b>Saavedra’s</b> Don Quijote. Throughout the history of Spain there have been intense conflicts between Christians and Muslims. From 711 until 1492, Muslims had power over much of the land that today comprises the country of Spain and this power created tensions between the two groups. This dichotomy between Christianity and Islam resulted in monumental battles and the infamously poor treatment of Muslims such as the mass expulsion during the reconquest and the mass conversion of Muslims to Christianity. Negative sentiments and stereotyping towards Muslims that have existed since the middle ages in Spain are represented in the story of Don Quijote and persist in Spanish society today...|$|R
50|$|In a {{surprising}} move, Paul Tracy withdrew his speed at 5:50 p.m. Tracy hoped {{to put in}} a safer speed, and prevent Howard from getting another chance to qualify. Tracy's withdraw re-instated Howard to the field temporarily. Tracy, however, got very loose in the hot conditions, and his speeds ended up being slower. He waved off after only two laps, and got back into the qualifying line. With only a couple minutes left in the day, Howard decided to withdraw his speed and make another attempt, in order to keep Tracy off the track. Howard's gamble backfired, however, as his speed much was slower this time. The 6 o'clock gun fired with Tracy still waiting in line. Since Howard withdrew, Sebastian <b>Saavedra's</b> car was re-instated to 33rd position, and he held on to make the field, while lying in a hospital bed.|$|R
