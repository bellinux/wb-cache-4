5|$|According to a 1997 U.S. Census Bureau report {{less than}} 10% of <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> {{individuals}} were employed. Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs. Factors {{that have been}} found to be related to employment are a strong work ethic and access to AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills. Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC, support from employers, governmental programs and others. Employers of AAC users report that skills in time management, problem solving, communication, technology and a good education are important to employers.|$|E

Hentoff argued that a consistent life ethic should be the viewpoint of a genuine civil libertarian, arguing that all human rights are at risk when the rights of any one group of people are diminished, that human rights are interconnected, and people deny others' human rights at their peril.|$|E
5|$|The 4 MINDS schools offer four {{programs}}; Pre-School, Junior, Senior and Special {{programs for}} pupils who have Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and are <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> intellectually or have challenging behaviours. The curriculum is tailored {{to suit the}} special needs of individual children and {{the focus is on the}} functional needs of the pupils for the present and the future. Areas of learning include language communication, functional academics such as time telling, money value, self-help skills and personal grooming, social competency and pre-vocational skills. To promote the holistic development of pupils, the schools have within their curriculum time, physical education, music and swimming. A multidisciplinary team of Allied Health Professionals in each school, such as psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists, ensures a holistic approach to the development of pupils and support for their families.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Severely</b> <b>disabling</b> {{chronic pain}} in the adult {{population}} is strongly associated {{with a range of}} negative health consequences for individuals and high health care costs, yet its prevalence in young adults is less clear. Methods All adults aged 18 – 25 years old registered with three general practices in North Staffordshire were invited to complete a postal questionnaire containing questions on pain within the last 6 months, pain location and duration. Severity of chronic pain was assessed by the Chronic Pain Grade. <b>Severely</b> <b>disabling</b> chronic pain was defined as pain within the last six months that had lasted for three months or more and was highly disabling-severely limiting (Grade IV). Results 858 responses from 2, 389 were received (adjusted response = 37. 0 %). The prevalence of any pain within the previous six months was 66. 9 % (95 %CI: 63. 7 %, 70. 1 %). Chronic pain was reported by 14. 3 % (95 %CI: 12. 0 %, 16. 8 %) of respondents with <b>severely</b> <b>disabling</b> chronic pain affecting 3. 0 % (95 %CI: 2. 0 %, 4. 4 %) of this population. Late responders were very similar to early responders in their prevalence of pain. Cross-checking the practice register against the electoral roll suggested register inaccuracies contributed to non-response. Conclusion Pain is a common phenomenon encountered by young adults, affecting 66. 9 % of this study population. Previously observed age-related trends in <b>severely</b> <b>disabling</b> chronic pain in older adults extend to younger adults. Although a small minority of younger adults are affected, they are likely to represent a group with particularly high health care needs. High levels of non-response in the present study means that these estimates should be interpreted cautiously although {{there was no evidence of}} non-response bias. </p...|$|R
