25|$|The Nord-100 was {{introduced}} in 1979, which was specialized at flexibility and focused on administrative applications. When Digital launched their VAX-11 in 1977, Norsk Data had the Nord-5 32-bit computer ready for CERN. As the VAX-11 was 32-bit and regarded as a <b>superminicomputer,</b> Norsk Data did not initially {{see it as a}} competitor since the Nord-5 had much better processing power. Nord-50 had similar processing power to the Nord-5, but was not a general-purpose computer. The 32 bit computer used a Nord-10 front processor that ran the SINTRAN III operating system. Development of the ND-500 started in 1978 and had so fundamental changes to the system architecture (was not made from bit-slice components but microprammed with a new instruction set) that all software had to be rewritten - except for the SINTRAN. The computer was launched in 1981, but with fundamental shortcomings imposed by the OS It was much faster than the VAX, but did not meet the general customers' expectation of being a multi-purpose computer. Later models improved the performance and tweaking of the system allowed it to become a multipurpose system.at the performance of a special purpose super computer as sold by Cray. A major contract with the ND-500 was the Joint European Torus project, which took delivery of twenty-seven ND-100 and -500 units. Development of the ND-5000 started before the ND-500 was completed. The design was changed to become more modular; this increased the development costs, but reduced production costs and increased scalability. On the ND5000, components were placed in cards that were interconnected, initially to simplify cooling but also to enable the high clock frequency If an electric current is switched at a clock frequency of 1GHz, it travel about one foot per cycle, so 10cm is a delay of a clock cycle at 3GHz. The ND-500 computers had timing problems caused by wire-distance, and going faster just required everything to be close.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{and cost}} effectiveness of solving thermal analysis problems on <b>superminicomputers</b> is demonstrated. Conventional thermal analysis {{and the changing}} computer environment, computer hardware and software used, six thermal analysis test problems, performance of <b>superminicomputers</b> (CPU time, accuracy, turnaround, and cost) and comparison with large computers are considered. Although the CPU times for <b>superminicomputers</b> were 15 to 30 {{times greater than the}} fastest mainframe computer, the minimum cost to obtain the solutions on <b>superminicomputers</b> was from 11 percent to 59 {{percent of the cost of}} mainframe solutions. The turnaround (elapsed) time is highly dependent on the computer load, but for large problems, <b>superminicomputers</b> produced results in less elapsed time than a typically loaded mainframe computer...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>superminicomputers</b> {{for solving}} {{a series of}} {{increasingly}} complex thermal analysis problems is investigated. The approach involved (1) installation and verification of the SPAR thermal analyzer software on <b>superminicomputers</b> at Langley Research Center and Goddard Space Flight Center, (2) solution of six increasingly complex thermal problems on this equipment, and (3) comparison of solution (accuracy, CPU time, turnaround time, and cost) with solutions on large mainframe computers...|$|R
50|$|MAI Basic Four Business Basic {{was one of}} {{the first}} commercially {{available}} business BASIC interpreters. MAI Basic Four (the company) originally sold minicomputers but later offered <b>superminicomputers</b> and microcomputers.

50|$|Projects {{to extend}} the PDP-10 line were eclipsed {{by the success of}} the {{unrelated}} VAX <b>superminicomputer,</b> and the cancellation of the PDP-10 line was announced in 1983.|$|E
50|$|The ND-500 was a 32-bit <b>superminicomputer</b> {{delivered}} in 1981 by Norsk Data. It {{relied on a}} ND-100 to do housekeeping tasks and run the OS, SINTRAN III.|$|E

5000|$|The first VAX model sold was the VAX-11/780, {{which was}} {{introduced}} on October 25, 1977 at the Digital Equipment Corporation's Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Bill Strecker, C. Gordon Bell's doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University, {{was responsible for}} the architecture. [...] Many different models with different prices, performance levels, and capacities were subsequently created. VAX <b>superminicomputers</b> were very popular in the early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{animation}} on {{this short}} was truly groundbreaking at the time, featuring the {{first use of}} motion blur in CG animation and complex 3D backgrounds, where the lighting styles and colors were inspired by Maxfield Parrish, made using particle systems. Lasseter pushed the envelope by asking for manipulatable shapes capable of the squash and stretch style, as earlier CG models had generally been restricted to rigid geometric shapes. It was rendered on a Cray X-MP/48 supercomputer and ten VAX-11/750 <b>superminicomputers</b> from Project Athena. The film's soundtrack was partially produced by SoundDroid.|$|R
50|$|The Prime 750 {{was a major}} upgrade. It ran at 1.0 MIPS, had 2-8 MB {{of memory}} and 1200 MB of disc storage and a 9-track tape unit.

50|$|The PDP-11 {{was soon}} {{replaced}} by a DEC VAX-11/780 and later PDI shifted to another <b>superminicomputer</b> called the Ridge32. This machine was 2-4 {{times faster than the}} VAX-11/780 {{at a fraction of the}} cost.|$|E
50|$|A <b>super{{minicomputer}},</b> or supermini, was “a minicomputer {{with high}} performance compared to ordinary minicomputers.” The term was an invention used from the mid-1970s mainly {{to distinguish the}} emerging 32-bit minis from the classical 16-bit minicomputers. The term is now largely obsolete but still remains of interest for students/researchers of computer history.|$|E
50|$|HYPERchannel, {{sometimes}} rendered Hyperchannel, was a {{local area}} networking system for mainframe computers, especially supercomputers, introduced by Network Systems Corporation in the 1970s. It ran at the then-fast speed of 50 mbits/second, performance {{that would not be}} matched by commodity hardware until the introduction of Fast Ethernet in 1995. HYPERchannel ran over very thick coax cable or fibre optic extensions and required adaptor hardware the size of a minicomputer. The networking protocol was entirely proprietary. Solutions for Control Data, IBM and Cray computers were their primary products, but a wide variety of support emerged in the 1980s, including DEC VAX and similar <b>superminicomputers.</b>|$|R

NAS, {{which was the first}} supercomputer facility to standardize operating-system and communication software on all processors, has done important Space Shuttle aerodynamics simulations and will be critical to the configurational refinement of the National Aerospace Plane and its intergrated powerplant, which will involve complex, high temperature reactive gasdynamic computations...|$|R
50|$|Many {{computer}} instruction sets are {{designed so that}} a single integer register can store the memory address to any location in the computer's physical or virtual memory. Therefore, {{the total number of}} addresses to memory is often determined by the width of these registers. The IBM System/360 of the 1960s was an early 32-bit computer; it had 32-bit integer registers, although it only used the low order 24 bits of a word for addresses, resulting in a 16 MiB 16 × 10242 bytes address space. 32-bit <b>superminicomputers,</b> such as the DEC VAX, became common in the 1970s, and 32-bit microprocessors, such as the Motorola 68000 family and the 32-bit members of the x86 family starting with the Intel 80386, appeared in the mid-1980s, making 32 bits something of a de facto consensus as a convenient register size.|$|R
5000|$|DEC's 32-bit {{successor}} to the PDP-11, the VAX (for [...] "Virtual Address eXtension") overcame the 16-bit limitation, but was initially a <b>superminicomputer</b> aimed at the high-end time-sharing market. The early VAXes provided a PDP-11 compatibility mode under which much existing software could be immediately used, in parallel with newer 32-bit software.|$|E
50|$|Gould Electronics Inc. - {{founded in}} 1928 and based in Chandler, Arizona - was a company {{involved}} in the electronics and semiconductor industries. They made printed circuit materials for use by electronics manufacturers. Having acquired Systems Engineering Laboratories Gould became {{involved in the}} <b>Superminicomputer</b> computer business. Gould's non-defense businesses were acquired in 1988 by Nippon Mining, now JX Holdings.|$|E
50|$|The PowerNode 9080 was a dual {{processor}} 32-bit <b>Superminicomputer</b> produced by Fort Lauderdale, Florida based electronics company Gould Electronics in the 1980s. Its UTX/32 4.3BSD Berkeley Unix-based operating system {{was one of}} the very first multi-processor shared memory implementations of Unix, although the processors operated in a Master-Slave configuration with a Mutual Exclusion (MutEx) lock on all Kernel IO resources. Machines could be configured for either single or {{dual processor}} operation.|$|E
40|$|Since 1982, the Western Aeronautical Test Range of the Ames-Dryden Flight Research Facility {{has been}} {{separating}} the data acquisition and processing function required on all telemetry {{pulse code modulation}} (PCM) data and the display processing function required in the flight research mission control centers (MCCs). These two functions historically have been done on {{the same set of}} <b>superminicomputers</b> remote from the MCCs. Removing the display processing function from the realm of the superminis or telemetry-radar acquisition and processing system (TRAPS) and out into the MCCs will allow the research engineers the flexibility to configure their own display processing system to optimize performance during a flight research mission. Meanwhile, the TRAPS will have more time to acquire data. One of the processors chosen is an IBM PC/AT compatible rack-mounted personal computer. This class and type machine will not only allow the transfer of the display processing function into the MCCs, but also allow the research engineers a personalized set of analytic and display tools for use on their own unique sets of data...|$|R
5000|$|Commodity {{computing}} (also {{known as}} commodity cluster computing) {{involves the use}} of large numbers of already-available computing components for parallel computing, to get the greatest amount of useful computation at low cost. It is computing done in commodity computers as opposed to in high-cost <b>superminicomputers</b> or in boutique computers. Commodity computers are computer systems - manufactured by multiple vendors - incorporating components based on open standards. Such systems are said to be based on commodity components, since the standardization process promotes lower costs and less differentiation among vendors' products. Standardization and decreased differentiation lower the switching or exit cost from any given vendor, increasing purchasers' leverage and preventing lock-in. A governing principle of commodity computing is that it is preferable to have more low-performance, low-cost hardware working in parallel (scalar computing) (e.g. AMD x86 [...] CISC) than to have fewer high-performance, high-cost hardware items (e.g. IBM POWER7 or Sun-Oracle's SPARC RISC). At some point, the number of discrete systems in a cluster will be greater than the mean time between failures (MTBF) for any hardware platform, no matter how reliable, so fault tolerance must be built into the controlling software.Purchases should be optimized on cost-per-unit-of-performance, not just on absolute performance-per-CPU at any cost.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1988 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaDramatic {{increases}} in telemetry data rates and sources require test engineers to view and digest real-time data {{in order to}} make cogent decisions about whether to continue or modify flight tests. Traditional telemetry systems offer limited insight through a myriad of strip charts and alphanumeric displays. Attempts to improve this human interface employed expensive central <b>superminicomputers</b> and display systems. Although these methods have been successful, development and procurement costs and delays have limited their deployment. Recent advances in low-cost standard display, processing, and network technology have {{led to the development of}} the System 500. The System 500 employs a distributed architecture. Independent, relatively low cost, high-resolution color graphics workstations connect to the data acquisition and processing subsystems via Ethernet. * Each station is independent, requesting and then receiving only data for display. The combined ability to physically display and update only a few hundred parameters, each at relatively few samples per second makes Ethernet and standard upper layer protocols ideal for this application. The state-of-the-art human interface lets users select or mix a variety of methods to create and modify display contents, including: choosing from a list using arrow keys or a mouse, moving a scroll bar to pan through parameter files, or entering commands via keyboard where response anticipation reduces keystrokes to those uniquely defining a choice. A repertoire of graphic window displays is available to present real-time and static data concisely in analog and alphanumeric formats. Window size, location, and color have been chosen to focus attention rather than beautify. Standard windows and accent colors direct user attention to specific areas without cluttering and distracting...|$|R

50|$|The PDP-10 was {{eventually}} eclipsed by the VAX <b>superminicomputer</b> machines (descendants of the PDP-11) when DEC {{recognized that the}} PDP-10 and VAX product lines were competing {{with each other and}} decided to concentrate its software development effort on the more profitable VAX. The PDP-10 product line cancellation was announced in 1983, including cancelling the ongoing Jupiter project to produce a new high-end PDP-10 processor (despite that project being in good shape {{at the time of the}} cancellation) and the Minnow project to produce a desktop PDP-10, which may then have been at the prototyping stage.|$|E
50|$|The MicroVAX 78032 (otherwise {{known as}} the DC333) is a {{microprocessor}} developed and fabricated by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) that implemented {{a subset of the}} VAX instruction set architecture (ISA). The 78032 was used exclusively in DEC's VAX-based systems, starting with the MicroVAX II in 1985. When clocked at a frequency of 5 MHz, the 78032's integer performance is comparable to the VAX-11/780 <b>superminicomputer,</b> which was introduced on 25 October 1977. The microprocessor could be paired with the MicroVAX 78132 floating point accelerator for improved floating point performance.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, DEC {{decided to}} extend the PDP-11 {{architecture}} to 32 bits while adding a complete virtual memory system to the simple paging and memory protection of the PDP-11. The result was the VAX architecture, where VAX stands for Virtual Address eXtension (from 16 to 32 bits). The first computer to use a VAX CPU was the VAX-11/780, which DEC {{referred to as a}} <b>superminicomputer.</b> Although it was not the first 32-bit minicomputer, the VAX-11/780's combination of features, price, and marketing almost immediately propelled it to a leadership position in the market after it was released in 1978. VAX systems were so successful that in 1983, DEC canceled its Jupiter project, which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10 mainframe, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as the single computer architecture for the company.|$|E
50|$|Minicomputers (colloquially, minis) are a {{class of}} {{multi-user}} computers that lie in the middle range of the computing spectrum, in between the smallest mainframe computers and the largest single-user systems (microcomputers or personal computers). The term <b>superminicomputer</b> or supermini was used to distinguish more powerful minicomputers that approached mainframes in capability. Superminis (such as the DEC VAX or Data General Eclipse MV/8000) were usually 32-bit {{at a time when}} most minicomputers (such as the PDP-11 or Data General Eclipse or IBM Series/1) were 16-bit. These traditional minicomputers in the last few decades of the 20th Century, found in small to medium-sized businesses, laboratories and embedded in (for example) hospital CAT scanners, often would be rack-mounted and connect to one or more terminals or tape/card readers, like mainframes and unlike most personal computers, but require less space and electrical power than a typical mainframe. The contemporary term for minicomputer is midrange computer, such as the higher-end SPARC, POWER and Itanium-based systems from Oracle Corporation, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, and the size is now typically smaller, such as a tower case.|$|E
