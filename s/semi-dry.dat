5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Israelis drink wine in moderation, and almost always at meals or social occasions. Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is low compared to other wine-drinking Mediterranean countries, but the per capita amount has been increasing since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of <b>semi-dry</b> and dry wines. In addition to Israeli wines, {{an increasing number of}} wines are imported from France, Italy, Australia, the United States, Chile and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or <b>semi-dry</b> wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s were a {{formative}} decade: {{the increased}} optimism after {{the signing of}} the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, the economic recovery of the mid-1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine. In addition, high quality, locally produced ingredients became increasingly available. For example, privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat, sheep and cow’s milk, which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public. In 1983, the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class, <b>semi-dry</b> and dry wines. New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads and the production of high quality olive oil. The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish, and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to mass concrete structures that minimizes cement's thermal byproduct {{is the use}} of roller-compacted concrete, which uses a dry mix which has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional wet placement.

25|$|In the Soviet Union, {{sparkling}} wine was produced {{under the name}} Soviet Champagne, or Sovetskoye Shampanskoye, most of it sweet. This designation continues {{to be used for}} {{sparkling wine}} produced in several countries formerly part of the Soviet Union, including Armenia, Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. Most likely, the name has stuck since Sovetskoye Shampanskoye {{was one of the few}} products or brands of the Soviet era which were seen as luxurious. Often the names have been altered to fit the exact country, e.g. Armenian Champagne. Nowadays, it is more common to encounter Sovetskoye Shampanskoye produced in a dry or <b>semi-dry</b> style. The products have some international popularity, thus Russian made dry and <b>semi-dry</b> versions can be found in the European markets and Moldovan made semi-sweet version from Muscat grapes has been regularly available in the U.S.|$|E
40|$|Effects of the {{addition}} of kimchi powder on the physico-chemical and sensory properties of <b>semi-dried</b> sausages were investigated at the following kimchi powder concentrations: control (0 %), T 1 (1 %), T 2 (2 %), and T 3 (3 %). pH of the <b>semi-dried</b> sausages containing kimchi powder decreased with {{the addition}} of kimchi (p< 0. 05). Also, {{the addition of}} kimchi pow-der to the sausages significantly decreased the CIE L * and increased the CIE a * and CIE b * values (p< 0. 05). The T 3 treat-ment resulted a higher mositure lose than other treatments. TBARS values of the T 2 and T 3 groups were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than that of the control, while T 3 had the highest VBN value among treatments {{at the end of the}} storage period. Addition of kimchi powder to <b>semi-dried</b> sausages improved the overall sensory properties of the sausages, and increased the softness and tenderness.

Detection is typically performed using peroxidase linked antibodies to catalyse a chemiluminescent reaction.|$|E
40|$|A {{sustained}} {{increase in}} Salmonella enterica serovar Virchow notifications in South Eastern Australia between September 1997 and May 1998 instigated a case-control study and environmental investigations. Cases {{were defined as}} having locally acquired culture-confirmed S. Virchow phage-type 8 infection and diarrhoeal disease. Matched controls were selected by progressive digit dialling based on cases telephone numbers. An exposure and food history questionnaire was administered by telephone. Phage typing and pulse field gel electrophoresis were performed on case and environmental isolates. Thirty-two notifications of S. Virchow infection met the case definition, 37 % reported bloody diarrhoea and S. Virchow was isolated from blood in 13 % of cases. Twelve patients were admitted to hospital and one died.

25|$|To dive safely, divers must {{control their}} {{rate of descent}} and ascent {{in the water and}} be able to {{maintain}} a constant depth in midwater. Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver's overall buoyancy determines whether they ascend or descend. Equipment such as diving weighting systems, diving suits (wet, dry or <b>semi-dry</b> suits are used depending on the water temperature) and buoyancy compensators can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers want to remain at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimises the effort of swimming to maintain depth and therefore reduces gas consumption.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} has rolling hills, {{mountain ranges}} and flatlands. Most {{of the rolling}} hills cross the territory from south to north, paralleling the Querétaro-San Luis Potosí highway.

Altitude varies from 1,900 to 2,460 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at mountains called El Buey, Pie de Gallo, El Patol, El Nabo, and El Paisano. The city proper is on a plain at 1,900 meters. There is only one river, the Querétaro River, which carved the La Cañada. There are numerous streams, many of them seasonal, and fresh water springs near the mountain areas. The climate is temperate and <b>semi-dry</b> in which the summers can be hot, with high up to 36C in May and June. Freezing temperatures are possible in the winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{sweetness}} of wines {{is determined by}} the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process. Wines can be bone dry (with the sugars fully fermented into alcohol), off-dry (with a hint of sweetness), <b>semi-dry</b> (medium-sweet) and dessert level sweetness (such as the high sugar content in Sauternes and Tokays). Sweet wines often need to be sweeter than the dish they are served with. Vintage brut champagne paired with sweet, wedding cake can make the wine taste tart and weak while the cake will have off flavors. In food pairings, sweetness balances spice and heat. It can serve as a contrast to the heat and alleviate some of the burning sensation caused by peppers and spicy Asian cuisine. It can accentuate the mild sweetness in some foods and can also contrast with salt such as the European custom of pairing salty Stilton cheese with a sweet Port. Sweetness in a wine can balance tartness in food, especially if the food has some sweetness (such as dishes with sweet & sour sauces).|$|E
