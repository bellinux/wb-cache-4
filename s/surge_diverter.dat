50|$|The {{locomotive}} has {{a single}} full width air conditioned cab. At the rear end, the body work is lower to provide clearance for the 50 kV AC electrical equipment which is mounted on the roof. This consists of a single pantograph, a potential divider, a vacuum circuit breaker, a <b>surge</b> <b>diverter</b> and the main transformer’s high voltage terminal. The electrical control system is solid state, using thyristors.|$|E
50|$|A surge {{protector}} (or surge suppressor or <b>surge</b> <b>diverter)</b> is an appliance or device {{designed to protect}} electrical devices from voltage spikes. A {{surge protector}} attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold. This article primarily discusses specifications and components relevant {{to the type of}} protector that diverts (shorts) a voltage spike to ground; however, there is some coverage of other methods.|$|E
50|$|Calculation of minimum {{approach}} distances {{take account of}} switching surges and other transients. Transmission systems are often fitted with coordinated protection devices called autoreclosers, which are circuit breakers that automatically attempt to remake a circuit after a fault. In the event that a fault did occur it would be most undesirable for the autorecloser to re-energise the circuit because the limits of approach would be greatly reduced and the workers' position could be compromised. Hence, auto-reclosing equipment is rendered inoperative while live working takes place. Additional protection against unplanned overvoltage events (such as switching surges) can be provided {{by means of a}} <b>surge</b> <b>diverter</b> known as portable protective air gap.|$|E

ABSTRACT: Hundred percent reliability is the utmost desire of every electricity operator, therefore a good designer will always aim at giving the optimum reliable conditions. This requires choosing the best and suitable materials according to the required regulations. The Niger Delta environment, due to its peculiar terrain and harsh climatic conditions requires special attention in terms of choosing the materials in construction. Therefore, a good protective device is necessary not only for equipment but also for personnel. The climate of Niger Delta {{is known to have}} heavy rainfall, high humidity and high Isokeraunic level, therefore proper selection of <b>Surge</b> Absorber (<b>diverter)</b> is necessary for a reliable protection from travelling waves and switching surges in lines and substations.
