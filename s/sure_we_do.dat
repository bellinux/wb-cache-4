[...] During the preceding several weeks, ElBaradei had several times expressed his opposition to a military attack on Iran. He made these statements as part of what he saw as his role as Director General of the IAEA, stating [...] "I have no brief other than to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not go into another war, or that we go crazy into killing each other." ...|$|E

He {{was asked by}} co-host Touré if he believed that Democratic Party has done {{enough to get the}} overwhelming support from African-Americans it receives. King's answer is said to have shocked the host. “The party does not do enough,” he said. “It's our responsibility to hold the party accountable. And I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that. I think {{we have to find a}} way to hold the parties accountable. He went on to say that he believed there should be communication between African-Americans and the Tea Party Movement, saying [...] "the only way you change is you have to be at least communicating".|$|E

6000|$|... § III. I said {{in chapter}} II. § XIV., that all noble {{ornamentation}} was {{the expression of}} man's delight in God's work. This implied {{that there was an}} ignoble ornamentation, which was the expression of man's delight in his own. There is such a school, chiefly degraded classic and Renaissance, in which the ornament is composed of imitations of tilings made by man. I think, before inquiring what we like best of God's work, we had better get rid of all this imitation of man's, and be quite <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not like that.|$|E

This starts with careful consideration of timing and relevance of the message, followed by 3 levels of {{performance feedback}}. The first level requires the team member to formulate the message short, clear and non-blaming (“doctor, I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> all the checks…”). The second level contains a key word that has a defined value (“doctor, I’m not comfortable with that decision…”). If this feedback is ignored, and the situation is considered unacceptable the last resort could be a request to “stop the procedure”.|$|R
50|$|The five unlucky {{days were}} called nemontemi in Mexico.

Therefore, People tried to do as little as possible on these days, and a person who was born during the nemontemi was considered unlucky.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the death}} of Michael Jackson on June 25, 2009, Captain EO regained {{popularity}} on the Internet.

Soon afterward, Disney officials were seen in Disneyland at the Magic Eye Theater and reportedly held a private screening of Captain EO to determine if it could be shown again. On September 10, Disney CEO Bob Iger said, [...] "There aren’t plans to bring back Captain EO at this time ... We are looking at it.

5000|$|When {{asked about}} {{allowing}} additional {{drilling for oil}} in the continental US, including the Great Lakes if oil was to be found there, Johnson responded: [...] "We {{have to get the}} oil where it is, but we need to do it responsibly. We need to utilize American ingenuity and American technology to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it environmentally sensitively and safely." [...] After criticism from the Feingold campaign, Johnson said in July 2010 that his answer did not mean he supported drilling in the Great Lakes. Johnson argues that America's dependence on imported oil creates [...] "both security and economic threats to the nation". Johnson is a cosponsor of legislation to encourage job growth, reduce energy costs, and increase tax revenue by expanding domestic oil production.|$|E
5000|$|Following passage, on May 12 Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas {{requested}} that the US Senate agree to form a joint select committee on the matter with the House. The suggestion was quickly rejected in the Senate, which unlike the House was under Democratic control. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican from South Carolina {{and member of the}} Senate Armed Services Committee, had said in November 2012 that Congress should form a special committee—like it had for the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals—to investigate what happened before, during and after the Benghazi attack. On May 15, 2014, he joined 36 other Republican senators calling on Majority Leader Harry Reid to establish a related select committee, saying: “Congressional oversight is crucial to understanding what happened before, during, and after the attacks, so we can be <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> everything in our power to prevent future attacks." ...|$|E

When a man is going to the deuce, how easy and pleasant the journey is!
