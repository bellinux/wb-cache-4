5|$|Mitochondria are organelles {{vital in}} {{metabolism}} {{as they are}} {{the site of the}} citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. They evolved from <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and retain a remnant genome. Like bacteria, plant cells have cell walls, and contain organelles such as chloroplasts in addition to the organelles in other eukaryotes. Chloroplasts produce energy from light by photosynthesis, and were also originally <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria.</b>|$|E

5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy {{one or more}} of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{bacteria}} that degrade cellulose. <b>Symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in Xylophaga {{may play a role in}} the degradation of sunken wood; while bacteria such as Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, Clostridia, and Bacteroidetes have been detected in wood submerged over a year.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to a role in fibre digestion, <b>Symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in N. corniger have {{also been shown to}} fix nitrogen at a rate of 0.25-1.0mg N per colony per hour. This suggests a nitrogen doubling time of 200–500 days making it possible for the whole population of the colony to be replaced once or twice each year.|$|E
25|$|Aphids can {{be easily}} killed by {{unfavourable}} weather, such as late spring freezes. Excessive heat kills the <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> that some aphids depend on, which makes the aphids infertile. Rain prevents winged aphids from dispersing, and knocks aphids off plants and thus kills them from the impact or by starvation. However, rain cannot be relied on for aphid control.|$|E

50|$|Fungus-growing attine ants {{have been}} shown to use antimycins - {{produced}} by <b>symbiotic</b> Streptomyces <b>bacteria</b> - in their fungiculture, to inhibit non-cultivar (i.e. pathogenic) fungi. One research group studying these <b>symbiotic</b> Streptomyces <b>bacteria</b> recently identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for antimycins, which was unknown despite the compounds themselves being identified 60 years ago. Antimycins are synthesised by a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)/non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS).|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the small}} size of the genome of most endosymbionts, they are unable to exist {{for any length of time}} outside of the host cell, thereby {{preventing}} a long-term symbiotic relationship. However, in the case of the endonuclear <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Holospora, it has been discovered that Holospora species can maintain their infectivity for a limited time and form a symbiotic relationship with Paramecium species.|$|R
25|$|During {{this initial}} stage, when methane is {{relatively}} abundant, dense mussel beds also form near the cold seep. Mostly composed of {{species in the}} genus Bathymodiolus, these mussels do not directly consume food. Instead, they are nourished by <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> that also produce energy from methane, similar to their relatives that form mats. Chemosynthetic bivalves are prominent constituents of the fauna of cold seeps and are represented in that setting by five families: Solemyidae, Lucinidae, Vesicomyidae, Thyasiridae and Mytilidae.|$|E
25|$|Sponges are {{sensitive}} to temperature, and extreme fluctuations in ambient temperature can negatively affect the health of sea sponges. High temperatures lead to crashes in sponge cultures. <b>Symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> that normally inhabit sea sponges start reproducing at an unsustainable rate when ambient temperature of the water increases by a few degrees. These bacteria then attack and destroy the sponge cells and tissue. It {{has been suggested that}} sponges should be cultured at water temperatures slightly below the ambient water temperature in the region the sponge has been originally isolated from.|$|E
25|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} {{was developed to}} explain the observation that hay fever and eczema, both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were, it is presumed, exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child. The hygiene hypothesis has been extensively investigated by immunologists and epidemiologists and has become an important theoretical framework {{for the study of}} allergic disorders. It is used to explain the increase in allergic diseases that have been seen since industrialization, and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. The hygiene hypothesis has now expanded to include exposure to <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and parasites as important modulators of immune system development, along with infectious agents.|$|E

50|$|Buchnera {{was named}} after Paul Buchner(de:) by Paul Baumann and his {{graduate}} student, and the first molecular characterization of a <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{was carried out by}} Baumann, using Buchnera. The initial studies on Buchnera later led to studies on symbionts of many groups of insects, pursued by numerous investigators, including Paul and Linda Baumann, Nancy Moran, Serap Aksoy, and Roy Gross, who together investigated symbionts of aphids, tsetse flies, ants, leafhoppers, mealybugs, whiteflies, psyllids, and others.|$|R
50|$|Inside their insect hosts, EPNs {{experience}} both intra and interspecific competition. Intraspecific competition {{takes place}} among nematodes {{of the same}} species when the number of infective juveniles penetrating a host exceeds the amount of resources available. Interspecific competition occurs when different species compete for resources. In both cases, the individual nematodes compete with each other indirectly by consuming the same resource, which reduces their fitness and may result in the local extinction of one species inside the host (Koppenhofer and Kaya 1996). Interference competition, in which species compete directly, can also occur. For example, a steinernematid species that infects a host first usually excludes a heterorhabditid species. The mechanism for this superiority may be antibiotics produced by Xenorhabdus, the <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacterium</b> of the steinernematid. These antibiotics prevent the <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacterium</b> of the heterorhabditid from multiplying (Kaya and Koppenhofer1996). In order to avoid competition, some species of infective juveniles are able to judge the quality of a host before penetration. The infective juveniles of S. carpocapsae are repelled by 24-hour-old infections, likely by the smell of their own species’ mutualistic bacteria (Grewal et al. 1997).|$|R
25|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} occurs {{through the}} clustered or scattered deposition of spermatophores by male adults. Stimulation of spermatophore deposition by female pheromones {{has been demonstrated}} in Sinella curviseta. Mating behaviour {{can be observed in}} Symphypleona. Among Symphypleona, males of some Sminthuridae use a clasping organ located on their antenna. Many collembolan species, mostly those living in deeper soil horizons, are parthenogenetic, which favours reproduction to the detriment of genetic diversity and thereby to population tolerance of environmental hazards. Parthenogenesis (also called thelytoky) is under the control of <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> of the genus Wolbachia, which live, reproduce and are carried in female reproductive organs and eggs of Collembola. Feminizing Wolbachia species are widespread in arthropods and nematodes, where they co-evolved with most of their lineages.|$|E
25|$|These tall {{sulphide}} chimneys (hydrothermal vents) host some unique ecological communities. While most of {{the deep}} sea depends on near-surface productivity with photosynthesis as its fundamental energy source, vent communities are completely independent from the surface and sunlight. Bacteria are able to use reduced compounds from the vent effluent as an energy source (chemosynthesis). These bacteria can be free-living or symbiotic and are {{the base of the}} food web of these communities where 90% of the species are endemic to this special environment. The tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae grows in large colonies in diffuse venting areas, supported by the symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria developing in their cells. These worms have no mouth and rely on their internal <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> to survive. Other species living within hydrothermal communities include limpets, worms (scale worms and sulphide worms), fish, and sea spiders.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} {{luminescence}} is <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> that dwell {{in and around}} the esca. In some species, the bacteria recruited to the esca are incapable of luminescence independent of the anglerfish, suggesting they have developed a symbiotic relationship and the bacteria are unable to synthesize all of the chemicals necessary for luminescence on their own. They depend on the fish to make up the difference. Electron microscopy of these bacteria in some species reveals they are Gram-negative rods that lack capsules, spores, or flagella. They have double-layered cell walls and mesosomes. A pore connects the esca with the seawater, which enables the removal of dead bacteria and cellular waste, and allows the pH and tonicity of the culture medium to remain constant. This, as well as the constant temperature of the bathypelagic zone inhabited by these fish, is crucial for the long-term viability of bacterial cultures.|$|E

50|$|Legumes are notable in {{that most}} of them have <b>symbiotic</b> nitrogen-fixing <b>bacteria</b> in {{structures}} called root nodules. For that reason, they {{play a key role in}} crop rotation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{belongs to}} Alcaligenaceae family of β-proteobacterium. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences, {{it is known}} that it {{originated}} from a common ancestor kinetoplastid with Blastocrithidia species. The two groups are assumed to enter two different host protozoans to evolve into different species. Hence the scientific name (Candidatus) Kinetoplastibacterium crithidii was given to the bacterium. Although it was initially proposed that the bacterium evolved from a common ancestor with members of Bordetella, however, detailed phylogenomic analysis revealed that it is more closely related to members of the genus Taylorella.|$|R
25|$|Though often counted {{among the}} various {{carnivorous}} plants, {{with the exception of}} Heliamphora tatei, the vast majority of plants in the genus Heliamphora do not produce their own digestive enzymes (i.e. proteases, ribonucleases, phosphatases, etc.), relying instead on the enzymes of <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> to break down their prey. They do, however, attract prey through special visual and chemical signals and trap and kill the prey through a typical pitfall trap. Field studies of H. nutans, H. heterodoxa, H. minor, and H. ionasi have determined that none of these species produce their own proteolytic enzymes. If production of these enzymes was used as a strict demarcation of what is and what is not a carnivorous plant, many of the Heliamphora species would not meet the requirement. H. tatei {{is one of the few}} species observed to produce both digestive enzymes and wax scales, which also aid in prey capture. The pattern of carnivory among Heliamphora species, combined with habitat data, indicates that carnivory in this genus evolved in nutrient-poor locations as a means to improve absorption of available nutrients. Most Heliamphora typically capture ants, while H. tateis improvements on the design allow it to capture and absorb nutrients from more flying insects. The carnivorous habit among these species is lost in low light conditions, which suggests that certain nutrient concentrations (specifically nitrogen and phosphorus) are only limiting during periods of fast growth under normal light conditions, thus rendering most of the carnivorous adaptations inefficient and not energy cost effective.|$|E
500|$|Horses are herbivores with a {{digestive}} system adapted to a forage diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, {{they have a}} relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate {{a steady flow of}} nutrients. A [...] horse will eat [...] of food per day and, under normal use, drink [...] of water. Horses are not ruminants, they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can utilize cellulose, a major component of grass. Horses are hindgut fermenters. Cellulose fermentation by <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> occurs in the cecum, or [...] "water gut", which food goes through before reaching the large intestine. Horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause colic, a leading cause of death.|$|E
500|$|The strict {{definition}} {{requires that}} a plant must possess morphological adaptations that attract prey through scent or visual cues, capture and retain prey (e.g., the waxy scales of Brocchinia reducta or downward facing hairs of Heliamphora prevent escape), digest the dead prey through enzymes {{produced by the}} plant, and [...] the products of digestion through specialized structures. The presence of commensals is also listed as strong evidence of a long evolutionary history of carnivory. By this definition, many sun pitcher plants (Heliamphora) and the cobra lily (Darlingtonia californica)s apparent lack of proteolytic enzymes. Ellison and Farnsworth (2005) also notes that Darlingtonia instead relies on [...] "a food web of bacteria, protozoa, mites, and fly larvae" [...] to break down captured prey (Naeem, 1988; Nielsen, 1990). would not be included on a roster of carnivorous plants because they rely on <b>symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and other organisms to produce the necessary proteolytic enzymes.|$|E
