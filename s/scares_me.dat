2500|$|After seeing Armie Hammer's {{performance}} in The Social Network (2010), Guadagnino [...] "fell in love" [...] {{with him and}} cultivated his passion for Hammer and the movies he made afterwards. The director {{found him to be}} a [...] "sophisticated actor, with a great range" [...] and had him in mind for the role of Oliver. Hammer, who expressed his interest in Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash, met with the director years before the film went into production. When Hammer got the script, he almost turned down the role because of the nudity that was originally in it. [...] "I did want to pass. It scared me," [...] he said. [...] "There’s a lot of stuff here that I’ve never done on film before. But there’s no way I can’t do this, mostly because it <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> so much." [...] According to Guadagnino, Hammer was going to pass on the role through his agent, but then changed his mind {{at the end of their}} conversation. This is the third film that has Hammer playing a gay character, following Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar (2011) and Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait (2017).|$|E
