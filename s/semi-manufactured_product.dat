As an important <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>product,</b> diced potatoes need to be graded according to their three-dimensional (3 D) size and shape before trading. 3 D information inspection manually is a time-consuming and labor intensive work. A novel automatic grading system based on computer vision and near-infrared linear-array structured lighting was proposed in this paper. Two-dimensional size and shape information were extracted from RGB images, and height information was measured in NIR images combined with structured lighting. Then, a pair of pseudo-color and gray level height map images fusing with 3 D size and shape information was constructed. Finally, diced potatoes were classified into either regular or irregular class according to their 3 D information and criteria required by the industry. The grading system and proposed algorithm were testified by a total of 400 diced potatoes with different size and shapes. The test results showed that the detection error was in the range of about 1  mm, and the classification accuracy was 98  %. The results indicated that the system and algorithm was efficient and suitable for the 3 D characteristic inspection of diced potatoes...|$|E

Globally, hard hit areas include those associated with the early Industrial Revolution characterised by mass production and the agglomeration of iron and steel, coal and textile industries. General changes in the global market, especially the falling demand for extractive heavy minerals like coal and gold have also affected many countries region and localities. In the case of South Mrica, the previous high economic dependence on mined minerals like coal and gold has resulted in many once prosperous mining regions of the country being reduced to a shadow of their former selves. The worst affected areas in South Africa are those of the Klerksdorp Goldfields in the North West Province and Free State Goldfields, with the latter alone losing 100, 000 jobs during the 1990 s. This trend has also been acute in the coal-mining industry of the KwaZulu-Natal province since the late 1970 s. The firms that had grown {{in the shadow of the}} major mining company supplyipg machinery, or who processed the <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>product</b> are also severely affected by the closing down and restructuring in the mining and iron industries. These industries have often been forced to close down because of a break in the vital connections they developed with these mining industries. Such localised economic crisis has encouraged the universal trend towards the devolution of developmental responsibilities to the local governments and other local stakeholders to - empower them to respond to these changes. This study investigated the local economic initiatives which have been undertaken in the three municipalities of north-western KwaZulu Natal i. e. Utrecht, Dundee and Dannhauser to respond to the closures which have taken place in the mining industry of this region, which used to be among the most prosperous coal mining regions of South Africa. Using their new developmental mandate the local governments, in partnership with the communities and other external interveners have tried to respond to these localised economic crisis and also indirectly to the general poverty and underdevelopment, which characterises this region of KwaZulu-Natal. The effects of apartheid policies, and previous discriminatory rural development policies in, particular, and the Regional Industrial Development policy, which was intensively applied in the 1980 s by the pre- 1994 government regime, have further compounded the magnitude of the challenge. The lack of capacity in some municipalities has constrained successful implementation of Local Economic Development has led to some communities acting alone to face their situation with or without external interventio...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is provided}} of the history, logic, merits {{and limitations of}} the national accounts. Past In {{the second half of}} the seventeenth century the first estimates of national income were made. These estimates served clear purposes, like demonstrating that a revision of the English tax system could raise sufficient resources for waging a war with Holland or France. The number of estimates and their frequency gradually increased, in particular since the First World War. Major innovations, like the development of the sector accounts, input-output tables and the arrival of the first guidelines took place in the thirties and forties. These innovations were stimulated by the Keynesian revolution and the development of macro-econometric model building. Since the Second World War national accounts statistics have become institutionalised and standardised, i. e. they are regularly compiled by national statistical institutes, Central Banks or Ministries and are based on one universal set of multi-purpose concepts and classifications. About a decade ago, the third generation of international guidelines on national accounting was introduced. In comparison to the first guidelines, the scope was drastically extended, e. g. by the inclusion of prices and volumes, balance sheets and input-output tables. However, the basic concepts, like the production boundary have hardly been changed in fifty years. Since the collapse of communism, no separate guidelines and concepts exist for the (formerly) communist countries. The European Unification has stimulated a revolution in national accounting, in particular with respect to the development of jurisprudence and the improvement and harmonization of the estimates. The European Union was not only aware of the possibilities of the national accounts as a tool for European policy, but acted also as a critical consumer. The latter was vital for generating this revolution in European national accounts practice. Present National accounts statistics are a miracle come true: all over the world, very incomplete, imperfect, heterogeneous and partly outdated data are transformed into a complete, consistent, internationally standardised and up-to-date overview of the national economy and its major components. What is the magic behind this miracle? The universal model National accounts statistics are estimates of a universal accounting model for describing, analysing and managing national economies. This universal model is not a neutral description of economic reality: it is focused on what can be readily observed in monetary terms, it contains substantial transformations of what can be observed and is based on a specific way of labelling economic reality. Different choices would have resulted in a different picture of economic reality. The major biases of the universal model merely reflect the natural focus of a regular economic statistic, i. e. a focus on what can be readily observed in monetary terms. This explains why the economic importance of unpaid household services, leisure time, pollution and tax expenditures is ignored. Including such major analytic elements in the basic concepts would seriously endanger the statistical purpose of the universal model. Furthermore, it would also drastically decrease the relevance of the universal model and its major aggregates for important other data needs, e. g. those of budgetary and monetary policy. The substantial transformations of what can be readily observed are required in order to look –on behalf of analysis and policy- through the complex, chaotic and many different economic and institutional realities. The specific concepts used are the result of many implicit and explicit considerations with respect to relevance, reliability and comparability. They are also influenced by the need to agree on one set of concepts, even if arguments are not sufficient to settle the score. The universal model incorporates two types of perspectives on the national economy. Firstly, it describes the national economy in terms of its major components (sectors/industries, various types of flows and stocks and several economic processes). This is the general perspective of the universal model. However, the universal model describes also each major component in a macro-economic context and in relation to the other major components. These are the specific perspectives incorporated in the universal model. Seven major specific perspectives can be distinguished: 1. 	Non-financial corporations (business accounts); 2. 	Financial corporations (monetary policy, financial markets); 3. 	Government (budgetary policy, government finance); 4. 	Households (personal income, wealth and consumption); 5. 	Rest of the world (balance of payments); 6. 	Industries (production, employment and input-output analysis); 7. 	Other (e. g. the environment, human capital and the welfare state). The old and most recent history of the national accounts demonstrates that these specific perspectives, and in particular that of the government and its relations to the national economy, are a major motivation for compiling national accounts statistics. The universal model is an ingenious and very practical product. The various perspectives demonstrate that it is a synthesis of various types of applied economic analysis, e. g. business accounts, Keynesian type of analysis, input-output analysis and index number theory. The universal model also reflects three hundred years of experience in compiling national accounts statistics. Nevertheless, the universal model can still be improved in various ways. The universal model stresses the importance of flexibility, but does not make an explicit link to the seven perspectives. For each of these perspectives, standard supplementary concepts, like government expenditure and revenue, entrepreneurial income after tax and net worth to the owner, are very relevant and can be easily derived from the basic concepts of the universal model. For each of these perspectives also the importance of prices, volumes, real values and key-ratios should be stressed. Also some changes in the basic concepts are proposed e. g. : -	Other non-market output, e. g. of the government, should be valued including a net operating surplus by amount of an opportunity interest on the capital invested. -	The purchase of consumer durables by households should be recorded as capital formation instead of as final consumption expenditure. Imputed services of owner-used consumer durables should be recorded by amount of its consumption of fixed capital plus an opportunity interest on the capital invested. These imputed services are consumed as part of the final consumption expenditure of households. These changes increase the relevance of the national accounts from an economic theoretic point of view. Furthermore, also various changes in the presentation of national accounts statistics are proposed, e. g. a more systematic distinction between actual and imputed flows and the limitation of the number of accounts. The national measurement process The universal model can not be estimated directly. It should first be translated into an operational model for a specific country during a specific period of time. This involves interpretation of the universal model in view of the national economy and further specification of the concepts, detail and scope. For example, which units belong to the sector government en to what extent can price- and volume measures take account of changes in quality? The operational model decides to a substantial extent what is actually measured. Differences in national operational models are therefore a serious threat to international comparability. The operational model is estimated by combining very heterogeneous and incomplete sets of data; the latter include national accounts estimates for previous periods and frames of reference for grossing up and combining data, e. g. a business register or a population census. The major estimation tools are accounting identities, plausibility checks and assumptions. The estimation process is influenced by environmental factors like skills (e. g. skills in combining data and making plausible assumptions), resources (e. g. resources for compiling good price-statistics, for maintaining a reliable business register or for compiling national accounts statistics) and policy (e. g. a mixed strategy of continuity or a preference for prudence and stability). Uses of the national accounts National accounts statistics are important for economic policy and analysis. Four different roles are played by national accounts statistics: 1. 	description and object of analysis; 2. 	tool for analysis and forecasting; 3. 	tool for communication and decision-making; 4. 	input for alternative accounts, budgetary rules and estimates. As a description and object of analysis, national accounts statistics are unique. They define and measure the national economy and its major components. They make the sizes and developments in national economies all over the world visible and put them into quantitative terms. As a consequence, the world economy, the national economies and their major components can be monitored and analysed. Not all descriptions are suited as an object of analysis. National accounts statistics are partly built on assumptions. Assumptions are essential in combining and completing the basic set of data. Plausible assumptions are even to be preferred above unreliable data. The more encompassing, up-to-date, detailed and reliable the basic data set, the smaller the role played by assumptions can be. By changing the definitions of the universal model, the role of assumptions can be increased or decreased. This also changes the usefulness of national accounts statistics as an object of analysis. For a proper analysis of national accounts statistics, sufficient information should be available about the operational concepts underlying the national accounts statistics, their reliability and the role of major specific events and institutional circumstances. Furthermore, users should have sufficient knowledge of the logic, merits and limitations of national accounts statistics in general. As a tool for analysis and forecasting, national accounts statistics are built on three very useful stocks of knowledge: the universal model, the operational model and the national compilation skills. Ignoring the national accounts as tool for analysis and forecasting can result in serious conceptual and statistical pitfalls. However, as a tool for analysis and forecasting, the national accounts have also clear limitations. For a proper use, national accounts statistics should often be rearranged or be supplemented with alternative concepts, alternative data and equations describing economic behaviour. As a tool for communication and decision-making, national accounts statistics are unique. They serve as the universal facts and language for thinking and communicating about national economies and their major components. They provide new opportunities for decision-making by providing information about major macro-economic developments, by providing explicit targets for many types of policy and by providing price-indexes for inflating contracts and agreements in real terms. However, for a proper and optimal use, knowledge of the merits and limitations of national accounts statistics is essential. National accounts statistics serve also as an input for alternative estimates, accounts for non-national accounting purposes and policy targets. As an input for alternative estimates, official national accounts statistics serve as a very cheap, well-designed, universal <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>product.</b> These alternative estimates may reflect fundamentally different perspectives on the national economy, e. g. welfare-measures. However, some of the major alternative estimates are best labelled as non-official national accounts statistics, e. g. by providing much longer time series. National accounts can also serve as a benchmark or source of inspiration for accounts for non-national accounting purposes (e. g. for the bookkeeping systems of municipalities) and policy targets (e. g. in defining the budgetary ceilings for state expenditure in the Netherlands). In this way, the national accounts actually extends its scope as a tool for communication and decision-making. The future On the brink of the twenty-first century the world is undergoing dramatic changes. Four trends (globalisation, regionalisation, automation and more-market oriented government) are changing the data needs and possibilities of the national accounts. Globalisation and regionalisation will increase the political use of national accounts figures. This reinforces requirements on international comparability and standardisation as evidenced by the European experience. Globalisation and more-market oriented government will pose serious difficulties for the quality and completeness of the statistics and administrative data sources used for compiling national accounts figures. A pro-active response is essential for statisticians. The possibilities for national accountants may be increased due to automation, putting minimum standards on the inputs for the national accounts statistics to increase their international comparability and advances in national accounts compilation techniques. More-market oriented government can stimulate the development of more efficient, effective and attractive national accounts statistics that appeal to a wide range of data users. However, it can also result in cutting down the resources for national accounts statistics and its major inputs below a minimum-level. National accounts statistics will then be trapped: resources are not enough to meet a minimum standard of reliability, to make national accounts statistics more attractive and to find new users; the potentials of the national accounts statistics are then trapped. In order to meet these challenges and dangers of the future, the efficiency and the national accounts as a product should be improved. This can be done in various ways, e. g. by: -	Developing an international long term strategy for improving national accounts compilation techniques; -	A better balance between the compilation process and the outputs; -	More modules for specific purposes. Some of these could contain internationally standardized supplementary concepts, like entrepreneurial income after tax, government expenditure and revenue or household income in cash. They may also contain modelling results, as modelling is often essential for a balanced view on the national economy. -	An international, EU-like, program for increasing the reliability and comparability of major national accounts variables, e. g. Domestic Product and the volume growth of Domestic Product. -	Investigation of user practice and the lessons that can be learned from that. -	Supplementing national accounts statistics with information about their meaning and reliability, e. g. about the operational concepts, the data sources, compilation methods, the size of the differences between successive estimates and the results of various types of sensitivity analyses. In order to clarify the value-added of national accounting and to fight wide-spread illiteracy in national accounting, marketing and education should be taken up seriously, preferably by an international long term strategy and by making use of all the possibilities of internet. ...|$|E

By the means of an error correction representation it is found that PIMFn and PIMFg, in the long and short-run, are more sensitive to overseas-determined prices (of oil, commodities and <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>products)</b> than domestically determined prices (labour, capital and the trend). It may be argued that to some considerable degree therefore the prices of material and intermediate inputs in UK manufacturing will not be particularly sensitive to policy actions. ...|$|R

The concentrations of PCBs were up to 4614 ng/g in the <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>products,</b> and 1797 ng/g in the product p-DCB. It was also found that high chlorinated PCB congeners increased with the further chlorination. The levels of PCDD/Fs decreased obviously in the purification process, while PCBs could not be removed effectively. Polychlorophenols and other important dioxin precursors (1, 4 -dichloro- 2 -phenoxybenzene and 2 -phenyl- 2 &# 39;, 5, 5 &# 39;-trichlorophenol) were also analyzed. Polychlorophenols which ortho- and para- positions of the hydroxyl were substituted by chlorine were the main congeners. In addition, a possible pathway {{of the formation of}} PCDD/Fs and PCBs in the production of p-DCB was presented. The results of this article suggest that re-estimation on the risk of using p-DCB products, especially the products for daily use such as mothballs, is expected. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|India and China are two rapidly {{emerging}} {{economies in}} the world. With their high growth rates and huge markets, these two Asian giants have {{attracted the attention of}} international business mangers to take a fresh look at the rapidly emerging opportunities in the two countries. Today, India–China relations are conspicuous by the fast rise of their merchandise trade, which has already crossed US $ 42 billion in 2009 – 2010. China has already become India’s second largest trade partner only after UAE. Besides this, China has also {{become one of the most}} favourite destinations for Indian exporters. China’s share in India’s global exports has increased rapidly from just 0. 10 per cent in 1990 – 1991 to 6. 47 per cent in 2009 – 2010. However, this growth of Indian exports to China has not been equally distributed over various commodity groups. In fact, Indian exports to China are mainly dominated by natural resource-based raw materials or <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>products</b> which are not considered to be healthy from the Indian point of view. Hence, there is an urgent need to add some technologically advanced products in the export basket to China. According to the need of the time, the present study examines the various trends that occurred in growth and structure of Indian exports to China during the last two decades...|$|R

40|$|Thanks {{to their}} high wear resistance, ceramic {{materials}} {{are suitable for}} use as metal working tools for rolling processes. The materials that {{have been widely used}} for rolling tools are steel or tungsten carbide. In order to get higher wear resistances and therefore longer lifetimes of the rolling tools, ceramic materials may be used. Silicon nitride is a highly wear resistant ceramic material. Further advantages of this silicon nitride are its high temperature stability, its low adhesion to the metallic materials and its low specific weight. Silicon nitride is therefore ideally suited for rolling tools. The higher costs of the rolls have to be compensated by the longer lifetime at more stable production conditions. In addition, the consumption cooling lubricants can be reduced by using ceramic tools. The scope of the project is therefore the development and fabrication of ceramic rolls for different <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>products.</b> It is found that the use of ceramic tools is possible and even has advantages regarding service lifetime and product quality. The present paper presents some case studies of ceramic rolling tools that were developed and tested in different manufacturing processes. The work conducted includes tool design, materials development, fabrication of the rolls, mechanical and tribological testing, and the testing of the rolls in several production processes. The focus of the presentation is put on the evaluation of ceramic tools and other components in rolling applications...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} wood {{as a very}} useful and {{important}} material for manipulation and construction {{which can be used}} in preschool as well as in everyday life. We can manipulate wood using different technologies, such as buffing, painting, filing, and joining, even in early childhood when we are developing different skills and competence. We used a survey questionnaire to find out how often wood is used as a didactic material in preschool. We believe that activities with which children could comprehensively get to know and develop manual skills, including fine and gross motor development, are not yet advanced enough in children aged 2 – 3. In this thesis, we present the forest as a living space, its meaning for people and the wood processing techniques to create <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>products</b> and products for everyday use. We helped children aged 2 – 3 years to familiarise themselves with forests and wood through experiential game-based learning and the construction of products from rod profiles that can be found in everyday life. Children used all their senses while learning. We evaluated the process of experiential learning and noted positive remarks about children's progress, for example fast learning, showing interest for the activity, and independent curiosity. To increase the possibility of improving and changing the way preschool children learn about technical education in the future, we included suggestions for different experiences in all areas of activity (nature and social studies, language, art, mathematics, and exercise). These activities complement each other and ensure an integrated development of children, not just with regard to construction using rod profiles, but in all technical fields. ...|$|R
30|$|Besides {{boosting}} {{the volume of}} trade among signatories and the concentration of Mexican exports-imports, the NAFTA functioned as a detonator of inward foreign investment owing mainly to the privileged access to the large US market and cheaper labor costs provided by Mexico. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flowed {{not only from the}} US but also from Asia and Europe. Even before the NAFTA came into effect, large TNCs and their respective clusters of suppliers had already established operations on Mexican soil, especially in regions enjoying competitive advantages such as border states and cities (e.g., Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua, Tijuana and Mexicali) as well as more industrialized central states (e.g., Aguascalientes, Puebla, Mexico City, Queretaro, and the State of Mexico). However, increased foreign investment led to intra-industry and intra-firm trade among TNCs and their traditional contractors, which did not always prove beneficial for established Mexican suppliers; in the case of Japan and Korean FDI in Mexico, the NAFTA consolidated these trade dynamics. According to Comtrade data ([URL] in 2015, Mexico imported US$ 17, 368 billion from Japan and US$ 14, 619 billion from Korea, while exporting only US$ 3017 billion and US$ 2770 billion to these countries, respectively. In both cases, 70 to 80 % of total imports from these Asian countries were comprised of parts and components assembled by Japanese and Korean companies located in industrial parks in Mexico and re-exported as final goods, mostly to the US, whereas nearly 80 % of Mexican exports to those countries consisted only of primary and <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>products.</b> Trade volume and composition have painted an unfavorable picture of Mexican industrial producers, who represent less than a 5 % share of global production networks. Contrary to expectations, Mexico did not attract Japanese FDI to any significant extent in the five years following the adoption of the Japan-Mexico FTA in 2005. That is, no significant positive correlation has been demonstrated between FTAs and increased investment (López Aymes and Salas-Porras 2012; Bancomext 2015).|$|R
40|$|In de Talamanca {{region in}} Costa Rica cocoa {{production}} was {{abandoned in the}} late 1970 s when yields dropped to zero due to Monilia. In the early 1990 s, the Talamanca Small-Farmers association (APPTA) gained success in promoting its revival. By creating contacts with buyers of organic cacao in the United States, APPTA was able to certify a significant area of cacao and to start exporting to the USA. Organic cacao had positive effects on farmers¿ income and on the environment. Recently {{a number of problems}} occurred: the USA buyer has withdrawn, the price of conventional cacao increased and the amount of organic cacao has increased as well, making it very costly to pay a premium for organic cacao. Costa Rica and Panama both produce only small volumes of organic cacao. Some cocoa producers started production of organic banana. APPTA has to cope with market instability due to excess supply and with low local production due to biological threats. APPTA has to find a reliable buyer and either to increase the volume of cacao or to pool its production with the production realized by COCABO in Panama. This latter option will lead to a number of associated challenges such as harmonization of quality, organizing logistics, tracking and tracing, elaborating contracts between cooperatives etc. Developing new commercialization channels towards Europe reveals three options: APPTA sells beans directly to a Dutch buyer; APPTA sells beans to a Costa Rican processor who in turn exports <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>products</b> to Dutch producers; or beans are processed by Costa Rican industry and APPTA commits to selling semimanufactured products to Dutch producers. Each of these three options has different repercussions on labelling, quality, environmental impact and profits. Additional options to improve livelihood of cacao farmers consist of diversification of the production at farm level and developing alternative sources of income, such as eco-tourism. The real challenge facing APPTA is to determine how to bring stakeholders with different interests and competencies together in an effective way to improve chain performance and to enhance farmers¿ livelihoods...|$|R
40|$|EXTENDED ABSTRACT: The {{paper has}} always been and {{it remains to be}} the primary {{information}} carrier though only 0. 1 % of the total information is recorded on this media. The paper production industry has a great impact on the environment which is mostly due to the use of raw materials (wood of conifers and deciduous trees), fillers (CaCO  3), additional materials (dyes, glue, binders, retentionaids), and chemicals (acids and bases). However, the greatest impact on the environmentis caused by the extensive water consumption. To produce 1 ton of paper up to 60 m 3 of freshwater are necessary. The water is not the only resource needed in the production cycle. Besides, the consumption of electrical energy (approximately 10, 000 MJ/t pap), waste paper (paper represents 35 % of waste), and air pollution (paper production and transport) should be taken into consideration. In spite of the above mentioned environmental threats the paper still remains an important element of the everyday life and the use of modern information technology (personal computers, telefax, Internet) has increased its demand and consumption. It is important that the paper is produced from natural materials which are later released into environment without significant environmental consequences. The technology of paper recycling and re-use is widely known and a must of any responsible and professional social environment. Digitisation has increased the consumption of electrical energy as a consequence of production, use and reprocessing of different devices. Unlike a written record, a digital record has no permanent value and the electromagnetic field has a negative effect on the digital records. Digital records have to be constantly updated and adjusted to the computer software and hardware. A book and its content represent a treasure and an invaluable part of the cultural heritage. To use a book it is necessary to learn the alphabet whereas to read digital records we need to be computer and information literate. Negative effects of digitisation have affected the production of paper as the demand for graphic paper (newsprint, writing, printing paper) has decreased. The demand for raw materials, <b>products</b> and <b>semi-manufactured</b> <b>products</b> has decreased, too. Consequently, the level of investments in modernisation of equipment and in new production lines has been equally reduced. The proportion of employees directly or indirectly involved in the paper making and paper processing industry has been diminished. In the European Union paper and paper processing industry employ 1. 9 million people in 200, 000 enterprises representing 6. 5 % of turnover in the production sector or 80 billion EUR or 16 billion EUR of the value added per year. The EU is expected to prevent the decline of paper and paper related industry (graphic, construction, logistic) which would endanger the production – consumption cycle. After all, dismissals can ruin the social equilibrium. However, the paper production is faced with a difficult situation caused by digitisation. The competitiveness of the global market has an impact on the labour force costs, raw materials and energy products. Besides, production costs within the European Union are not competitive because of the EU Regulations and Directives which affect the price of raw materials, semi products and energy products. All these facts led to the decrease of workforce and the loss of market leading position and competitiveness. </p...|$|R
