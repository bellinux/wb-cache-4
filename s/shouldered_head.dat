60|$|He was an inch, perhaps two, {{under six}} feet, powerfully built, and he {{advanced}} straight {{at you with}} a slight stoop of the <b>shoulders,</b> <b>head</b> forward, and a fixed from-under stare which made {{you think of a}} charging bull. His voice was deep, loud, and his manner displayed a kind of dogged self-assertion which had nothing aggressive in it. It seemed a necessity, and it was directed apparently as much at himself as at anybody else. He was spotlessly neat, apparelled in immaculate white from shoes to hat, and in the various Eastern ports where he got his living as ship-chandler's water-clerk he was very popular.|$|R

50|$|<b>Head</b> and <b>Shoulders</b> {{formation}} {{consists of}} a left <b>shoulder,</b> a <b>head,</b> and a right shoulder and a line drawn as the neckline. The left shoulder is formed {{at the end of}} an extensive move during which volume is noticeably high. After the peak of the left shoulder is formed, there is a subsequent reaction and prices slide down to a certain extent which generally occurs on low volume. The prices rally up to form the head with normal or heavy volume and subsequent reaction downward is accompanied with lesser volume. The right shoulder is formed when prices move up again but remain below the central peak called the Head and fall down nearly equal to the first valley between the left <b>shoulder</b> and the <b>head</b> or at least below the peak of the left shoulder. Volume is lesser in the right shoulder formation compared to the left <b>shoulder</b> and the <b>head</b> formation. A neckline is drawn across the bottoms of the left <b>shoulder,</b> the <b>head</b> and the right shoulder. When prices break through this neckline and keep on falling after forming the right shoulder, it is the ultimate confirmation of the completion of the <b>Head</b> and <b>Shoulders</b> Top formation. It is quite possible that prices pull back to touch the neckline before continuing their declining trend.|$|R

When they saw the horrendous injuries inflicted with the Spanish sword - arms hacked off at the <b>shoulder,</b> <b>heads</b> entirely severed, bellies ripped open and guts hanging out - they realised the kind of weapons and the sort of enemy that they were up against, and a wave of fear spread through their ranks." ...|$|R
5000|$|While the {{relationship}} between human perception of sound and various attributes of the sound field is not yet well understood, DSP algorithms for sound localization are able to employ several mechanisms found in neural systems, including the interaural time difference (ITD, the difference in arrival time of a sound between two locations), the interaural intensity difference (IID, the difference in intensity of a sound between two locations), artificial pinnae, the precedence effect, and head-related transfer functions (HRTF) [...]When localizing 3D sound in spatial domain, one could {{take into account that}} the incoming sound signal could be reflected, defracted and scattered by the upper torso of the human which consists of <b>shoulders,</b> <b>head</b> and pinnae.Localization also depends on the direction of the sound source.|$|R
