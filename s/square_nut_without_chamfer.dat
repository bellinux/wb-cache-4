50|$|A <b>square</b> <b>nut</b> is a four-sided nut. Compared to {{standard}} hex <b>nuts,</b> <b>square</b> <b>nuts</b> {{have a greater}} surface {{in contact with the}} part being fastened, and therefore provide greater resistance to loosening (though also greater resistance to tightening). They are also much less likely to become rounded-off after repeated loosening/tightening cycles. <b>Square</b> <b>nuts</b> are typically mated with square-headed bolts. <b>Square</b> <b>nuts</b> are used along with flat washers in order to avoid damage from its sharp edges and helps to increase the strength of the fastener. <b>Square</b> <b>nuts</b> can have standard, fine or coarse threading with platings of zinc yellow, plain, zinc clear, tin and cadmium, among others. Most can meet either the ASTM A194, ASTM A563, or ASTM F594 standard.|$|R
50|$|<b>Square</b> steel <b>nuts</b> {{were common}} on {{machinery}} {{of the late}} 19th through mid 20th century. Today hex nuts have displaced them. One reason is that a hex nut offers a new wrenching access at every 60°, whereas a <b>square</b> <b>nut</b> offers one only at every 90°.|$|R

50|$|A <b>square</b> style clip-on <b>nut</b> {{does not}} clip onto {{the edge of}} the sheet metal, but rather the edges of a square hole or slot. It is a <b>square</b> <b>nut</b> that has a sheet metal {{retainer}} that protrudes down two sides of the nut. These legs are formed to have lips that grab onto the sheet metal object. Prior to tightening the nut, it can float in the hole or slot, but when the nut is tightened it presses the lips of the retainer out and anchors itself in place.|$|R

50|$|A {{cage nut}} or caged nut (also called a captive or clip nut) {{consists}} of a (usually <b>square)</b> <b>nut</b> in a spring steel cage which wraps around the nut. The cage has two wings that when compressed allow the cage to be inserted into the square holes, for example, in the mounting rails of equipment racks. When the wings are released, they hold the nut in position behind the hole. Cage nuts conforming to this description were patented in 1952 and 1953.|$|R
5000|$|A J-nut is a nut that clips to {{the edge}} of the sheet metal. It is named after the way it is shaped; the thread is on the long side of the [...] "J". The thread may either be of a speed nut form or have an {{integrated}} hex or <b>square</b> <b>nut.</b> Due to the short retaining leg the nut is allowed to float more, which can help with misalignment, but the nut is free to un-clip from the sheet metal as well.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an Ultra Wideband (UWB) antenna is presented. The antenna {{radiating}} patch is circular {{in shape}} with coplanar waveguide (CPW) feeding technique. The proposed chamfering {{to the outer}} edges of the ground plane successfully widens the - 10 dB impedance bandwidth of the antenna to cover from 1. 92 GHz up to 15. 16 GHz (correspond to 155 % fractional bandwidth). The antenna gain varies from 2 to 5 dB over the operating band. Parametrical {{studies have been conducted}} for four different conditions of the ground plane; <b>without</b> <b>chamfering,</b> chamfering on the inner edges, chamfering on the outer edges and both chamfering of inner and outer edges. The effects of distinguished chamfering conditions to antenna performance are analyzed. The measured and simulated results for reflection coefficients and radiation patterns (2. 45 GHz, 3. 5 GHz and 5. 8 GHz) are presented. The corresponding realized gains are 2. 14 dB, 2. 85 dB and 3. 4 dB respectively. The measured results satisfactorily agreed with the simulated ones.

50|$|<b>Square</b> <b>nuts,</b> {{as well as}} bolt heads, {{were the}} first shape made and {{used to be the}} most common largely because they were much easier to manufacture, {{especially}} by hand. While rare today due to the reasons stated below for the preference of hexagonal nuts, they are occasionally used in some situations when a maximum amount of torque and grip is needed for a given size: the greater length of each side allows a spanner to be applied with a larger surface area and more leverage at the nut.|$|R
40|$|AbstractProjection welding of nuts to sheets is {{a widely}} {{utilized}} manufacturing process in the automotive industry. The process entails challenges due the necessity of joining different sheet thicknesses and nut sizes made from dissimilar materials, and {{due to the fact}} of experiencing large local deformations ranging from room temperature to above the melting point. Heating is facilitated by resistance heating and is highly influenced by the contact area resulting from the amount of deformation, which is also temperature dependent due to material softening and frictional conditions. Resort to new materials and applications require a new level of understanding of the process by combining finite element modelling and experimentation. This paper draws from the challenge of developing a three-dimensional computer program for electro-thermo-mechanical modeling of resistance welding and presents, as far as the authors are aware, the first ever three-dimensional simulation of the projection welding of <b>square</b> <b>nuts</b> to sheets by means of finite element analysis. Results are compared with experimental observations and measurements produced by the authors with the aim and objective of assessing the accuracy, reliability and validity of the theoretical and numerical developments. Numerical simulations support the evaluation of the experiments by providing detailed information on the process like the initial heating location and the following temperature development, and allowing to analyze the weldability of the <b>square</b> <b>nut</b> to the sheet under different operating conditions...|$|R

In mid-2007, Cadbury announced that it would be cutting around 7,500jobs. An internal memo which later leaked revealed that many of the jobs would be moved to Poland, causing an outcry from the manufacturers' trade unions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nearly 90 % of {{failures}} of machines and mechanical parts are caused at {{the area of}} stress concentrated in the structural components. Hence, {{it is important to}} investigate the method of improving fatigue strength for notched parts. In this paper, the fatigue tests have been performed to investigate the effect of the plastic-working on fatigue strength of specimens with notch. The main results obtained in this study are as follows: (1) The fatigue limit of notched specimen chamfered by the plastic-working increases by 45 % than that of specimen <b>without</b> <b>chamfer.</b> (2) The reason of enhancing the fatigue strength may be to attributed to the work-hardening and compressive residual stress which suppress the fatigue crack initiation and propagation in early stage...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} {{structures}} is often optimized by gradually decreasing the thickness as the load carrying requirement on the components decreases. Such structures in composites {{are made of}} tapered laminates involving dropping of plies. However, these structures are often prone to early delamination initiation, which leads to premature failure of the component and therefore limits its useful life. In the past, many routes to circumvent this problem have been evolved, {{such as the use}} of adhesive film layers or interleaving the dropped plies between continuous ones. In this work, a novel technique of ply edge chamfering has been developed and employed in the specimen fabrication. Comparisons have been drawn between similarly configured specimens, with and <b>without</b> <b>chamfered</b> ply drops. Static and fatigue test results have shown remarkable improvements, both in terms of complete suppression of delamination around ply drops and in realizing 14. 5 – 77. 6 % higher strength levels in tapered composite test coupons. The experimental data along with their comparative cases are presented.

40|$|A triple-mode {{silver-plated}} ceramic {{cavity filter}} with wide spurious-free response is presented. It uses single mode ceramic slabs as interfacing resonators with the cube to give wide spurious-free performance up to 4 GHz for an 1800 -MHz base station filter. Three square apertures at the slab-cube interface give simple and flexible control of transmission zero placement while maintaining low insertion loss. The parallel {{nature of the}} slab-to-cube coupling allows a simple cuboid structure <b>without</b> <b>chamfers</b> or intermode coupling elements. A seven-pole filter in the DCS- 1800 transmit band is built using a slab-slab-cubeslab-slab structure and measured. Along with wide spuriousfree performance, the filter achieves around 1 dB of band edge insertion loss with more than 50 dB of attenuation, 20 MHz from the band edges, and from an 11 -cm(3) package. The near band performance shows all of the seven poles in the return loss. The insertion loss is 1. 1 dB on the low side (1805 MHz), 1. 0 dB on the high side (1880 MHz), and 0. 6 dB at the band center.

The husk, or involucre, differs greatly, being extremely short in Barr's Spanish, and extremely long in filberts, {{in which it is}} contracted so as to prevent the nut falling out. This kind of husk also protects the nut from birds, for titmice (Parus) have been observed (10/135.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Oral sub mucous {{fibrosis}} (OSF) is a {{high risk}} precancerous condition, predominantly affecting Indian. Data from recent epidemiological studies provide overwhelming evidence that areca nut is the main etiological factor for OSF. A clear dosedependent relationship was observed for both frequency and duration of chewing areca <b>nut</b> (<b>without</b> tobacco) {{in the development of}} OSF. Limitation of mouth opening result in difficulty in mastication is the main presenting feature. Although nutritional deficiencies and immunological processes may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis. The available epidemiological evidence indicates that chewing betel quid (containing areca nut, tobacco, slaked lime or other species) is an important risk factor for OSF. It has been postulated that areca nut may also induce the development of the disease by increased levels of cytokines in the lamina propria. Hence the present article OSF reviewed the etiology, pathophysiology, clinical features & management. Key words:- OSF, Juxtra epithelial, Areca nut...|$|R
