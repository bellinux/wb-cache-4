40|$|Environmental hazards can {{be caused}} by radio-active waste after disposal. It is, therefore, {{important}} that safety assessment methodologies be developed and established to study and estimate the possible hazards, and institute safety methodologies that will prevent the evolution of these hazards. <b>Spent</b> sealed <b>sources</b> are a specific type of radioactive waste. According to the IAEA definition,[1] <b>spent</b> sealed <b>sources</b> are unused sources because of activity decay, damage, misuse, loss, or theft. Accidental exposure to humans from <b>spent</b> sealed <b>sources</b> can occur at the moment they become spent and before their disposal. Because of this reason, safety assessment methodologies have been tailored to suit the management of <b>spent</b> sealed <b>sources.</b> To provide an understanding of and confidence in this study, validation analysis was undertaken by considering the scenario of an accident that occurred in Egypt, June 2000 (the Meet-Halfa accident from an iridium- 192 source). The study includes consideration related to safety assessments for <b>spent</b> sealed <b>sources,</b> the processes which caused an active <b>source</b> to be <b>spent,</b> accident scenarios, mathematical models for dose calcula-tions, radiological consequences and regulatory criteria.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the {{utilization}} of sealed source for medical, industrial and research purposes has shown an accelerating increase. This situation will lead to increases {{in the amount of}} sealed radioactive. During its use, a sealed radioactive waste will eventually become either a <b>spent</b> sealed <b>source</b> or disused sealed radioactive source (DSRS), due to certain factors. The reduction of the amount of radioactive waste can be executed through the application of reuse and recycle of sealed source. The reuse and recycle policy for spent and disused sealed sources are not already specified yet. The reuse of <b>spent</b> sealed <b>sources</b> can be applied only for the sources which had been used in the medical field for radiotherapy, namely the reuse of a teletherapy Co- 60 source in a calibration facility. The recycle of a <b>spent</b> sealed <b>source</b> can be performed for radioactive sources with relatively high activities and long half-lives; however, the recycling activity may only be performed by the manufacturer.

40|$|Most African {{countries}} have been using radiation emitting devices and radioactive sources {{for the past three}} decades or more for the promotion, development, and utilization of the peaceful application of nuclear techniques fo r the benefit of their countries. Most of these sealed radiation sources have deteriorated to such a state that they are leaking and their current storage situation does not meet the necessary norms for safety. This {{is due to the fact}} that most of the countries don't have radiation protection and waste management infrastructures. To this effect the Organization of African Unit (OAU) through the African Regional Co-operative Agreement (AFRA) have strongly endorsed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) awareness of the need to promote well defined levels of radiation protection and waste management especially in the handling and storage of <b>spent</b> radioactive <b>sources.</b> Since most countries lack facilities and trained personnel, a specialised team from South Africa has been established to encapsulate, condition and store all sources on the continent, thus clearing the continent of all dangerously neglected sources.

40|$|We {{consider}} a central place forager with two qualitatively {{different types of}} food sources; type 1 sources are always available whereas type 2 sources become available intermittently and this availability is signalled by information present at the central place. Source 1 is modelled using a standard patch foraging model whereas source 2 is modelled somewhat schematically {{in terms of the}} presence of information, the time <b>spent</b> at the <b>source</b> and the average reward received. The only decision in the model is the time spent by the forager at source 1 on each trip. We characterise the optimal foraging time and the optimal overall reward rate under the two source model and compare it with the corresponding quantities for a single source model. We show that, in general, the potential for information transfer has a marked effect on the forager’s behaviour, and that a forager behaving optimally should return to check for new information with what might, under a single source model, seem to be a strictly submaximal load. We consider the dependence of the optimal foraging time and the optimal overall reward rate on the source 2 model parameters, and also show that our qualitative results hold for a variety of models for the time <b>spent</b> on <b>source</b> 2...|$|R

Reading in clinical practice is important {{as it relates to}} clinical competencies. This study was carried out to assess knowledge, attitude and practice of reading habit among female medical students at Taibah University. MethodsA descriptive cross sectional approach was adopted. It involved 105 (out of 130) female medical students from 4 th and 5 th years in their clinical rounds. A structured questionnaire for measuring knowledge, attitude and practice of reading habit was used. Statistical analysis was done using percent, mean, standard deviation, chi-square, Student’s t-tests, and Pearson’s correlation. ResultsThe mean age of the studied students was 22. 9 ± 0. 9 years. The mean percent score for knowledge was 87. 5 ± 14. 4, for attitude was 70. 2 ± 19. 9, and for practice 60. 0 ± 17. 8. The total reading habit score was 72. 6 ± 11. 1, with a significant positive correlation between knowledge and practice (r= 0. 251, p= 0. 010). College related barriers and overcrowded students’ timetable were the main perceived barriers for reading (84. 8 % and 79. 0 % respectively).

Since the 1980 s {{it has been}} clear there were links between higher blood lead levels and alcohol {{consumption}} (Shaper et al 1982, Hense et al 1992, Pizent et al 2001). In the USA women who were heavy alcohol consumers were 5. 6 {{times more likely to}} be in the highest 10 % of the population for blood lead than teetotallers [consumers of no alchohol] (Lee et al 2005). Much effort was expended in the 1990 ’s, tracking possible sources of lead contamination in alcohol, notably lead seals on wine bottles and illicit liquor. But the overall correlations were not explainable by the degree of lead contamination (Shaper et al 1982 p 301). A clue, however, appeared in an apparent contradiction – individuals who consumed significant alcohol were likely to have higher iron levels (Whitfield 2001). Two glasses of alcohol a day reduces the risk of being iron deficient (Whitfield et al 2001 p 1041) and any alcohol consumption reduced the risk of iron deficiency anaemia by up to 40 % (Ioannou et al 2004).
