Partly due to technical challenges with investigating <b>subcortical</b> <b>sensory</b> structures, current research on dyslexia in humans by-and-large focuses on the cerebral cortex. These studies found that dyslexia is typically associated with functional and structural alterations of a distributed left-hemispheric cerebral cortex network. However, findings from animal models and post-mortem studies in humans suggest that developmental dyslexia might also be associated with structural alterations in <b>subcortical</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways.</b> Whether these alterations also exist in developmental dyslexia in-vivo and how they relate to dyslexia symptoms is currently unknown. Here we used ultra-high resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography to investigate the structural connections of the visual <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway</b> in dyslexia in-vivo. We discovered that individuals with developmental dyslexia have reduced structural connections in the direct pathway between the left visual thalamus (LGN) and left middle temporal area V 5 /MT, but not between the left LGN and left primary visual cortex (V 1). In addition, left V 5 /MT-LGN connectivity strength correlated with rapid naming abilities - a key deficit in dyslexia [14]. These findings provide the first evidence of specific structural alterations in the connections between the sensory thalamus and cortex in developmental dyslexia.

We present a {{detailed}} computational model of interacting neuronal populations that mimic the hatchling Xenopus tadpole nervous system. The model includes four <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways,</b> integrators of <b>sensory</b> information, and a {{central pattern generator}} (CPG) network. <b>Sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> of different modalities receive inputs from an “environment”; these inputs are then processed and integrated to select the most appropriate locomotor action. The CPG populations execute the selected action, generating output in motor neuron populations. Thus, the model describes a detailed and biologically plausible chain of information processing from external signals to sensors, <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways,</b> integration and decision-making, action selection and execution and finally, generation of appropriate motor activity and behaviour. We show how the model produces appropriate behaviours {{in response to a}} selected scenario, which consists of a sequence of “environmental” signals. These behaviours might be relatively complex due to noisy <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> and the possibility of spontaneous actions. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Considering {{that many}} natural stimuli are sparse, can a sensory system evolve to take {{advantage}} of this sparsity? We explore this question and show that significant downstream reductions in the numbers of neurons transmitting stimuli observed in early <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> might be a consequence of this sparsity. First, we model an early <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway</b> using an idealized neuronal network comprised of receptors and downstream sensory neurons. Then, by revealing a linear structure intrinsic to neuronal network dynamics, our work points to a potential mechanism for transmitting sparse stimuli, related to compressed-sensing (CS) type data acquisition. Through simulation, we examine the characteristics of networks that are optimal in sparsity encoding, and the impact of localized receptive fields beyond conventional CS theory. The results of this work suggest a new network framework of signal sparsity, freeing the notion from any dependence on specific component-space representations. We expect our CS network mechanism to provide guidance for studying sparse stimulus transmission along realistic <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> as well as engineering network designs that utilize sparsity encoding...|$|R
50|$|Corollary {{discharge}} {{is characterized}} as an efference copy {{of an action}} command used to inhibit any response to the self generated sensory signal which would interfere with {{the execution of the}} motor task. The inhibitory commands originate {{at the same time as}} the motor command and target the <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway</b> that would report any reafference to higher levels of the CNS. This is unique from the efference copy, since the corollary discharge is actually fed into the <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway</b> to cancel out the reafferent signals generated by the movement. Alternatively, corollary discharges briefly alters self-generated sensory responses to reduce self-induced desensitization or help distinguish between self-generated and externally generated sensory information.|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem of sensory processing is the discrimination between self-generated, or reafferent, sensory information and externally evoked sensory information {{of the same}} modality.

A solution common to many sensory systems {{is to reduce the}} responsiveness of the <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway</b> during the generation of reafferent information. Modulation of the responses to reafferent sensory information can occur at two stages of the sensory pathway: peripherally, as a result of mechanical changes at the sense organ, or centrally within the nervous system.

Eleven subacute stroke survivors participated in this study. Subjects performed a motor task with the affected and non-affected arm while continuous wrist position perturbations were applied.

40|$|Electrophysiological and {{histological}} {{techniques were}} used to trace <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> for stretch mechanoreceptor fibres from the distal colon to dorsal root ganglia. Extracellular and intracellular recording techniques revealed <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> for mechanoreceptors to the prevertebral sympathetic ganglia but no further centrally. Histological studies involving the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase revealed <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> from the distal colon to the spinal cord, mainly {{to the level of}} the second lumbar vertebra. Few (less than 2000) fibres were involved; their perikarya were small (ca. 25 micron). Sensory perikarya in spinal ganglia in the guinea-pig could be categorized into two populations, F and H cells, after a previously defined nomenclature for murine spinal ganglion cells. F and H cells were distinguished initially by their times to decay by 50 % of the action potential. H cells took three times as long to repolarize. F and H cells were distinguished further by their electrical properties including membrane potential, input resistance and amplitude and duration of the after-potential following the action potential. Both F and H cells showed unusual time-dependent rectification following either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current pulses. Threshold currents to show rectification were different for F and H cells. When taken in conjunction with conduction velocities, the electrophysiological evidence may assist in identifying sensory neurones. For example, H cells appeared to have slow conducting (C fibre) axons. From the lack of electrophysiological evidence and limited histological support for major central <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways,</b> it is concluded that stretch mechanoreceptor information from the colon of the guinea-pig is referred mainly to the prevertebral ganglia with minimal involvement of the spinal cord...|$|R
40|$|Oftentimes, we {{perceive}} our environment by integrating information across multiple senses. Recent {{studies suggest that}} such integration occurs at much earlier processing stages than once thought possible, including in thalamic nuclei and putatively unisensory cortical brain regions. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and an audiovi-sual integration task {{to test the hypothesis}} that anatomical connec-tions between sensory-related <b>subcortical</b> structures and <b>sensory</b> cortical areas govern multisensory processing in humans. Twenty-five subjects (mean age 22 years, 22 females) participated in the study. In line with our hypothesis, we show that estimated strength of white-matter connections between the first relay station in the auditory pro-cessing stream (the cochlear nucleus), the auditory thalamus, and primary auditory cortex predicted one’s ability to combine auditory and visual information in a visual search task.

We conclude that experience-dependent plasticity can occur in the periphery of adult mouse olfactory system, which should improve odor detection and contribute towards accurate and fast odor discriminations...|$|R

In addition, viewing videos of speech (lip-reading) and music (instrument being played) enhanced temporal and frequency encoding in the auditory brainstem, particularly in musicians.
