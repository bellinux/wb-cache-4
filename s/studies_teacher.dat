40|$|The {{acquisition}} {{of knowledge and}} Jawi pedagogical skills does not only become the standard of the competency level among Islamic <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers.</b> It is also indirectly serves as a catalyst and a two-pronged strategy {{in an effort to}} restore and retain the Jawi script. Jawi has been in use over 1000 years ago, since 10 th century AD in the Malay Archipelago. It is the nation's heritage that should be protected rather than Rumi script that has been used for only 50 years. Jawi competency reflects the efficiency of Islamic <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers</b> which covers content knowledge, skills to deliver the lessons effectively and personality traits that motivate themselves to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively. However, the study found that the Jawi competency level among Islamic <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers</b> has yet to fully achieve specific quality standards. Therefore, this study aims to identify the Jawi competency level among Islamic <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers</b> in terms of their content knowledge, teaching skills and personality traits that {{play an important role in}} promoting the Jawi script. The methods used in this study are literature review and document analysis. References from scientific journals, research reports and related theses were used to collect information and data about Jawi competency among Islamic <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers.</b> According to the study, the findings indicate that the competency level among Islamic <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers</b> in terms of Jawi spelling proficiency is still weak, the Islamic <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers</b> were lack of student-centered teaching practice, and their personality as well as interpersonal attitude is at medium level. In summary, it can be concluded that the Islamic <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers?</b> competency is still at a moderate level and has not reached the quality standards outlined in the Malaysian Teacher Standards and has not been able to restore and retain Jawi which is the nation's heritage...|$|R

The total population comprised forty-one respondents purposively sampled from nine junior and senior secondary schools in rural and urban locations. These included thirty four social <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> and seven head of departments. Data were analyzed quantitatively using descriptive statistics. The findings revealed that, contrary to expectations the Botswana’s social studies curriculum does not promote the acquisition of citizenship skills. There is a disconnection between what social <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> think they do and what actually happens on the ground. In fact, the mere teaching of citizenship skills does not automatically translate into equipping learners with the relevant and appropriate competencies.

The next year, more than 30 graduating Seniors in the school (including many student leaders) complained that Tech's curriculum was old and outdated. Their primary complaint was that the curriculum was geared toward the small minority of students who were not planning on attending college.

The instrument used for the study was the questionnaire. The data collected were analyzed using the z-test of significance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} issue of teacher retention in urban science classrooms, in which a revolving door of new teachers leads to an inexperienced teaching force and reduced academic attainment for students. Urban science teachers are particularly susceptible to attrition due to extensive professional opportunities outside the classroom. This study follows eight case <b>study</b> <b>teachers</b> in an urban school district {{in order to better}} understand how today's urban science teachers think about their careers and career moves. Based on traditional research on teacher retention and existing literature on teachers' professional lives, this study focuses in particular on urban science teachers' professional priorities, community participation, and process of career decision making {{in order to determine the}} ways in which these factors may be consequential for their career paths. The study uses a qualitative case study methodology. Data collection methods include a survey of all first, second, and third year science teachers in one urban district followed by the selection of eight case <b>study</b> <b>teachers</b> using a variety of demographic, certification, and workplace characteristics. In-depth case studies included monthly interviews and professional observations over parts of two school years. The experiences and perspectives of the eight case <b>study</b> <b>teachers</b> revealed three patterns. First, the eight case <b>study</b> <b>teachers</b> followed two distinct paths through the profession, those who aimed to integrate and were oriented toward the educational system and those who wanted to participate and oriented themselves away from the educational system. These professional trajectories were influential in shaping case study teachers' experiences in schools as well as their career directions. Second, the eight case <b>study</b> <b>teachers</b> continually considered their professional alternatives, either within or outside of the educational system. Finally, the case <b>study</b> <b>teachers</b> aimed to get past the challenges inherent in urban teaching and reach professional confirmation before moving on to new roles and responsibilities. These themes indicate the centrality of urban science teachers' professional orientations for recruitment, preparation, and retention, demonstrate the need for in-depth and longitudinal research on teacher retention, and suggest the pivotal nature of professional growth in career mobility...|$|R
