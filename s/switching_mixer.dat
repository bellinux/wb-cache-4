50|$|The aim of a <b>switching</b> <b>mixer</b> is {{to achieve}} linear {{operation}} over the signal level by means of hard switching driven by the local oscillator. Mathematically the <b>switching</b> <b>mixer</b> is {{not much different from}} a multiplying mixer, just because instead of the LO sine wave term we would use the signum function. In the frequency domain the <b>switching</b> <b>mixer</b> operation leads to the usual sum and difference frequencies, but also to further terms e.g. ±3fLO, ±5fLO, etc.The advantage of a <b>switching</b> <b>mixer</b> is that it can achieve (with the same effort) a lower noise figure (NF) and larger conversion gain. This is because the switching diodes or transistors act either like a small resistor (switch closed) or large resistor (switch open), and in both cases only a minimal noise is added. From the circuit perspective, many multiplying mixers can be used as switching mixers, just by increasing the LO amplitude. So RF engineers simply talk about mixers and mean switching mixers.|$|E

40|$|Because of advancements in RF CMOS circuits, devices, {{and passive}} {{elements}} in the last decade, it has become possible to develop a RF system-on-chip (SoC) that integrates RF, analog and digital circuits completely. Direct downconversion, or zero-IF downconversion architecture, shows an advantage over traditional superheterodyne architectures, because it eliminates the image rejection filter and IF filter, and employs only one local oscillator (LO), which reduces the receiver size and power dissipation significantly. For this reason, direct downconversion has drawn more and more attention recently in various wireless applications. However, it also presents some design challenges like flicker noise, DC offsets, even-order distortion, and I/Q mismatches. In this work, a thorough noise analysis and a comprehensive study of the noise mechanism of the low noise amplifier of CMOS direct downconversion receivers (DCR) is given. Also addressed is {{the design of a}} cross-coupled LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). For the low noise amplifier, which presents major noise contribution to the DCR front-end, an optimization technique which employs both a parallel capacitance and an inter-stage inductor is proposed. The addition of this capacitance helps keep the active device relatively small, and the analysis on the effects of the inter-stage inductor shows that it helps boost gain of the LNA at the desired operation frequency of 2. 4 GHz, and offers a lower noise figure. In order to achieve direct downconversion, both a passive <b>switching</b> <b>mixer</b> and an active double-balanced mixer are presented. The passive <b>switching</b> <b>mixer</b> helps solve the problem of flicker noise, but suffers power loss, while the double-balanced architecture helps relieve the problems of DC offset and second-order distortion.

It uses on-chip spiral inductors and junction varactors in the resonant LC-tank. The presented building blocks can be used for a low-power, low-voltage DCR front-end for 802. 11 b/g applications.

This study of "statistical electronics" spans two disciplines, statistical thermodynamics and electronic circuit engineering, {{and leads to}} a general picture that bridges electronics and statistical thermodynamics. Our work on statistical electronics has both scientific and engineering implications. Scientifically, this work is an extensive study of statistical thermodynamics {{in the context of}} electrical circuits, which has made several significant contributions to the understanding of noise processes in electrical circuits. The technological importance is a demonstration of how the fundamental physical considerations evolve to practical high-performance novel circuit design. The power of our fundamental approach is demonstrated through several practical circuit examples. First, our investigation of fluctuations in nonlinear electrical circuits provides deep insight into the nonlinear fluctuation phenomena. Especially, the study of fluctuations in nonlinear active devices constitutes an important sector in this investigation; verifying the physical soundness of the contemporary active device noise modeling and leading to clear understanding of fluctuation-dissipation relations in nonlinear devices. Second, we apply statistical electronics to noise problems involved in frequency conversion, an essential function in modern RF and microwave receivers. This study leads to two novel observations of noise figure degradation due to cyclostationary noise and conversion gain enhancement, both dependent on the size of energy storing elements. This novel behavior is experimentally verified with a direct measurement of integrated <b>switching</b> <b>mixers.</b> The results provide new insight into cyclostationary noise processes in frequency conversion and optimum deisgn for <b>switching</b> <b>mixers.</b> Third, application of statistical electronics to noise in frequency generation by self-sustained oscillators leads to a new theory of oscillator noise.

The novel concepts of virtual damping and linewidth compression put resonators and oscillators in a unified framework, providing immediate design optimization insight. The power of this theoretical development is demonstrated through experimental measurements of various integrated oscillators.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new nonlinear transistor model {{based on a}} symmetrical small-signal model far GaN HEMTs. The intrinsic symmetry reflected into the small signal equivalent circuit is used {{to build a new}} model to describe the nonlinear behavior of the device. The model consists of a new nonlinear charge expression with only 6 parameters, while the nonlinear current expression is extended front an existing model to enable validity in both the positive and negative Vis region. Therefore, it can be used for transistors in <b>switches,</b> resistive <b>mixers</b> as well as amplifiers. The model is validated with both small-signal and nonlinear measurements showing good agreements...|$|R
