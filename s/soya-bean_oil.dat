40|$|A {{longitudinal}} cross-over feeding {{design was}} used to investigate the relationship of dietary lipid composition to the membrane lipid environment and activity of mitochondrial ATPase in vivo. Rats were fed a polyunsaturated fatty-acid-rich oil (<b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil)</b> for 12 days, crossed-over to a monounsaturated fatty-acid-rich oil (rapeseed oil) for the next 11 days, then returned to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> for 11 more days. Additional rats were fed either <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> or rapeseed oil throughout. Rats fed rapeseed oil had lower rates of ATPase-catalysed ATP/[32 P]Pi exchange than rats fed <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil.</b> Arrhenius plots showed higher transition temperature (Tt) and activation energy (Ea) for rats fed rapeseed oil. Switching from <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> to rapeseed oil was dynamically followed by changes in the thermotropic and kinetic properties of the mitochondrial ATPase exchange reaction. Returning to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> reversed these changes. The rapid and reversible modulation of Tt caused by a change {{of the type of}} fat ingested suggests that membrane physicochemical properties are not under rigid intrinsic control but are continually modified by the profile of exogenously derived fatty acids. The studies suggest that in vivo the activity of mitochondrial ATPase is in part determined by dietary lipid via its influence on the microenvironment of the enzyme. The rapidity and ready reversibility of changes observed for this subcellular-membrane-bound enzyme suggest that dietary fatty-acid balance may be an important determinant of other membrane functions in the body...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{longitudinal}} feeding {{design was}} used to investigate the controlling influence of dietary fatty acids on the dynamic incorporation of fatty-acyl chains into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin in inner membrane of cardiac mitochondria. Rats were fed a polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-rich oil (<b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil)</b> for 12 days, crossed-over to a monounsaturated-fatty-acid-rich oil (rapeseed oil) for the next 11 days, then returned to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> for 11 more days. Additional rats were fed either <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> or rapeseed oil only throughout. Rats were killed serially. Regression analysis {{was used to}} represent longitudinal flux in membrane lipid fatty-acid composition occurring with change in dietary fat. The fatty-acid composition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin was influenced by dietary oil in a reversible way. Maximal diet influence was achieved in the 11 -day cross-over period. <b>Soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> to rapeseed oil cross-over caused the fatty-acid composition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin to resemble that of rats fed rapeseed oil only. These changes were reversed by crossing back to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil,</b> indicating the dynamic state and short half-life of membrane phospholipid fatty-acyl chains. This report demonstrates {{for the first time in}} the whole animal fed diets adequate in all nutrients that subcellular membrane lipids rapidly respond to change in dietary fatty-acid balance. The system may be used to assess in vivo the significance of dietary fat in determining membrane physicochemical properties and biochemical functions...|$|E
40|$|Male Sprague-Dawley rats {{were fed}} diets {{containing}} 20 % (w/w) <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil,</b> high-erucic acid rapeseed oil or low-erucic acid rapeseed oil for 0, 12 or 23 days. The type of fat {{present in the}} diet {{had no effect on}} the total phospholipid content of heart mitochondria (micrograms/mg of protein) but did influence the phospholipid class distribution. Rats fed high-erucic acid rapeseed oil for 12 or 23 days had significantly higher mitochondrial phosphatidylcholine content than rats fed <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil.</b> Low-erucic acid rapeseed oil resulted in elevation of cardiac mitochondrial cardiolipin content after dietary treatment for 12 days. The results demonstrate in vivo that diet is a significant determinant of the phospholipid class content of subcellular membranes...|$|E
40|$|Male C 57 BL/ 65 mice {{received}} a basal diet supplemented with 4 % <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil,</b> linseed oil or fish oil, {{in which the}} major polyunsaturated fatty acids were linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid and long chain omega- 3 fatty acids, respectively. Groups of animals were injected into the right flank with EL 4 -lymphoma cells, others with thymoma cells. Tumour implantation caused a gradual decrease in food consumption with both types of tumour, while body weight increased, especially in the EL 4 -bearing animals receiving the soya-bean diet. The weight gain was due to body water accumulation and was accompanied by decreases in body fat and minor changes in carcass protein and ash contents. The dietary treatments did not produce significant differences in tumour incidence and mortality, but tumour size was decreased by diets supplying omega- 3 fatty acids: in the EL 4 mice tumour weight was markedly depressed by linseed oil, compared to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil,</b> whereas thymoma tumour weight was lowest in mice receiving fish oil and highest in the <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> group. Both types of tumour caused pronounced hypoglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia in the hosts, and the effect was modulated by the diets in the EL 4 {{but not in the}} thymoma animals: the plasma glucose level was especially low in the linseed oil group and relatively highest in the <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> treatment. The degree of hyperinsulinaemia depended on the diet only in the thymoma-bearing mice, with linseed and fish oils producing higher insulin levels than <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil.</b> A slight hyperinsulinaemia was also observed in linseed and fish oil-fed control mice. Serum triglycerides were elevated in tumour-bearing animals, without consistent differences between dietary treatments. Although no clear pattern emerged concerning total cholesterol and LDL levels, HDL values were strongly affected by the type of oil: in the control animals linseed oil caused an increase in HDL-cholesterol compared to the other two oils. The thymoma-bearing mice responded to the linseed and fish oil diets with greatly elevated HDL-cholesterol levels. The results point to important differences in the responses of the two implanted tumours and hosts not only to the omega- 6 and omega- 3 fatty acids, but also to the type of dietary omega- 3 fatty acids, namely alpha-linolenic acid and long chain fish oil polyunsaturated fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} an experimental procedure based on a chemical industrial process of <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> extraction applied in general chemistry for undergraduate students. The experiment was planned according to the Science, Technology and Society (STS) approach to teach basic chemical concepts and provide grounding {{in the management of}} environmental care. The use of real life chemistry problems seems to salient the relevance of chemistry to our students and enhances their motivation to learn both the practical and theoretical components of the discipline...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary lipid on the thermotropic {{properties}} of acetylcholinesterase activity was examined in rat synaptosomal membrane preparations after feeding diets containing <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil,</b> sunflower oil or soya-bean phosphatidylcholine as the dietary fats. Arrhenius plots and energies of activation were altered by {{the duration of}} feeding {{as a function of}} time, {{as well as by the}} composition of diet fat fed. Animals fed sunflower oil had the highest maximal velocity for acetylcholinesterase activity. The observations of this study suggest that dietary fat is an important determinant of the physicokinetic properties of lipid-dependent functions in brain synaptosomal membranes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{was to assess the}} {{competitive}} position of the main producers and exporters of oilseeds and vegetable oils in the intra-EU trade in 2004 and 2012. The competitiveness was assessed {{with the use of a}} selected set of quantitative measures of international competitive position. Moreover, some shares of the analysed countries in the intra-EU trade, as well as relative export intensity of oilseeds and vegetable oils in these countries were estimated. On the basis of the conducted analyses it is possible to conclude that apart from Germany in trade in rapeseed and soya beans, as well as the Netherlands in trade in rapeseed and sunflower-seed, the main producers and exporters of oilseeds were competitive on the Single European Market. Excluding <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> produced in the EU mainly from imported raw material, competitive advantage of most of the countries decreased together with the level of processing and was lower in trade in vegetable oils...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} some fish oils on the plasma-cholesterol level of chicks were studied in eleven experiments. Soya- bean oil, {{margarine}} fat and squalene were {{also included in}} the study. Arachis oil was used as a reference in all experiments. In experiments with added cholesterol, cod liver oil usually showed lowered values compared with arachis oil and no fat added, but the effect varied greatly. Thus no final conclusions could be drawn. <b>Soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> did not show any effect compared with arachis oil, whereas basking shark liver oil, dogfish liver oil and squalene lowered the cholesterol level. Methyl ester fractions of cod liver oil with iodine numbers ranging from 78 to 254 were without effect. In experiments without added cholesterol, cod liver oil in most cases gave significantly lower cholesterol levels than did arachis oil. This effect was also observed for herring oil, dogfish liver oil, basking shark liver oil and squalene...|$|E
40|$|The {{modulation}} of rat brain microsomal and synaptosomal {{membrane lipid}} by diet fat was examined. Brain synaptosomal and microsomal membrane composition was compared for rats fed on diets containing either <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> (SBO), SBO plus choline, SBO lecithin, sunflower oil (SFO), chow or low-erucic acid rape-seed oil (LER) for 24 days. Cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine levels in both membranes were altered by diet. Diet fat also affected the microsomal content of sphingomyelin. Change in membrane phosphatidylcholine level {{was related to}} the relative balance of omega- 6, omega- 3 and monounsaturated fatty acids within the diets fed. The highest phosphatidylcholine levels appeared in membranes of animals fed on SBO lecithin and the lowest in those fed on LER. Microsomal membrane cholesterol and sphingomyelin content increased by feeding on SBO lecithin. In both synaptosomal and microsomal membranes a highly significant correlation was observed between membrane phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol content. The fatty acyl composition of phospholipids from both membranes also altered with diet and age. Alteration in fatty acid composition was observed in response to dietary levels of omega- 6, omega- 3 and monounsaturated fatty acids, but the unsaturation index of each phospholipid remained constant for all diet treatments. These changes in lipid composition suggest that dietary fat may be a significant modulator in vivo of the physicobiochemical properties of brain synaptosomal and microsomal membranes...|$|E
40|$|Rats {{were fed}} diets that {{differed}} in fatty acid composition {{or in the}} proportion of energy derived from fat to determine if alteration of dietary fat intake influences the structural lipid composition of liver plasma membrane and the expression of an associated hormone-receptor-mediated function. Weanling rats were fed 9 % (w/w) or 20 % (w/w) low-erucic acid rape-seed oil or 9 % (w/w) <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> for 24 days. Plasma membranes were isolated and the effect of diet fat on the fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol and sphingomyelin was determined. Diet fat significantly altered total saturated and (omega- 9) and (omega- 6) -unsaturated fatty acid composition in addition to the (omega- 6) - to (omega- 3) -unsaturated fatty acid ratio in these polar lipids. Feeding the high-fat diet increased the (omega- 6) - to (omega- 3) -unsaturated fatty acid ratio and the (omega- 9) -unsaturated fatty acid content in all lipids except sphingomyelin. Assay of glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity at both high and low glucagon concentrations indicated that high-fat intake also decreased cyclic AMP formation. In a second experiment the fat intake was held constant (40 % of energy) and oleic acid was substituted for linoleic acid by blending high- and low-linoleic acid-type safflower oils. This experiment established that a dose-response relationship exists between dietary intake of fatty acid and the fatty acid composition of plasma-membrane phospholipids. Specific diet-induced transitions in membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition were paralleled by changes in glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. This study suggests that transitions in dietary fat intake can alter a hormone-receptor-mediated enzyme function in vivo by changing the surrounding lipid environment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, gel {{formulations}} of organogels, hydrogels, and oleo-hydrogel (bigels) were evaluated as transdermal drug delivery systems for diltiazem HCL (DH). Organogels were prepared using <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> (SO) as a solvent and span 60 (Sp 60), cetyl alcohol (CA) or lecithin-pluronic (PLO) as organogelators without and with different surfactants (2 % w/w) namely span 80 (Sp 80), tween 20 (T 20) and tween 80 (T 80). On the other hand, hydrogels were formulated using Hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) polymer and bigels were prepared by mixing organogels with HPMC hydrogels. The prepared gels were analyzed microscopically, thermally by DTA and for pH, and viscosity. The effect of gelator used, surfactant types and pH {{of the sink}} on DH release from cellophane membrane was investigated. In addition, the DH permeability across the rabbit skin was evaluated. Finally, the in vivo performance of various gel formulations was assessed based on the hypotensive effects of the drug using hypertensive albino male rat models. The microscopical analysis indicated that the solid fibers formed by gelator particles form {{the backbone of the}} organogels while bigels appeared as emulsion like. The addition of surfactants showed an increase in organogel viscosity. The thermal analysis of organogels indicated that the drug present in amorphous not in crystalline form. The release studies indicated that DH release from organogels, hydrogels and bigels could be controlled. The included surfactants decreased the DH release and permeation from organogels compared to those without surfactants using either Sp 60 or CA. HPMC hydrogel and Bigels showed higher DH release and permeation rates when compared to organogels. The percent DH released in different pH values was in the following descending order: pH 5. 5 >pH 1. 2 >pH 6. 8 >pH 7. 4. The in vivo antihypertensive activity of DH using different transdermal gels is arranged as following: hydrogels > PLO organogel > bigel> Sp 60 organogel...|$|E
