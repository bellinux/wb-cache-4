40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model for {{determining}} a robust defence strategy against ballistic missile threat. Our approach takes into account a variety of possible future scenarios and different forms of robustness criteria, including the well-known absolute robustness criterion. We consider two problem variants. In the first, the number of ballistic missile <b>interceptor</b> <b>systems</b> is minimised, such that a predetermined defence level is achieved. In the second variant, the defence level is maximised for a given number of available <b>interceptor</b> <b>systems.</b> The solutions of both variants consist of a subset of all possible locations of the <b>interceptor</b> <b>systems.</b> We applied two solution approaches to this problem: a heuristic and an exact solution method. The heuristic method is based on simulated annealing and produces good results within {{a short amount of}} computation time. We also developed an integer programming formulation which can be solved to optimality using a standard solver. The computation time is higher, but because of the nice properties of the proposed IP-formulation, it can still be solved within reasonable amount of computation time. These two solution approaches were tested using a fictive, but realistic dataset. The results illustrate the effects of the predetermined defence levels and the availability of <b>interceptor</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as the robustness of the solutions produced. Finally, we used our dataset to illustrate the differences between both variants and their use in practice...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{competitiveness}} on the global market the major objective of the world olive growing industry {{seems to be the}} reduction of the production costs and the increase of the number of olive trees per hectare. The production cost analysis indicates that harvesting is of utmost importance. As a result it is important to mechanize and innovate the harvesting process. Using olive harvesting mechanization systems it is necessary both to reduce the production costs and {{to improve the quality of}} the olives and subsequently of the oil. In the order of increasing importance and cost of the machine, the following olive harvesting mechanization systems are used in high density orchards: hand held shaker or trunk shaker with different <b>interceptor</b> <b>systems.</b> Various tests have been done on the different harvesting systems to compare the fruit removal efficiency and work productivity. Our results have demonstrated that the work productivity increases when the harvesting mechanization systems are used and that productivity increases proportionally to the power of the mechanization systems. When the hand held shaker is used the work productivity is doubled, compared with harvesting by hand. However, it is important to note that the hand held shaker is only suitable for sloping or terracing ground and small family run farms.

The interceptor is comprised of a three-stage solid propulsion system for an exoatmospheric boost phase intercept (BPI). The interceptor's duty is to deliver a kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) to the optimal position in space to accomplish the mission of intercept. The modules for propulsion, aerodynamics, mass properties and flight dynamics are integrated to produce a high fidelity model of the entire vehicle. The propulsion module comprises of solid rocket motor (SRM) grain design, nozzle geometry design and performance prediction analysis. Internal ballistics and performance prediction parameters are calculated by using lumped parameter method. The design objective is to minimize the gross lift off mass (GLOM) of the interceptor under the mission constraints and performance objectives.

40|$|This paper proposes {{three-dimensional}} {{impact angle}} control guidance laws {{based on a}} sliding mode control technique. Unlike the usual approach of decoupling the engagement dynamics into two mutually orthogonal two-dimensional planes, the guidance laws are derived using coupled engagement dynamics. By using this approach, the control effort required {{to achieve the objective}} reduces and the performance of the guidance law is improved. The derivations of guidance laws are done using both conventional as well as nonsingular terminal sliding mode control, which guarantees asymptotic and finite time convergence, respectively, to the desired impact angle. In order to derive the guidance laws, multi-dimensional switching surfaces are used. The stability of the system, with selected switching surfaces, is demonstrated using Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulation results are presented to validate the proposed guidance laws for constant speed, as well as a realistic interceptor model with given aerodynamic properties. The simulations show the advantage of using coupled dynamics. The robustness of the proposed guidance laws, with respect to the <b>interceptor's</b> <b>system</b> lag, is also investigated...|$|R

We evaluated the safety and feasibility of the Medtronic Self-Expanding Carotid Stent (Exponent) {{in combination with the}} Medtronic <b>Interceptor</b> Carotid Filter <b>System</b> for the treatment of carotid stenosis among patients at high risk for carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: Patients at high risk for carotid endarterectomy but amenable to percutaneous treatment with stent placement were enrolled. Clinical follow-up was performed at 30 days and 6 and 12 months postprocedure. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was assessed before and within 3 days postprocedure and at 30 days and 6 months postprocedure. Angiography was performed pre- and postprocedure, and carotid duplex scans were performed at baseline and at 30 days and 6 months. RESULTS: Fifty-two carotid procedures were performed in 51 patients (mean age, 69 years; 84 % of patients were men). The major adverse event (MAE) rate (death, stroke, and myocardial infarction [MI]) at 30 days was 5. 9 %: 2 strokes and a single death from periprocedural MI. MAE rates after 6 and 12 months were 5. 9 % and 11. 8 %, respectively. The delivery success rate was 94. 2 % (49 / 52) for the <b>Interceptor</b> Filter <b>System</b> and 95. 9 % (47 / 49) for the Exponent Stent.
