5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E
