The attempt to draft a Constitution for Europe showed the limits of supranational democracy in that it maintained the intergovernmental design of treaty revision, and finally crashed against the scepticism {{of a number of}} national voters. What is left is the mixed kind of legitimation that results from the <b>successive</b> <b>treaty</b> revisions: input legitimacy (through the European and the national parliaments, states’ governments representation in Council, social dialogue, and participatory democracy), output legitimacy, and rule of law. This mixed model is exactly what is now put into question. The multiple crises that the EU currently experiences seem open to three different developments: an unlikely new edition of the federal dream; the transformation of the EU into an ‘empire’ with one or more clear hegemonic countries; the reinforcement of informal, inclusive governance as a further implementation of the path inaugurated with the Lisbon Treaty. A mixed, but mainly intergovernmental strengthening of (economic) governance is still the most realistic path out of the crisis and towards enhanced political union...|$|R

This innovation is possible because, technically, the TSCG I not an EU Treaty. It is not constructed as a reform of the EU Treaties following Article 48 which prescribes unanimity. So far, EU treaty revision is firmly locked in the unanimity requirement creating a Catch- 22 situation: unanimity can only be removed unanimously. This, together with an adherence to a ‘strict construction’ {{in the interpretation of}} EU law and the relative absence of instances of ratification failures may explain the permanence of the requirement. As the basic rule of constitution-making, several criticisms can be launched against unanimity. This paper discusses the rule of unanimity in three parts: it presents, firstly, the origins and maintenance of the rule through the EU’s <b>successive</b> <b>treaty</b> reforms, as well as the theoretical alternatives proposed. The second part of the paper raises various arguments against unanimity: the factual outcome of the practice of unanimity, its effect on the model of constitutional rules of the Union, the issue of consent and the possibility of externalising the effects of unanimity. The third part presents and discusses the provisions in the existing draft on a reinforced economic union. The conclusion argues in favour of any rule short of unanimity, since its most important property will be to transform the dynamics of the ratification process. constitution building; constitutional change; law; political science; treaty reform; unanimity...|$|R

40|$|From the ‘long’ {{sixteenth century}} the Ottoman regencies of North Africa {{operated}} as major centres of piracy and privateering across the Mediterranean sea. Though deemed by emerging European powers {{to be an}} expression of the ‘barbarian’ status of Muslim and Ottoman rulers and peoples, piracy and corsairing in fact {{played a major role in}} the development of the ‘primary’ or ‘master’ institutions of international society such as sovereignty, war and international law. Far from representing a ‘barbarian’ challenge to the European ‘standard of civilization’, piracy and privateering in the modern Mediterranean acted as contradictory vehicles in the affirmation of that very standard. This paper explores in some historical detail the ways in which piracy and corsairing off the Barbary Coast in effect acted as ‘derivative’ primary institutions of international society, as Barry Buzan has labelled them. It argues that piracy and corsairing simultaneously contributed to the construction of north African sovereignty whilst also prompting <b>successive</b> wars and <b>treaties</b> aimed at outlawing such practices. The cumulative effect of these complex historical experiences was certainly the expansion of international society and its accompanying master institutions. Yet the manner of their consolidation – at least in the western Mediterranean - suggests that primary institutions of international society owe much more to ‘barbarism’ and ‘illegality’ than is commonly acknowledged...|$|R
40|$|The European Convention on Human Rights is {{the most}} {{effective}} human rights regime in the world. The Convention (ECHR), which entered into force in 1953, established a basic catalogue of rights binding on the signatories, and new institutions charged with monitoring and enforcing compliance. Distinctive at its conception, the ECHR has since evolved into an intricate legal system. The High Contracting Parties have steadily upgraded the regime’s scope and capacities, in <b>successive</b> <b>treaty</b> revisions. They have added new rights, enhanced the powers of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and strengthened the links between individual applicants and the regime. For its part, the Strasbourg Court has built a sophisticated jurisprudence, whose progressive tenor and expansive reach has helped to propel the system forward. Today, the Court is an important, autonomous source of authority on the nature and content of fundamental rights in Europe. In addition to providing justice in individual cases, it works to identify and to consolidate universal standards of rights protection, in the face of wide national diversity and a steady stream of seemingly intractable problems. This book focuses on the impact of the Court and the Convention on the domestic legal systems of the regime’s members, a topic that has been understudied, given its increasing importance. Two previously published pieces of research inspired and guided this project. The book entitled “The European Court and the National Courts: Legal Change in its Social, Political, and Economic Context”, published in 1998, presented a series of single-country reports and comparative analyses of how the national courts reacted to, and ultimately, accommodated the European Court of Justice’s doctrine of the supremacy of European Community law. One premise of that earlier volume, which we share, is that national judges are important actors in their own right in the process through which European law becomes effective in national legal orders. This volume’s scope is somewhat wider, in that the reports examine the role of all national officials, not only judges, in facilitating or resisting the influence of the Convention. The basic template for the research was established by Helen Keller’s pilot study entitled “Reception of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in Poland and Switzerland”, an agenda we extended for this project. A first point of departure was the view that the Court is today institutionally well-positioned to exercise such influence. The Court has final jurisdiction over disputes concerning the content of the Convention, the compliance with the Convention of the High Contracting Parties, and the scope of its own jurisdiction (Kompetenz-Kompetenz); it has a burgeoning caseload in the form of individual applications; and it has produced a case law that defines what States owe to their own citizens under the Convention. A second point of departure was the observation that the regime’s influence on national officials and their decision making varies widely across States and across time. Indeed, as our research shows, the Court’s impact has been broad and pervasive in some States, and weak in others. Moreover, in those States that have been heavily influenced by the Convention, impact has been registered through quite different processes. How national officials use Convention norms, {{and the extent to which}} they resist or adapt to the Court’s case law, has also changed across time, sometimes radically. Our major objective, then, was to describe and analyse this variance, as systematically as possible, and to take some initial steps toward explaining it. This volume reports our results. Each of the nine substantive chapters examines comparatively what we will call “the reception of the ECHR” in two States. By reception, we mean how – that is, through what mechanisms – national officials confront, make use of, and resist or give agency to Convention rights. The book is fundamentally a work of comparative law, albeit with a twist. The project focuses empirical attention on the capacity of an international regime, and its transnational court, to shape law and politics at the domestic level. It thus addresses some of the same basic questions asked by students of the Europeanization of law and politics, of multi-level governance, and of the constitutionalization of treaty-based legal systems. The project also has a normative dimension, namely, to identify how the effectiveness of Convention rights in national legal orders has been, and can be, enhanced over time. We chart how the status of the Convention in domestic law and politics has changed over time, and examine, from a comparative perspective, the regime’s overall effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Africa is poor in {{the midst}} of plenty. Though {{multiple}} causes and reasons may be claimed for Africa’s shrinking state of development, disruptive effects of colonialism takes forefront. Present-day Africa is literally free but colonial footprints are still apparent in the borderlands. The study pinpoints how natural borderline development was thwarted by the infamous Berlin Conference of 1884 - 1885. As result, people, ethnic groups, nations and nationalities have been disintegrated. Ethnic disintegration and arbitrary colonial boundaries lines have been source of unavoidable intra and inter state conflicts in Africa. Ironically, in fear of opening “Pandora’s Box” that would further unlock unmanageable conflict, founding fathers of OAU have decided to abide by the colonial boundaries “whether they are good or bad” in Cairo Resolution of 1964, thereby suppressing Kwame Nkrumah’s vision of forming United Sates of Africa by removing colonial boundary lines. The study argues that Africa has missed the best opportunity that would avoid boundary conflict that constitutes 90 % of African interstate conflicts. This study proves deficiencies of the Cairo Declaration of 1964 that has honored colonial boundaries, as boundaries between independent African States taking Ethio-Eritrean boundary as case study. The Ethio-Eritrean boundary meant to be defined by the three <b>successive</b> colonial <b>treaties</b> of 1900, 1902, and 1908 that were concluded between Italy, Ethiopia and Great Britain, but the actual boundary line never been drawn on the ground and cannot be define in accordance with the awkward terms of the treaties. Any attempt for strict application of the elusive treaty wordings exacerbates the complexity, confusion and ultimately fuels up conflict. The study focuses on resolving the current impasse between Ethiopia and Eritrea by drawing an acceptable boundary line through constructive dialogue. A true and acceptable boundary line cannot be drawn simply on the basis of elusive colonial treaties, but through constructive and honest dialogue. Drawing a line of separation is not a goal by itself, but it would perpetuate peace, create good neighborhood, and contribute for rebuilding sense of brotherhood by avoiding animosity and mistrust. Peaceful coexistence, coupled with effects of globalization, therefore, would stimulate economic and political integration that would ultimately remove restraining effects border walls. This will effectuate AU’s Border Program that aims to change the nature of borders from barriers to bridges thereby enable everyone to freely move all over Africa once again...|$|R
