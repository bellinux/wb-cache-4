[...] Keating wins and Howard concedes with the line [...] "Well, I'm <b>sorry...</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> lost!" [...] (a reference to his unwillingness to support a formal apology to the Aboriginal people). [...] As the song's title indicates, the actual Keating did not win the 1996 election. [...] The song segues into a reprise of [...] "Ruler Of The Land".|$|E

So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would be sort of the opposite, because even though you think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, and it just actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E
500|$|Many {{survivors}} of the tragedy refused to blame anyone. Survivor John Jacques wrote, [...] "I blame nobody. I am not anxious to blame anybody... I {{have no doubt that}} those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances." [...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company." [...] On the other hand, survivor John Chislett, who later left the Church, wrote bitterly of Richards promising them that [...] "we should get to Zion in safety." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E

At the 60th Academy Awards, Empire of the Sun was nominated for Art Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Original Music Score, Costume Design (Bob Ringwood), and Sound (Robert Knudson, Don Digirolamo, John Boyd and Tony Dawe). It did not convert any of the nominations into awards. Allen Daviau, who was nominated as cinematographer, publicly complained, [...] "I can't second-guess the Academy, but I feel very <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> get nominations and Steven doesn't. It's his vision that makes it all come together, and if Steven wasn't making these films, {{none of us would}} be here." [...] The film won awards for cinematography, sound design, and music score at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards.

2500|$|In August 2007, Burroughs and his publisher, St. Martin's Press, {{settled with}} the Turcotte family, who {{stated that they}} were the basis for the Finch family portrayed in Running with Scissors. The Turcottes, who alleged that Running with Scissors was largely fictional and written in a sensational manner, sought damages of $2 million for {{invasion}} of privacy, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Burroughs defended his work as [...] "entirely accurate," [...] but agreed to call the work a [...] "book" [...] (instead of [...] "memoir") in the author's note, to alter the acknowledgments page in future editions to recognize the Turcotte family's conflicting memories of described events, and express regret for [...] "any unintentional harm" [...] to the Turcotte family. Burroughs felt vindicated by the settlement. [...] "I'm not at all <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wrote it. And you know, the suit settled – it settled in my favor. I didn't change a word of the memoir, not one word of it. It's still a memoir, it's marketed as a memoir, [...] agreed one hundred percent that it is a memoir." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011 Coulson {{left his}} post, saying {{coverage}} of the phone-hacking scandal was {{making it difficult to}} give his best to the job. In July 2011 he was arrested and questioned by police in connection with further allegations of illegal activities at the News of the World, and released on bail. Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the leader of the opposition, Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance. On 20 July, in a special parliamentary session at the House of Commons, arranged to discuss the News International phone hacking scandal, Cameron said that he [...] "regretted the furore" [...] that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that [...] "with hindsight" [...] he would not have hired him. Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by Strathclyde Police on 30 May 2012. Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones in June 2014. Prior to the jury handing down their verdict, Cameron issued a [...] "full and frank" [...] apology for hiring him, saying [...] "I am extremely <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that." [...] The judge hearing Coulson's trial was critical of the prime minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation.|$|E
