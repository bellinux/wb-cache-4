25|$|Harper–Dorn creep is a climb-controlled {{dislocation}} mechanism at low {{stresses that}} has been observed in aluminum, lead, and tin systems, in addition to nonmetal systems such as ceramics and ice. It is characterized by two principal phenomena: a linear relationship between the steady-state <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> and applied stress at a constant temperature, and an independent relationship between the steady-state <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> and grain size for a provided temperature and applied stress. The latter observation implies that Harper–Dorn creep is controlled by dislocation movement; namely, since creep can occur by vacancy diffusion (Nabarro–Herring creep, Coble creep), grain boundary sliding, and/or dislocation movement, and since the first two mechanisms are grain-size dependent, Harper–Dorn creep must therefore be dislocation-motion dependent.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{behavior}} of ultrafine-grained (UFG) commercially pure aluminum (AA 1070) samples prepared via two different equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) routes was studied at high <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> at room and sub-zero temperatures using the Hopkinson Split Bar technique, and at quasi-static <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> {{at room temperature}} using a servohydraulic materials testing machine. For comparison, similar tests were also conducted on coarse-grained AA 1070 aluminum samples. 3 D- and 2 D-ECAP dies were used to deform the initial coarse-grained aluminum to total equivalent plastic strains of ca. 10 using routes Bc and C+Bc, respectively.

25|$|This idea {{can work}} fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, {{problems}} such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the no-slip condition generates a thin region of large <b>strain</b> <b>rate,</b> the boundary layer, in which viscosity effects dominate and which thus generates vorticity. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), viscous flow equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict drag forces, a limitation known as the d'Alembert's paradox.|$|E
25|$|The {{slope of}} the inner trench slope of an accretionary {{convergent}} margin reflects continuous adjustments to the thickness and width of the accretionary prism.
