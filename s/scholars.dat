5|$|A {{point of}} {{contention}} among <b>scholars</b> is {{the role played by}} Armenian clerics in that process. According to a number of <b>scholars</b> and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been criticized by <b>scholars,</b> both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other <b>scholars</b> quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity. Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must {{have played a role in}} the creation of the Georgian script.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal <b>scholars</b> disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial.

5|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the High Middle Ages, when Latin <b>scholars</b> focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics, Renaissance <b>scholars</b> were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance <b>scholars</b> such as Petrarch, Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406), Niccolò de' Niccoli (1364–1437) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as Cicero, Lucretius, Livy and Seneca. By the early 15th century, the bulk of such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European <b>scholars</b> turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} century of the Empire, refugee Byzantine <b>scholars</b> were principally {{responsible}} for carrying, {{in person and}} in writing, ancient Greek grammatical, literary studies, mathematical, and astronomical knowledge to early Renaissance Italy.
