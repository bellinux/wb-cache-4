40|$|ABSTRACT We {{present a}} finite {{difference}} algorithm for integrating the reactive flow model of contractile biological polymer networks {{on a fixed}} Eulerian mesh. We discuss the accuracy and limits of the algorithm. To illustrate {{the application of the}} algorithm, we carry out a family of computations involving an unreactive contractile network contained in a two-dimensional square reaction vessel. By numerical experiments using different values ofthe physical parameters of the model, we find that for this simple sort of system two major dynamical modes of contraction are predicted to occur. There is the <b>squeezing</b> <b>type</b> contraction in which the network contracts to a single small clump with gradual expulsion ofsolution material, and the rending type contraction in which the network tears itself into a number of separate pieces. We find that to a good approximation the transition between the squeezing mode and the rending mode is controlled by a single nondimensional number (the rending number). We discuss the relevance ofthese results for the analysis ofvarious experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an X-Band and RF {{system for the}} Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator. The RF system consists of a 90 MeV injector and a 540 MeV linac. The main components of the injector are two low-Q single-cavity prebunchers and two 0. 9 -m-long detuned accelerator sections. The linac system consists of six 1. 8 -m-long detuned and damped detuned accelerator sections powered in pairs. The rf power generation, compression, delivery, distribution and measurement systems consist of klystrons, SLED-II energy compression systems, rectangular waveguides, magic-T`s, and directional couplers. The phase and amplitude for each prebuncher is adjusted via a magic-T type phase shifter/attenuator. Correct phasing between the two 0. 9 m accelerator sections is obtained by properly aligning the sections and adjusting two <b>squeeze</b> <b>type</b> phase shifters. Bunch phase and bunch length can be monitored with special microwave cavities and measurement systems. The design, fabrication, microwave measurement, calibration, and operation of the sub-systems and their components are briefly presented...|$|R

40|$|I review what bispectra and trispectra {{look like}} in real space, {{in terms of the}} sign of {{particular}} shaped triangles and tetrahedrons. Having an equilateral density bispectrum of positive sign corresponds to having concentrated overdensities surrounded by larger weaker underdensities. In 3 D these are concentrated density filaments, as expected in large-scale structure. As the shape changes from equilateral to flattened the concentrated overdensities flatten into lines (3 D planes). I then focus on squeezed bispectra, which {{can be thought of as}} correlations of changes in small-scale power with large-scale fields, and discuss the general non-perturbative form of the squeezed bispectrum and its angular dependence. A general trispectrum has tetrahedral form and I show examples of what this can {{look like in}} real space. Squeezed trispectra are of particular interest and come in two forms, corresponding to large-scale variance of small-scale power, and correlated modulations of an equilateral-form bispectrum. Flattened trispectra can be produced by line-like features in 2 D, for example from cosmic strings, and randomly located features also give a non-Gaussian signal. There are relationships between the <b>squeezed</b> <b>types</b> of non-Gaussianity, and also a useful interpretation in terms of statistical anisotropy. I discuss the various possible physical origins of cosmological non-Gaussianities, both in terms of primordial perturbations and late-time dynamical and geometric effects.

40|$|Background and Objective: Chest pain is {{a common}} and {{important}} admission complaint of patients in the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis {{especially in terms of}} acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be done carefully by emergency physicians. The present study aims to identify patients with chest pain according to presence of ACS in the ED. Material and Methods: The patients who admitted to the ED of a university hospital in a year period with chest pain complaint were enrolled into the study prospectively. The information that include age, gender, type of chest pain, duration of pain, medical history, transporting way to the ED, duration time of electrocardiography (ECG) recording, main diagnosis, consultation status, last condition of patients and length of stay of patients were recorded. The data were analyzed by SPSS 17. 0 program. Results: Totally 325 patients with chest pain complaint were enrolled into the study. 24. 3 % of patients with chest pain were diagnosed as ACS. It was found that most of the patients (42. 5 %) came to ED by the ambulance. 110 (33. 8 %) of 325 patients with chest pain were consulted with cardiologists. The older age was found to be related with ACS significantly (p< 0. 001). Additionally; compressive, burning and <b>squeezing</b> <b>types</b> of chest pain were associated with ACS (p< 0. 040). The length of stay in the ED was found shorter in ACS+ group than ACS- group (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The presented study indicates the role of emergency physicians on the management of patients with chest pain. The early and true diagnosis of patients is very important and essential particularly for the management of ACS in the ED. [J Contemp Med 2016; 6 (1. 000) : 30 - 34...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the development of}} a fundamental understanding of the acoustics and piezoelectric transducer governing the operation of piezoelectric inkjets and horn-based ultrasonic atomizers when utilizing high viscosity working fluids. This work creates coupled, electro-mechanical analytical models of the acoustic behavior of these devices by extending models from the literature which make minimal simplifications in the handling terms that account for viscous losses. Models are created for each component of the considered fluid ejectors: piezoelectric transducers, acoustic pipes, and acoustic horns. The acoustic pipe models consider the two limited cases when either the acoustic boundary layer or attenuation losses dominate the acoustic field and are adapted to account for changes in cross-sectional area present in acoustic horns. A full electro-mechanical analytical model of the fluid ejectors is formed by coupling the component models using appropriate boundary conditions. The developed electro-mechanical model is applied to understand the acoustic response of the fluid cavity alone and when combined with the transducer in horn-based ultrasonic atomizers. An understanding of the individual and combined acoustic response of the fluid cavity and piezoelectric transducer allow for an optimal geometry to be selected for the ejection of high viscosity working fluids. The maximum pressure gradient magnitude produced by the atomizer is compared to the pressure gradient threshold required for fluid ejection predicted by a hydrodynamic scaling analysis. The maximum working fluid viscosity of the standard horn-based ultrasonic atomizer and those with dual working fluid combinations, a low viscosity and a high viscosity working fluid to minimize viscous dissipation, is established to be on the order of 100 mPas. The developed electro-mechanical model is also applied to understand the acoustic response of the fluid cavity and annular piezoelectric transducer in <b>squeeze</b> <b>type</b> ejectors with high viscosity working fluids. The maximum pressure gradient generated by the ejector is examined {{as a function of the}} principle geometric properties. The maximum pressure gradient magnitude produced by the ejector is again compared to the pressure gradient threshold derived from hydrodynamic scaling. The upper limit on working fluid viscosity is established as 100 mPas. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|The Squeeze film damper {{has proved}} a useful means of {{eliminating}} instabilities and reducing vibration in rotor-bearing systems. Analyses for this problem generally assume parallel land dampers. In this thesis, the pressure distribution, the fluid film forces, and the stiffness and damping coefficients of variable land geometry narrow, circular orbit <b>type</b> <b>squeeze</b> film dampers are obtained theoretically, assuming end feed and the Short Bearing Approximation. The coefficients for 7 r film are obtained for quartic, exponential, cosine and step wise axial profile variation and {{compared to those}} for parallel axial land geometry. It is shown that variable land geometry dampers can reduce the variation of stiffness and damping coefficients, thereby reducing the degree of damper force non-linearity, and presumally reducing the likelihood of undesirable bistable operation. Alternatively, variable axial land geometry dampers can significantly alter the unbalance response, and in particular, the likelihood of undesirable jump of circular orbit <b>type</b> <b>squeeze</b> film dampers. This thesis investigates the effect of variable land geometry profiles mentioned above on the jump up propensity of such dampers. Theoretical investigation is restricted to n film vertical rigid rotors with end feed {{and the application of}} Short Bearing Approximation. It is found that regardless of unbalance and regardless of the depth, width or shape of the profile, parallel land dampers are least likely to experience jump up to undesirable operation modes. These conflicting conclusions might be accounted for by the reduction in damping, and in fact, the reduction in the pressure. Moroever, the damper model with end feed assumed in this thesis could alter pressure distributions and forces. Thus, these conclusions will need to be qualified for practical dampers with oil hole feed. Finally, the limitation of Short Bearing Approximation for large e region could alter actual unbalance response data...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of an atomic two-level {{system and a}} squeezed vacuum leads to interesting novel effects in atomic dynamics, including line narrowing in resonance fluorescence and absorption spectra, and a suppressed (enhanced) decay of the in-phase and out-of phase component of the atomic polarization. On the experimental side these predictions have so far eluded observation, essentially due {{to the difficulty of}} embedding atoms in a 4 pi squeezed vacuum. In this paper we show how to ``engineer'' a squeezed-bath-type interaction for an effective two-level system. In the simplest example, our two-level atom is represented by the two ground levels of an atom with angular momentum J= 1 / 2 -> J= 1 / 2 transition (a four level system) which is driven by (weak) laser fields and coupled to the vacuum reservoir of radiation modes. Interference between the spontaneous emission channels in optical pumping leads to a <b>squeezed</b> bath <b>type</b> coupling, and thus to symmetry breaking of decay on the Bloch sphere. With this system {{it should be possible to}} observe the effects predicted in the context of squeezed bath - atom interactions. The laser parameters allow one to choose properties of the squeezed bath interaction, such as the (effective) photon number expectation number N and the squeezing phase phi. We present results of a detailed analytical and numerical study. Comment: 24 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
50|$|A {{compound}} <b>squeeze</b> is a <b>type</b> {{of play in}} {{the game}} of contract bridge. In this squeeze one opponent is squeezed such that some form of other squeeze emerges involving either or both players.Usually this term is used to reference a pentagonal squeeze. In this form of squeeze both players guard two suits, and one player guards a third suit. On the play of a card the player guarding three suits must give up one of the shared guards (so as not to provide immediate winners).Now each opponent singly guards one suit, and there is a third suit that is jointly guarded. This means that a double squeeze matrix exists. Note that there are pseudo compound squeezes, where the triply squeezed opponent can select the 'correct' shared suit, such that the entry situation precludes the proper functioning of the double squeeze.|$|R

The significant effects of thermophoresis and Brownian motion have been contained in the model of nanofluid flow. The three governing equations are solved simultaneously via Galerkin method (GM). Comparison with other works indicates that this method is very applicable to solve these problems. The semi analytical analysis is accomplished for different governing parameters in the equations e. g. the squeeze number, Eckert number and Hartmann number.

3000|$|What are the {{implications}} of this type of technological change for the supply of different types of tasks and for wages? Acemoglu and Autor (2011) answer this question formally. Here, I provide the intuition. A key observation is that this form of technological change has the potential to generate the patterns of wage changes and polarization that have been widely discussed in the recent literature (Autor and Dorn forthcoming; Goos et al. 2011; Firpo et al. 2011; Autor et al. 2006, 2008; Goos and Manning 2007); that is, a task-replacing technological change can directly reduce wages of a skill group even as it raises total output. The reason, intuitively, is that a task-replacing technological change <b>squeezes</b> out the <b>type</b> of worker previously performing these tasks, thereby creating “excess supply.” These workers are therefore reallocated to tasks for which they have lower comparative advantage, which pushes their wages down. 10 Simultaneously, by reducing the cost, and hence increasing the intensity of use, of the newly automated tasks, the task-replacing technological change complements each of the remaining tasks performed by labor. These countervailing effects imply that the real wage of the group that is directly displaced by technology in a subset of its original tasks does not have to fall in real terms. But such an outcome is possible—perhaps even likely—in realistic cases. 11 [...]...|$|R
