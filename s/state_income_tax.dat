5|$|After {{a decade}} out of politics, Willis was chosen without {{opposition}} as the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1943. Infighting among the state's Democrats combined with Willis's popular proposal {{to eliminate the}} <b>state</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> carried him to a narrow victory over J. Lyter Donaldson. Willis was opposed by Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the Kentucky General Assembly. The end of World War II in 1945 brought sizable budget surpluses to the state, and disagreements over how to spend the excess funds spilled over into special legislative sessions. Willis was not able to realize his campaign promise of eliminating the <b>state</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> because the legislature expanded the budget far beyond what he proposed. Nevertheless, he was able to forge a record of modest accomplishments, including constructing five tuberculosis hospitals across the state and significantly increasing funding for education. Following his term as governor, he served on various state boards and commissions, but failed in his only attempt to return to elective officea 1952 campaign against Bert T. Combs to return to the Court of Appeals. Willis died on April 1, 1965, and is interred at Frankfort Cemetery in the capital city of Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{followed}} up her {{success in the}} 1985 special session with a push for more higher education funding in the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers obliged by approving an additional $100million for {{higher education in the}} biennial budget. They also approved implementation of a pilot preschool program and the purchase of new reading textbooks, but failed to act on Collins' request for an additional $3.9million to improve the state's vocational education system. Legislators approved calling a referendum on a constitutional amendment– supported by Collins– to make the state superintendent of education an appointive, rather than elective, office. The amendment was defeated by the state's voters in November 1986, despite a Collins-led campaign in favor of it. The increased corporate tax intended {{to cover the cost of}} the increased education budget was, however, inadequate. In 1987, a plan to increase revenue through changes in the <b>state</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> was abandoned when Wallace Wilkinson, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who would go on to succeed Collins, announced his opposition to it.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of <b>state</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation}} in per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

25|$|The states {{effectively}} {{lost the}} ability to raise <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> during the Second World War. In 1942, Canberra invoked its Constitutional taxation power (s. 51 (ii)) and enacted the <b>Income</b> <b>Tax</b> Act and three other statutes to levy a uniform <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> across the country. These acts sought to raise the funds necessary to meet burgeoning wartime expenses and reduce the unequal tax burden between the states by replacing <b>state</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> with a centralised tax system. The legislation could not expressly prohibit <b>state</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> (s. 51(ii) does not curtail the power of states to levy taxes) but the federal government's proposal made localised <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> extremely difficult politically.
