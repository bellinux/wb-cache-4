5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the Australian line of {{communications}} in the sector, engineers from the 16th Field Company later constructed a road using a bulldozer that had to haul itself up the ridge via a <b>steel</b> <b>cable</b> that was manhandled {{up to a point}} just below the ridge over the course of eight days. A light rail system was also established between Barges' Hill and Pearl Ridge.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{notice that}} Geiger {{has set the}} ship to crash into an oil tanker {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin. Alex decides to stop the ship by diving {{underneath}} it and jamming the propeller with a <b>steel</b> <b>cable.</b> Geiger realizes Alex is trying to stop the ship, so he jams the cable winch while Alex is underwater, causing it to break off the ship and free the cable. Geiger takes Annie hostage and escapes with her on a boat from the ship's stern.|$|E
5|$|One unusual {{defensive}} weapon was in use at Kenley on 18 August; the parachute-and-cable. Located {{on the north}} side of the airfield at 18 metre (60 foot) intervals, these were fired vertically by a rocket in salvoes of nine or more. As enemy aircraft came in at low-altitude, the parachute deployed and held a 145-metre (480 foot) long <b>steel</b> <b>cable</b> from an altitude of 180 metres (600 feet). If struck by an aircraft, a second parachute deployed and tangled the device around the victim. If the cable was picked up on the wing, there was a good chance that the aircraft would go down out of control. This device had not been used before 18 August 1940. Also available were barrage balloons with cutting cables capable of tearing off bombers' wings.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s {{the wooden}} floor was replaced, and the {{condition}} of the <b>steel</b> <b>cables</b> was checked, in order to enable vehicular travel over the bridge. At the time the original <b>steel</b> <b>cables</b> were starting to corrode.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the 1981 season, Greer {{underwent}} {{a number of}} renovations including the addition of over 1,200box seats and over 1,000new general admission seats. Two wooden general admission seating areas were replaced by 2,000contoured seats. The original backstop which consisted of several steel poles was upgraded to a <b>steel</b> <b>cable</b> system, eliminating most of the poles. Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance and exit ramps, a new sound system, doubling {{the size of the}} reader panel on the scoreboard, and enlarging the ticket booth. The ballpark's attendance record was set on August 18, 1982, when 22,315people watched the Sounds play against the Columbus Astros.|$|E

25|$|Cable-propelled transit (CPT) is {{a transit}} {{technology}} that moves people in motor-less, engine-less vehicles that are propelled by a <b>steel</b> <b>cable.</b> There are two sub-groups of CPT – gondola lifts and cable cars (railway). Gondola lifts are supported and propelled from above by cables, whereas cable cars are supported and propelled from below by cables.|$|E

25|$|In 1974, French high wire acrobatic {{performer}} Philippe Petit walked {{between the}} towers on a tightrope, {{as shown in}} the documentary film Man on Wire (2008), based on Petit's book To Reach the Clouds: My High Wire Walk Between the Twin Towers (2002) (released in paperback with the title Man on Wire (2008)) and depicted in the feature film The Walk (2015). Petit walked between the towers eight times on a <b>steel</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} {{is a kind}} of {{reinforced concrete}} used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to beams, floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing tendons (generally of high tensile <b>steel</b> <b>cable</b> or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a compressive stress that offsets the tensile stress that the concrete compression member would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.|$|E

25|$|A {{chair lift}} {{is a type}} of aerial lift, which {{consists}} of a continuously circulating <b>steel</b> <b>cable</b> loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers, carrying a series of chairs. They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas, but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions, and increasingly, in urban transport. James Curran, an engineer from the Union Pacific Railroad, invented and built the first chair lift in the world. Known as the Proctor Mountain Ski Lift, it was located in Sun Valley, Idaho.|$|E
25|$|On chain timpani, {{the tension}} rods are {{connected}} by a roller chain {{much like the one}} found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including <b>steel</b> <b>cable.</b> In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it with his foot. Professionals may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.|$|E
