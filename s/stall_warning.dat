25|$|The aircraft, a Convair CV-580 Airtanker, {{serial number}} 129 {{registered}} C-FKFY, manufactured in 1953, was powered by two Allison 501-D22G engines. The aircraft {{was equipped with}} a fire retardant tank and other standard equipment, but did not carry a cockpit voice recorder, flight data recorder, or a <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> device.|$|E
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{investigated}} the crash and released its report on October 6, 1994. In the report {{the crew and}} Atlantic Coast were faulted for the crash. The pilots followed a poorly planned and executed approach, improperly responded to a <b>stall</b> <b>warning,</b> and lacked experience in aircraft equipped with an electronic flight instrument system. Atlantic Coast failed to provide adequate stabilized approach criteria, suitable training simulators, and crew resource management training.|$|E
25|$|By 16:10:32 (122 seconds), the leading-edge devices had stowed {{fully into}} the wing. The speed was , and height {{above the ground}} was , with the {{aircraft}} still held into its usual climb attitude. Key continued to hold the nose-up attitude {{when there was a}} second stick shake and stick push in the following two seconds. A third stick push followed 127 seconds into the flight but no recovery was attempted. One second later, the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> and recovery system was over-ridden by a flight crew member.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{failed to}} {{recognise}} {{the reasons for}} the <b>stall</b> <b>warnings</b> and <b>stall</b> recovery system operation.|$|R
50|$|The pilots did {{not comment}} on the <b>stall</b> <b>warnings</b> and {{apparently}} did not realize that the aircraft was stalled.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{conducted}} the accident investigation and published a final report on February 2, 2010, which found the {{probable cause to}} be the pilots' inappropriate response to the <b>stall</b> <b>warnings.</b>|$|R
25|$|The NTSB {{published}} {{its report}} into the disaster on 13 December 1988. They {{found that the}} preliminary cause of the accident was {{the failure of the}} flight crew to maintain a proper flight path because of the improper instrument scanning by the first officer and the flight crew's response to a perceived fault in the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> system. Contributing features were the lack of company response to documented indications of difficulties in the first officer’s piloting, and the lack of FAA surveillance of AVAir.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} is continued beyond the OM, the commander takes over {{operation of the}} Power Levers. Descent is continued below the DH. A significant reduction in power and significant roll to the left follows, just below 100ft, a third go-around is called by the commander which the co-pilot acknowledges. Coincident with the application of go-around power by the commander, control of the aircraft was lost. The aircraft rolls rapidly to the right beyond the vertical which brought the right wingtip {{into contact with the}} runway surface. The aircraft continued to roll and impacted the runway inverted. The <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> sounded continuously during the final seven seconds of the CVR recording.|$|E
25|$|Data {{from the}} flight data {{recorder}} (FDR) showed that the events leading into the crash began at 9:15:36, when the aircraft hit wake turbulence from the JAL flight {{just in front of}} it. The first officer attempted to stabilize the aircraft with alternating aggressive rudder inputs from left to right. This continued for at least 20seconds, until 9:15:56, when the stress of the first officer's repeated rudder movements caused the lugs that attached the vertical stabilizer and rudder to fail. The stabilizer separated from the aircraft and fell into Jamaica Bay, about one mile north of the main wreckage site. Eight seconds later, the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> sounded on the cockpit voice recorder.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after {{receiving}} clearance to land, the no. 1 engine ignition light illuminated {{in the cockpit}} {{as a result of}} a momentary negative torque condition when the propeller speed levers were advanced to 100% and the power levers were at flight idle. Captain Hillis suspected an engine flame out and eventually decided to execute a missed approach. The speed had decreased to [...] and two momentary <b>stall</b> <b>warnings</b> sounded as the pilot called for max power. The aircraft was in a left turn at [...] and the speed continued to decrease to , followed by <b>stall</b> <b>warnings.</b> The rate of descent then increased rapidly to more than [...] The aircraft eventually struck some trees and crashed about [...] southwest of the runway 5L threshold at 18:34.|$|R
50|$|Weather was 2,400 feet visibility, RVR runway 05L of 3,900 feet, 300 feet broken ceiling, 3,000 feet overcast. According to the CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder), {{the last}} words were from the captain and were 'OH! My God!'. This was {{surrounded}} by the Terrain alarm and <b>stall</b> <b>warnings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The report {{noted that}} taking off after dark, towards the sea, the pilots lacked visual references, and {{recommended}} that for crews of aircraft in which false <b>stall</b> <b>warnings</b> are likely, type rating and later training should include ways to recognise and manage such false warnings when {{close to the}} ground.|$|R
25|$|Although clouds {{extended}} down {{as low as}} 300–400 {{feet above}} the sea surface and surface visibility had fallen to 1,500–2,500 meters at Campeltown Airport, the wind was from the west at 12 knots, and the aircraft was below the freezing level (reported at 6,500 feet). Conditions {{at the time of}} the accident made it possible for ice to form in the carburetors, and carburetor heat was not applied to counteract this possibility, but there was no sign that the engine function was impaired. The switches for pitot and <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> probe heating, and for propeller de‑icing were selected ON. The switches for airframe de-icing, heated windshield and for the ice inspection lamp were selected OFF.|$|E
25|$|These {{systems were}} {{the subject of}} a {{comprehensive}} stall programme, involving some 3,500 stalls being performed by Hawker Siddeley before the matter was considered resolved by the Air Registration Board. The <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> and recovery systems tended to over-react: of ten activations between the Trident entering service and June 1972, only half were genuine, although in the previous 6½ years there had been no false activations when an aircraft was actually in the air. When BEA Trident pilots were questioned informally by one captain, over half of the pilots said that they would disable the protection systems on activation rather than let them recover the aircraft to a safe attitude. Random checks carried out by the airline after the accident showed that this was not the case; 21 captains stated that they had witnessed their co-pilots react correctly to any stall warnings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> and stall {{recovery}} {{systems were}} at {{the centre of the}} inquiry, which examined in some detail their operation and why the flight crew might have over-ridden them. A three-way air pressure valve (part of the stall recovery system) was found to have been one-sixth of a turn out of position, and the locking wire which secured it was missing. Calculations carried out by Hawker Siddeley determined that if the valve was in this position during the flight then the reduction in engine power for the noise abatement procedure could have activated the warning light that indicated low air pressure in the system. The failure indications might have appeared just prior to take-off and could have accounted for the two-minute delay {{at the end of the}} runway. A captain who had flown Papa India on the morning of the accident flight noted no technical problems, and the public inquiry found that the position of the valve had no significant effect on the system.|$|E
5000|$|... 13 October 2010: A Cobham Boeing 717-200, {{operating}} in Qantas livery, {{was close to}} stalling. The flight from Perth to Kalgoorlie had two 'stick shaker' (<b>stall)</b> <b>warnings.</b> They were caused by the pilot entering the wrong weight of the aircraft into the flight management system (FMS), and by the pilots not following correct stall recovery procedures.|$|R
5|$|Just {{under five}} {{seconds after the}} {{undercarriage}} left the ground, the plane's left wing scraped against the asphalt for 110 feet and the stick shaker activated. The crew received six <b>stall</b> <b>warnings,</b> before the jet began banking to the left, then to the right, {{and then to the}} left again, still only several meters above the ground. The aircraft struck two visual approach slope indicator posts, touched down again for approximately 100 feet, before lifting off again and striking an ILS beacon and a water pump house.|$|R
25|$|In {{a further}} near-accident, a Trident 2E, G-AVFH, {{climbing}} away from London Heathrow for Naples in May 1970 experienced what was claimed by its flight crew {{to have been}} a spontaneous uncommanded retraction of the leading-edge slats which was initially unnoticed by any of them. The aircraft's automatic systems sensed the loss of airspeed and lift and issued two <b>stall</b> <b>warnings.</b> Since the crew did not initially detect anything amiss, they disabled the automatic system. While doing so, the first officer noted and immediately remedied the problem by re-extending the retracted slats, and the flight continued normally.|$|R
25|$|An interim {{statement}} {{was published in}} February 2012 in line with European Union regulatory requirements. Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right engine intake air temperature and pressure sensor. The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's power lever than the left engine. The investigation also determined that both engines were developing go-around power at the moment of impact; however both engines were below flight idle power at eight to six seconds before impact. At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller). The <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> horn also sounded repeatedly in the seven seconds prior to impact.|$|E
500|$|Since it was {{no longer}} {{possible}} to abort the takeoff at this point, the crew followed the standard operating procedure for an [...] "engine out" [...] climb. This procedure is to climb at the takeoff safety airspeed (V2) and attitude (angle), as directed by the flight director. The partial electrical power failure (produced by the separation of the left No. 1 engine) meant that neither the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> nor slat retraction indicator was operative. The crew was, therefore, unaware that the slats on the left wing were retracting. This retraction significantly raised the stall speed of the left wing. Thus flying at the takeoff safety airspeed caused the left wing to stall while the right wing was still producing lift, so the aircraft banked sharply and uncontrollably to the left. Later, in simulator recreations of the accident, it was determined that by climbing at a higher airspeed the crash could have been averted.|$|E
500|$|Test {{pilot and}} naval aviator Captain Eric Brown {{evaluated}} the first prototype and found [...] "the controls in cruising flight were very heavy and, in fact, lateral control was so solid that I could barely move the ailerons {{with one hand}} at [...]" [...] In bad weather a pilot circling a carrier while waiting to land would {{have been forced to}} fly such a wide circuit that he could not always keep the carrier in sight. The later prototypes had ailerons boosted by hydraulic power and artificial feel to the stick from a spring, as an interim measure but Brown found [...] "the second prototype was much less the pleasant aircraft to fly as the stick continually hunted either side of neutral and there was no build up of stick force with increase in speed." [...] The Spearfish lacked any sort of <b>stall</b> <b>warning,</b> which would have been a problem in operational use as the stall and approach speeds were fairly close. For the landing, the aircraft proved quite docile.|$|E
5000|$|In a July 2011 {{article in}} Aviation Week, Chesley [...] "Sully" [...] Sullenberger {{was quoted as}} saying the crash was a [...] "seminal accident," [...] and he {{suggested}} that pilots would be able to better handle upsets of this type if they had an indication of the wing's angle of attack (AoA). By contrast, aviation author Captain Bill Palmer has expressed doubts that an angle of attack indicator would have saved AF447, writing [...] "as the PF seemed to be ignoring the more fundamental indicators of pitch and attitude, along with numerous <b>stall</b> <b>warnings,</b> one could question what difference a rarely used AoA gauge would have made".|$|R
2500|$|The D.XVII was {{rolled out}} on 18 October 1918 {{in time for}} the third D-type {{competition}} held at Adlershof that month but was judged inferior to the Fokker V 29, another parasol wing, BMW III powered design. [...] The Roland's wing oscillated in turns and <b>stalled</b> without <b>warning</b> at low speeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{negative}} effects (i.e. a <b>stall</b> without much <b>warning)</b> of this design are most pronounced on 15-meter wingspan without winglets. These characteristics caused the relative unpopularity of this glider and only 114 aircraft were produced (partially because the moulds were later destroyed {{in a factory}} fire). Later versions with 17 and 18 m wingspan offer much better low-speed handling.|$|R
500|$|On January 7, 1994, United Express Flight 6291 was a BAe Jetstream 41 being {{operated}} by Atlantic Coast Airlines; {{it was on}} approach to runway 28L when it entered into a stall at [...] above runway level. The aircraft collided with a stand of trees and came to rest inside a commercial building [...] short of the runway and burst into flames. The accident killed two of three crewmembers and five of nine passengers. The probable cause was attributed to [...] "(1) An aerodynamic stall that occurred when the flight crew allowed the airspeed to decay to stall speed following a very poorly planned and executed approach characterized by an absence of procedural discipline; (2) Improper pilot response to the <b>stall</b> <b>warning,</b> including failure to advance the power levers to maximum, and inappropriately raising the flaps; (3) Flight crew experience in 'glass cockpit' automated aircraft, aircraft type and in seat position, a situation exacerbated by a side letter of agreement between {{the company and its}} pilots; and (4) the company's failure to provide adequate stabilized approach criteria, and the FAA's failure to require such criteria.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, A MK26 80% scale Spitfire {{crashed in}} Adelaide, AUS. The pilot, {{as the only}} {{passenger}} in the aircraft, {{died as a result}} of the accident. Official findings show pilot error as the main contributor of the accident, however, the ATSB report: http://www.atsb.gov.au/media/4548260/ao-2013-051_final.pdf stated: “The aircraft was prone to aerodynamically stall with little or no aerodynamic precursors and it was not fitted with a <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> device, increasing the risk of inadvertent stall.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{final report}} found that {{following}} the uncommanded autofeather of engine number 2 the pilot flying reduced power on and subsequently shut down the operative engine number 1. The flight crew failed to perform the failure identification procedure and did not comply with standard operating procedures resulting in the pilot flying’s confusion regarding the identification {{and nature of the}} propulsion system malfunction. The autofeathering was caused by compromised soldering joints in the auto feather unit. During the initial stages of the take-off roll the flight crew did not reject the take off when the automatic take off power control system ARM pushbutton did not light, and TransAsia did not have a clear requirement to do so. The loss of engine power during the initial climb and inappropriate flight control inputs by the pilot flying generated <b>stall</b> <b>warnings</b> and activation of the stick pusher to which the crew did not respond in a timely and effective manner. The loss of power from both engines was not detected and corrected by the crew in time and the aircraft stalled during the attempted restart at an altitude from which they could not recover. Ineffective flight crew coordination, communication, and threat and error management compromised the safety of the flight. The crew failed to obtain relevant data from each other regarding the status of both engines. The pilot flying did not appropriately respond to input from the pilot monitoring.|$|R
40|$|Instrumentation {{interfacing}} frequently {{requires the}} linking of intelligent systems together, {{as well as}} requiring the link itself to be intelligent. The airborne instrumentation computer system (AICS) was developed to address this requirement. Its small size, approximately 254 by 133 by 140 mm (10 by 51 / 4 by 51 / 2 in), standard bus, and modular board configuration give it the ability to solve instrumentation interfacing and computation problems without forcing a redesign of the entire unit. This system has been used on the F- 15 aircraft digital electronic engine control (DEEC) and its follow on engine model derivative (EMD) project and in an OV- 1 C Mohawk aircraft <b>stall</b> speed <b>warning</b> system. The AICS is presently undergoing configuration for use on an F- 104 pace aircraft and on the advanced fighter technology integration (AFTI) F- 111 aircraft...|$|R

2500|$|Initial {{analysis}} from David Learmount, a Flight International editor, was that [...] "The aircraft had either a total or severe power loss and this occurred very {{late in the}} final approach because the pilot {{did not have time}} to tell air traffic control or passengers."

2500|$|The 1966 model saw great {{changes to}} the 150 design. The tailfin was swept back 35 degrees to match the styling of the Cessna 172 and other models. The cabin doors were made 23% wider, new brakes were brought in and the 6.00×6 tires were made standard. The {{previously}} manual flaps were now electrically actuated through a panel-mounted flap switch. The old electric <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> system was replaced with a pneumatic-type. The baggage compartment was enlarged by 50%. A total of 3087 of the newly styled [...] "F" [...] models were produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{autopilot}} {{reached the}} limits of its programming and disengaged. After checking their circuit breakers {{for the source of}} the warnings, the crew then reduced thrust to lower the speed. This immediately triggered the 757's stick-shaker <b>stall</b> alert, <b>warning</b> the confused pilots that the aircraft was flying dangerously slow, seconds after it was warning them that the speed was too high. The co-pilot and the relief pilot Muhlis Evrenesoğlu both seemed to recognise the approaching stall and tried to tell the captain, but did not intervene directly, possibly out of deference to the captain's age and experience. The captain then tried to recover from the stall by increasing the plane's thrust to full, but the plane was still in a nose up attitude, preventing the engines from receiving adequate airflow to match the increase in thrust. The left engine flamed out, which caused the right engine, still at full power, to throw the aircraft into a spin. Moments later, the plane inverted. At 11:47p.m., the Ground Proximity Warning System sounded an audio warning, and eight seconds later the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers were killed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{accident}} {{started at}} 12:40:26 WST {{when one of}} the aircraft’s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRU) started providing incorrect data to the flight computer. In response to the anomalous data, the autopilot disengaged automatically, and a few seconds later, the pilots received electronic messages on the aircraft ECAM, warning them of an irregularity with the autopilot and inertial reference systems, and aural <b>stall</b> and overspeed <b>warnings.</b> During this time, the pilot took control of the aircraft, increasing the altitude to 37,180 ft. The autopilot was then re-engaged and the aircraft started to return to the prior selected flight level. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew after about 15 seconds and would remain disengaged {{for the remainder of the}} flight.|$|R
2500|$|Penalty (1 or 2 points): One or {{two points}} can be awarded by the referee to the {{opponent}} for various penalty situations.
