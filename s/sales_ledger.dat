40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore {{possibilities}} of modelling late payment times of invoices in business-to-business sales process using real data of <b>sales</b> <b>ledgers.</b> Survival analysis and a novel ensemble method of Random Survival Forests {{is applied to the}} right-censored data of late invoices. A theoretical overview of Random Survival Forests is given and concordance index as a performance measure for survival models is explained. A comprehensive overview of data preprocessing and deriving payment times from <b>sales</b> <b>ledgers</b> is presented. We propose two separate models, for first-time debtors and for repeated debtors, and explore the effect of different predictors in a model. Random Survival Forests prove to have advantages over Cox Proportional Hazards model as there are no underlying assumptions that need to be taken into consideration. Overall, it is concluded that Random Survival Forests model which additionally uses historical payment behaviour of debtors, performs the best in ranking payment times of late invoices...|$|R

Traditional modular systems have separate General, Purchase and <b>Sales</b> <b>Ledgers</b> which reflect times when accountants wrote information into large paper books or ledgers. Balances on control accounts were copied from one book to another, so that a full set of accounts could be completed and as an additional process control accounts were reconciled.

40|$|The text {{analyses}} {{the creative}} expression of London’s couturiers; {{the industry and}} their client base between 1947 and 1957. It also – and without precedent - identifies the significance of museological processes of acquisition and the interpretation of surviving clothing as material evidence. The author thus intervenes within several disciplines including historiography, fashion history, industry, material culture and museology. Primary research processes involved collaboration with Lindsay Evans Robertson (formerly designer with couturier John Cavanagh) who provided detailed technical information. Analysis of museum accession documentation permitted a critical differentiation to be made between the dress donated by clients (evidence of commercially successful designs) and those presented by a couturier (as exemplars). Investigation of international dress collections, couturiers paper archives, autobiographies and high fashion magazines provided insight into how representative the surviving clothes are of each couturiers output; self and mediated interpretations of their work and sited surviving garments within a fashion context. The text also brings to the fore work of couturiers eclipsed within fashion history and exhibitions. Research into Lachasse’s <b>sales</b> <b>ledgers</b> resulted in the unequivocal re-dating of a suit (for book and exhibition) from c 1947 to 1954 and revealed evidence of the client’s purchasing habits {{over a period of}} years and prices charged.

A sheep-shear makers, Burgon & Ball, has records from its commencement in the 1860s; these include much relating to its Australian trade. The firm also had an agency {{for the sale of}} bicycles with rubber tyres in the eighteen-nineties and cars early in this century. The technical drawing office records of the Yorkshire Engine Company consist of engine plans and orders and there is also a series of photographs of many engines made by the firm. A selected series of over seventy <b>sales</b> <b>ledgers</b> of Arthur Balfour's (now Balfour Darwin's) illustrates the growth of the firm's trade in steel throughout the world from 1865 to about 1948. Spear & Jackson, tool makers, have also deposited some records. The business of an eighteenth-century hardware (cutlery) merchant is represented by stock and account books of Walter Oborne of Sheffield and subsequently of Ravenfield. Cutlery manufacturing firms, mainly of the nineteenth century, are represented by small deposits of Thomas Nowill & Co., Christopher Johnson & Co., and Ibbotson Bros., and by some orders and correspondence of Joseph Rodgers & Sons rescued from destruction in the 1930s. Reference has already been made to the Sheffield Smelting Company's extensive records. From Thurlstone, bordering on the textile district, have come records of a peculiar trade, the making of hair-cloth and bagging for oil presses, from about 1790-1820s; this archive contains a series of letters from an emigrant to Pittsburg, written to his relatives in Yorkshire.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, even as Calder’s {{international}} acclaim was growing, his works were still not highly sought after, {{and when they}} sold, it was often for relatively little money. A copy of a Pierre Matisse <b>sales</b> <b>ledger</b> in the foundation’s files shows {{that only a few}} pieces in the 1941 show found buyers, one of whom, Solomon R. Guggenheim, paid only $233.34 (about $3,500 in 2014 dollars) for a work. The Museum of Modern Art had bought its first Calder in 1934 for $60, after talking Calder down from $100. In 2010, his metal mobile Untitled (Autumn Leaves), sold at Sotheby's New York for $3.7 million. Another mobile brought $6.35 million at Christie's later that year. Also at Christie's, a standing mobile called Lily of Force (1945), which was expected to sell for $8 to $12 million, was bought for $18.5 million in 2012. Calder’s 7 1/2-foot-long hanging mobile Poisson volant (Flying Fish) (1957) fetched $25.9 million, setting an auction record for the sculptor at Christie's New York in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{published}} sources have contained errors {{on the production}} numbers of the Arnolt-Bristol.

As a result, European sales were not included. One result is that several sources claim only three coupes were built, when there were in fact six: one was sold in France and the other two in Spain (the chassis numbers of all of which are recorded in the Bristol Owner's Club registry). At the Paris Auto Show in 1955, an up-and-coming actor, Lee Marvin, saw the Arnolt-Bristol coupe and purchased it. In later years, Marvin would win the Oscar for Best Actor, and after his death, his ultra-rare Arnolt-Bristol Coupe (the only Arnolt ever built with the coved front fenders that would inspire the Corvette designers) sold at auction for $451,000.|$|E

A model 4/75 was also supplied to the EELM (later Baric) Bureau subsidiary and installed at Winsford, Cheshire as the hardware for a bureau-developed commercial system for interactive use by bureau customers. Although several multi-user commercial packages (e.g. <b>sales</b> and purchase <b>ledger</b> systems) were developed and trialled with customers, this was not commercially successful, and the service was soon withdrawn.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Cash {{management}} {{means the}} management of liquidity {{in order to meet}} their day-to-day commitment. The result of poor focus on cash management often means that the financial assets are bound. The management of liquidity is not something new but cash management is a modern way of doing that. Cash management is a very broad subject which involves many factors, this paper will focus on examine how the liquidity is managed in Jonsons Byggnads AB, in order to improve the liquidity through cash management thinking. Jonsons Byggnads AB is a local construction firm located in Jönköping. This paper will examine the firm’s liquidity with focus on payment/payout routines, liquidity management, short-term financing and the connection between accounts receivables and payables.   Purpose: The purpose is to examine Jonsons bygg’s liquidity today in order to later recognize which factors within cash management that can strengthen the liquidity position for Jonsons Byggnads AB. Method: This is a qualitative study based examining the liquidity management for Jonsons Byggnads AB. The collection of the data and information was gathered by interviews, observations and balance sheet/income statement (Jonsons Byggnads AB). The interviews were done with Fadi Babil (The owner of Jonsons Byggnads AB) and two other staff members, which have chosen to be anonymous. Fadil Sadiku (Financial advisor at Swedbank) have also been interviewed in order to gather information about various products Swedbank offers to improve the liquidity for Jonsons Byggnads AB. Conclusion: The result of this study showed us that Jonsons Byggnads AB have good liquidity position even though the company does not have anyone employed to manage the liquidity. Even though Jonsons bygg’s liquidity position is healthy, there are some areas that can be improved. Improvements in the payment/payout routines can be done by computerizing the <b>sales</b> <b>ledger</b> system completely and therefore be more efficient and profitable. Connecting the invoices to an account with higher interest is also an approach to be more profitable. Since the accounts being used today have almost no interest. ...|$|E
40|$|Guy Belloncle is Professor of Sociology at the University of Tours in France. He is {{consultant}} sociologist to many development projects, both {{governmental and}} non-governmental, which promote farmers organizations. After {{the failure of}} many state-controlled cooperatives during the 1970 s, the 1980 s saw thousands of associations and village groups of all kinds spring into being, mainly on the initiative of local leaders (the educated unemployed or former public servants) but with significant financial backing from northern NGOs. Many believed that where state-run organizations had failed, these new organizations would succeed in getting the economy on its feet again. But all too soon there was a chorus of condemnation against corruption and apathy, and this could soon have turned into a death knell for these organizations. In issue 10 of 'La lettre du reseau GAO' (Groups, Village Associations and Farmers Organizations), J P Prodhomme asks with concern: 'What would be the alternative if failure were inevitable?' This is a crisis which now demands immediate action. Farmers organizations must become fully autonomous enterprises with strict accounting systems and must aim to achieve a dual capitalization - financial and intellectual, each supporting the other. The absence of coherent accounting systems is all too obvious: most organizations do not even have a simple ledger. It is a common problem, but one which always receives the same explanation: accountancy is not possible because the people are illiterate. This simply is not true any more. African villages which {{do not have a}} core of educated young people are rare these days. They have either been to school, or have learned from state or privately-run native language literacy campaigns, or possibly from Koranic schools where children are taught to write their native language using Arabic script. Contrary to the usual prejudice, Africa is more likely soon to be over-literate than illiterate if one judges by the skills used by those who have mastered writing a language, whatever it may be. I have recently seen proof of this in the Central African Republic. In order to make them self-sufficient, the National Pastoralism Development Project has for five years attempted to bring literacy to the leaders of the cattle owner groups. But the pastoralists of Mbororo of Central Africa are far from illiterate. This is one of the areas where the Fulfude language, written in Arabic characters, is particularly widespread. Two weeks were therefore long enough to train the first team of managers; one week for them to learn how to make the change from the Arabic to the Latin alphabet, and one week to train the staff who would {{be in charge of the}} <b>sales</b> and credit <b>ledgers</b> and the files for the stocks of medicines. The staff who would deal with the cash side (cash books, occasional stock-taking, accounts three times a year done by histograms - stock, cash and credit sales, so that everyone can come and check out the 'wealth' of the group) required similar training. It cannot be said strongly enough: illiteracy as a bar to strict accounting practice is just an excuse which no-one should believe any more, especially the donor NGOs. So the problem must lie elsewhere. It has to do with the total lack of accountancy training among the promoters (native or foreign) of the current peasant groups, and so these never address the subject for fear of showing up their own ignorance. There is another cause - the inability of peasant leaders to follow through what is in effect a real cultural revolution which means the separation of the property of the enterprise (however much that is village-led) from the village itself. - It is now a matter of urgency to find accountants with sufficient flexibility of thought and practice to create 'customized' accountancy systems for each situation. - It is now a matter of urgency to promote the most expert peasant accountants into auditors to check village accounts. - It is now a matter of urgency for the NGOs to understand that their apathy is frankly criminal since it leads to a superfluity of money fouling up village systems rather than helping maximize profits in order to reinvest. I shall never forget the remark of one farmer 'wariyesitane', which being translated means 'Money is the very devil'. More of Guy Belloncle's thoughts on the subject can be found in his book Applied anthropology and development associations in Sahelian Africa 1960 - 1990, available from the College coopératif, 1 rue du 11 november, 92120 Montrouge, FRANCE The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTA.
