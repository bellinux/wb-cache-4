500|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. <b>Stress</b> <b>fractures</b> and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. Allosaurus was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for <b>stress</b> <b>fractures,</b> they found that Allosaurus had a significantly greater number of <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> than Albertosaurus, Ornithomimus or Archaeornithomimus. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain <b>stress</b> <b>fractures.</b> Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have <b>stress</b> <b>fractures.</b> The <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> in the foot bones [...] "were distributed to the proximal phalanges" [...] and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in [...] "statistically indistinguishable" [...] numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined Allosaurus fossils indicates an origin for the <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> and avulsion injuries in Allosaurus provide evidence for [...] "very active" [...] predation-based rather than scavenging diets.|$|R

30|$|<b>Stress</b> <b>fractures</b> {{occur in}} normal bones of healthy people without any {{particular}} trauma, and their types and locations depend on age {{and degree of}} activity. Regarding the mechanisms involved, Ingersoll [8] suggested that <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> occur in normal bones when fine fractures accumulate due to repetitive mechanical stimuli or external forces {{beyond the limits of}} skeletal maintenance. Belkin [9] reported bone resorption occurs and progresses as a reaction to stress and leads to fine fractures followed by complete fractures, and also reported that the frequency of <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> is increasing among athletes. However, Haider and Storey [10] advised that in patients with rheumatoid arthritis <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> were caused by systemic osteoporosis. Subsequently, <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> caused by long-standing rheumatoid arthritis have been well described. In addition, osteoporosis and corticosteroid therapy, which has the side effect of bone loss, are other known causes of <b>stress</b> <b>fractures.</b>|$|R
5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game.

5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior.

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1996 regular season, the Nebraska Cornhuskers boasted the No. 4 rushing offense in Division I-A college football, averaging 292 rushing yards per game and 422 overall yards per game.

Ahman Green, who led the Nebraska offense with 155 carries, 917 rushing yards, and seven touchdowns, suffered a <b>stress</b> <b>fracture</b> in his foot during the second-to-last Nebraska regular-season game. The No. 2 rusher, DeAngelo Evans, had 776 rushing yards and a team-high 14 rushing touchdowns, but was limited by a groin injury.
