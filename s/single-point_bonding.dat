40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{electric shock}} hazard due to induced sheath voltages in 110 kV power cables. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to find an optimal configuration of the power cable system, taking into account electric shock hazard and ability of the system to transfer maximal power. A computer simulations on a computer model of the local power system, comprising high voltage power cables, were carried out. This model enables to analyse various configurations of the metallic cable sheaths bonding and earthing (<b>single-point</b> <b>bonding,</b> both-ends bonding, cross-bonding) and their impact on induced voltages in the cable sheaths. The analysis presented in the paper shows, that it is possible to find an optimal configuration of the complicated power cable system, in terms of electric shock hazard, maximal power transfer as well as economic aspects...|$|E
40|$|Proposal of {{abstract}} for LEB 99, Snowmass, Colorado, 20 - 24 September 1999 The ALICE Inner Tracker (ITS) silicon strip layers will use kapton/aluminium microcables (12 / 14 um thickness) exclusively for all interconnections {{to and from}} the front-end chips and hybrids, completely eliminating traditional wirebonding. Benefits are increased robustness and an extra degree of dimensional freedom. Utilising a low-power, low temperature and low-force (10 - 15 grams) <b>single-point</b> TAB <b>bonding</b> process, aluminium traces are directly bonded through bonding windows in the kapton foil to bond pads on the chips and the hybrid. The same technique is also used to interconnect these microcables to create multi-layer bus structures with "bonded via's". A double-sided strip detector using prototype cables has been installed in the NA 57 experiment in 1998...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe high-spin {{electronic}} {{states for}} lithium, sodium, and potassium four-atom clusters were studied. In particular, we performed coupled cluster geometry optimization of the quintet state in tetrahedral geometry. The quintet state {{of these systems}} is characterized by having all the valence electron unpaired, giving rise to the so-called no-pair <b>bonding.</b> <b>Single-point</b> full configuration interaction computations on the equilibrium geometries for the various clusters are also presented. The analysis of the valence orbitals in a localized representation confirms {{the importance of the}} p atomic orbitals to explain this unusual type of bond...|$|R
