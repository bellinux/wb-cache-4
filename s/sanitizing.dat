40|$|A plastic tubing system {{operated}} under vacuum is usually {{used to collect}} sap from maple trees during spring time to produce maple syrup. This system is commonly <b>sanitized</b> with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove microbial contamination colonizing the system during the sugar season. Questions have been raised whether IPA would contribute to the leaching of plastic residues in maple sap and syrup coming from <b>sanitized</b> systems. First, an extraction experiment was performed in the lab on commercial plastic tubing materials that were submitted to IPA under harsh conditions. The results of the GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of many compounds that served has target for further tests. Secondly, tests were done on early and mid-season maple sap and syrup coming from many sugarbushes using IPA or not to determine potential concentrations of plastic residues. Results obtained from sap and syrup samples showed that no quantifiable (< 1 – 75 μg/L) concentration of any plastic molecules tested was determined in all samples coming from IPA treated or not treated systems. However, some samples of first sap run used as a rinse solution to be discarded before the season start and that were coming from non <b>sanitized</b> or IPA <b>sanitized</b> systems, showed quantifiable concentrations of chemical residue such as ultraviolet protector (octabenzone). These results show that IPA can be safely used to <b>sanitize</b> maple sap collection system {{in regards to the}} leaching of plastic residues in maple sap and syrup and reinforced the need to thoroughly rinse the tubing system {{at the beginning of the}} season for both <b>sanitized</b> and non <b>sanitized</b> systems...|$|R

25|$|Some non-eusocial insects also {{sanitize}} their nests: {{the wood}} cockroach (Cryptocercus punctulatus) commonly defecates within the nest (this species nests in decaying wood, which often {{has a high}} microbe density), and faeces {{have been found to}} have antifungal activity against M. anisopliae, possibly mediated by microbes. The galleries constructed within spruce trees by spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) are under threat from multiple species of fungus which reduce spruce beetle fitness. Upon fungal invasion, adults begin secreting orally and analysis of these secretions has revealed bacteria with antifungal activity; faecal pellets are used to quarantine off fungally-infested sections of the gallery. A waste management strategy exists in some group living and subsocial species, such as the subsocial De Geer's short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus muticus). 5–10 minutes after defecating and returning to her eggs, A. muticus females return to the fecal pellets and removes them out of the chamber — note no other items are removed from the chamber. Upon discovering a carcass, subsocial N. vespilloides parents upregulate the anitmicrobial activity of their anal exudates and smear them over the carcass - thus <b>sanitizing</b> the resource their brood will soon feast on.|$|E
