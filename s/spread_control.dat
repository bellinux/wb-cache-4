5000|$|He was {{the first}} and the {{youngest}} native East and Central African epidemiologist in the field of tropical medicine and infectious diseases—both as researcher and a clinical practitioner in the <b>spread,</b> <b>control,</b> and eradication of infectious agents. His pioneering parasitological epidemiology medical research and resultant modalities have received global acclaim and application. He was a key champion of indigenous medical research and the dissemination of homegrown scientific medical information—such as, new clinical modalities, field studies and discoveries, etc.—via cooperation with indigenous and overseas scholarly reviewed publications, medical panels, and scientific proceedings. He foresaw this informational approach as an effective and dynamic forum for interchange of knowledge and viewpoints amongst various indigenous healthcare communities and their counterparts abroad; a mechanism for the documentation and dissemination of vital information on local diseases within the East and Central African region. His epidemiological medical research of the East African leishmaniasis or kala-azar (black fever) has bred critical knowledge for worldwide use in both private and public health sectors, and civil societies. [...] In 1964 he attended, as an invited expert panelist, the XII International Congress of Entomology at London, United Kingdom.|$|E

In this paper, we present a new SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) rumor spreading model with hesitating mechanism.

The global stability of the rumor-free equilibrium and the permanence are proved in detail, and the global attractivity of the rumor-prevailing equilibrium is proved by using a monotone iterative technique. Furthermore, the modified model with feedback mechanism on social networks is introduced. The feedback mechanism cannot change the basic reproductive number but it can reduce the continuous level {{and the spread of}} rumor. Numerical simulations confirm the analytical results.|$|R

The use of new feedback gains alone following a failure can provide significantly improved recovery as long as the control elements remain within their travel limits and as long as uncertainty about the failure identity is properly handled. The use of the feed-forward trim solution in conjunction with redesigned feedback gains allows recovery to take place even when significant control saturation occurs...|$|E

We show that malicious attacks are hard to achieve and their impacts are scenario dependent. In contrast, rational attackers always obtain a significant benefit.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the KPC-type carbapenem-hydrolysing b-lactamase, extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) and class 1 integrons among nosocomial Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: MICs were determined and isolates were screened for ESBLs, metallo-b-lactamases (MBLs) and class A carbapenemase-producing phenotypes. The main b-lactamases resistance genes (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaKPC, blaIMP and blaVIM) and class 1 integrons were detected by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. The genetic relatedness of isolates was determined by PFGE. Results: All K. pneumoniae isolates were positive for ESBL and class A carbapenemase production and negative for MBL production. All isolates were resistant to all b-lactam antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, being susceptible only to tigecycline and polymyxin B. The blaKPC- 2, blaCTX-M- 1, blaCTX-M- 2, blaCTX-M- 8 and blaSHV- 11 genes were detected. PFGE analysis revealed two clonal types among KPC-producing isolates, both identified in the same hospital.
