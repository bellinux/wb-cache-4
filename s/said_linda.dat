500|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{much of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. Their addictions had begun to affect their performances and matters seemed to only be getting worse, according to many involved. The clinic was deemed a [...] "joke" [...] and a [...] "nuthouse" [...] by Payne and Red Dog, and was later described {{as more of a}} psychiatric ward, as true rehabilitation clinics were several years away. All involved (including Duane) struggled to keep off the substance in the ensuing days. Despite this, Duane fueled the band's passion to get better and end their addictions: [...] "Duane was so happy and full of positive energy. He was always like that unless he was just totally wasted. He was the leader, the great soul, and he kept saying, 'We are on a mission and it's time for this thing to happen,'" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda</b> Oakley. [...] "He was moving forward, and that energized everyone else. Everyone fed off of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, I {{think you}} had; I'm sure mamma would break down there,' <b>said</b> <b>Linda.</b> 'Mamma, I'm {{sure you would}} never get over the {{official}} priggism.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's {{too late}} to keep Charley in bed,' <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> 'for I see him coming along the road now with a towel; he's been bathing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>Linda</b> Tressel," [...] <b>said</b> poor <b>Linda.</b> She saw at {{a glance}} that she herself would not have known Herr Molk, whom she had never before met without his hat, and she {{perceived}} also {{that he had not}} recognised her.|$|R
2500|$|Around this time, Paul {{fell into}} a deep {{depression}} due to the Beatles' pending break-up. He would spend days in bed and drink excessively, {{not knowing what to do}} with his life. McCartney later <b>said</b> that <b>Linda</b> helped him pull out of that emotional crisis by praising his work as a songwriter and persuading him to continue writing and recording: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is in prison!" [...] <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> {{this with}} a little hysteric scream. Then she began to sob and cry, and turned her back to Tetchen and hid {{her face in her}} hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, if you please, I {{will go to}} bed," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> who was by {{no means}} sorry to escape the {{necessity}} of returning to the parlour.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is welcome}} to the rooms if he wants them," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda.</b> [...] "He is {{welcome to the}} whole house {{if you choose to}} give it to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> {{through her}} clenched teeth. [...] "Is he not? Well, then, look to it; because father has been walking about with a loaded gun at night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{are going}} to Mr. Searle's,' <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> quietly; 'this is the street I think. I got the {{directions}} how to find it at the hotel. He is a respectable lawyer, I am told.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We are {{grateful}} for the generosity of Bill Stone and his SS&C executive team and their support in fostering the investment accounting field in USI's nationally-competitive accounting program," [...] <b>said</b> USI resident <b>Linda</b> L. M. Bennett.|$|R
5000|$|Abbygale Williamson Arenas (born November 17, 1974, in Angeles City) is {{a former}} model from the Philippines. She is 5'9" [...] and is <b>said</b> to {{resemble}} <b>Linda</b> Evangelista. She is now a freelance make-up artist. She is married to photographer Jun de Leon.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose, Charley, you'll {{have to make}} {{an entry}} about that barge on Monday morning, won't you?' <b>said</b> <b>Linda.</b> 'Mind you put in it how {{beautiful}} I looked sailing through the arch.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who told me? The {{magistrate}} {{you were}} taken to; Herr Molk told me himself," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> almost happily. That smile upon {{his face had}} in some way vanquished her feeling of jealousy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> indignantly. What had she {{to do with}} Mary Magdalene? The {{reality of}} her {{position}} then came upon her, and not the facts of that position which she had for a moment almost endeavoured to simulate.|$|E
5000|$|Around this time, Paul {{fell into}} a deep {{depression}} due to the Beatles' pending break-up. He would spend days in bed and drink excessively, {{not knowing what to do}} with his life. [...] "I nearly had a breakdown," [...] he said. [...] "I was going crazy." [...] Sounes writes that [...] "McCartney sank into whisky-soaked oblivion, and only Linda knew how to save him." [...] McCartney later <b>said</b> that <b>Linda</b> helped him pull out of that emotional crisis by praising his work as a songwriter and convincing him to continue writing and recording: ...|$|R
5000|$|Event 1 - Duel:Linda was {{up against}} Zodiac and {{originally}} stay on the duel scoring herself five points but referee John Anderson came in after Linda talked to John Fashanu saying that the contender had to attack or get disqualified but <b>said</b> that <b>Linda</b> only just attacked and allowed her to keep the five points. Jackie {{was up against}} Falcon and stayed on the duel scoring herself five points. Glenn was up against Hunter who knocked him off 2.2 seconds in and kept Glenn from scoring while Chris was up against Saracen who knocked him off three seconds in and kept him from scoring.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, {{it is the}} manner in which the all-wise Creator has thought fit to make the weaker vessel subject to the {{stronger}} one." [...] <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> nothing, but thought that that old town-clerk was not a vessel strong enough to hold her in subjection. [...] "It is this which a woman should bring home to herself, Linda, when she first thinks of marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gertrude,' at last <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> when Gertrude {{thought that}} the subject had been put to rest at any rate for that night, 'don't you think mamma would be pleased if she knew that you had engaged {{yourself}} to Harry Norman?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed I am not,' <b>said</b> <b>Linda.</b> 'I {{liked him}} very well till he drank three huge glasses of gin-and-water last night, but I never can fancy him after that. You can't conceive, Alaric, what the drawing-room smelt like. I suppose he'll do the same every evening.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is timid," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> with {{a little}} burst of laughter. [...] "People notice her fair hair as she goes along with us. They call out after her, 'Look at the Rubia! Look at the Rubiacita!' They call out in the streets. She is timid." ...|$|E
5000|$|Linda was {{immediately}} {{impressed with the}} sound Duncan had achieved on the all-acoustic CD, and really liked the trio's 3-part vocals. One of the songs Bobby played was his own Into The Arms Of Love, and Linda started singing a pretty harmony part under her breath. Bobby asked if she would sing that part on the CD and <b>Linda</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Sure." [...] That was it.|$|R
2500|$|With his {{homemade}} {{approach to}} recording, McCartney eschewed the musical sophistication that had distinguished the Beatles' work with producer George Martin, particularly the band's 1969 album Abbey Road, and instead {{returned to the}} [...] "as nature intended" [...] ethos of Get Back. McCartney played all the musical instruments on the album – from acoustic and electric guitars and bass to keyboards, drums and various percussion instruments – with Linda supplying backing vocals on some songs, most noticeably on [...] "Man We Was Lonely". She also contributed the breathing and animal-like sounds, with McCartney, on the album-closing [...] "Kreen-Akrore". McCartney has <b>said</b> that <b>Linda</b> was instrumental in bolstering his spirits and confidence during the making of McCartney.|$|R
5000|$|Variety {{described}} {{the film as}} having [...] "deliciously vulgar dialog and well-directed confrontation scenes." [...] TV Guide awarded the film one star and <b>said</b> of star <b>Linda</b> Blair [...] "This is Blair's best performance since THE EXORCIST (1973), but that's not saying much." [...] Carol J. Clover in Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film found Linda Blair unconvincing {{in her role as}} a female avenger.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do love him," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda.</b> Using {{the moment}} for {{reflection}} allowed to her as best she could, she thought that she saw the best means of escape in this avowal. Surely her aunt would not press her to marry one man when she had declared that she loved another.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Charlotte," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> [...] "he {{has done}} me the only favour that I could accept at his hands. It {{is true that}} I have done that which, had he been a man, would have {{prevented}} him from seeking to make me his wife. All that is true. I own it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Katie's perverse wickedness on {{this point}} was very nearly giving rise to another contest between the sisters. Linda's common sense, however, prevailed, and giving up the point of Harry's prowess, she succeeded at last in getting Katie into bed. 'You know mamma will be so angry if she hears us,' <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> 'and I am sure you will be ill to-morrow.' ...|$|E
2500|$|McMahon's husband, Vince McMahon, did not {{actively}} campaign for his spouse, causing some {{to wonder if}} Linda was purposely distancing herself from him. In February 2010, <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> Vince was too busy [...] "running the company" [...] as both chairman and CEO to campaign, but said he may be involved “down the road”. Several speculators predicted that if he campaigned with her, his direct association with controversial wrestling skits would be a “major liability”.|$|R
40|$|The {{reading and}} study of ethnic {{minority}} writing repeatedly confront {{the problem of}} representation, and raise many questions in the debate between essentialism and social construction and implications for the issues of appropriation of voice and agency. Using examples from Italian-Canadian writers and other minority groups in Canada this paper explores these questions and implications referring to the critical work of Sneja Gunew, Edward <b>Said,</b> Francesco Loriggio, <b>Linda</b> Hutcheon and Frank Lentricchia...|$|R
5000|$|BASH was the {{originally}} thought up by Linda Macfarlane, Canberra and Karen Garnett, Sydney. <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> that the tango crowd from Canberra wanted {{to dance with}} more people, and Karen from Sydney said the same about the Sydney scene. They both thought, why not bring the two crowds together? Figuring that a place geographically {{right in the middle}} would be ideal, Linda found Bundanoon as the perfect place. Thus BASH was born.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is in prison. I {{know he is}} in prison," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda.</b> [...] "I wish I {{were there}} too;--so I do, or dead. I'd rather be dead." [...] Then Madame Staubach, having perhaps heard the lock {{of the front door}} when it was closed, came into the kitchen. [...] "Linda," [...] she said, [...] "I am waiting for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{house is}} as much mine as yours," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> sullenly. And she too, in saying this, had not known what she meant to say, or what she ought to have said. Her aunt had alluded to the house, and there seemed to her, in her distress, to be {{something}} in that on which she could hang a word.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Alaric, {{surely you}} would not {{interfere}} with Harry,' <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> whose humble, innocent heart thought still of nothing but the merits of her sister; and then, remembering {{that it was necessary}} that she should admit nothing on Gertrude's behalf, she entered her little protest against the assumption that her sister acknowledged Norman for her lover. 'That is, {{you would not}} do so, if there were anything in it.' ...|$|E

2500|$|The gravestone, {{designed}} by North Snohomish County sculptor Kirk McLean, {{is a tribute}} to Lee and Hutton. Its two twisting rectangles of charcoal granite join at the bottom and pull apart at the top. [...] "It represents Eliza and Brandon, the two of them, and how the tragedy of his death separated their mortal life together", <b>said</b> his mother, <b>Linda</b> Lee Cadwell, who described her son, like his father before him, as a poetic, romantic person.|$|R
2500|$|Another was Flow My Tears, the Policeman <b>Said,</b> {{adapted by}} <b>Linda</b> Hartinian and {{produced}} by the New York-based avant-garde company Mabou Mines. It premiered in Boston at the Boston Shakespeare Theatre (June 18–30, 1985) and was subsequently staged in New York and Chicago. Productions of Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said were also staged by the Evidence Room [...] in Los Angeles in 1999 and by the Fifth Column Theatre Company at the Oval House Theatre in London in the same year.|$|R
