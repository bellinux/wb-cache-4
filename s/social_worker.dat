The <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the contact between foster homes and <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> by doing a comparison of the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and the foster homes experiences of the cooperation that is between them. We started from three main questions to get an answer to our aim, how the foster homes and the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> experience the organization of the foster care in the Social Service as an impact of the cooperation, what does the foster homes and the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> experience as a important fact of a successful placement and finally, how does the foster homes and the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> experience the supporting and controlling contact that is between them. To get our results we based our study on interviews whit four foster homes and whit four <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> The analysis was based on one theoretical perspective, Skaus (2007) analytical approach for power and help. As a conclusion we have found out, that the organization of the Social Service has significance for the contact between <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and foster homes. The <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and the foster homes have different opinions of how the Social Service should be organized, so that the contact should be as good as possible. The <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> saw the ground work as an important fact for the placement to be successful. Both <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and foster homes saw the confidence between them, as an important fact for the placement to be successful. All four foster homes and two of the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> saw the controlling part of the contact as a good and necessary thing. The other two of the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> saw the controlling part as a complicated assignment.   The <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> saw the controlling part as an inadequate thing in the foster care today.

To answer the purpose eight qualitative interviews with four Swedish and four Belgian <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> were made. The results were analyzed by theory of organization and professional acting space. The {{results of the study}} show that the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> in both countries preferred foster care, especially for small children, and that the Swedish <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> had a more negative attitude towards residential care than the Belgian <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> Even though the Belgian <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> preferred foster care, they found themselves forced to choose residential care due to lack of available foster care facilities, something that did not seem to affect the Swedish <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> Factors that affected the Swedish and the Belgian <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> professional acting space were the consent from parents, discussing with colleagues and specialization of interventions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study is to get more {{knowledge}} about how moral dilemmas affect <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> in their work. This because we find that {{a big part of}} social work involves ethic reflections and that is why we find it important for <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> to have knowledge about how they should and can think and act in these situations. Ethic statements exist for <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> to use in their work but we haven’t found any guidelines for concrete situations and that’s why we decided to study this area. Questions we want to answer are how do the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> define moral dilemmas in social work? How do the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> deal with moral dilemmas in their work? How do moral dilemmas affect <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> in their work? This is a qualitative study with interviews from seven <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> from one <b>social</b> service office although they are from different units. The study’s concepts are system theory, utilitarianism, deontology, moral dilemmas, inner/outer ethic, and inner/outer moral. In this study, we have a social constructive perspective as we process and analyze the empiricism. The result from this study shows that <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> experience moral dilemmas in their work and the different morals in a society contribute to moral dilemmas for the <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> The <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> in our study have strategies for handling and coping with moral dilemmas.

According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

The results and analysis showed that the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> considered that their client’s autonomy and justice increases by the Housing First model.

Therefore, this study utilized a quantitative research methodology (and the AIDS Attitude Scale) to investigate professional <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 and Counselors 2 ̆ 7 self-report measures of their empathy and avoidance attitudes toward persons with AIDS. ^ One hundred and twenty (120) study participants were randomly selected from the membership list of each of these professional associations, i. e., thirty participants selected from each of the four professional associations (N = 120). Each participant (Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> Mental Health Counselors, and School Counselors) was mailed a copy of the AIDS Attitude Scale, a consent to participate letter, and a stamped self-addressed envelope. ^ There was a statistically significant difference among Mental Health Counselors, Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> School Counselors, and School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> as measured by the Empathy sub-scale of the AIDS Attitude Scale (AAS). The results from the ANOVA and Tukey HSD Post Hoc Test determined that the statistically significant difference was between Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> and School Counselors with regard to the variable empathy (F [3, 89] = 2. 583, p 3 ̆c. 05). Hence, Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> had statistically significant higher empathy scores. ^ ANOVA procedures indicated statistical significance for the dependent variables as follows: (1) “Years experience in profession” between School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> and Mental Health Counselors (F [3, 89] = 3. 307, p 3 ̆c. 05). School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> had statistically significant higher years of experience in the profession, and (2) “Know someone with AIDS” between Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> and School Counselors (F [3, 82] = 4. 245, p 3 ̆c. 05).

Thirty-seven participants agreed to complete an on-line questionnaire on the topic. The study findings indicated that CWS <b>social</b> <b>workers???</b> most preferred coping resources were talking to co-workers, talking to family, and exercising. A small percentage of CWS <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> utilized smoking and alcohol as a coping resource. CWS <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> stated that having a supportive supervisor or agency support was beneficial in the prevention of burnout. This study also found that one???s personal history of trauma may contribute to burnout and that those <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> with positive outlooks in life were less likely to burn out. <b>Social</b> <b>workers</b> were asked about burnout prevention. <b>Social</b> <b>workers</b> provided a multitude of responses, including a smaller caseload, supportive supervisors, and agency support. The study also suggested that CWS <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> with Bachelor Degrees were more receptive to receive education about burnout than those <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> with Master???s Degrees. The study further suggested that younger CWS <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> participated less in spiritual practices.
