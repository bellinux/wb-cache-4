5|$|In early 2010, while {{performing}} at the Sports Illustrated <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue release party in Las Vegas, Levine met Russian Sports Illustrated <b>swimsuit</b> cover-model Anne Vyalitsyna. They began a relationship {{which ended in}} April 2012.|$|E
5|$|The photographers in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 were {{respectively}} Antoine Verglas, James Porto, Michael Zeppetello and Steven White for the <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue works. From 2005–2007 Gair {{took the}} photographs of her body paintings herself. Verglas again photographed the bodypainting for the 2008 <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue. No body painting pictures have been chosen as the main image {{on the cover of}} the <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue. However, in the 2005 <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue (pictured left) in which Carolyn Murphy is the cover model, Jessica White was shown as an inset on the cover in a Miami Dolphins jersey body painting by Gair. Thus, as a Sports Illustrated <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue photographer Gair debuted on the cover in a sense. In 2006 a small cropped portion of her photograph of a bodypainting of Klum appeared in an inset on the cover, but no bodypainting was apparent.|$|E

50|$|The 1920s and 1930s saw leotards {{influencing}} {{the style of}} <b>swimsuits,</b> with women's one-piece <b>swimsuits</b> today still being similar in appearance to leotards.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHydrodynamics {{plays an}} {{important}} role in swimming. Recently, <b>swimsuits</b> have been aggressively marketed, principally as a means for reducing the skin friction component of the total drag, thereby conferring a competitive advantage over other swimmers. Currently a range of <b>swimsuits</b> are available in the market however their aerodynamic data is hardly available in the public domain. Additionally, there is no standard methodology for the evaluation of hydrodynamic performance of <b>swimsuits.</b> The primary purpose of this work is to evaluate the hydrodynamic properties of a series of <b>swimsuits</b> at a macroscopic level. A standard cylindrical methodology has been developed in wind tunnel measurement of aero/hydrodynamic properties (drag and lift). Current production <b>swimsuits</b> including Diana and Spalding have been tested. All tests were conducted at a range of speeds. The findings indicate that there is a notable variation in aerodynamic properties among <b>swimsuits...</b>|$|R
25|$|In the 1930s, new {{materials}} were being developed and use in swimwear, particularly latex and nylon, and <b>swimsuits</b> gradually began hugging the body, especially women's <b>swimsuits.</b>|$|R
5|$|McDougal {{appeared}} in the 2005 Playmates at Play at the Playboy Mansion <b>swimsuit</b> calendar as the calendar girl of July. The calendar was the inaugural Playmates at Play calendar and it was shot {{on the grounds of}} Playboy Mansion in 2004. It was Playboys first attempt at creating a non-nude <b>swimsuit</b> calendar featuring Playmates similar in style with those from Sports Illustrated <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue. While all Playmates {{appeared in}} bikinis in the calendar, McDougal and Hiromi Oshima were the only two Playmates actually wearing only painted on bikinis.|$|E
5|$|Adams' first {{paid work}} was a Farrah Foxette pinup that he copied from Farrah Fawcett's iconic 1976 <b>swimsuit</b> poster, which he {{submitted}} to the letters page of the DC Comics series Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! That series' editor, Roy Thomas, paid Adams $10 to publish the piece as a fan pinup.|$|E
5|$|After 2 {{years of}} college, McDougal {{moved to a}} Detroit suburb where she taught pre-kindergarten, before being persuaded {{to try out for}} a <b>swimsuit</b> competition. One of her {{professional}} goals has always been to open a learning center for children, but she has put those plans on hold to focus on pursuing roles in acting and modelling.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to describing women’s one-piece <b>swimsuits,</b> the word maillot {{has also been}} {{used to refer to}} tights or leotards made of stretchable, jersey fabric, generally used for dance or gymnastics. The term maillot was first used to describe tight-fitting, one-piece <b>swimsuits</b> in the 1920s, as these <b>swimsuits</b> had been manufactured from a similar stretchable, jersey fabric.|$|R
50|$|In 1935 topless <b>swimsuits</b> for {{men were}} worn {{for the first}} time during an {{official}} competition. In 1943, the US ordered the reduction of fabric in <b>swimsuits</b> by 10% due to wartime shortages, resulting in the first two piece <b>swimsuits.</b> Shortly afterwards the bikini was invented in Paris by Louis Reard (officially) or Jacques Heim (earlier, but slightly larger).|$|R

5|$|Alyssa Elaine Miller (born July 4, 1989) is an American fashion model. She {{has done}} print and runway work for {{numerous}} leading companies. Among her highlights are cover appearances on for Vogue (Germany) and Elle (Italy), {{work as a}} featured modelspokesperson for both Guess and Victoria's Secret as well as appearances in the Sports Illustrated <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue.|$|E
5|$|Jessica Gomes (born 25 September 1984) is an Australian model who {{appeared}} in the <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue of the American publication Sports Illustrated every year from 2008 to 2015. She works extensively in Australia and Asia. She has strong followings in South Korea and in the East Coast hip hop community.|$|E
5|$|Male bikini tops {{also exist}} {{and are often}} used as visual gags. A mankini {{is a type of}} sling <b>swimsuit</b> worn by men. The term is {{inspired}} by the word bikini. It was popularized by Sacha Baron Cohen when he donned one in the film Borat.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} magazines. In the 2012 Sports Illustrated <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue, she appeared in a section composed of athletes in body paint. She was featured in the 2013 music issue of ESPN The Magazine replicating Katy Perry's One of the Boys album cover. In May 2015, Morgan was featured on the cover of ESPN Magazine with teammates Abby Wambach and Sydney Leroux. The same year, she appeared on multiple covers of Sports Illustrated before and after winning the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. She appeared for a second time in the Sports Illustrated <b>Swimsuit</b> Issue in 2015. She has appeared on the covers of Health and Self magazines. She has {{been featured in}} Shape, Vogue, Elle, Time, and Fortune.|$|E
5|$|Swimwear and {{underwear}} have similar design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The <b>swimsuit</b> was, and is, following underwear styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1930s BVD was purchased by the Atlas Underwear company of Piqua, Ohio. During the Great Depression they were successful in manufacturing <b>swimsuits</b> for men, women and children. They patented their own fabric, Sea Satin, a rayon woven satin backed with latex for stretch. They also used knits of cotton, wool and Rayon, and cellophane.Their <b>swimsuits</b> featured in major fashion magazines and high fashion stores. Styles included form fitting maillots as well as full skirted <b>swimsuits.</b> They offered suits for men with detachable tops. In 1929, Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller, who {{went on to become the}} most famous Tarzan in motion pictures, was hired as a model and representative. He was featured at swim shows throughout the country wearing the BVD brand of <b>swimsuits,</b> handing out leaflets and giving autographs.|$|R
40|$|Aero/hydrodynamics plays a {{critical}} role in swimming. Studies estimate that over 90 % of the swimmer&# 039;s power output is spent overcoming aero/hydrodynamic resistance. Recently, <b>swimsuits</b> have been aggressively marketed, principally as a means for reducing the skin friction component of the total drag, thereby conferring a competitive advantage over other swimmers. Some manufacturers have claimed significant reduction of drag, {{but it is difficult to}} find independent research in the open literature that supports these claims and counter claims. In fact, it is not at all clear that <b>swimsuits</b> in reality reduce skin friction or other forms of drag. At present, there is no standard methodology for the evaluation of <b>swimsuits</b> performance. The primary purpose of this work is to conduct a comparative study of three competitive commercially manufactured <b>swimsuits...</b>|$|R

5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece <b>swimsuit</b> with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist James Mellaart {{described}} the earliest bikini-like costume in Çatalhöyük, Anatolia in the Chalcolithic era (around 5600 BC), where a mother goddess is depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume somewhat like a bikini. The two-piece <b>swimsuit</b> {{can be traced}} back to the Greco-Roman world, where bikini-like garments worn by women athletes are depicted on urns and paintings dating back to 1400 BC.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Cielo {{won four}} gold medals: in the 50 and 100-metre {{freestyle}}, {{and in the}} 4×100-metre freestyle and medley relay. He broke the Pan-American record in the 50-metre freestyle (21.58 seconds), the 100-metre freestyle (47.84 seconds), and in the 4×100-metre freestyle (3:14.65). His highlight for the competition was his time of 47.84 seconds in the 100-metre freestyle, {{the best time of}} his life without the use of a technological <b>swimsuit.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of {{pubic hair}} beyond the bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a <b>swimsuit.</b> Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E
5|$|Heim's atome {{was more}} attuned {{to the sense of}} propriety of the 1940s and a bigger hit than Réard's design but Réard's was the design that won the public's {{imagination}} over time. Though Heim's design was the first worn on the beach and sold more swimsuits, it was Réard's description of the two-piece <b>swimsuit</b> as a bikini that stuck. Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Australian swimmer and {{performer}} Annette Kellerman {{was arrested}} on a Boston beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted <b>swimsuit</b> attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. In 1913, designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired {{by the introduction of}} females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.|$|E
