5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> produced further {{away from the body}} than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from African American English.|$|E
50|$|WABE's call <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> WPBA-FM {{for much}} of April 1984, {{at the same time}} WETV's call <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> changed to WPBA. The radio station's call <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> changed back in May because of confusion.|$|R
25|$|In September 2015, a 'Welcome' <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} in Iğdır and written in four languages, Turkish, Kurdish, English, and Armenian. The Armenian {{portion of the}} <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> protested by ASIMDER who demanded its removal. In October 2015, the Armenian writing on the 'Welcome' <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> heavily vandalized. The Armenian portion of the <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> ultimately removed in June 2016.|$|R
50|$|Peabody's <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> a {{clinical}} <b>sign</b> which may <b>be</b> found {{in patients with}} deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> positive when calf muscle spasm occurs on raising the affected leg with the foot extended. The <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> neither sensitive nor specific {{for the presence of}} DVT.|$|R
5|$|On the {{day before}} Remembrance Day, 2009, the section of Highway35 between Lindsay and Norland was renamed the Midland Regiment Commemorative Highway, in honour of {{veterans}} of World War II. <b>Signs</b> <b>are</b> placed along the highway at regular intervals to acknowledge the designation.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian , state {{symbols and}} <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> not {{protected}} by copyright. As such, the anthem's music and lyrics {{may be used}} and modified freely. Although the law calls for the anthem to be performed respectfully and for performers to avoid causing offence, it does not define what constitutes offensive acts or penalties. Standing for the anthem is required by law but {{the law does not}} specify a penalty for refusing to stand.|$|E
5|$|Angle brackets, , {{indicate}} {{that there is a}} sequence of runes that cannot be interpreted with certainty. Other special <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> þ and ð, where the first one is the thorn letter which represents a voiceless dental fricative as th in English thing. The second letter is eth which stands for a voiced dental fricative as th in English them. The ʀ sign represents the yr rune, and ô {{is the same as the}} Icelandic O caudata ǫ.|$|E
25|$|Direction of {{movement}} is indicated via an operator symbol. A plus <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to indicate forward movement. A minus <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to indicate backwards movement. A dot or period or equal <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to indicate horizontal or lateral movement. For {{a piece that}} moves diagonally (such as the horse or elephant), the plus or minus <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used rather than the period.|$|R

5000|$|An early {{version of}} the <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> put on the {{hillside}} in 1923 and the current, permanent <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> created in 1929. The <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> cited as {{a prime example of}} [...] "civic boosterism"; the intention was to advertise the city's welcoming attitude toward industry. Its location was chosen so as to be visible from the main north-south highways El Camino Real and the Bayshore Highway, {{as well as from the}} train and the nearby Mills Field airfield (now San Francisco International Airport). The <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> originally proposed, and the first <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> placed, by the South San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. The $5,000 cost of the second, permanent <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> funded by a special property tax assessment approved by the voters.|$|R
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{individuals}} with this disorder have not been diagnosed and consequently are not receiving lipid-lowering treatments. Physical examination findings can help a physician make the diagnosis of FH. Tendon xanthomas are seen in 20-40% {{of individuals}} with FH and are pathognomonic for the condition. A xanthelasma or corneal arcus may also be seen. These common <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> supportive of the diagnosis, but are non-specific findings.|$|E
5|$|During the {{recovery}} phase intravenous fluids are discontinued {{to prevent a}} state of fluid overload. If fluid overload occurs and vital <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed. If a person is outside of the critical phase, a loop diuretic such as furosemide {{may be used to}} eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.|$|E
5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E
50|$|The Kawasaki B-IV cars feature multi-panel {{signs to}} {{indicate}} the origin point, destination, and type of service. One <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> mounted {{on each side of}} a car, set just inside a window to make it visible from both the interior and exterior. A similar, smaller <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> mounted over car-end doors when cab equipment <b>is</b> present; this <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> only visible from the exterior. These <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> a significant improvement over earlier rolling stock which completely lacked such signage.|$|R
50|$|The station {{signed on}} in the Eugene, Oregon area as KFMY in 1958. On August 9, 1978, the call <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> changed to KUGN-FM. The call <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> then changed to KKTT on March 16, 1998 which {{remained}} until August 15, 2001 when the call <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> changed to KNRQ-FM.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> usually {{present from}} 4-6 weeks until the 12th week of pregnancy. Hegar's <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> more {{difficult}} to recognize in multiparous women.|$|R
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} {{often have}} no or only mild symptoms. Numerous symptoms and <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> associated with hypothyroidism, {{and can be}} related to the underlying cause, or a direct effect of having not enough thyroid hormones. Hashimoto's thyroiditis may present with the mass effect of a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland).|$|E
5|$|There are 44 {{numbered}} city {{roads in}} Kawartha Lakes. Kawartha Lakes city roads are signed with a flowerpot-shaped sign, as are most regional and county roads in Ontario. The road number {{appears in the}} centre of the sign, with the word KAWARTHA above and the word LAKES below. Like King's Highways, these <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> known as shields.|$|E
5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> iconically self-explanatory, {{that they}} are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even {{that they are}} pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
50|$|To write a {{consonant}} {{without the}} inherent vowel the halant <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used below the base glyph. In Assamese this <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> called ‘haxanta’.|$|R

50|$|In {{case there}} are two {{identical}} pieces in one file, symbols + (front) and - (rear) are used instead of former file number.Direction of movement is indicated via an operator symbol. A plus <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to indicate forward movement. A minus <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to indicate backwards movement. A dot or period or equal <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to indicate horizontal or lateral movement. For a piece that moves diagonally (such as the horse or elephant), the plus or minus <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used rather than the period.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with several}} other roads in the Highlands, the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe has been {{installed}} with permanent gates that are closed {{in the event of}} severe weather. These gates are now fitted with fibre-optic illuminated signs. The road has been identified as one of several trunk roads in the Highlands that suffers from problems with deer-vehicle collisions. In 1996, Transport Scotland set up a number of vehicle activated warning signs alerting drivers attention to nearby deer. Four of these <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> on the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe.|$|E
5|$|As a {{circular}} highway, M-185 has no specific termini; the generally accepted {{starting point is}} at the mile0 marker {{placed in front of}} the Mackinac Island State Park Visitor Center. The highway uses wooden markers to measure miles instead of the common metal signage; these <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> erected by the MISPC, as MDOT does not install the standard state highway reassurance markers along this roadway. M-185 is one of only three state trunkline highways in Michigan on islands; the others are M-134 on Drummond Island and M-154 on Harsens Island. No part of M-185 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Over a half million people travel along the trunkline in a year.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a refurbishment programme including improvements to signage, security and train information systems. General repairs and redecoration were carried out, flooring was renewed, and better lighting, an improved CCTV security system and Help Points were installed, {{with the latter}} being suitable for people with limited hearing. Some of the original <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> in a 'petit-serif' adaptation of the London Underground typeface, Johnston Delf Smith Sans. This typeface was designed by Charles Holden and Percy Delf Smith, a former pupil of Edward Johnston.|$|E

5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often {{out of proportion to}} the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. <b>Signs</b> <b>are</b> limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E
5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} commences with Inna wearing a pink leotard, {{following}} {{which she and}} other women practice pole dancing. Subsequently, the singer appears in black hotpants and a blonde blouse {{in front of a}} neon-lightened X sign in the background, flirting with one male. For the first refrain, she and her background dancers perform hand choreography. Following this, Inna and others are seen on {{what appears to be a}} runaway, with rain coming out from above; similar neon <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> shown in the background. After Yandel's cameo appearance, the video ends with Inna and her dancers further performing to the track. Cut scenes show the singer dancing and performing a slut drop in front of a wet glass surface.|$|E

50|$|The Hamburger <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> {{used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of appendicitis. The <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to rule out that disease, with the physician inquiring if the patient would like to consume his/her favourite food. If a patient wants to eat, consider a diagnosis other than appendicitis. Anorexia is 80% sensitive for appendicitis. A positive hamburger <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated by a patient declining food.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, a white <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> mounted above each portal that {{declared}} [...] "Old Kissing Bridge {{built in}} 1875 by the Phelps Bros." [...] Sometime in the mid-2000s, the <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> taken down. When {{the bridge was}} closed, large [...] "Bridge Closed" [...] <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> mounted in the same location with concrete barricades placed across the road on the bridge's approaches.|$|R
