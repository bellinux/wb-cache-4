5|$|Debian offers {{different}} network installation methods. A minimal install of Debian {{is available}} via the netinst CD, whereby Debian is installed {{with just a}} base and later added <b>software</b> <b>can</b> be downloaded from the Internet. Another option is to boot the installer from the network.|$|E
5|$|The console has {{a number}} of {{internal}} features made available from its hardware and firmware components. The hardware allows for extendability (via expansion ports), while the firmware (and some <b>software)</b> <b>can</b> receive periodic updates via the WiiConnect24 service.|$|E
5|$|Debian {{has access}} to online {{repositories}} that contain over 50,000 software packages making it the largest software compilation. Debian officially contains only free software, but non-free <b>software</b> <b>can</b> be downloaded and installed from the Debian repositories. Debian includes popular free programs such as LibreOffice, Firefox web browser, Evolution mail, K3b disc burner, VLC media player, GIMP image editor, and Evince document viewer. Debian is a popular choice for web servers (cf. LAMP).|$|E
40|$|Measures of <b>software</b> {{maintainability}} <b>can</b> {{be taken}} either late or {{early in the}} development process. Late measurements of <b>software</b> maintainability <b>can</b> be used for assessing the software system, and planning for future enhancements. On the other hand, early measures of <b>software</b> maintainability <b>can</b> help in allocating project resources efficiently, predicting the effort of maintenance tasks and controlling the maintenance process...|$|R

5|$|Decompression <b>software</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} {{generate}} tables or schedules matched to a diver's planned dive profile and breathing gas mixtures. The usual procedure is {{to generate}} schedules for the intended profile {{and for the most}} likely contingency profiles, such as slightly greater depth, delayed ascent and early ascent. Sometimes an emergency minimum decompression schedule and a more conservative schedule will be generated to allow the diver further options.|$|E
5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project aimed at protein structure prediction {{and is one}} of the most accurate tertiary structure predictors. The conformational states from Rosetta's <b>software</b> <b>can</b> be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>software</b> <b>can</b> be {{purchased}} {{in any of}} five capability configurations: JMP, JMP Pro, JMP Clinical, JMP Genomics and the JMP Graph Builder App for the iPad. JMP can be automated with its proprietary scripting language, JSL. The software is focused on exploratory visual analytics, where users investigate and explore data. These explorations can also be verified by hypothesis testing, data mining, or other analytic methods. In addition, discoveries made through graphical exploration can inspire a designed experiment that can be both designed and analyzed with JMP.|$|E

50|$|Some of the <b>software</b> {{mentioned}} <b>can</b> also be run {{on different}} devices {{than what they}} are intended for. A particular case-in-point is the Android <b>software</b> which <b>can</b> often be run on laptops or PCs (running Linux, Windows or Mac OS X) as well. This can be done using emulators.|$|R

5|$|The Kinect, a motion-sensing {{input device}} made by Microsoft and {{designed}} as a video game controller, was first introduced in November 2010, and was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra-wide 1080p camera, which can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor. It employs higher-end processing power and new <b>software,</b> <b>can</b> distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and can determine a user's heart rate by looking at his/her face. Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers {{as part of a}} plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered its biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000 after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among the investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet; with more than 11 percentage points declining Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion. For the 2010 fiscal year, Microsoft had five product divisions: Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division and Entertainment and Devices Division.|$|E
