6000|$|Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob {{from the}} top of an andiron, and passed it around her so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Gyp smiled. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> all so well. The black walls, {{the silver}} statuettes, Rops drawings, scent of dead rose-leaves and pastilles and cigarettes--and those two by the piano--and her father so cool and dry! ...|$|E
60|$|We {{stood looking}} at one another {{on the edge of}} the marsh. In the clear morning {{sunlight}} I had no chance of escape or subterfuge. There was terror in my face, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now Miriam was angry. There {{was nothing}} to be ashamed of, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> and <b>it</b> was {{certainly}} very rude in Miss Bannister to drop her bottle, and nearly push her over in her haste to get away from her and her poor calf.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Benjamin {{looked away}} {{and made a}} note. If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>it,</b> Helen would {{certainly}} have been surprised. For, though her voice was low, she had schooled herself to go through her task without agitation. Yet, here was the note.|$|R
50|$|Peng {{questioned}} Arnold, {{and began}} inspecting his luggage, noting {{a laptop computer}} and several computer accessories. Peng instructed Arnold {{to turn on the}} computer so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> if <b>it</b> was functioning. CBP Officer John Roberts was called to assist with the inspection while the computer was booting up.|$|R
60|$|She leant yet lower towards Marcus and listened. He was not dead, for he breathed. More, {{she heard}} him stir his hand and thought that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> move upwards towards his wounded head. Then she drew back.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun saw {{all their}} loveliness, she KNEW how immortally {{beautiful}} they were, great pistils of rose-coloured, snow-fed {{fire in the}} blue twilight of the heaven. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>SEE</b> <b>it,</b> she knew it, {{but she was not}} of it. She was divorced, debarred, a soul shut out.|$|E
60|$|She {{was carried}} away by his narrative. He had let himself go now, {{speaking}} in short, quick sentences. Yet his plain words seemed to paint with a marvellous vividness the story he told. It {{seemed to her that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> all, could realise what he went through.|$|E
60|$|He nodded, {{and though}} she had scored her point <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> that <b>it</b> had any {{material}} bearing after all.|$|R
6000|$|He long {{remembered the}} look <b>she</b> gave him--who <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> and forget it?--and the {{struggle}} that ensued within her. At last she said: ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{his picture}} in her room, and {{sometimes}} she sat down to write with his sadly inscrutable face before her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in <b>it</b> (as <b>she</b> studied it here in her home) the lines of varied and restless thought which make up {{the face of a}} man who largely comprehends American civilization in the light of experience.|$|R
60|$|Her {{affections}} {{were not}} acute, nor was her mind tenacious. After a time, Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects, and revive {{some interest in}} the usual occupations; but whenever Lady Bertram was fixed on the event, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> only in one light, as comprehending {{the loss of a}} daughter, and a disgrace never to be wiped off.|$|E
60|$|Inez {{came running}} from the nursery to take baby, but Louise would not let little Jane go. Although she had escaped {{much of the past}} night’s misery, thanks to Dr. Knox’s quieting powders, the young mother was still unnerved and liked to have the child where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> So Inez sat on a bench and held Jane, who was the least {{concerned}} of anyone over her recent peril and fortunate escape.|$|E
60|$|The {{thing that}} held {{her she had}} {{recognized}} now as a Tor-o-don, {{but the other thing}} she could not place, though in the moonlight <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> very distinctly. It had no tail. She could see its hands and its feet, and they were not the hands and feet of the races of Pal-ul-don. It was slowly closing upon the Tor-o-don and in one hand it held a gleaming knife. Now it spoke and to Pan-at-lee's terror was added an equal weight of consternation.|$|E
50|$|Hudson and Bess were dining companions with Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen. At {{dinner on}} 14 April, they brought Loraine {{to the dining}} room with them so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how pretty <b>it</b> was.|$|R
60|$|Her {{quick glance}} had shown {{her that the}} room was quite empty, and that in {{addition}} to the main doorway {{at the lower end of}} the apartment, where she had entered, there was but one other door leading from the hall. This was at one side, and as <b>it</b> stood ajar <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>it</b> led into a small room, apparently a bedchamber.|$|R
60|$|She waited {{what seemed}} an interminable time, {{and then a}} faint {{drumming}} caught her attention, and grew into a welcome beat of hoofs. Some one was coming along the road. She watched eagerly, straining her eyes {{to catch a glimpse}} of the rider. At last an object emerged from the shadow, and as <b>it</b> drew nearer <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>it</b> was a man riding a mule.|$|R
60|$|Ida {{glanced at}} the slide of silky green water that leaped out over a shelf of rock and fell through a haze of spray into a {{whirling}} pool. It did not look altogether attractive, and now that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> more clearly she rather shrank from it; but she was accustomed to having exactly what she wished, and her companion had not shown himself quite as ready to meet her views that day as she would have liked. An impulse {{that she did not}} altogether understand impelled her to persist.|$|E
60|$|After a while, {{finding that}} nothing more happened, she decided on {{going into the}} garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! {{when she got to}} the door, she found she had {{forgotten}} the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.|$|E
60|$|When Aaron came in, {{she looked}} at him with a gentle, fresh smile that seemed to make the fard on her face look like a curious tiredness, which now she might recover from. And as the last time, it was {{difficult}} for her to identify this man with the voice of the flute. It was rather difficult. Except that, perhaps, between his brows was something of a doubt, and in his bearing an aloofness that made her dread he might go away and not come back. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in him, that he might go away and not come back.|$|E
60|$|The candle burned up, {{its light}} fell upon the white, elfish face of Benita, whose long dark hair {{streamed}} about her; it shone in her great eyes. Still <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing, for <b>it</b> dazzled her.|$|R
60|$|After luncheon {{she took}} Cacilie into her bed-room {{and began to}} talk very seriously to her; but to her amazement the girl adopted a brazen attitude; she {{proposed}} to go about as she liked; and if she chose to walk with the Chinaman <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was anybody's business but her own. The Frau Professor threatened to write to her uncle.|$|R
60|$|<b>See</b> to <b>it!</b> How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>see</b> to <b>it</b> {{when that}} letter {{should have been}} written? And Rachel was well aware that another day must not pass without the writing of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, it is!" [...] {{cried the}} Cookie Cook, and rushing forward, she fell {{on her knees}} and threw her arms around the {{precious}} pan. But her arms came together without meeting any resistance at all. Cayke tried to seize the edge, but found nothing to grasp. The pan was surely there, she thought, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> plainly; but it was not solid; she could not feel it at all. With a moan of astonishment and despair, she raised her head to look at the Bear King, who was watching her actions curiously. Then she turned to the pan again, only to find it had completely disappeared.|$|E
60|$|The party {{started in}} August, {{travelled}} very slowly, {{and he was}} the kindest squire to the two girls, taking them to see everything, and being altogether, as Geraldine said, the most admirable courier in the world, with a wonderful intuition as to what she individually would like to see, and how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> without fatigue. Moreover, on the Sunday that occurred at a little German town, it was the greatest joy to her that he sought no outside gaiety, but rather seemed to cling to his uncle's home ministrations, and even to her readings of hymns. They had a quiet walk together, and it was a day of peace when his gentle kindness put her in mind of his father, yet with a regretful depth she had always missed in Edgar.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood at}} the door as the two men got into the gig, and, as it passed down through the gate, she hurried out upon the terrace, from whence <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> for a few yards down the lane. Then she ran from the terrace to the gate, and, hurrying through the gate, made her way into the churchyard, from the farther corner of which she could see the heads of the two men till they had made the turn into the main road beyond the parsonage. There she {{remained}} till the very sound of the wheels no longer reached her ears, stretching her eyes in the direction they had taken. Then she turned round slowly and made her way out at the churchyard gate, which opened on to the road close to {{the front door of the}} Small House.|$|E
60|$|She assured Mrs. James Frost {{that she}} did not think Delaford to blame; many girls would be foolish about a man with {{personal}} advantages, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was his fault. Poor Marianne had been always weakly, and, 'After all, ma'am, some young women will put constructions upon anything,' said Mrs. Fanshawe, deciding that at least she should make no mischief by sacrificing poor Marianne.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the note}} was published, the site amended Thompson's online {{biography}} when {{an editor at}} a Chicago public radio station said that while Thompson had indeed worked there, he had no involvement in the station's news reporting as he had claimed. His past tenure at DNAinfo in Chicago, where one editor tweeted {{in response to the}} story that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> coming, was also edited out.|$|R
50|$|A week later, Choegoe and Lehnberg met in Rondebosch once more. This time he {{admitted}} that he was too afraid to go through with the murder. Lehnberg promised that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> to <b>it</b> that he received help with his artificial limb, if he did away with Mrs van der Linde. She also gave him a radio. Choegoe went to Bellville once more. On this occasion, he simply walked past the house but made no attempt to enter.|$|R
60|$|This bright, fresh morning, in March, Helen {{came out}} upon the porch to revel {{a little in}} the warmth of {{sunshine}} and the crisp, pine-scented wind that swept down from the mountains. There was never a morning that she did not gaze mountainward, trying to see, with a folly she realized, if the snow had melted more perceptibly away on the bold white ridge. For all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> had not melted an inch, and she would not confess why she sighed. The desert had become green and fresh, stretching away there far below her range, growing dark and purple in the distance with vague buttes rising. The air was full of sound--notes of blackbirds and the baas of sheep, and blasts from the corrals, and the clatter of light hoofs on the court below.|$|E
60|$|Birkin {{was dancing}} with Ursula. There were odd little fires {{playing in his}} eyes, {{he seemed to have}} turned into {{something}} wicked and flickering, mocking, suggestive, quite impossible. Ursula was frightened of him, and fascinated. Clear, before her eyes, as in a vision, she could see the sardonic, licentious mockery of his eyes, he moved towards her with subtle, animal, indifferent approach. The strangeness of his hands, which came quick and cunning, inevitably to the vital place beneath her breasts, and, lifting with mocking, suggestive impulse, carried her through the air as if without strength, through blackmagic, made her swoon with fear. For a moment she revolted, it was horrible. She would break the spell. But before the resolution had formed she had submitted again, yielded to her fear. He knew all the time what he was doing, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in his smiling, concentrated eyes. It was his responsibility, she would leave it to him.|$|E
60|$|One Sunday she {{happened}} to be walking in Russell Square, at some distance from Mr. Osborne's house (<b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> from a distance though) when all the bells of Sabbath were ringing, and George and his aunt came out to go to church; a little sweep asked for charity, and the footman, who carried the books, tried to drive him away; but Georgy stopped and gave him money. May God's blessing be on the boy! Emmy ran round the square and, coming up to the sweep, gave him her mite too. All the bells of Sabbath were ringing, and she followed them until {{she came to the}} Foundling Church, into which she went. There she sat in a place whence she could see the head of the boy under his father's tombstone. Many hundred fresh children's voices rose up there and sang hymns to the Father Beneficent, and little George's soul thrilled with delight at the burst of glorious psalmody. His mother could not see him for awhile, through the mist that dimmed her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] exclaimed Dorothy, {{rubbing her}} nose, which had struck {{something}} hard, although <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> what <b>it</b> was; [...] "this isn't {{as easy as}} it looks. What has stopped us, Ozma? Is it magic of some sort?" ...|$|R
60|$|The girl {{left the}} kitchen and climbed {{up on the roof}} of the castle and looked out. Far, far away, so far that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> was the glow of a fire. 'I will go and fetch a burning coal from there and light my fire,' thought she, and opened the door of the castle. When she reached the place where the fire was kindled, a hideous man-eater was {{crouching}} over it.|$|R
6000|$|But many of {{the windows}} of the town {{remained}} lighted up, and at a little distance below her, round the corner so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> a small crowd must have collected in front of the gateway which led into the courtyard of the Gayole Fort. Marguerite could hear a persistent murmur of voices, mostly angry and threatening, and once there were loud cries of: [...] "English spies," [...] and [...] "a la lanterne!" ...|$|R
