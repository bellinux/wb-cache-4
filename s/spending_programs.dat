40|$|Can a {{large-scale}} defcit <b>spending</b> <b>program</b> speed up recovery after recession? To {{answer that question}} we calibrate a standard neoclassical growth model with US data and assume that an exogenous shock has driven aggregate output far below steady-state level. We calibrate the model such that a permanent increase of government expenditure is effective in raising output. We then show that "fiscal stimulus", i. e. a temporary increase of government expenditure is not only ineffective but detrimental. Even before the <b>spending</b> <b>program</b> expires, aggregate output is lower than it could be without fiscal stimulus. We show the generality of this result w. r. t. size and persistence of the shock, size of the government spending multiplier, and the scale and {{duration of the stimulus}} program. Using a phase diagram we provide the economic intuition for our unpleasant finding and explain why, generally, private capital stock reaches its lowest level when a deficit <b>spending</b> <b>program</b> expires. We also show how an accompanying temporary cut of capital income taxes helps to prevent the negative repercussion of deficit spending on economic recovery. deficit spending, government spending multiplier, economic recovery, economic growth...|$|R

25|$|Historically, {{the party}} has {{represented}} farmers, laborers, labor unions, and religious and ethnic minorities; it has opposed unregulated business and finance, and favored progressive income taxes. In foreign policy, internationalism (including interventionism) was a dominant theme from 1913 to the mid-1960s. In the 1930s, the party began advocating welfare <b>spending</b> <b>programs</b> targeted at the poor. The party had a fiscally conservative, pro-business wing, typified by Grover Cleveland and Al Smith, and a Southern conservative wing that shrank after President Lyndon B. Johnson supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The major influences for liberalism were labor unions (which peaked in the 1936–1952 era), and the African American wing, which has steadily grown since the 1960s.

2500|$|In 1932, Hayek {{suggested}} that private {{investment in the}} public markets was a better road to wealth and economic co-ordination in Britain than government <b>spending</b> <b>programs,</b> as argued in an exchange of letters with John Maynard Keynes, co-signed with Lionel Robbins and others in The Times. [...] The nearly decade long deflationary depression in Britain dating from Churchill's decision in 1925 to return Britain to the gold standard at the old pre-war, pre-inflationary par was the public policy backdrop for Hayek's dissenting engagement with Keynes over British monetary and fiscal policy. Well beyond that single public conflict, regarding the economics of extending the length of production to the economics of labour inputs, Hayek and Keynes disagreed on many essential economics matters. Their economic disagreements were both practical and fundamental in nature. Keynes called Hayek's book, Prices and Production, [...] "one of the most frightful muddles I have ever read", famously adding, [...] "It is an extraordinary example of how, starting with a mistake, a remorseless logician can end in Bedlam." [...] Many other notable economists have also been staunch critics of Hayek, including John Kenneth Galbraith and later, Paul Krugman, who wrote: [...] "the Hayek thing is almost entirely about politics rather than economics".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{countries}} provide {{publicly funded}} retirement {{or health care}} systems. In connection with these systems, the country typically requires employers and/or employees to make compulsory payments. These payments are often computed by reference to wages or earnings from self-employment. Tax rates are generally fixed, but a different rate may be imposed on employers than on employees. Some systems provide an upper limit on earnings subject to the tax. A few systems provide that the tax is payable only on wages above a particular amount. Such upper or lower limits may apply for retirement but not health care components of the tax. Some have argued that such taxes on wages are a form of [...] "forced savings" [...] and not really a tax, while others point to redistribution through such systems between generations (from newer cohorts to older cohorts) and across income levels (from higher income levels to lower income levels) which suggest that such programs are really tax and <b>spending</b> <b>programs.</b> Some tax scholars argue that supporting social security programs exclusively through taxes on wages, rather than through broader taxes that include capital, creates distortions and underinvestment in human capital, since the returns to such investments will be taxes as wages.|$|E

40|$|One person's {{public good}} is another's public bad and so, perhaps, the public goods {{problem could be}} more {{generally}} described as the public commodities problem, in which disagreement about the basic goal of a <b>spending</b> <b>program</b> complicates the decision of how much to spend to achieve that goal. Although public goods spending is a continuous variable, it often has a binary goal such as win a war, deter crime, provide transportation, or reduce poverty. To decide how much spending is necessary to achieve that goal, society must answer both a normative question—Should the government adopt {{the goal of this}} spending program?—and a positive question—Given this <b>spending</b> <b>program's</b> goal, what is the optimal level of spending? If the answer to the first question is yes, it may be desirable that the level of spending be set at the optimal level of spending given the stated goal; spending, however, may not be set at that level. This paper uses the median voter theorem to demonstrate that those who do not believe the government should pursue the stated goal of a <b>spending</b> <b>program,</b> and those who believe that the government can achieve the goal with relatively less spending, can form a coalition to keep spending at a level that most supporters (and possibly most citizens) believe objectively is the optimal amount. Thus, even if voters have rational expectations about the amount necessary to achieve a goal, disagreement about whether or not to pursue the goal can cause an underfunding bias. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{foreign aid}} or foreign lending policy that focuses {{exclusively}} on project financing may have unintended consequences, report the authors. New {{research shows that}} aid intended for crucial social and economic sectors often merely substitutes for spending that recipient governments would have undertaken anyway and the funds that are thereby freed up are spent for other purposes. If the aid funds something {{that would have been}} done anyway, traditional ways of evaluating the aid's effectiveness are not really accurate. Ifaid funds are fungible and the recipient's public <b>spending</b> <b>program</b> is unsatisfactory, project lending may not be cost-effective. If the recipient's public <b>spending</b> <b>program</b> is satisfactory, perhaps the donor should finance a portion of it instead of financing individual projects. One {{solution to the problem of}} fungibility, then, is that donors could tie assistance to an overall public <b>spending</b> <b>program</b> (in the recipient country) that provides adequate resources to crucial sectors. To make this kind of reform operational, the authors propose a new lending instrument: a public expenditure reform loan (PERL). A PERL would tie an institution's lending strategy to the recipient country's achievement of mutually agreed-upon development goals. Everyone agrees that better donor coordination is needed, but it has been difficult to achieve because some donors tend to prefer projects (usually with the national flag flying over them). By agreeing on a public expenditure program and financing a portion of it, the World Bank credibly ask other donors to do the same.

40|$|Most of the {{discussion}} about fiscal stimulus focuses on the multiplier of government spending on impact. In this paper we shift the focus to the multiplier at the end, i. e. to {{the period in which}} a deficit <b>spending</b> <b>program</b> terminates. We show that recent time series analyses as well as economic models of different schools of thought predict that the multiplier turns negative before spending expires. This means that aggregate output at the time of expiry of fiscal stimulus is predicted to be lower than it could be without deficit spending. We set up a simple model that explains this phenomenon. Using phase diagram analysis we prove that the aggregate capital stock at the time of expiry of fiscal stimulus is lower than it would be without the deficit <b>spending</b> <b>program.</b> This fact explains why aggregate output is below its laissez faire level as well. We then calibrate an extended version of the model for the US and demonstrate how fiscal stimulus slows down recovery from a recession in the medium-run...|$|R
