40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the relative performance of two multipath routing schemes in wireless networks, namely, selective preferential forwarding (SPF) (or primary / <b>secondary</b> <b>routing)</b> and recently proposed selective random forwarding (SRF), {{in terms of}} their packet throughput and traffic load distribution. Aiming at achieving a good performance trade-off in meshed multipath routing, we introduce a novel hybrid packet forwarding scheme that takes advantage of more uniform load distribution of SRF and higher end-to-end throughput of SPF. Our approach is guided by analytic intuition and verified by simulations. I...|$|E
30|$|The {{main idea}} of the first case study is to {{demonstrate}} the benefits in CRNs whose SUs {{can take advantage of}} online social networking towards finding appropriate forwarding paths. Due to the high impact of PUs activity on secondary network performance - stemmed from the requirement for ensuring seamless primary network operation - we focus on leveraging information regarding the reputation about PUs (re)appearances at specific locations with the aim of avoiding <b>secondary</b> <b>routing</b> paths across regions with high volatile PU activity. In fact, as recognized in literature [14], the dynamic nature of PUs could trigger severe cascaded secondary network modifications, thus resulting in significant reconfiguration overhead. To avoid such issues, SeBPeMRF is leveraged towards forwarding data while shaping routing paths consisting of SUs that lie in areas with low reputation for frequent PU (re)appearances.|$|E
40|$|Via novel path-routing {{techniques}} we prove a {{lower bound}} on the I/O-complexity of all recursive matrix multiplication algorithms computed in serial or in parallel {{and show that}} it is tight for all square and near-square matrix multiplication algorithms. Previously, tight lower bounds were known only for the classical Θ(n^ 3) matrix multiplication algorithm and those similar to Strassen's algorithm that lack multiple vertex copying. We first prove tight lower bounds on the I/O-complexity of Strassen-like algorithms, under weaker assumptions, by constructing a routing of paths between the inputs and outputs of sufficiently small subcomputations in the algorithm's CDAG. We then further extend this result to all recursive divide-and-conquer matrix multiplication algorithms, and show that our lower bound is optimal for algorithms formed from square and nearly square recursive steps. This requires combining our new path-routing approach with a <b>secondary</b> <b>routing</b> based on the Loomis-Whitney Inequality technique used to prove the optimal I/O-complexity lower bound for classical matrix multiplication...|$|E

We developed an algorithm to efficiently track the <b>secondary</b> power <b>routing</b> and accurately estimate the routing quality using approximate voltage drop as the criteria. The fast check can identify potential hotspot issues {{without going through}} sign-off checks. It helps designers to capture issues at early stages and fix the issues with less design effort. We also discussed some limitations to our algorithm. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

40|$|Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) are {{composed}} of frequency-agile radio devices that allow licensed (primary) and unlicensed (secondary) users to coexist, where secondary users opportunistically access channels without interfering with the operation of primary ones. From the perspective of secondary users, spectrum availability is a time varying network resource over which multi-hop end-to-end connections must be maintained. In this work, a theoretical outlook {{on the problem of}} <b>routing</b> <b>secondary</b> user flows in a CRN is provided. The investigation aims to characterize optimal sequences of routes over which a secondary flow is maintained. The optimality is defined according to a novel metric that considers the maintenance cost of a route as channels and/or links must be switched due to the primary user activity. Different from the traditional notion of route stability, the proposed approach considers subsequent path selections, as well. The problem is formulated as an integer programming optimization model and shown to be of polynomial time complexity in case of full knowledge of primary user activity. Properties of the problem are also formally introduced and leveraged to design a heuristic algorithm to solve the minimum maintenance cost routing problem when information on primary user activity is not complete. Numerical results are presented to assess the optimality gap of the heuristic routing algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{networks}} {{with common}} shared wireless medium, the available bandwidth is always valuable and often scarce resource. In addition to it, memory available at nodes (eg., sensor nodes) might be limited {{relative to the}} amount of information that needs to be stored locally. As Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) rely on node mobility for data dissemination, the high node mobility limits the duration of contact. Besides the issue of contact opportu-nities between nodes, the bandwidth, available storage at peering nodes and contact duration also affect data forwarding. These factors also influence the mechanisms such as buffer replacement and scheduling policies. So there are <b>secondary</b> problems that <b>routing</b> strategies may {{need to take care of}} such as to deal with limited resources like buffer, bandwidth and power. Furthermore, despite inherent delay tolerance of most DTN driving applications, there can be situations where some messages may be more important than the others and expected to get delivered earlier. So considering the network limitations and application requirements, the problem of choosing the messages to be transmit-ted when a contact opportunity arises and the messages to be dropped when buffer full is formulated. A buffer management policy to address these issues is proposed and analysed in this paper. Additionally the buffer utilization of var-ious DTN routing protocols and the impact of buffer size on the performance of DTN are studied...|$|R
40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) present many {{challenges}} {{that are not}} present in traditional networks. Many stem from the {{need to deal with}} disconnections which directly impacts routing and forwarding. However as these networks enable communication between wide range of devices, there are <b>secondary</b> problems that <b>routing</b> strategies may {{need to take care of}} such as to deal with limited resources like buffer, bandwidth, power. Most of the routing protocols in DTN assume that the buffer size as infinitewhich is not the case in reality. In resource constrained environment, buffers will run out of capacity at certain point of time. Moreover due to mobility of the nodes and limited bandwidth, it is not possible to transmit all messages a node has during the short available period of contact. Consequently an efficient buffer management policy is required under resource constrained DTNs. Further, DTNs can be used to support several asynchronous applications simultaneously. Each application may have different priority. For example, an emergency alert in monitoring application is more important than the regular data. Such environment stimulates the need to introduce priority to messages. Therefore in this paper, a policy is proposed which performs buffer management with prioritization. The proposed approach with epidemic routing is evaluated through simulation and compared with other policies. It is shown that the proposed approach results in performance improvement to epidemic routing with preferential delivery...|$|R
