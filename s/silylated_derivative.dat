The β-CD-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica synthesis using the “one-pot method” of co-condensation of TEOS, and <b>silylated</b> <b>derivative</b> of β-CD enables to receive materials with high β-CD loadings [28]. However, the used cyanuric chloride linker is sensitive to alkaline hydrolysis, whereas the linker with urethane bond is less susceptible to hydrolysis [37]. Despite the fact that amide linkage is relatively stable, it was shown the opportunity of partial amide bond hydrolysis under hydrothermal treatment in alkaline solution [52]. In order to increase the content of covalently bound β-CD groups on the surface of MCM- 41 silicas, it was enhanced the quantities of CDI activator and APTES compound in β-CD-organosilanes synthesis in three and five times for both compounds. Molar ratio β-CD:CDI[*]=[*] 1 : 1, 1 : 3, or 1 : 5 was used, and molar composition of reaction mixtures were 1 : 1, 3 : 1, and 5 : 1 for APTES and activated β-CD, accordingly. In addition, the 10 % excess of CDI was used for all β-CD-organosilanes obtaining to ensure complete activation since the purity of CDI is variable due to its extreme sensitivity to water vapor.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method {{for the analysis of}} two sewage-derived contaminants: triclosan (TCS), an antibacterial agent, and methyl triclosan (MTCS), a TCS metabolite. For solid samples (4 g), extraction and cleanup were integrated into the same step using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with in-cell-clean-up (1 g of florisil). The extraction was performed using dichloromethane at 100 °C, 1500 psi and 3 static extraction cycles of 5 min each. For water samples (100 mL), stir bar sorptive extraction–liquid desorption (SBSE–LD) was used. Bars were stirred for 10 h and analytes were later desorbed using acetonitrile. Finally, MTCS and a <b>silylated</b> <b>derivative</b> of TCS were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Recovery experiments in water and sediments were performed and the results ranged from 67 % to 78 %. Limits of detection (LODs) were 5 ng L− 1 for TCS and 1 ng L− 1 for MTCS, in water samples, and 0. 1 ng g− 1 for TCS and MTCS in solid samples. The method was applied then to determine the levels of these compounds in the estuary of Guadalete River (SW Spain). TCS and MTCS concentrations up to 9. 6 ng g− 1 in sediments and 310 ng L− 1 in water were measured. Their distribution was strongly influenced by the presence of wastewater sources, treated and untreated, along the sampling area, where maximum concentrations were detected.

The methodologies of chemo- and regioselective synthesis of highly functionalized deazapurines have been developed by using modern C-H activation chemistry. Various functional groups such as amino-, imido-, silyl- and phosphonyl- were introduced by C-H activation reactions. Amino deazapurine derivatives were synthesized by developed Pd/Cu-catalyzed direct C-H amination and C-H chloroamination of 6 -substituted 7 -deazapurines with N-chloro-N- alkyl-arylsulfonamides. C-H imidation reactions of pyrrolopirimidines were performed under ferrocene catalysis with N-succinimido- or N-phtalimidoperesters.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl-ethers (PBDEs) are metabolized into {{hydroxylated}} metabolites (OH-PCBs/PBDEs), {{which can}} disrupt the thyroid hormone homeostasis. Binding of these metabolites to transport proteins such as transthyretin (TTR) {{is an important}} mechanism of their toxicity. Several methods to quantify the competitive thyroxine (T 4) displacement potency of pure metabolites exist. However, quantification of the potency of in vitro metabolized PCBs and PBDEs has drawbacks related to the coextraction of compounds disturbing the T 4 -TTR competitive binding assay. This study identifies and quantifies the major coextractants namely cholesterol, saturated and nonsaturated fatty acids (SFA and NSFA) at levels above 20 nmol per mg equivalent protein following various extraction methods. Their TTR binding potency was analyzed in a downscaled, nonradioactive fluorescence displacement assay. At concentration factors needed for TTR competitive binding, at least 10 µM of these coextracts is present, whereas individual SFA and NSFA disturb the assay from 0. 3 µM. The effectiveness of the in vitro metabolism and extraction of the model compounds CB 77 and BDE 47 was chemically quantified with a newly developed chromatographic method analyzing <b>silylated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of the OH-metabolites and coextractants.

A favourable condition for this immobilization methodology is the use of small amounts of the silylating agent, with six times less than the previous procedure. The maximum amount of the silane attached to the RUB- 18 surface, based on analytical results considering the nitrogen content, gave the values 5. 64, 4. 16, 4. 37 and 4. 05 mmol g(- 1), respectively.

The new achievements provided by this PhD thesis were obtained by following the steps below: - optimisation of a Py(HMDS) -GC/MS method {{for the analysis of}} consolidated/unconsolidated archaeological wood, using an EGA/PY- 3030 D Pyrolyser (Frontier Lab); - construction of a library for the recognition and semi-quantification of the <b>silylated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of wood pyrolysis products, using the AMDIS software (Automated Mass spectral Deconvolution and Identification System); - identification of relevant analytical parameters to assess wood degradation {{on the basis of the}} obtained pyrolysis profiles; - development of a new procedure based on EGA-MS applied to archaeological wood; - application of complementary techniques (SEM-EDX, FT-IR, synchrotron radiation based micro-FTIR, classical wet chemical methods, XRD, ICP-OES, IC) for the analysis of archaeological composite wooden artefacts; - integration of the results obtained by multi-analytical approaches for relevant case studies. Particular attention was paid to the strategy of interpretation of analytical data and new potentialities of Py(HMDS) -GC/MS are here reported.

Uncoated iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (10 nm in diameter) were formed by the coprecipitation reaction of ferrous and ferric salts. Then, they were added to a water-in-oil microemulsion where the hydrophilic silica shells were obtained through hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxyorthosilicate together with the corresponding <b>silylated</b> dye <b>derivatives</b> - a sulforhodamine was embedded in the inner silica shell and used as the reference dye while a pH-sensitive fluorescein was incorporated in the outer shell as the pH indicator. The magnetic nanoparticles were characterized using vibrating sample magnetometry, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The relationship between the analytical parameter, that is, the ratio of fluorescence between the sensing and reference dyes versus the pH was adjusted to a sigmoidal fit using a Boltzmann type equation giving an apparent pKa value of 6. 8. The fluorescence intensity of the reference dye did not change significantly (3. 0 %) on modifying the pH of the nanoparticle dispersion.

The measured differences in quality and quantity of the identified oxidation products provide insight into diagenetic processes in the surface marine sediments...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} a modified Stöber method for coating maghemite (?-Fe 2 O 3) nanocrystals with silica shells in order to built magnetic fluorescent sensor nanoparticles in the 50 – 70 nm diameter range. In detail, the magnetic cores were coated by two successive silica shells embedding two fluorophores (two different <b>silylated</b> dye <b>derivatives),</b> which allows for ratiometric pH-measurements in the pH range 5 – 8. Silica coated magnetic nanoparticles were prepared using maghemite nanocrystals as cores (5 – 10 nm in diameter) coated by tetraethoxyorthosilicate via hydrolysis/condensation in ethanol, catalyzed by ammonia. In the inner shell was covalently attached a sulforhodamine B, which was used as a reference dye; while a pH-sensitive fluorescein was incorporated into the outer shell. Once synthesized, the particles were characterized in terms of morphology, size, composition and magnetization, using dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). TEM analysis showed the nanoparticles to be very uniform in size. Wide-angle X-ray diffractograms showed, for uncoated as well as coated nanoparticles, typical peaks for the spinel structure of maghemite at the same diffraction angle, with no structural changes after coating. When using VSM, we obtained the magnetization curves of the resulting nanoparticles and the typical magnetization parameters as saturation magnetization (Ms), coercivity (Hc), and remanent magnetization (Mr). The dual-dye doped magnetic-silica nanoparticles showed a satisfactory magnetization that could be suitable for nanoparticle separation and localized concentration of them. Changes in fluorescence intensity of the pH indicator in the different pH buffered solutions were observed within few seconds indicating an easy accessibility of the embedded dye by protons through the pores of the silica shell. The relationship between the ratio in fluorescence (sensor/reference dyes) and pH was adjusted to a sigmoidal fit using a Boltzmann type equation. Finally, the proposed method was statistically validated against a reference procedure using samples of water and physiological buffer with 2 % (w/v) of horse serum added, indicating that there are no significant statistical differences at a 95 % confidence level...|$|R
