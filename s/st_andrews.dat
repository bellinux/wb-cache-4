5|$|He was {{pastor of}} the church of Calder Comitis, Midlothian, by September 1296. Both churches were {{indirectly}} under the patronage of the Bishop of <b>St</b> <b>Andrews,</b> William Fraser. The rector of Haddington was <b>St</b> <b>Andrews</b> Cathedral Priory and although the church of Calder Comitis was normally under the patronage of the Mormaer of Fife, {{at that point in time}} the wardship of the young mormaer's lands was being held by the Bishop of <b>St</b> <b>Andrews.</b>|$|E

5|$|In ecclesiastical affairs, Hugh {{attended}} the 1163 Council of Tours {{that was held}} by Pope Alexander III. In 1179 he {{attended the}} Lateran Council at Rome. It was {{while he was there}} that he became involved in the conflict between the king of Scots and the chapter of <b>St</b> <b>Andrews</b> over the election of the bishop of <b>St</b> <b>Andrews.</b> The king wanted his chaplain, another Hugh, and the chapter wanted John the Scot. The pope ordered Puiset to compel the king to obey, but in 1183 the controversy was solved by a compromise.|$|E
5|$|This {{situation}} was {{transformed by the}} founding of St John's College, <b>St</b> <b>Andrews</b> in 1418. Henry Wardlaw, bishop of <b>St.</b> <b>Andrews,</b> petitioned the anti-Pope Benedict XIII during the later stages of the Great Western Schism, when Scotland {{was one of his}} few remaining supporters. Wardlaw argued that Scottish scholars in other universities were being persecuted for their loyalty to the anti-Pope. St Salvator's College was added to <b>St.</b> <b>Andrews</b> in 1450. The other great bishoprics followed, with the University of Glasgow being founded in 1451 and the King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. Both were also papal foundations, by Nicholas V and Alexander VI respectively. St Leonard's College was added at <b>St.</b> <b>Andrews</b> in 1511. <b>St.</b> <b>Andrews</b> was deliberately modelled on Paris, and although Glasgow adopted the statues of the University of Bologna, there, like Aberdeen, there was an increasing Parisian influence, partly because all its early regents had been educated in Paris. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law. They provided only basic degrees. Those wanting to study for the more advanced degrees that were common amongst European scholars still needed to go to universities in other countries. As a result, Scottish scholars continued to visit the Continent and returned to English universities after they reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Until 1295, Nicholas was {{referred}} to as Nicholas of <b>St</b> <b>Andrews</b> (de Sancto Andrea), but in February of that year he began to be called de Balmyle, one source referring to him as de Balmyll dictus de Sancto Andrea (de Balmyle called de Sanctoandrea). It is probable that he adopted de Sancto Andrea when he finished training at <b>St</b> <b>Andrews</b> and went elsewhere, and that he dropped it in 1295 when he moved back.|$|E

Nicholas {{thereafter}} can be found exercising a senior role in Scottish affairs, and by early 1301 he was Chancellor of Scotland. In his late 60s or (more probably) his 70s by this stage, Nicholas was an extremely old man, yet in 1307 he became Bishop of Dunblane.

The <b>St</b> <b>Andrew's</b> association continued as a provider of first aid services and training, changing their trading name.|$|R
5|$|The {{problem was}} that this archiepiscopal status had not been cleared with the papacy, opening the way for English archbishops to claim overlordship of the whole Scottish church. The man {{responsible}} was the new aggressively assertive Archbishop of York, Thurstan. His easiest target was the bishopric of Glasgow, which being south of the river Forth was not regarded as part of Scotland nor the jurisdiction of <b>St</b> <b>Andrews.</b> In 1125, Pope Honorius II wrote to John, Bishop of Glasgow ordering him {{to submit to the}} archbishopric of York. David ordered Bishop John of Glasgow to travel to the Apostolic See in order to secure a pallium which would elevate the bishopric of <b>St</b> <b>Andrews</b> to an archbishopric with jurisdiction over Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Europe, {{the collapse of}} papal authority in the Papal Schism allowed the Scottish Crown to gain effective control of major ecclesiastical appointments within the kingdom. This de facto authority over appointments was formally recognised by the Papacy in 1487. This led to the placement of clients and relatives of the king in key positions, including James IV's illegitimate son Alexander, who was nominated as Archbishop of <b>St.</b> <b>Andrews</b> {{at the age of}} 11, intensifying royal influence and also opening the Church to accusations of venality and nepotism. James IV used his pilgrimages to Tain and Whithorn to help bring the respective regions of Ross and Galloway, which lay on the edges of the kingdom, under royal authority. Relationships between the Scottish Crown and the Papacy were generally good, with James IV receiving tokens of papal favour. In 1472 <b>St</b> <b>Andrews</b> became the first archbishopric in the Scottish church, to be followed by Glasgow in 1492.|$|E
