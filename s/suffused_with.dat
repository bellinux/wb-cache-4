5|$|The Solar System {{is in the}} Local Interstellar Cloud or Local Fluff. It {{is thought}} to be near the {{neighbouring}} G-Cloud but it is not known if the Solar System is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or if it is in the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud and G-Cloud are interacting. The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is <b>suffused</b> <b>with</b> high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.|$|E

60|$|Such {{propping}} and backing has M. de Calonne; {{and then}} intrinsically such qualities! Hope radiates from his face; persuasion hangs on his tongue. For all straits he has present remedy, {{and will make}} the world roll on wheels before him. On the 3d of November 1783, the Oeil-de-Boeuf rejoices in its new Controller-General. Calonne also shall have trial; Calonne also, in his way, as Turgot and Necker had done in theirs, shall forward the consummation; <b>suffuse,</b> <b>with</b> one other flush of brilliancy, our now too leaden-coloured Era of Hope, and wind it up--into fulfilment.|$|R

25|$|Although {{they have}} never been seen, Higgslike fields play an {{important}} role in theories of the universe and in string theory. Under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of Einsteinian physics, they can become <b>suffused</b> <b>with</b> energy that exerts an antigravitational force. Such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Underside ochraceous light brown, shaded with orange-yellow on apex of forewing {{and on the}} {{anterior}} portion of the postdiscal band on the hindwing; the markings similar on the upperside but somewhat diffuse, the discoidal streak and posterior half of inner sub-terminal band on forewing and the postdiscal band posteriorly on the hindwing <b>suffused</b> <b>with</b> very pale bluish pink; the interspaces of the ground colour smallish darker brown blotches, forming on the hindwing a conspicuous discal transverse series of spots in the interspaces; the dorsal margin of the hindwing broadly bluish white.|$|E

25|$|The letter {{shown in}} her right hand {{contains}} a demand from David for her to choose between fidelity to her husband or obedience to her king, and is an anecdotal catalyst for her introspection. In representing this moment, Rembrandt extrapolated from the biblical text, which treated Bathsheba incidentally while focusing on David's sinfulness. As a result, her expression is profound enough to suggest not only her sense of resignation, but the broader narrative as well. As a conception of the nude figure <b>suffused</b> <b>with</b> complexity of thought, Bathsheba at Her Bath is nearly unique in art.|$|E
25|$|Writing for the majority, Justice Blackmun {{noted that}} the courts had {{not come up with}} an {{analytically}} sound distinction between traditional and non-traditional governmental operations. He {{noted that the}} Court had adopted a similar distinction decades earlier in challenges to the federal government's taxation of the operations of state governments, only to reject it as well. The Court denounced any efforts to draw this distinction, whether based on the historical record or on historical grounds, as arbitrary and likely to be <b>suffused</b> <b>with</b> the prejudices of an unelected branch of government as to which governmental functions are proper and traditional and which ones are not.|$|E

Hindwing black, inwardly red-margined spots superposed on the pink area in interspaces 6 and 7. Cilia very narrow, pale pink. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, thorax above and the abdomen on the sides streaked with greenish grey; beneath: ochreous grey touched on the thorax with pink.|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} by which people learn to make sense and make sense to learn is of both theoretical and practical importance. In a world <b>suffuse</b> <b>with</b> dynamic complexity in which unusual, unexpected and unprecedented events occur on a persistent basis, this challenges {{the relevance of the}} sensemaking perspective. We put forward a rebalanced model of sensemaking to make the sensable once again sensible, and open up the sensemaking perspective to understand learning as a process that is more than mere interpretation and attends to embodied sensemaking through adopting a thorough-going process approach. This way, we extend both the grasp and the reach of the sensemaking perspective to make sense of learning and to learn to make sense...|$|R

25|$|As {{with almost}} all {{carnivorous}} plants, the flowers of butterworts are held {{far above the}} rest of the plant by a long stalk, {{in order to reduce the}} probability of trapping potential pollinators. The single, long-lasting flowers are zygomorphic, with two lower lip petals characteristic of the bladderwort family, and a spur extending from the back of the flower. The calyx has five sepals, and the petals are arranged in a two-part lower lip and a three-part upper lip. Most butterwort flowers are blue, violet or white, often <b>suffused</b> <b>with</b> a yellow, greenish or reddish tint. P. laueana and the newly described P. caryophyllacea are unique in having a strikingly red flowers. Butterworts are often cultivated and hybridized primarily for their flowers.|$|E

In the female this band is outwardly narrowly bordered with brown. Cilia white.

Male with a patch of specialized dark scales above vein 4 on the upperside of the hindwing.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 9 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is creamy ochreous, but paler creamy in the distal {{half of the}} wing.
