5|$|The {{building}} incorporated {{many modern}} features, such as <b>sound-proofing</b> and under-seat heating, {{and it was}} also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting. It had a seating capacity of 1,400 in the stalls and 600 in the circle, with a further 146 seats in the café area. When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, but this was removed when the A56 was widened. During the Second World War the building was used for concerts, including one given by a young Julie Andrews. It also played host to the Hallé Orchestra after the orchestra's own home, the Free Trade Hall, was bombed and severely damaged during the Manchester Blitz of 1940.|$|E
25|$|On March 1, 1996, The Lab {{began its}} {{move into the}} Redstone Building from its {{original}} location at 1805 and 1807 Divisadero Street, where, since 1984 it had run a black-box theater, art gallery and working facilities for artists: SoundLab, DesignLab, PrintLab and PhotoLab. The new Redstone space was too costly, so a floor-to-ceiling wall was built that reduced the overall space by 1/3. It is the same 3,000 sq ft footprint The Lab occupies today. Early projects include the mural project, <b>sound-proofing,</b> and The Lab's signature visual, sound, music and performance programming.|$|E
500|$|Work {{to convert}} the {{basement}} of the New Public Offices began, under the supervision of Ismay and Sir Leslie Hollis, in June 1938. The work included installing communications and broadcasting equipment, <b>sound-proofing,</b> ventilation and reinforcement. Meanwhile, by the summer of 1938 the War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry had developed the concept of a Central War Room that would facilitate discussion and decision-making between the Chiefs of Staff of the armed forces.|$|E
40|$|Two-factor {{authentication}} protects online accounts even if passwords are leaked. Most users, however, prefer password-only authentication. One {{reason why}} two-factor authentication is so unpopular is the extra steps that the user must complete {{in order to}} log in. Currently deployed two-factor authentication mechanisms require the user to interact with his phone to, for example, copy a verification code to the browser. Two-factor authentication schemes that eliminate user-phone interaction exist, but require additional software to be deployed. In this paper we propose <b>Sound-Proof,</b> a usable and deployable two-factor authentication mechanism. <b>Sound-Proof</b> does not require interaction between the user and his phone. In <b>Sound-Proof</b> the second authentication factor is {{the proximity of the}} user's phone to the device being used to log in. The proximity of the two devices is verified by comparing the ambient noise recorded by their microphones. Audio recording and comparison are transparent to the user, so that the user experience is similar to the one of password-only authentication. <b>Sound-Proof</b> can be easily deployed as it works with current phones and major browsers without plugins. We build a prototype for both Android and iOS. We provide empirical evidence that ambient noise is a robust discriminant to determine the proximity of two devices both indoors and outdoors, and even if the phone is in a pocket or purse. We conduct a user study designed to compare the perceived usability of <b>Sound-Proof</b> with Google 2 -Step Verification. Participants ranked <b>Sound-Proof</b> as more usable and the majority would be willing to use <b>Sound-Proof</b> even for scenarios in which two-factor authentication is optional.

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the KAL-2 is a {{stressed skin}} alloy semi-monocoque with a 240hp (179kW) Lycoming GO-435 flat-six engine {{installed in the}} nose, driving a two blade variable-pitch propeller. [...] The military prototypes had the -435-C2 engine variant but civil KAT-2s were intended to have a -435-C2B. The side-by-side seating in the KAL-2 required a wider fuselage {{than that of the}} KAT-1; unlike the KAL-1, where the rear cabin roof merged into the upper fuselage line, the transparent roof of the KAL-2s cabin drops down aft to a lower rear fuselage. There are two seats in front, fitted with dual control and a bench seat for two or three passengers behind. [...] Those at the front have an explosively released starboard side door for emergency escape, rear seat occupants leaving via canopy roof panels. [...] The interior has <b>sound-proofing</b> and air-conditioning. The KAL-2 has a retractable tricycle undercarriage with oleo-pneumatic shock absorbers and hydraulic brakes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the CR110 was {{upgraded}} {{and became}} the CR111. With extended <b>sound-proofing</b> for its time, it was marketed as the [...] "silent bus". The same year, Scania also introduced a new range of longitudally rear-engined coaches known as the CR85 and the CR145. While CR85 had the small 8-litre engine, the CR145 was powered by a 14-litre V8 engine. The coaches were built until 1978, but never sold very well. In 1973, one right-hand drive CR145 prototype was built in Sweden, with the finishing touches done by MCW, but it remained {{the only one of}} its kind. The CR111 was replaced by the all-new CR112 in 1978. With its angular design, the CR112 was called a [...] "shoebox". As with the BR112 chassis being renamed the N112, the CR112 was renamed the CN112 in 1984, and it was also launched in an articulated version. A North American version of the CN112 was built in around 250 units between 1984 and 1988. The CK112 was launched as a simple coach or intercity bus in 1986, sharing most of the styling with the CN112. With the launch of the 3-series in 1988, both the CN112 and CK112 were upgraded to CN113 and CK113. The CK113 was replaced by the L113-based CL113 in 1991 with new rectangular headlights, but production ended in 1992. Less than 100 units of the CK112/CK113/CL113 were ever built.|$|E

50|$|The Safrane's {{design was}} a {{deliberate}} effort to overcome the R25's main weaknesses — insufficient chassis stiffness and poor build quality. Renault was also keen to take noise reduction to best-in-class levels. These constraints resulted in a much heavier car than its predecessor (+200-300 kg / 440-660 lb.) due to a heavily reinforced chassis and the liberal use of <b>sound-proofing</b> materials.|$|E
