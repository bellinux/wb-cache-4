5|$|Also in 1933 Whale {{directed}} the romantic comedy By Candlelight which gained good reviews {{and was a}} modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed One More River, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Galsworthy. The film tells the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal had a difficult time securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> {{separated}} from her husband when the plane crashes {{was going to be}} used for Kate, but when Kate's role in the series changed the producers kept that story for Rose. Much of the couple's story prior to the plane crash was based on the events of Caldwell's life; she married her husband even though he was dying. Due to Caldwell and Anderson having other acting commitments, the writers found it difficult finding time when both actors could appear together in the show, resulting in neither character featuring in most of season three. Critics reacted positively to the couple, often hoping they would appear more frequently, and both actors were praised for their work.|$|E

25|$|The {{filming of}} Ploning was entirely {{done on the}} {{municipality}} of Cuyo in Palawan. It was directed by Dante Nico Garcia, who incidentally, {{is a native of}} the town. According to him, the film is based on his childhood memories of the town. When he wrote the screenplay for the film with Benjamin Lingan, he decided to use his native tongue, Cuyonon. He had stated that the inspiration for the character Judy Ann Santos played in the film is based on a Cuyonon folk song about a girl's hidden feelings, originally sung by a male but was first recorded by a female. This led him to think of a <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> singing the song while remembering her lover.|$|E

25|$|In 1920, Menichelli {{starred in}} La Storia di Una Donna (The <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Woman),</b> her first {{production}} at Rinascimento Film. Highly unusually for the time, {{the story of}} the protagonist is told through an extended flashback. An unconscious woman with gunshot wounds is brought into the city hospital. After conversing with her doctor, a detective finds the woman's diary, which is then used {{to tell the story of}} her life. At the end of the film, the unknown woman dies, having never regained consciousness, and the detective sets off to arrest her killer.

25|$|S. L. Bhyrappa, {{a charismatic}} young writer, {{first came to}} {{attention}} in the 1960s with his first novel Dharmasri, although it was his Vamsavriksha ("Family Tree", 1966) that {{put him in the}} spotlight as one of Kannada's most popular novelists. It is a story of a respected scholar, Srinivasa Srotri, his family and their long-held values. The protagonist's young and widowed daughter-in-law wishes to remarry, putting his family tradition at risk. Bhyrappa's best novel of the period was Grihabhanga ("Breaking of a Home", 1970), a <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> surviving under tragic circumstances. The characters in the story are rustic and often use vulgar language. His other important novel is Parva, a major work in Kannada fiction acclaimed as an admirable attempt at recreating life on the sub-continent {{during the time of the}} epic Mahabharata.|$|E
25|$|In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Helene experienced {{the first of many}} miscarriages. In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named Mrs. Smith, Helene tells the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who has trouble bringing a baby to full term. Helene wrote that Mrs. Smith was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident. Mrs. Smith, however, took solace in the deep love of her father and older sister. When she married and wanted to have a child, Mrs. Smith had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When she was about to become a mother herself, Mrs. Smith's fear about identifying with her mother intensified. This fear came to fruition when Mrs. Smith gave birth to a still born child one month before full term.|$|E
