2500|$|A [...] "strike team" [...] is a {{deployment}} of appliances {{out of their}} usual area of operation. A strike team is made up as an operational unit to simplify incident command and control. A strike team consists of 5 fire appliances and a leading command car. The most common configuration is 4 Fire fighting appliances and 1 Bulk water carrier. Strike teams generally have a purpose for example a campaign strike team (with {{a full range of}} appliances) or an Impact strike team which consists of 5 fire trucks, mostly small and manoeuvrable (14's or 24's). Typically Strike teams are sourced from a group, and are named after their group. (e.g., A strike team from Swanport Group would be called [...] "Swanport strike team"). Strike teams however can be composite made up from appliances from a number of groups. Strike teams are often deployed to regional areas for several days deployment. Often a strike team will be in charge of a particular <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Photoelectric smoke {{detectors}} respond faster to fire in its early, smouldering stage (before it breaks into flame). [...] The {{smoke from the}} smouldering stage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> is typically made up of large combustion particles—between 0.3 and 10.0µm. Ionization {{smoke detectors}} respond faster (typically 30–60 seconds) in the flaming stage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> The smoke from the flaming stage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> is typically made up of microscopic combustion particles—between 0.01 and 0.3µm. Also, ionization detectors are weaker in high air-flow environments, and because of this, the photoelectric smoke detector is more reliable for detecting smoke in both the smoldering and flaming stages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R

Henry S. Parmelee of New Haven, Connecticut invented and installed the first closed-head or automated fire sprinkler in 1874.|$|R
