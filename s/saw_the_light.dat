5|$|In late 2013 {{and early}} 2014, Hiddleston starred {{as the title}} {{character}} in the Donmar Warehouse production of Coriolanus, winning the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Actor. In 2015, he starred in Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, Ben Wheatley's High Rise, and played the troubled country music singer Hank Williams in the biopic I <b>Saw</b> <b>The</b> <b>Light.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Macpherson's {{squadron}} {{reached the}} high ground an Ottoman patrol <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> horsemen, but before they could alert the Tiberias garrison, they was quickly cut off and captured. By the time a squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment advancing from Semakh, reached the outskirts of Tiberias at 11:30, all approaches were held by squadrons of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade.|$|E
2500|$|The crew on the German {{cargo vessel}} the Christian Sartori {{witnessed}} {{the sinking of}} the Bradley through their binoculars. [...] They <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> go out on the fore part of the ship while the aft end of the ship remained lit. Then they <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> on <b>the</b> aft end go out so that the silhouette of the ship remained barely visible. A short time later they heard an explosion and saw a red, yellow and white column of flame. [...] They [...] "concluded that the Bradley had exploded".|$|R
60|$|He {{walked away}} feebly into <b>the</b> darkness. We <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> {{of a vehicle}} on the high-road: after a while we heard the bang of a door, and a cab rattled away.|$|R
50|$|During {{the night}} the Peruvian {{warships}} were sailing off the Chilean coast to Arica, when they <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> of Antofagasta. Admiral Grau decided to engage any Chilean vessel at the port, intending to inflict some damage.|$|R
5|$|A Dexter's Laboratory combat-style action {{video game}} for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube was set to be {{developed}} by n-Space, published by BAM! Entertainment, and distributed by Acclaim Entertainment for a 2004 release, but the project was cancelled. On February 15, 2005, Midway Games announced plans to develop and produce a new Dexter's Laboratory video game for multiple consoles, but the game never <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day.|$|E
25|$|Buoyed by {{the success}} of the {{original}} line, a 3.6-kilometre, four stop extension of the route opened on 13 August 2000. This <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> rail reach Lilyfield, which was then the limit of the closed section of the goods line.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, the long delayed Chatur Singh Two Star <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day after three years. Run Bhola Run remains {{unreleased}} following the shutting {{down of the}} production company Shree Ashtavinayak Cine Vision, despite the trailer and posters being unveiled in late 2010.|$|E

60|$|He pointed downwards. For {{a moment}} the clouds had parted. Thousands of feet below, like little pinpricks of red fire, they <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> of Monte Carlo. Almost as they looked, the clouds closed up again. It was {{as though they had}} peered into another world.|$|R

25|$|Aside from a cameo in the Avengers Forever limited series, Death's Head II was not {{featured}} in a Marvel comic again until 2009. A planned Punisher-Death's Head II series never <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day, and Liam Sharp pitched a revival on which Marvel passed.|$|E
25|$|During the Sentimental Hygiene {{sessions}}, Zevon {{also participated}} in an all-night jam session with Berry, Buck and Mills, as they worked their way through rock and blues numbers {{by the likes of}} Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and Prince. Though the sessions were not initially intended for release, they eventually <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day as a Hindu Love Gods album.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> Extended Play, a two-disc EP CD/DVD {{compilation}} {{that features}} exclusive unreleased remixes and UK B-sides, {{as well as}} a 35-minute bonus DVD, that included a 27 minutes documentary titled Once Upon a Time in the East: Ladytron in China based on their short 2004 tour in China. In the same year Ladytron recorded The Harmonium Sessions, which contained four songs from their third studio album, performed unplugged.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm Isaac Fasick, and I own {{the farm}} {{down the road}} a spell. I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> here, and as Mr. Ford asked me {{to keep an eye}} on his {{property}} I made up my mind I'd come over and see what it meant. Is he here on a visit?" ...|$|R
60|$|They waited patiently, {{until they}} <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> in <b>the</b> zenana windows extinguished. Then they crept quietly up, {{and placed the}} ladder under the window at which the signal had been shown; and found that their {{calculations}} were correct, and that it reached to a few inches below the sill.|$|R
6000|$|Purun Bhagat dropped fainting by his side, for {{the chill}} of the rain and that fierce climb were killing him; but first he called to the {{scattered}} torches ahead, [...] "Stay and count your numbers"; then, whispering to the deer as he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> gather in a cluster: [...] "Stay with me, Brother. Stay--till--I--go!" ...|$|R
25|$|Not completed. Only a march {{sequence}} {{from this}} opera <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day, {{as the second}} movement of his Symphony No. 2 in C minor {{and a few other}} segments are occasionally heard as concert pieces. Interestingly, while Tchaikovsky revised the Second symphony twice in his lifetime, he did not alter the second movement (taken from the Undina material) during either revision. The rest of the score of Undina was destroyed by the composer.|$|E
25|$|Boullée's ideas {{had a major}} {{influence}} on his contemporaries, not least because of his role in teaching other important architects such as Jean Chalgrin, Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart, and Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand. Some of his work only <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day in the 20th century; his book Architecture, essai sur l'art ("Essay on the Art of Architecture), arguing for an emotionally committed Neoclassicism, was only published in 1953. The volume contained his work from 1778 to 1788, which mostly comprised designs for public buildings on a wholly impractical grand scale.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{release of}} Morente, El Pequeño Reloj, <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> in 2003. Whereas {{the second half}} of the CD is a more or less random collection of songs, the first half of the record comprises a surprising series of songs which are broken in two parts: in the first part of the song, Morente's voice is superimposed on top of old 78 r.p.m recordings of old masters of the flamenco guitar like Ramón Montoya, Sabicas or Manolo de Huelva, while the second part is a modern development of the same palo, with the side guitar of the young and innovative guitarist Niño Josele.|$|E
60|$|The Dora {{had been}} {{provided}} with several long, patent sweeps, {{and for a}} while both of the young rascals used these, in an endeavor to get the houseboat out {{into the middle of the}} river. In <b>the</b> distance they <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> of a steamboat and this was all they had to guide them.|$|R
60|$|The {{doors of}} the public-house at the corner were {{swinging}} wide, and he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> and <b>the</b> smiling barmaids, heard the many voices discussing the fight and the prosperous chink of money on the bar. Somebody called to {{him to have a}} drink. He hesitated perceptibly, then refused and went on his way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{got down}} into the room all right, and I got the safe open, {{and there was the}} money, and, right facing me, my letters and bonds, and pretty well a hundred {{thousand}} dollars in cash. And then I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> flare up, and Murchison was there in his shirt and trousers.|$|R
25|$|Around 1770 Antoine Dauvergne {{planned to}} set La Bruère's {{libretto}} {{in collaboration with}} Jean-Claude Trial and Pierre Montan Berton. All three composers were admirers of Rameau. Berton wrote {{the majority of the}} score. Linus was scheduled to be part of celebrations at Versailles but it was cancelled. It was rescheduled for the following year and went into rehearsal on 4 April 1771 but was never staged because of problems with the fifth act and was replaced by Monsigny's Aline, reine de Golconde. In the 1790s Berton's son Henri Montan Berton made another attempt at setting the libretto but this version never <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day.|$|E
25|$|Thus began Swaminatha Iyer's long {{search for}} the {{original}} texts of ancient literary works during which he regularly worked with S. V. Damodaram Pillai. It was a search that lasted until his death. Many people voluntarily parted with the manuscripts in their possession. Swaminatha Iyer visited almost every hamlet and knocked at every door. He employed all the resources at his command {{to get at the}} works. As a result, a large number of literary works which were gathering dust as palm-leaf manuscripts in lofts, storerooms, boxes and cupboards <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day. Of them, the Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai and Purananuru were received by Tamil lovers with a lot of enthusiasm. Purananuru, which mirrored the lives of Tamils during the Sangam period, prompted scholarly research on the subject. In a span of about five decades, Swaminatha Iyer published about 100 books, including minor poems, lyrics, puranas and bhakti (devotional) works.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} part of the 1989 season, the team had to prequalify - a task that was nearly never {{achieved}} by Gabriele Tarquini and Yannick Dalmas. AGS then finished 15th in the Constructors' Championship, equal with the Lolas used by the Larrousse team. During the summer months, there were strong rumours that AGS would soon use a new W12 engine developed by the French designer Guy Nègre. This strange MGN (Moteurs Guy Nègre) machine <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day in late 1988 and was tested in an old AGS JH22 chassis in the summer of 1989. It was clear that AGS was not related to these tests; they were completely private attempts by Nègre. The engine never found its way to a Grand Prix but it was announced to be used in a 1990 Le Mans car called Norma M6. The car was presented and attempted to race, but failed to qualify over engine issues.|$|E

5000|$|A {{family in}} Hanover Township {{reported}} seeing <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> from their home. An 11-year-old, Kristin Hurley {{was the first}} to notice <b>the</b> <b>lights.</b> Paul Hurley, a pilot, <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> and said they were not planes. The Hurley Family took video of <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> which appeared on Fox News. Hurley stated, [...] "I have been in the aviation industry for 20 years and have never seen anything like this, a little scary, little scary." ...|$|R
60|$|But at nightfall {{they came}} into the wide mouth of the River Phasis, that flows through {{the land of the}} world's end, and they <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> burning in <b>the</b> palace of Æêtes the king. So now they were come to the last stage of their journey, and there they slept, and dreamed of the Fleece of Gold.|$|R
25|$|After the defeat, Wilson {{was once}} again scornful of Buller’s lack of {{progress}} and of his predictions {{that he would be}} in Ladysmith by 5 February. That month <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> Brigade take the hill at Vaal Krantz (6 February) before being withdrawn by Buller the following evening. Wilson recorded that Buller was right as {{he did not have the}} 3:1 numerical superiority needed to storm entrenched positions, but by 20 February Wilson was again expressing his frustration at Buller’s slowness in exploiting further recent victories. Leo Amery later told a malicious story of Wilson had suggested gathering the brigade majors together to arrest their commanding general, although Wilson in fact seems to have thought highly of Lyttelton at this time. He was also highly critical of Fitzroy Hart (“perfect disgrace … quite mad & incapable under fire”), commanding general of the Irish Brigade, for attacking Inniskilling Hill in close order on 24 February (see Battle of the Tugela Heights), and, on the same day, leaving the Durham Light Infantry (part of the Light Brigade) exposed to attack (Wilson visited the position, and they were withdrawn on 27 February after Wilson lobbied Lyttelton and Warren), and for leaving Wilson to organise a defence against a Boer night attack on Light Brigade HQ after refusing Light Brigade requests to post pickets. The Light Brigade finally took Inniskilling Hill on 27 February and Ladysmith was relieved the following day, allowing Wilson to meet his old friend Rawlinson, who had been besieged there, again.|$|E
500|$|Writer Herbert Steinhouse, who {{interviewed him}} in 1948, wrote that [...] "Schindler's {{exceptional}} deeds stemmed from just that elementary sense of decency and humanity that our sophisticated age seldom sincerely believes in. A repentant opportunist <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and rebelled against the sadism and vile criminality all around him." [...] In a 1983 television documentary, Schindler {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "I felt that the Jews were being destroyed. I had to help them; there was no choice." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} in June 2014 that Hiddleston would play country music singer Hank Williams in the 2015 biopic I <b>Saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light,</b> based on the 1994 biography. It was directed by Marc Abraham and started shooting in Louisiana in October 2014. In 2017, Hiddleston starred in Legendary Pictures' King Kong film, [...] It was released on 10 March, and was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. He is also set to reprise his role as Loki in , scheduled for release on 3 November 2017, as well as [...] (2018) and its as yet untitled sequel (2019).|$|E
60|$|I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> of Bordeaux when it {{was quite}} dark, a nebulous haze against black; of that I am {{reasonably}} sure. But certainly our fall took place in <b>the</b> cold, uncertain <b>light</b> of early dawn. I am, at least, equally sure of that. And Mimizan, near where we dropped, is fifty miles from Bordeaux, whose harbour lights I must have seen.|$|R

Anyhow, I saw no more of them." ...|$|R
