Kirsten often stated {{that he wanted to}} spend time with his two growing sons, Joshua and James, and wife and <b>said</b> <b>three</b> years away from home was long enough. Immediately after the announcement Kirsten was linked with joining South Africa as their coach as the South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl also announced his contract would end after the World Cup as well.|$|E
25|$|That <b>said,</b> <b>three</b> of {{the four}} major {{international}} charities in the region are religious in nature: Northwest Medical Teams International, World Concern, World Vision International, and Mercy Corps. This is part of a long tradition of activist religion. The Skid Road Group, a shelter offering soup and sermons to the unemployed and recovering alcoholics, was launched in Vancouver, with the Salvation Army having deep roots in the Gastown district, dating back to the era of the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1880s) and attained prominence in the same centers during the Klondike Gold Rush.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{game that}} is {{isomorphic}} to tic-tac-toe, but on the surface appears completely different. It is called Pick15 or Number Scrabble. Two players in turn say a number between one and nine. A particular number may not be repeated. The game is won by the player who has <b>said</b> <b>three</b> numbers whose sum is 15. If all the numbers are used and no one gets three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw. Plotting these numbers on a 3×3 magic square shows that the game exactly corresponds with tic-tac-toe, since three numbers will be arranged {{in a straight line}} if and only if they total 15.|$|E
25|$|The canons {{were much}} {{employed}} {{in managing the}} abbey's substantial estates, which {{seem to have been}} worked mainly by indentured servants and later by wage labour. A fairly high proportion of the abbey's land was kept in demesne, cultivated from granges. The Lilleshall estate alone had four of these and there was a ring of further granges in Shropshire and Staffordshire, with two outlying at Blackfordby and Grindlow. The grange at Blackfordby seems to have absorbed {{a good deal of time}} and labour, with canons often staying there. There was even a chapel on site, with mass <b>said</b> <b>three</b> times a week. This was strictly irregular, as it was considered perilous to the soul for a canon to reside anywhere alone, and there were complaints about it from the Bishop of Lichfield. However, the nature of the abbey's estates meant that canons would often require leave to travel. Both this and the increasingly unfavourable agrarian conditions and labour market of the 14th century meant that direct exploitation of demesnes was gradually reduced in favour of leasing out land.|$|E
25|$|Statements were {{collected}} from all the crew. These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on standard forms in identical handwriting with similar phrasing. Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company, {{and that it had}} been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship, rather than the one which he described. Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes. Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify. In contrast to his statement at the inquest, Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship, not one. In an interview in 1933, Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo. Most witnesses said there had been two, but a couple <b>said</b> <b>three,</b> possibly involving a second submarine. Clem Edwards, representing the seamen's union, attempted to introduce evidence about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey.|$|E

Instead, she claims that Peggy is based on women she has seen in East End pubs and her own mother: [...] "women whose hair is great and their outfits are more Walthamstow market, they get it wrong slightly...Some things I've done with Peggy is from my Mum. She {{was one of those}} East End snobs. I drew on all of those experiences." [...] In a 2009 radio {{interview}} with Dale Winton, Windsor <b>said</b> <b>three</b> people have influenced her portrayal of Peggy: Violet Kray (thus retracting her earlier statement), her own mother, and the actor Mike Reid, who played her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Hezbollah fighters {{crossed the}} border from Lebanon and took over eight villages in the Al-Qusayr District of Syria. On 16–17 February 2013, Syrian {{opposition}} groups claimed that Hezbollah, backed by the Syrian military, attacked three neighboring Sunni villages controlled by the Free Syrian Army (FSA). An FSA spokesman said, [...] "Hezbollah's invasion {{is the first of}} its kind in terms of organisation, planning and coordination with the Syrian regime's air force". Hezbollah <b>said</b> <b>three</b> Lebanese Shiites, [...] "acting in self-defense", were killed in the clashes with the FSA. Lebanese security sources said that the three were Hezbollah members. In response, the FSA allegedly attacked two Hezbollah positions on 21 February; one in Syria and one in Lebanon. Five days later, it said it destroyed a convoy carrying Hezbollah fighters and Syrian officers to Lebanon, killing all the passengers.|$|E
500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength {{to come back here}} – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I <b>said</b> <b>three</b> or four months ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E
