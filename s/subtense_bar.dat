50|$|A {{theodolite}} is used {{to measure}} the angle between indicators on the two ends of the <b>subtense</b> <b>bar.</b> The distance from the telescope to the <b>subtense</b> <b>bar</b> is the height of an isosceles triangle formed with the theodolite at the upper vertex and the <b>subtense</b> <b>bar</b> length at its base, determined by trigonometry.|$|E
50|$|Another device used in {{tacheometry}} is the <b>subtense</b> <b>bar.</b> This is a rigid rod, usually of {{a material}} insensitive {{to change in}} temperature such as invar, of fixed length (typically two metres). The <b>subtense</b> <b>bar</b> is mounted on a tripod over the station to which the distance is desired. It is brought to level and a small telescope on the bar enables the bar to be oriented perpendicular {{to the line of}} sight to the angle measuring station.|$|E
50|$|The survey lab has a {{collection}} of transit theodolites, electronic theodolite, dumpy levels, engineering chains, measuring tapes, plane table, prismatic compass, total station, planimeter, and <b>subtense</b> <b>bar</b> 2m.|$|E
5000|$|Subtense Valley (...) is {{a mostly}} {{ice-free}} valley, 1.5 nautical miles (2.8 km) long, located 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) northwest of Tabular Mountain {{in the west}} extremity of Quartermain Mountains, Victoria Land. The name {{is one of a}} group in the area associated with surveying applied in 1993 by New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB). A <b>subtense</b> <b>bar</b> is a fixed base (usually 2 meters long) used in conjunction with a theodolite in the calculation of horizontal distance.|$|E
40|$|Five optical {{theodolites}} {{of different}} designs and least counts are compared for accuracy in reading horizontal angles. A <b>subtense</b> <b>bar</b> of an accurately known length and a Wild T 3 precision theodolite {{are used for}} this purpose. Subtended angles are first measured using the Wild T 3. These are then remeasured using each of the test instruments. The root-mean-square-error values of angle measurement are then computed as standard deviations. The best accuracy values are obtained with the double-reading micrometer theodolites. However, in almost all cases considered, the optical scale-reading theodolites give accuracy values approximating those obtained with a single-reading micrometer type of instrument...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{document}} the development of an accurate, affordable, reliable machine to perform the relatively long distance measurements routinely made by land surveyors. Prior to the development of the technology, surveyors used a variety of contact instruments for measurement: ropes, rods, poles, chains and steel tapes. The difficulty of obtaining results on long measurements by contact devices led innovators of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries to develop alternate non-contact methods of measuring: <b>subtense</b> <b>bar,</b> stadia wires and triangulation, all of which came with their own inadequacies. In 1951, Erik Bergstrand, a physicist with the Swedish Geographical Survey Office culminated thirteen years of research by bringing an electronic distance meter which measured distances based on the speed of light to the market. Research efforts undertaken during and after World War II in applied electronics and wave propagation led to the maser, which allowed South Africans Harry Baumann and T. L. Wadley to develop and market a device using the microwave spectrum to measure. Maser research was the progenitor of the laser, which led to the discovery of the lasing properties of a Gallium Arsenide diode emitting light in the infrared spectrum...|$|E
