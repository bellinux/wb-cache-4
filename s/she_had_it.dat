5|$|Mila Kunis and Lacey Chabert {{have both}} voiced Meg Griffin. Chabert left the series because of time {{conflicts}} with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five.

Once she claimed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> under control, MacFarlane hired her.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} episode to have Mila Kunis {{providing}} the voice of Meg. Lacey Chabert, the original voice of Meg, left the series due to time constraints with her acting role in Party of Five, as well as schoolwork. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, {{in part due to}} her performance on That '70s Show. Seth MacFarlane, the show's creator, called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> under control, MacFarlane hired her.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, her elder daughter, Denise, {{kept the}} {{notebook}} containing the manuscript of Suite française {{for fifty years}} without reading it, believing that it would indeed be a journal or diary too painful to read. In the late 1990s, having made arrangements to donate her mother's papers to a French archive, Denise decided to examine the notebook first. At last discovering what it contained, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> published in France in 2004.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that Mary, Queen of Scots – King George III's ancestor – also suffered from acute intermittent porphyria, although this is subject to much debate. It is assumed she inherited the disorder, if indeed <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>it,</b> from her father, James V of Scotland; both father and daughter endured well documented attacks that could fall within the constellation of symptoms of porphyria.|$|E
25|$|This stone, {{signed by}} the runemaster Öpir, is found at Sjusta near Skokloster.

They added that the place where Spjallboði had died was i olafs kriki, and several scholars have discussed the meaning of these runes.|$|E

25|$|It was {{morning and}} Belacqua {{was stuck in}} the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither {{backward}} nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there, Dante also, and she explained the spots on the moon to him.

500|$|Mila Kunis is {{the voice}} of the {{character}} named Meg Griffin. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> under control, MacFarlane hired her. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat". She further explained, [...] "Meg gets picked on a lot. But it's funny. It's like the middle child. She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 14-year-old, when you're kind of going through puberty and what-not. She's just in a perpetual mode of humiliation. And it's fun." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{her best}} bit of phrasing and it pleased Benham very much.

500|$|After the parade, Carol set out {{to destroy}} his mother's {{popularity}} among Romanians and tried to push {{her out of the}} country. Marie, however, did not comply, instead retreating to either of two locales. The first was Bran Castle. Located near Brașov in southern Transylvania and given to her as a gift in 1920 by grateful local officials, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> restored over the next seven years. The other was Balchik, where she had built a palace and a small chapel called Stella Maris and tended to her garden. She also visited Ileana and her children in Austria. Ileana rarely received permission from Carol to visit Romania; this irritated Marie greatly. She also spent some time in Belgrade with her daughter [...] "Mignon" [...] and her son-in-law, King Alexander. In 1934, Marie visited England once again, meeting the Duchess of York, later Queen Elizabeth, by whom she was enchanted.|$|E
500|$|Directed by Hannah Lux Davis, it is Aguilera's first {{music video}} as a soloist {{in four years}} and, despite the song being more than three minutes long, the video itself is 96 seconds in length. It {{consists}} of the singer sitting in a multi-colored room dressed in disco-themed sequined clothes, including knee-high boots, with a large hair style as she holds a disco ball. She is also seen lying down on a glittering pool table. Deepa Lakshmin of MTV News thought that given the theme of The Get Down, it [...] "makes sense" [...] that the video should be disco-themed. Writing for Billboard, Taylor Weatherby noted that the video is [...] "short-but-sweet" [...] and did not blame her for wanting to celebrate the song reaching number-one and having some fun. Joey Nolfi for Entertainment Weekly wrote that her large hair style was reminiscent of how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> {{around the time of}} the release of Moulin Rouge!. Gay Times writer Daniel Megarry joked that the size of Aguilera's hair would [...] "make RuPaul jealous".|$|E
500|$|Her love of tattoos, however, gained media {{attention}} in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos {{of the word}} [...] "fuck" [...] on their ribs. Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an [...] "Abbey Dawn" [...] on her left forearm and an [...] "XXV" [...] and star on her right. Although she confirmed the [...] "fuck" [...] tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her [...] "favorite word") <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> applied after the magazine's photo shoot. She added that she eventually {{wanted to get a}} [...] "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life." [...] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, [...] "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast. The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Kunis {{replaced}} Lacey Chabert in {{the role}} of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: [...] "What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, {{but there was something about}} Mila– something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work." [...] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Catherine greatly exaggerated Russia's {{economic}} stability and greatly misinformed Voltaire on the subject.

[...] As a result, Voltaire never realized the significant economic hardship of Russia's peasant class that had triggered the revolt.|$|E
