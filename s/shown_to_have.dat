5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at {{both ends}} of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a tonal language, {{based on the fact that}} four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages each can be <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.|$|E

The genealogies were collected on two islands (Bra~ and Hvar) and in two continental regions (Sinjska Krajina and Srijem). Genealogy Structure Index (GSI) was defined as quantitative indicator of genealogy structure. GSI was continuos variable which, by its extreme, describes vertical and horizontal type of genealogy structure, independently of the way genealogies were collected. Genealogy structure of surveyed population was described {{on the basis of}} participation of different genealogy types. Populations of the island Hvar and Bra~ <b>showed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> horizontal genealogy type, continental population of Sinjska Krajina <b>showed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> mixed type and continental population of Srijem <b>showed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> vertical type of genealogy structure...|$|R
