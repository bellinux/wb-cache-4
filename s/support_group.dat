5|$|In 1939, Morgan was {{promoted}} to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st <b>Support</b> <b>Group</b> of the 1st Armoured Division. When the 1st <b>Support</b> <b>Group</b> was shipped to France in May 1940, following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, it had already been stripped of its two field artillery regiments and two infantry battalions. As a result, Morgan's command included only a force of Royal Engineers and a Territorial Army (TA) battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which {{was in the process of}} converting to an anti-aircraft/anti-tank regiment and armed only with anti-tank guns. His group was in no position to fulfil its normal role supporting the division's armoured brigades and so was sent to reinforce the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division south of the river Somme. During a confused retreat most of the <b>Support</b> <b>Group</b> was captured along with the 51st Division at Saint-Valery-en-Caux but the remainder, including Morgan, got away and were evacuated to England.|$|E

The role players {{participating}} {{within the}} <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> {{for patients with}} chronic diseases in Primary Health care services are facing a difficult task of managing <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> effectively. They are confronted by managerial challenges involved in the managing of <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> for patients with chronic diseases, such as careful planning, organising, leading and controlling the <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> This is evidently confirmed by the disintegration of <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> and patients openly and deliberately rebelling and ignoring participation in <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> The resistance and opposition is also displayed by other staff members within the clinic. The general dissatisfaction and frustration among the primary health care facilitators serves as proof of the poor management of <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> The need to investigate and address this dilemma is important. It is therefore {{the reason why the}} researcher embarked on this studying order to explore the I experiences of the role players with regard to the management of the <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> for patients with chronic diseases within the clinic context, and then utilise the results ad basis for formulating guidelines for quality management of <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> within Primary Health Care clinics in Soweto.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the ways}} of {{building}} and developing a better cooperative relationship between parents of people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities and professional staff is the inclusion of parents in <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> for parents and staff in <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> for staff. Goal: To examine the correlation {{of the level of}} cooperative relationship between the parents of people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities and professional staff with the inclusion of parents in <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> for parents and staff in <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> for staff. Methodology: Respondents: parents (296) of people with severe and profound learning disabilities and staff (298) in five centres across Slovenia; Methods: descriptive statistics, test of homogeneity, the rankit method, one-way analysis of variance; Procedures: survey questionnaires for parents and staff. The data was processed using SPSS software for personal computers. Results: The difference between the variances of the groups (parent) found is statistically significant (F = 6. 16; p = 0. 01). Staff included in <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> have a significantly lower level of cooperative relationship with parents (f= 10; M = - 0. 12) than staff not included in these groups (f = 191; M = 0. 04). Conclusion:In contrast to theoretical findings the results indicated less successful cooperation for professional staff included in <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> The results furthermore did not confirm any differences in the cooperative relationship of parents included in <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> and those who are not.

40|$|Advances in {{diagnostic}} {{tools and}} disease slowing treatments {{have led to}} an increased focus on diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{during the early stages}} of the disease. Early diagnosis of AD improves quality of life for patients and caregivers by allowing for participation in disease slowing interventions. However, early diagnosis of AD may have unintentional psychological and social consequences for patients and caregivers. To combat these potential consequences, it is important that psychosocial interventions, such as <b>support</b> <b>groups,</b> are available at the time of diagnosis. A review of literature demonstrated that early stage AD patients and their informal caregivers benefited from <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> attended by both patients and caregivers, referred to as early stage AD patient-caregiver dyad (PCD) <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the need for early stage AD PCD <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> in rural areas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the need for early stage AD PCD <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> in rural WA. A needs assessment survey was developed and distributed for a period of one month to four clinics and one senior center in five rural WA towns. Twelve informal caregivers and five community members who did not have AD or care for someone with early stage AD were included in data analysis. Results demonstrated that participants lacked information about early stage AD PCD <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> and barriers to accessing these groups.

Prior research in bipolar disorder has reported value from online <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> Aims: To understand the use of online <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> by patients with bipolar disorder {{as part of a}} larger project about information seeking. Methods: The results are based on a one-time, paper-based anonymous survey about information seeking by patients with bipolar disorder, which was translated into 12 languages. The survey was completed between March 2014 and January 2016 and included questions on the use of online <b>support</b> <b>groups.</b> All patients were diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Analysis included descriptive statistics and general estimating equations to account for correlated data. Results and conclusions: The survey was completed by 1222 patients in 17 countries. The patients used the Internet at a percentage similar to the general public. Of the Internet users who looked online for information about bipolar disorder, only 21. 0 % read or participated in <b>support</b> <b>groups,</b> chats, or forums for bipolar disorder (12. 8 % of the total sample). Given the benefits reported in prior research, clarification of the role of online <b>support</b> <b>groups</b> in bipolar disorder is needed.
