2500|$|In a legal service, {{the ball}} travels over the net (without {{touching}} it) {{and into the}} diagonally opposite <b>service</b> <b>box.</b> If the ball hits the net but lands in the <b>service</b> <b>box,</b> this is a let or net service, which is void, and the server retakes that serve. The player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults. A fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the <b>service</b> <b>box,</b> or does not clear the net. There is also a [...] "foot fault", which occurs when a player's foot touches the baseline or {{an extension of the}} center mark before the ball is hit. If the second service is also a fault, the server double faults, and the receiver wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service.|$|E

2500|$|A serve (or, more formally, a [...] "service") {{in tennis}} is a shot {{to start a}} point. The serve is {{initiated}} by tossing {{the ball into the}} air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite <b>service</b> <b>box</b> without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity. If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a [...] "let" [...] and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in. There can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn't prepared. If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, then they get one more try to get the serve in the box.|$|E
