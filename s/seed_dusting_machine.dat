40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of the microbial diversity of bioaerosols in relation to occupational exposure and work related health symptoms is not known. The aim {{of this paper is}} to gain knowledge on the bacterial and fungal communities in dust causing organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) and in reference dust not causing ODTS. Bacterial and fungal communities were described in personal exposure samples from grass seed workers developing ODTS, in dust generated from grass seeds causing ODTS and in dust generated from reference seeds not causing ODTS. Amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS region, as well as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) were used for identification of fungi and bacteria in personal exposure samples and in dust samples from grass seeds causing ODTS and in dust from reference grass seeds. Furthermore, activities of enzymes were measured in the same samples. The sequencing data revealed more than 150 bacterial and 25 fungal genera present in each sample. Streptomyces spp., Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus microsporus were dominating in the dust causing ODTS but not in the reference dust. The dustiness in terms of Mucor sp. and R. microsporus were 100 – 1000 times higher for problematic seeds compared to reference seeds. The bacterial species in the dust causing ODTS included pathogenic species such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Streptomyces pneumonia, and it contained increased concentrations of total protein, serine protease, chitinase, and β-glucosidase. Twenty-three bacterial genera covered more than 50 % of the total reads in the personal and problematic <b>seed</b> <b>dust.</b> These 23 genera accounted for less than 7 % of the total reads in the reference <b>seed</b> <b>dust.</b> The microbial community of the dust from the problematic seeds showed great similarities to that from the personal air samples from the workers. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time a shift in the microbial community in aerosol samples that caused ODTS compared to the reference samples that did not cause the ODTS. Furthermore, elevated enzyme activities were found in the dust causing ODTS...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{algorithm}} is described for {{the calculation of}} equilibrium compositions of multiple highly nonideal liquid and solid solutions, as well as pure stoichiometric phases, coexisting {{with a mixture of}} ideal gas species at fixed temperature and pressure. The total Gibbs free energy of the system is approximated as a quadratic function of the compositions of the gas phase and stable condensed phases, in an orthogonal basis set of pure elements. Only changes in thermal energy and energy related to pressure-volume work are considered. The total Gibbs energy is minimized directly by use of both the slope and the curvature of the Gibbs energy surface with respect to the gas and condensed phase compositions in the basis elements. The algorithm described has been implemented in a computer code for the calculation of condensation sequences for cosmic nebular gases enriched in <b>dust.</b> <b>Machine,</b> compiler and library requirements for performing these calculations in the C programmin...|$|R
40|$|Clean air {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} needed by yarn companies. This factor {{influences}} the quality of yarn, clean air helps produce good quality of yarn. On the other hand, recently many of yarn companies do not consider that factor as important and that can cause several problems. 	This research is conducted at a yarn company named PT Kusumaputra Santosa located at Jl. Raya Jaten Km 9, Karanganyar. The air around ring frame machine is dusty and that causes the surfaces of yarn produced by this machine defected (not aligned). The defect product must be cut at the finishing work center; this prolongs production processes, creating a bottleneck at this work center. Finally the main problem is that the real production does not reach the production target (late of production) that causes profit loss. The root problem is the <b>dust</b> cleaner <b>machine</b> cannot absorb <b>dust</b> optimally, because lack of hole at exhaust arm. 	Based on those problems, this research tries to propose a design improvement of <b>dust</b> cleaner <b>machine</b> by adding 10 exhaust holes at exhaust arm, to maximize the ability of absorbing dust in the air, in order to help PT. Kusumaputra Santosa clean the air condition in the spinning work center. The research employs Rational Method developed by Cross, 1994, to appropriate the design of <b>dust</b> cleaner <b>machine.</b> The research also employs Gravimetric Method to measure the level of dust in the air. There are literature reviews about the product design and improvement methods to help make a good design. 	Finally, with the design improvement, the <b>dust</b> cleaner <b>machine</b> can reduce the dust level in the air from 0. 91 mg/m 3 to 0. 52 mg/m 3, so there will be decreasing the defect product, reduce the number cut and join done by winding machine from 10. 3 /spindle to 7. 8 /spindle, fast production process, no bottleneck, so that the production rate is increase from 0. 38 bale/day to 0. 447 bale/day for yarn type 32 CD, and then increase from 0. 25 bale/day to 0. 3 bale/day for yarn type 30 CD...|$|R

40|$|Soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) {{hydrophobic}} protein (HPS) is {{an abundant}} seed constituent and a potentially hazardous allergen that causes asthma in persons allergic to soybean dust. By analyzing surface extracts of soybean seeds with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal microsequencing, we determined that {{large amounts of}} HPS are deposited on the seed surface. The quantity of HPS present varies among soybean cultivars and is more prevalent on dull-seeded phenotypes. We have also isolated cDNA clones encoding HPS and determined that the preprotein is translated with a membrane-spanning signal sequence and a short hydrophilic domain. Southern analysis indicated that multiple copies of the HPS gene {{are present in the}} soybean genome, and that the HPS gene structure is polymorphic among cultivars that differ in seed coat luster. The pattern of HPS gene expression, determined by in situ hybridization and RNA analysis, shows that HPS is synthesized in the endocarp of the inner ovary wall and is deposited on the seed surface during development. This study demonstrates that a <b>seed</b> <b>dust</b> allergen is associated with the seed luster phenotype in soybean and that compositional properties of the seed surface may be altered by manipulating gene expression in the ovary wall...|$|R

Experiments consisted of <b>seeding</b> evapocondensed Saharan <b>dust</b> at the surface of a polyethylene tank filled with filtered surface seawater. Phosphate (PO 43 -), nitrate (NO 3 -), size and number of particles and transparent exopolymeric particles production (TEP) were measured over the course of one week following <b>seeding.</b> <b>Dust</b> deposition was followed by a transient increase in [PO 43 -] during the first three hours with a maximum input of 33, 9 and 39 nM respectively in May, October and February. The removal of almost all the PO 43 - initially released suggests a scavenging process of PO 43 - back onto ferric oxide-rich particles leading to concentrations {{at the end of the}} experiment close to the initial values (7 nM in May and October, and 6 nM in February). NO 3 - released from dust was high especially in May and October (maximum input of 23 and 11 µM respectively) and was attributed to nitrogen dissolution from the large amount of small particles (< 1 µm) rich in nitrogen in the evapocondensed dust. [NO 3 -] remained high until the end of the experiment (16 µM in May and 11 µM in October), indicating that NO 3 - from dust is likely to be bioavailable for a longer period compared to PO 43 - from dust.

The seed samples are sent in by growers throughout the Ottawa district. Ascochyta spp. and Fusarium spp. are the dominant fungi isolated from pea seed originating in the Ottawa district. As shown by Jones in 1927 there are three Ascochyta fungi which cause disease on peas; Ascochyta pisi Lib., Mycosnhaerella pinodes (Berk, and Blox.) Stone and Ascochyta pinodella Jones. The percentage of seed infected with Ascochyta pisi in these samples varies from 0 to 100 %. The percentage of seed infected with Ascochyta pinodes and Ascochyta pinodella does not usually run above 5 %.

40|$|We {{identify}} and study {{a number of}} new, rapidly growing instabilities of dust grains in protoplanetary disks, which may be important for planetesimal formation. The study {{is based on the}} recognition that dust-gas mixtures are generically unstable to a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI), whenever there is relative streaming motion between the two phases and the gas (absent dust) supports undamped linear modes. Due to the drag forces between dust and gas, each gas mode is associated with a set of instabilities (RDIs) which generically act to clump the dust. We show that the "streaming instability" is an RDI associated with epicyclic oscillations; this provides simple interpretations for its mechanisms and accurate analytic expressions for its growth rates and fastest-growing wavelengths. We extend this to identify a variety of additional RDIs associated with different waves [...] e. g., buoyancy, acoustic, and magnetohydrodynamic oscillations [...] each of which leads to new instabilities. Most importantly, we identify the disk "settling instability" (or vertical-epicyclic RDI), which occurs as dust settles vertically into the midplane of a rotating disk. For small grains, this instability grows many orders of magnitude faster than the standard streaming instability: in fact, its growth rate is independent of grain size. Growth timescales for realistic dust-to-gas ratios are comparable to the disk orbital period, and the characteristic wavelengths are more than an order of magnitude larger than the streaming instability (allowing the instability to concentrate larger masses). This suggests in the process of settling, dust will band into rings (then filaments or clumps), potentially <b>seeding</b> <b>dust</b> traps, high-metallicity regions (which in turn seed the streaming instability), or overdensities that could coagulate or directly collapse to planetesimals.
