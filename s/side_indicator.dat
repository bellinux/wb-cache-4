25|$|The FJ cruiser was {{primarily}} {{developed for the}} North American market but has been sold in small numbers globally since its launch. On 25 November 2010, Toyota announced sales would begin in right-hand drive form for the Japanese market. Sales began on December 4, replacing the outgoing Hilux Surf and selling alongside the Land Cruiser. Japanese-produced right-hand drive models have a different rear bumper to North American models with the license plate located on the bumper as opposed to under the tailgate door handle. In addition, right-hand drive versions have the <b>side</b> <b>indicator</b> markers located on the fender panels, rather than located on the side-view mirrors used for left-hand drive production FJ Cruisers. Sales of right-hand drive model began in Australia and New Zealand in 2011 available in four-wheel drive automatics only.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the first}} Chrysler small car sold in Japan, {{starting}} in 1996-1998, but only the sedan was offered. It was sold at Mitsubishi dealerships as well as Yanase dealerships, and {{very similar to those}} sold in the Australian market. it was equipped with amber turn signal indicators next to the tail lights to comply with Japanese regulations, and a <b>side</b> <b>indicator</b> behind the front wheel installed in the fender.

The 420G was distinct from the Mark X only with the addition of a vertical central bar splitting the grille in two, <b>side</b> <b>indicator</b> repeaters on the front wings, and a chrome strip along the wing and door panels (two tone paint schemes were also available with the chrome strip omitted).|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} Festiva {{continued to be}} sold in Australia until 2000 when it {{was replaced by the}} Ford Ka. Australian second-generation Festivas have U.S. side marker light cut-outs {{on each side of the}} vehicle (driver-side and passenger-side) at the front and rear. Instead of housing orange reflectors/lights at the front sides and red reflectors/lights at the rear sides, there are non-lit orange reflectors at all four locations. These redundant reflectors, coupled with the orange <b>side</b> <b>indicator</b> repeater (which is not required in the U.S., and was not included on the Aspire) make for a unique side profile.|$|E

50|$|Cars for the US market were {{fitted with}} large {{projecting}} rubber bumper over-riders (in 1973 these were on front, in 1974 both front and rear) to meet local 5 mph impact regulations, but those on European models were considerably smaller. US models also have <b>side</b> <b>indicator</b> repeats {{on the front}} wings. There were also a very limited number of six-cylinder Series 3 E-Types built.

5000|$|Built from 1991 in Japan, for Australia, New Zealand, and Europe, {{compared}} to the A-spec, the E-spec has different headlights (a two-piece projector setup giving far greater lighting) and taillights, different front and rear bumpers, fog lights, wing-mirrors (power and heated), steering wheel, interior trim, and alloys as standard. The <b>side</b> <b>indicator</b> lights were mounted behind the front wheels, and no corner bumper lights were used. It also came with optional air conditioning and leather interior (standard from '96), and the MX6’s main act - the 4WS system (not available in the UK).

3000|$|Estimation of {{the control}} {{variables}} {{is presented in the}} Appendix (Table 10), and we found quite standard effects with few exceptions. These findings include evidence of state dependence (even after controlling for endogenous initial conditions) ranging from 0.35 in Poland to 0.47 in Slovakia and decreasing to 0.12 in Lithuania, perhaps because of the strong increases in unemployment rates in the period under investigation. 14 We also find evidence of lower employment probabilities for women (negative impact ranging from 1.3  % in Lithuania to 7.2  % in Poland) and for older workers, a negative impact of having children aged 0 – 3  years old in the household, and greater employment opportunities for better educated and higher-income individuals. The demand <b>side</b> <b>indicator</b> (the local unemployment rate), also catching the economic slowdown effects, shows the expected negative sign. When focusing on disability effects, it is essential to note the high significance and magnitude of both current and strong disability. As shown in Table  3, the impact of current disability on employment opportunities ranges from − 2.6  % in Slovakia to − 11.1  % in Lithuania. We find intermediate effects in Romania (− 3.8  %), Hungary (− 4.9  %), Poland (− 5.8  %), and the Czech Republic (− 7.1  %). The negative impact is much greater when focusing on strong disability, ranging from − 11.1  % in Romania to − 25  % in Lithuania. 15 Intermediate impacts exist in Slovakia (− 11.8  %), Hungary (− 13.6  %), Poland (− 14.4  %), and the Czech Republic (− 19  %). Comparing these effects with those reported in the related literature (e.g., Gannon 2005; Oguzoglu 2010 and Agovino et al. 2014), we find that the detrimental impact of disability is greater in the CEEC analyzed than in the Western nations (Mussida and Sciulli 2015). 16 [...]...|$|E

50|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} that Puffin crossings {{may be less}} safe than Pelican crossings due the nearside indicator not being visible while crossing, and being at a different focal length, reducing traffic awareness.

We develop a theoretical model where macroeconomic conditions, technological opportunity, and the entrepreneurial environment affect the demand and supply of VC. The quantitative results, based on a panel dataset of 16 OECD countries from 1990 to 2000, show that VC intensity is pro-cyclical. Interest rates affect more the demand side of VC (entrepreneurs) than the supply <b>side.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of technological opportunity, such as the stock of knowledge {{and the number of}} triadic patents affect positively and significantly the relative level of VC.

Teixeira, Rosa and Amaral (2004) have analysed the presence/absence of market mechanisms in the Portuguese higher education sector. This paper describes supply and demand in the Portuguese system. On the supply side, it looks at indicators such as place distribution and diversity, whereas on the demand <b>side,</b> <b>indicators</b> based on the revealed preferences are computed. It goes a step further in quantifying the (mis) match {{between the two sides}} of the market, by suggesting and computing a set of strength and weakness indicators.

25|$|Early 1980-1985 models {{featured}} butterfly opening windows, round <b>side</b> <b>indicators,</b> only {{a single}} set of tail lights {{on each side of}} the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.|$|R
