25|$|The gorges in the island, {{such as the}} Daal of Lumbister {{provide an}} {{important}} environment {{for some of the}} few trees on the island, since they are untouched by sheep grazing. Before human colonisation, it appears that Yell was wooded to some degree, at least with dwarf trees and shrubs. In the gorge at the head of Gloup Voe, dog roses and honeysuckle can be found. As the peat preserves old plants and pollen to some degree, due to its anaerobic nature, it is possible to get <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former vegetation of the island. For example, it is known that 40,000 years ago, before the advent of the last Ice Age, and probably any human habitation, that oak, Scots pine and Mediterranean heathers were growing here. The remains of these plants have been preserved in layers of ancient peat, which were in turn buried by the boulder clay left by glacial moraines.|$|E
500|$|... "Stupid in Love" [...] {{garnered}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Leah Greenblatt for Entertainment Weekly praised Rihanna's {{high level of}} emotional conviction on [...] "Stupid in Love", writing {{that it is a}} piece of [...] "self-lacerating balladry." [...] Neil McCormick for The Daily Telegraph thought that the song was a direct reference to Rihanna and Brown, writing [...] "Rihanna notoriously received a black eye prior to the 2009 Grammy awards when she was attacked by her then boyfriend, R singer Chris Brown. Clearly, this is a potentially life-changing incident, and we get <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emotional aftermath on the ballad Stupid In Love." [...] Norman Mayers for Nu-Soul Magazine concurred with McCormick, writing that Rihanna does not shy away from what happened between herself and Brown, rather, she confronts it directly on [...] "Stupid in Love". Alex Thornton for HipHopDX wrote {{that it is difficult to}} listen to the song without thinking of [...] "you know who," [...] referring to Brown.|$|E

2500|$|However, using {{loan words}} {{in the context of}} the {{language}} borrowing them is a markedly different situation from the study of Latin itself. In this classroom setting, instructors and students attempt to recreate at least <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original pronunciation. What is taught to native anglophones is suggested by the sounds of today's Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin. Instructors who take this approach rationalize that Romance vowels probably come closer to the original pronunciation than those of any other modern language (see also the section below on [...] "Derivative languages").|$|E

It is revealed that the galaxy itself exists as a computer simulation managed by the Atlas, the Traveller an entity created by the Atlas to explore the simulation, while Nada and Polo were [...] "errors" [...] that had become self-aware of being in a simulation and isolated themselves in the anomaly to help others.|$|E
2500|$|The most copious {{evidence}} of ancient Greek painting survives {{in the form}} of vase paintings. These are described in the [...] "pottery" [...] section above. They give at least <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aesthetics of Greek painting. [...] The techniques involved, however, were very different from those used in large-format painting. The same probably applies to the subject matter depicted. It should be noted that strictly speaking, vase painting was a separate skill or art from potting. It should also be kept in mind that vase painting, albeit by far the most conspicuous surviving source on ancient Greek painting, was not held in the highest regard in antiquity, and is never mentioned in Classical literature.|$|E

2500|$|The same claim {{has been}} made for a version in the Vernon collection. The Vernon Mona Lisa is {{particularly}} interesting because it was originally part of the collection at the Louvre. Another version, dating from c. 1616, was given in c. 1790 to Joshua Reynolds by the Duke of Leeds {{in exchange for a}} Reynolds self-portrait. Reynolds thought it to be the real painting and the French one a copy, which has now been disproved. It is, however, useful in that it was copied when the original's colors were far brighter than they are now, and so it gives <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original's appearance 'as new'.

2500|$|In Don Quixote, {{there are}} {{basically}} {{two different types}} of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, {{while the rest of the}} roles speak a modern version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource – he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him mad; and many times, when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effect by having Don Quixote use King James Bible or Shakespearian English, or even Middle English.) ...|$|E

Control systems that include <b>some</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results {{they are trying to}} achieve are making use of feedback and so can, to some extent, adapt to varying circumstances.

2500|$|After the {{founding}} of Potosi in 1545, Spanish settlers traveled {{from there to the}} Cintis to give birth, it being too cold and socially turbulent in Potosi. This would create an early connection between this wine region and the imperial city. [...] Subsequently, residents of Potosi who acquired wealth founded villas in the valley of the Cintis. [...] By 1585 this area became the major center of wine and singani production initiating many of the first non-monastic commercial ventures. [...] During the 16th Century, Turuchipa was listed as delivering [...] "vinos endebles" [...] (weak wine) to Potosi, while Cinti delivered wine and distilled liquor. [...] At that time each household in Potosi was observed to possess eight to ten [...] "cántaros" [...] or amphora-like jugs of alcoholic drink. [...] This plus population estimates of 100,000 to 200,000 would provide <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall demand for wine, chicha, and liquor at that time and place.|$|E
2500|$|By [...] "necessary connection", Hume {{means the}} power or force which {{necessarily}} ties one idea to another. He rejects {{the notion that}} any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew {{the nature of this}} power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then {{we would be able to}} intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the [...] "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" [...] which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone. (Hume 1974:355-356) He also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere occasions of the will of some god(s), a view associated with the philosopher Nicolas Malebranche.
