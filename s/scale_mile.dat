50|$|Because stream {{gradient}} is customarily {{given in}} feet per 1000 feet, one should then measure the amount a stream segment rises {{and the length}} of the stream segment in feet, then multiply feet per foot gradient by 1000. For example, if one measures a <b>scale</b> <b>mile</b> along the stream length, and counts three contour lines crossed on a map with ten-foot contours, the gradient is approximately 5.7 feet per 1000 feet, a fairly steep gradient.|$|E
50|$|Grand Prix {{is a time}} trial, and the {{competing}} cars are obstacles rather than competition for the finish line. The player's car can easily outpace the other cars, but if it collides with one, its speed drops {{lower than that of}} the impacted car. Driving over an oil slick causes the player's car to skid slightly sideways, but does not slow it down. Once every <b>scale</b> <b>mile,</b> the player crosses a narrow bridge over blue water. Colliding with any wall of the bridge stops the car, and the player must slowly gain speed to continue. A patch of oil slicks precedes a bridge. This both forewarns the player, and presents a hazard while trying to steer onto the bridge.|$|E
40|$|Upon {{entering}} Dock Lands, {{the viewer}} first encounters two lengths of tie-dyed hot pink and black fabric, hanging from an oddly obtrusive frame of industrial wall studs—in a nod both to cinematic curtains and to aesthetics claimed by psychedelic and punk subculture. Beyond this initial obstruction are paraphernalia suggestive {{of a rock}} performance: a tangle of cables, tall set of speakers, and a subwoofer. Various spatial interventions stretch across {{the area of the}} gallery. Another stud construction—in which Lloyd has embedded two overlapping wooden cutouts, among many strewn about the gallery—extends toward a rear wall of the gallery. Running {{across the top of the}} back wall is a banner, which rounds the corner of the room and stretches across the length of the adjacent windows. Aurally, one hears a dog barking and a cover of the 1936 Fred Astaire song, “We Saw the Sea”—relating the exhibition’s soundtrack to her playfully embellished dog photos and stenciled anchors, Lloyd uses sound not as diegetic but as associative and symbolic. Though it fills the space, the soundtrack in fact originates from Mile High Club (2017). Projected low on the floor and at a small <b>scale,</b> <b>Mile</b> High Club turns Lloyd’s lens on an airport runway as seen through a plane window, exploring a romanticized notion of arrivals and departures. Emphasizing texture, activating every part of the gallery space, stimulating yet confusing one’s hearing, and obstructing natural pathways, Lloyd’s installation renders viewing an active and physiological experience, upending cinema’s paralysis of the viewer and singular focus on the screen.

30|$|To make DESaster {{suitable}} for participatory modeling, interactive and visual interfaces are needed that are created using human-centered design principles and implemented to be flexible, adaptable, and extensible (Ganji and Miles 2018). Little to no formal {{research has been}} done to develop visual analytics that facilitate understanding of community resilience relationships and dependencies between hazard loss and disaster recovery data (simulated or empirical) or to understand the implications of scenario-based processes across different spatiotemporal <b>scales</b> (<b>Miles</b> 2014).|$|R
30|$|Representation of {{community}} resilience that is conceptualized as disaster loss and recovery is hyperdimensional. It involves potentially several tens {{of community}} neighborhoods, thousands or millions of households and businesses—each {{with a range}} of attributes—and many recovery indicators that vary over multiple temporal and spatial <b>scales</b> (<b>Miles</b> 2014). Within a simulation modeling context, this hyperdimensionality explodes with the creation of alternative “what if” scenarios, for example to determine a community’s expected and target recovery capacities as part of a resilience planning process informed by the NIST guide. For usability, this hyperdimensionality must be packaged and presented in a transparent and open way (Arias et al. 2000; Drew 2003).|$|R
2500|$|HO scale trains {{elsewhere}} {{were developed}} {{in response to the}} economic pressures of the Great Depression.

In addition there are two manual lever frames, one ex-British Railways and the other from London Underground. The BR lever frame is still in use as a manual override for the trains. Some original Bassett-Lowke stock from the 1930s is still in daily use, albeit with new running gear. Many of these trains have significant historical value. Some have been running for over 50 years, each covering about 2000 mi per year.|$|R

5000|$|Record Breakers were Mini 4WD {{but not in}} the {{conventional}} sense as they didn't have the pins or blades characteristic of most. They were battery operated and could run on a track with horizontal side-mounted guide wheels, but could just as well run independently of tracks, though if their guide wheels were removed, in-track performance would be greatly diminished if not impossible. The cars were known for their high performance, and on smooth surfaces were capable of 20 mph, translating into 500 to 640 <b>scale</b> <b>miles</b> per hour. [...] A car outside of a track would inevitably crash into an obstacle if not otherwise stopped. Twin electric motors cars ran off two AA batteries. Another version of the cars used a single motor that ran on two AA batteries, though often a third battery could be added for additional power. The single motor cars could be manually switched between 2WD and 4WD. The scale is difficult to specify as they were frequently not based on any real-life vehicles, but it appears to be approximately 1:32. Customization and upgrade kits with accessories such as different kinds of wheels and guide wheels were sold, as well as different kinds of tracks.|$|R
