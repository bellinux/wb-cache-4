5|$|On 23 June 1991, as <b>Slovenia</b> and Croatia {{prepared}} to declare their independence during {{the breakup of}} Yugoslavia, the European Community (EC) foreign ministers decided the EC member states would not extend diplomatic recognition to the two states. The EC viewed the declarations as unilateral moves and offered assistance in negotiations regarding {{the future of the}} SFR Yugoslavia instead. At the same time, the EC decided to suspend direct talks with <b>Slovenia</b> and Croatia. The move was welcomed by the Yugoslav federal government. <b>Slovenia</b> and Croatia declared independence on 25 June, and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) units began to deploy from its bases in <b>Slovenia</b> the next day. On 27 June, armed conflict broke out as the JNA and the Territorial Defence Force of <b>Slovenia</b> (TDS) began fighting over control of Slovenia's border posts, in what became the Ten-Day War.|$|E

5|$|Baćović joined Đurišić's {{forces in}} their trek towards <b>Slovenia,</b> {{alongside}} Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić, detachments commanded by Ostojić, {{and a large}} number of refugees, totaling around 10,000. This force was formed into the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, consisting of the 1st, 5th, 8th and 9th (Herzegovina) divisions. Earlier, Đurišić and Mihailović had argued over the best course of action. Đurišić had wanted to withdraw through Albania to Greece, but Mihailović had told him to prepare for an Allied landing, the return of the king and the establishment of a national government. From the time Đurišić joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, he was very critical of Mihailović's leadership and argued strongly for all remaining Chetnik troops to move to <b>Slovenia.</b> When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to <b>Slovenia</b> independently of him, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's Serbian Volunteer Corps already in <b>Slovenia</b> to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the status}} of Lipizzans as the only breed of horse {{developed}} in <b>Slovenia,</b> via the Lipica stud that is now located within its borders, Lipizzans are recognized in <b>Slovenia</b> as a national animal.
