50|$|In 1777 Abraham-Louis Breguet {{also became}} {{interested}} in the idea and his first attempts led him to make a <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> with a barrel remontoir. Although a successful design, it was too complex and expensive for it to be manufactured and sold.|$|E
50|$|About the {{beginning}} of 1777, Perrelet invented a <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> for automatic watches. It worked on the same principle as a modern wristwatch, and was designed to wind as the owner walked, using an oscillating weight inside the large watch that moved up and down.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advent of}} the wrist watch after World War I led to renewed {{interest}} in <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and all four types listed above were used: ...|$|R
50|$|Shinola {{has faced}} {{criticism}} for {{its failure to}} use the automatic, <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> found in nearly all higher-end watches, some of which require substantially more skill to produce.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Self-winding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{continue}} working {{even after the}} mainspring is fully wound up. If a simple mainspring was used, this would put excessive tension on the mainspring. This could break the mainspring, {{and even if it}} did not, it can cause a problem called [...] "knocking" [...] or [...] "banking". The excessive drive force applied to the watch movement gear train can make the balance wheel rotate with excessive amplitude, causing the impulse pin to hit the back of the pallet fork horns. This will make the watch run fast, and could break the impulse pin. To prevent this, a slipping clutch device is used on the mainspring so it cannot be overwound.|$|R
50|$|In April 2014 the Swatch Group {{launched}} the sistem51 wristwatch. It has a purely mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including a novel <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> with a transparent oscillating weight. So far, {{it is the}} only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line. The low parts count and the automated assembly make it an inexpensive mechanical Swiss watch, which can be considered a successor to Roskopf movements, although of higher quality.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{credible evidence}} for a successful design is the watch made by the Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Perrelet, who lived in Le Locle. In late 1776 or early 1777, he invented a <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> for pocket watches using an oscillating weight inside the watch that moved up and down. The Geneva Society of Arts, reporting on this watch in 1777, stated that 15 minutes walking was necessary to fully wind the watch.|$|E
50|$|The Valjoux 7750 uses a three-plane cam system, the coulisse-lever escapement, {{rather than}} the {{traditional}} chronograph mechanism, the column wheel. It is constructed of a mainplate, calendar plate, and chronograph top plate. Levers push a cam back and forth, driving the stopwatch mechanism of the Valjoux 7750. In the 1980s, many companies began using the Valjoux 7750 because {{it was easier to}} mass-produce and distribute in high-volume. The system and movement were developed by Edmond Capt in 1970, as a fully integrated <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> with quick-set day/date based on the Valjoux 7733.|$|E
50|$|A self-winding watch {{movement}} has a mechanism which winds the mainspring using the natural {{motions of the}} wearer's body. The watch contains an eccentric weight that turns on a pivot. The normal movements of the watch in the user's pocket or on the user's arm cause the rotor to pivot on its staff, which {{is attached to a}} ratcheted winding mechanism. The motion of the watch is thereby translated into circular motion of the weight which, through a series of reverser and reducing gears, eventually winds the mainspring. There are many different designs for modern <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Some designs allow winding of the watch to take place while the weight swings in only one direction while other, more advanced, mechanisms have two ratchets and wind the mainspring during both clockwise and anti-clockwise weight motions.|$|R
50|$|Automatic quartz is a {{collective}} term describing watch movements that combine a <b>self-winding</b> rotor <b>mechanism</b> (as used in automatic mechanical watches) {{to generate electricity}} with a piezoelectric quartz crystal as its timing element. Such movements aim to provide the advantages of quartz without {{the environmental impact of}} batteries. Several manufacturers employ this technique.|$|R
50|$|Perpetual rotor in the <b>self-winding</b> {{wristwatch}} <b>mechanism,</b> {{allowing the}} watch to run continuously, as every slight {{movement of the}} wrist winds the movement. The energy generated is stored in the mainspring, allowing the watch to continue to function with no movement for several days. Each movement is a Swiss chronometer officially certified by the COSC.|$|R
5000|$|Invented by John Harwood, a watch {{repairer}} from Bolton, England, {{who took}} out a UK patent with his financial backer, Harry Cutts, on 7 July 1923, and obtained a corresponding Swiss patent on 16 October 1923. [...] The Harwood system used a pivoting weight which swung as the wearer moved, winding the mainspring. The ratchet mechanism wound the mainspring only when moving in one direction. The weight did not rotate a full 360°; spring bumpers limited its swing to about 180°, to encourage a back and forth motion. This early type of <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> is now {{referred to as a}} 'hammer' or 'bumper'.|$|E
5000|$|A self-winding or {{automatic}} {{watch is}} one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body. The first <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet, but the first [...] "self-winding", or [...] "automatic", wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named John Harwood in 1923. This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer. It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with {{the movement of the}} wearer's wrist. The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a ratchet to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.|$|E
5000|$|Rayban, Rolex, and Louis Vuitton are {{the most}} copied brands worldwide, with Nike being the most counterfeited brand {{globally}} according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Counterfeit clothes, shoes, jewelry and handbags from designer brands are made in varying quality; sometimes the intent is only to fool the gullible buyer who only looks at the label and {{does not know what}} the real thing looks like, while others put some serious effort into mimicking fashion details. Others realize that most consumers do not care if the goods they buy are counterfeit and just wish to purchase inexpensive products. The popularity of designer jeans in 1978, spurred a flood of knockoffs. Factories that manufacture counterfeit designer brand garments and watches are usually located in developing countries, with between 85-95% of all counterfeit goods coming from China. International tourists visiting Beijing, China, may find a wide selection of counterfeit designer brand garments at the Silk Street. Expensive watches are vulnerable to counterfeiting as well. In Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, authentic looking but poor quality watch fakes with <b>self-winding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and fully working movements can sell for as little as US $20 to good quality ones that sell for $100 and over. Also some fakes' movements and materials are of remarkably passable quality [...] - [...] albeit inconsistently so [...] - [...] and may look good and work well for some years, a possible consequence of increasing competition within the counterfeiting community. Some counterfeiters have began to manufacture their goods in the same factory as the authentic goods. Yuandan goods is a term used to describe those fakes that are produced in the same factory as legitimate designer pieces without authorized permission to do so. These goods are made from scraps and leftover materials from the genuine products, produced illegally and sold on the black market.|$|R
50|$|A {{clock that}} employs {{electricity}} {{in some form}} to power a conventional clock mechanism is an electromechanical clock. Any spring or weight driven clock that uses electricity (either AC or DC) to rewind the spring or raise {{the weight of a}} mechanical clock then is an electromechanical clock. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. The timekeeping function is regulated by the pendulum. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, the availability of the dry cell battery made it practical to use electric power in clocks. The use of electricity then led to many variations of clock and motor designs. Electromechanical clocks were made as individual timepieces but most commonly were used as integral parts of synchronized time installations. Experience in telegraphy led to connecting remote clocks (slave clocks) via wires to a controlling (master clock) clock. The goal was to create a clock system where each clock displayed exactly the same time. The master and the slaves are electromechanical clocks. The master clock has a conventional <b>self-winding</b> clock <b>mechanism</b> that is rewound electrically. The slave clock mechanism is not a conventional clock mechanism as it consists only of a ratchet wheel and time train. Slave clocks rely upon electrical impulses from the master clock to mechanically move the clock hands one unit of time. Synchronized time systems are made up of one master clock and any number of slave clocks. The slave clocks are connected by wires to the master clock. These systems are found in locations where multiple clocks would be used such as learning institutions, businesses, factories, transportation networks, banks, offices and government facilities. A notable example of this type of system is the Shortt-Synchronome clock, which is an example of an electromechanical gravity remontoire. These self-winding clock systems were usually low voltage DC. They were installed thru the 1950s and by then systems with synchronous motor clocks were becoming the clock system of choice.|$|R
