5|$|These gems {{inspired}} {{the names of}} features: the mountains near Rock Creek are known as the <b>Sapphire</b> Mountains. Garnets are also found at some Montana <b>sapphire</b> sites, inspiring {{the name of the}} Garnet Range, which lies {{to the north of the}} <b>Sapphire</b> Mountains. In 1969, the <b>sapphire</b> and agate were jointly declared Montana's two official state gemstones.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} typical colouration, Djungarian hamsters {{can also be}} {{coloured}} pearl, <b>sapphire,</b> <b>sapphire</b> pearl, and marbled. Other colorations are available, but these are strongly suspected to appear only in hybrid crossings with Campbell's dwarf hamsters. Some of these colorations are mandarin, blue, argente, yellow blue fawn, camel, brown, cream, merle, and umbrous.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} between Dusty Rhodes and Randy Savage {{was about to}} begin, Ted DiBiase {{appeared}} and {{announced that he had}} purchased <b>Sapphire.</b> Rhodes walked down the aisle toward DiBiase and <b>Sapphire</b> but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and <b>Sapphire</b> but was unable to catch up to their departing limousine.|$|E
5000|$|Natural padparadscha <b>sapphires</b> often draw {{higher prices}} {{than many of}} even the finest blue <b>sapphires.</b> Recently, more <b>sapphires</b> of this color have {{appeared}} on the market {{as a result of}} a new artificial treatment method called [...] "lattice diffusion".|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsing ICP-MS­LA analyses, we {{demonstrate}} {{that the use of}} the Ga/Mg ratio, in conjunction with the Fe concentration, is an efficient tool in discriminating between "metamorphic" and "magmatic" blue <b>sapphires.</b> Magmatic blue <b>sapphires</b> found in alkali basalts (e. g. southeastern Asia, China, Africa) are commonly medium-rich to rich in Fe (with average contents between 2000 and 11000 ppm), high in Ga (> 140 ppm), and low in Mg (generally 10). Conversely, metamorphic blue <b>sapphires</b> found in basalts (e. g. Pailin pastel) and in metamorphic terrains (e. g. Mogok, Sri Lanka, Ilakaka) are characterized by low average iron contents (60 ppm) with low average Ga/Mg ratios (< 10). Basaltic magmatic <b>sapphires</b> have Fe, Ga and Mg contents similar to those obtained for primary magmatic <b>sapphires</b> found in the Garba Tula syenite. This suggests that these both sets of <b>sapphires</b> have a possible common "syenitic" origin, as previously proposed from other criteria. In addition, plumasite-related <b>sapphires</b> and metamorphic <b>sapphires</b> also exhibit similar composition in trace elements. Based on results from the present study, we suggest that fluid circulations during a metamorphic stage produced metasomatic exchanges between mafic and acidic rocks (plumasite model), thus explaining the high Mg contents and converging Ga/Mg ratios observed in metamorphic <b>sapphires...</b>|$|R
5|$|Like Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Ruby and <b>Sapphire</b> {{keep track}} of real-life time; this {{influences}} events like tides and berry plant growth. However, unlike their predecessors, Ruby and <b>Sapphire</b> do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to {{the differences in the}} technical specifications of Game Boy link cables and Game Boy Advance link cables, Ruby and <b>Sapphire</b> cannot be linked with Pokémon games of previous generations; one cannot battle with or trade to the previous generations.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2014, Nintendo {{announced}} that a remake of Ruby and <b>Sapphire,</b> titled Omega Ruby and Alpha <b>Sapphire,</b> and it was released for the Nintendo 3DS on November 21, 2014 worldwide, with the exclusion of Europe, where it was released on November 28, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Blue <b>sapphires</b> are {{evaluated}} {{based upon the}} purity of their primary hue. Purple, violet, and green {{are the most common}} secondary hues found in blue <b>sapphires.</b> Violet and purple can contribute to the overall beauty of the color, while green is considered to be distinctly negative. Blue <b>sapphires</b> with up to 15% violet or purple are generally said to be of fine quality. [...] Gray is the normal saturation modifier or mask found in blue <b>sapphires.</b> Gray reduces the saturation or brightness of the hue, and therefore has a distinctly negative effect.|$|R
25|$|In North America, <b>sapphires</b> {{have been}} mined mostly from {{deposits}} in Montana: fancies along the Missouri River near Helena, Montana, Dry Cottonwood Creek near Deer Lodge, Montana, and Rock Creek near Philipsburg, Montana. Fine blue Yogo <b>sapphires</b> are found at Yogo Gulch west of Lewistown, Montana. A few gem-grade <b>sapphires</b> and rubies {{have also been}} found in the area of Franklin, North Carolina.|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of the members, Lorelei, disappears. After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with him. Once more, the protagonist must thwart the Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the Ruby and the <b>Sapphire,</b> {{and put them in the}} main {{computer}} at One Island. After that, the player can communicate, battle, trade, etc., with Ruby and <b>Sapphire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and <b>Sapphire,</b> Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in Ruby and <b>Sapphire,</b> in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle like they were in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in Ruby and <b>Sapphire.</b>|$|E
5|$|FireRed and LeafGreen {{were first}} {{announced}} in September 2003 as upcoming remakes {{of the original}} Pocket Monsters Red and Green games that were released in Japan in 1996. Game director Junichi Masuda stated the new titles would be developed around the idea of simplicity, as the game engine was a slightly {{modified version of the}} one used in Pokémon Ruby and <b>Sapphire.</b> As a result, FireRed and LeafGreen were made fully backward compatible with Ruby and <b>Sapphire,</b> allowing players to trade Pokémon between games.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sapphires</b> of gem quality {{are found}} in the region. They were first found in this region at Rock Creek near Philipsburg in 1892. Rock Creek, also known as Gem Mountain, has been the most {{productive}} site in Montana for <b>sapphires</b> by far, even more so than Yogo Gulch, producing over 190 million carats of <b>sapphires</b> [...] Garnets are also found here.|$|R
500|$|<b>Sapphires</b> are a color {{variety of}} corundum, a {{crystalline}} form of aluminium oxide (...) [...] Corundum {{is one of}} the hardest minerals, rating9 on the Mohs scale. Corundum gems of most colors are called <b>sapphires,</b> except for red ones, which are called rubies. The term [...] "Yogo sapphire" [...] refers only to <b>sapphires</b> from the Yogo Gulch. [...] The cornflower blue color of the Yogo results from trace amounts of iron and titanium. Yogo <b>sapphires</b> are unique in that they are free of cavities and inclusions, have high uniform clarity, lack color zoning, and do not need heat treating because their cornflower blue coloring is uniform and deep. Unlike Asian <b>sapphires,</b> they maintain their brilliance in artificial light. Yogos present an advantage to gemcutters: since they are found as primary constituent minerals within an igneous bedrock rather than in sedimentary alluvial deposits where most other <b>sapphires</b> are located, they retain a perfect or near perfect crystalline shape, making cutting much easier, as does their lack of inclusions, color zoning, or cloudiness. Yogos also exhibit a triangular pattern on the basal plane of the flattened crystals, with thin rhombohedral crystal faces, a feature absent in <b>sapphires</b> from other parts of Montana.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sapphires</b> {{from certain}} locations, or of certain categories, {{may be more}} commercially {{appealing}} than others, particularly classic metamorphic <b>sapphires</b> from Kashmir, Burma, or Sri Lanka {{that have not been}} subjected to heat-treatment.|$|R

5|$|Notable {{among the}} 23,578 {{precious}} and semi-precious stones are CullinanI, the largest clear cut diamond {{in the world}} at , set in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. On the Imperial State Crown are CullinanII (second-largest of the Cullinan diamonds), the Stuart <b>Sapphire,</b> StEdward's <b>Sapphire,</b> and the Black Prince's Ruby– a large spinel given to Edward, the Black Prince, by a Spanish king in 1367. The Koh-i-Noor diamond has featured on three consort crowns.|$|E
5|$|On 20July1951, the P.1067 {{made its}} maiden flight, flown by Neville Duke, from RAF Boscombe Down, {{powered by a}} single 6,500lbf (28.91kN) Avon 103 engine. The second prototype, which was fitted with production-standard avionics, {{armament}} and a 7,550lbf (33.58kN) Avon 107 turbojet, first flew on 5May1952. As an insurance against development problems {{on the part of}} the Avon engine, Hawker modified the design to accommodate another axial turbojet, the 8,000lbf (35.59kN) Armstrong Siddeley <b>Sapphire</b> 101. Fitted with a <b>Sapphire,</b> the third prototype flew on 30 November 1952.|$|E
5000|$|Briggs {{wrote the}} Helpmann Award winning play The <b>Sapphires</b> which was first {{performed}} in 2004. It {{tells the story}} of The <b>Sapphires,</b> a singing group of four Koori women who tour Vietnam during the war. [...] It is inspired by the true story of his mother, Laurel Robinson, and aunt, Lois Peeler, who toured Vietnam as singers in 1968. Briggs adapted the play for the 2012 film The <b>Sapphires.</b>|$|R
50|$|In August 2007, Eunice Olumide, a model {{signed to}} <b>Sapphires,</b> was {{announced}} as a finalist at the Scottish Fashion Awards. <b>Sapphires</b> {{were the first}} model agency outside London or Scotland to be representing a finalist at the awards. In January 2008, <b>Sapphires</b> opened a second office in London and in 2010 relocated their head office to Soho. In 2012, the company further expanded and moved to new offices in South Molton Street, Mayfair.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Sapphires</b> {{is about}} four {{indigenous}} Australian women, Gail (Deborah Mailman), Julie (Jessica Mauboy), Kay (Shari Sebbens) and Cynthia (Miranda Tapsell), who are discovered by a talent scout (Chris O'Dowd), {{and form a}} music group named The <b>Sapphires,</b> travelling to Vietnam in 1968 to sing for troops during the war.

5|$|The George VI Victorian Suite was {{originally}} a wedding present by George VI {{to his daughter}} Elizabeth in 1947. The suite consists of a long necklace of oblong sapphires and diamonds {{and a pair of}} matching square <b>sapphire</b> earrings also bordered with diamonds. The suite {{was originally}} made in 1850. The stones exactly matched the colour of the robes of the Order of the Garter, although this may have been a coincidence on George's part. Elizabeth had the necklace shortened by removing the biggest <b>sapphire</b> in 1952, and later had a new pendant made using the removed stone. In 1963, a new <b>sapphire</b> and diamond tiara and bracelet were made to match the original pieces. The tiara is made out of a necklace that had belonged to Princess Louise of Belgium, daughter of Leopold II. In 1969, the Queen wore the complete parure to a charity concert.|$|E
5|$|The P.1067 first {{flew from}} RAF Boscombe Down on 20 July 1951, {{powered by a}} 6,500lbf (28.91kN) Rolls-Royce Avon 103 engine from an English Electric Canberra bomber. The second {{prototype}} was fitted with a 7,550lbf (33.58kN) Avon 107 turbojet. Hawker's third prototype was powered by an 8,000lbf (35.59kN) Armstrong Siddeley <b>Sapphire</b> 101.

5|$|As chief {{engineer}} at Altec, Hilliard joined the Hollywood {{section of the}} <b>Sapphire</b> Group, a regular social gathering of sound recordists and a precursor to the Audio Engineering Society. In 1948, Hilliard was elected to chair the <b>Sapphire</b> Group Recording Standards Committee. He made certain, along with the Motion Picture Research Council, that proposed industry standards were forwarded to members of National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), Acoustical Society of America (ASA) and Royal Musical Association (RMA). Hilliard helped form the Los Angeles section of the Audio Engineering Society (AES) in 1951. At the beginning of 1963, IRE merged with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)—Hilliard retained his Fellowship.|$|E
