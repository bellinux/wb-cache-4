5|$|A July 2006 USA Today/Gallup {{poll found}} that 83% of the 1,005 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, at least in part, for the 2006 Lebanon War, {{compared}} to 66% who blamed Israel to <b>some</b> <b>degree.</b> Additionally, 76% disapproved of the military action Hezbollah took in Israel, compared to 38% who disapproved of Israel's military action in Lebanon. A poll in August 2006 by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 68% of the 1,002 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, at least in part, for the civilian casualties in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War, compared to 31% who blamed Israel to <b>some</b> <b>degree.</b> Another August 2006 poll by CNN showed that 69% of the 1,047 Americans polled believed that Hezbollah is unfriendly towards, or an enemy of, the United States.|$|E
5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to <b>some</b> <b>degree.</b> This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Although other breeds {{were being}} {{increasingly}} imported and bred, {{the numbers of}} the Finnhorse population also slowly began to recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed.

5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> of flexibility between the bones {{in the rear of}} the mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on the surface of the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} affects between 5% and 66% of people, {{with about}} 20% {{of individuals in}} most populations having the condition to <b>some</b> <b>degree.</b> This makes it the most common disease of the oral mucosa.

5|$|As well as English, England has {{two other}} {{indigenous}} languages, Cornish and Welsh.

5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Brax {{said that}} {{personal}} data protection legislation needed to be adjusted to allow a freer access to information among professionals.

5|$|Farsari's {{images were}} widely distributed, {{presented}} or mentioned {{in books and}} periodicals, and sometimes recreated by artists in other media; they shaped foreign perceptions {{of the people and}} places of Japan and to <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> affected how Japanese saw themselves and their country.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed churches, only believing Christians are {{expected}} to partake of the Lord's Supper. Further, partakers {{are expected}} to examine and prepare themselves for the sacrament. This involves determining whether one acknowledges their sinfulness and has faith in Christ to forgive them. Christians may have <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> of doubt regarding their salvation, but they are at least {{to be aware of}} their sin and have a desire to have faith.|$|E
5|$|In a 1983 study, only 5% of {{patients}} who had abruptly stopped taking long-acting benzodiazepines after less than 8 months demonstrated withdrawal symptoms, but 43% {{of those who had}} been taking them for more than 8 months did. With alprazolam– a short-acting benzodiazepine– taken for 8 weeks, 65% {{of patients}} experienced significant rebound anxiety. To <b>some</b> <b>degree,</b> these older benzodiazepines are self-tapering.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} at {{the county}} level, and to <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> at the state level, became notoriously tolerant of the illegal activities in Galveston, {{in no small part}} because of the prosperity they generated, and the bribery and influence peddled by the Maceos. The city police very early on became entirely complicit.|$|E

50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>degrees</b> {{are awarded}} jure dignitatis. That is, {{a person who}} has {{demonstrated}} the appropriate qualities to be given a particular office may be awarded the degree by virtue of the office held. It is another kind of earned—but not strictly academic—degree.|$|R
5|$|Outside {{its native}} range, F.rubiginosa has naturalised to <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> in urban Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia, {{as well as}} New Zealand, Hawaii and California, and Mediterranean Europe.

5|$|Rome's {{earliest}} history, {{from the}} time of its founding as a small tribal village, to the downfall of its kings, is the least well preserved. Although the early Romans were literate to <b>some</b> <b>degree,</b> this void {{may be due to the}} lack of will to record their history at that time, or such histories as they did record were lost.|$|E
5|$|Two skull bones, the {{lacrimal}} and postorbital bones, projected {{into the}} eye socket {{from the front}} and back, nearly dividing it into two compartments. The eye would have been located in the upper compartment, which was tilted slightly outwards in Carnotaurus, perhaps providing <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> of binocular vision. The lacrimal and postorbital also met above the eye socket, to form a ridge or brow above the eye.|$|E
40|$|Grating coupled {{emission}} PbSnSe/PbEuSnSe double-heterostructure stripe-geometry diode lasers were fabricated using {{molecular beam}} epitaxy.

50|$|Collaborative {{programs}} with other {{institutions such as}} the University of Alberta allow students to complete <b>some</b> bachelor <b>degrees</b> at GPRC, including the Bachelor of Science - Agriculture. Other degree programs require transferring to another institution to complete their degree after studying at the College.

In total, over 20 different routes for University Studies are offered, and <b>some</b> <b>degrees</b> can be completed at the College.|$|R
50|$|Constraint {{algorithms}} achieve computational efficiency by neglecting motion along <b>some</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom.
