25|$|Hardening {{vegetable}} oil {{is done by}} raising a blend of {{vegetable oil}} and a catalyst in near-vacuum to very high temperatures, and introducing hydrogen. This causes the carbon atoms of the oil to break double-bonds with other carbons, each carbon forming a new single-bond with a hydrogen atom. Adding these hydrogen atoms to the oil makes it more solid, raises the <b>smoke</b> <b>point,</b> and makes the oil more stable.|$|E
25|$|In the {{processing}} of edible oils, the oil is heated under vacuum to near the <b>smoke</b> <b>point,</b> and water is introduced {{at the bottom of}} the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam sparging removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization is key to the manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and canola oils found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors and flavors, and lightens the color of the oil.|$|E

40|$|Seven {{commercial}} {{edible oils}} including soybean oil, corn germ oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, blend peanut oil, calola oil and lard were investigated for their {{physical and chemical}} properties {{as well as for the}} mutagenicity of oil fumes by applying the Ames test.

Peanut oil produced the largest amount of fumes while corn germ oil and sunflower oil produced the least amounts. The oil fumes (0 similar to 10 mu g/plate) of these edible oils showed various degrees of mutagenicity toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Soot {{formation}} within hydrocarbon-fueled flames is {{an important}} unresolved problem of combustion science for several reasons: soot emissions are responsible for more deaths than any other combustion pollutant, thermal loads due to continuum radiation from soot limit the durability of combustors, thermal radiation from soot is mainly responsible for the growth and spread of unwanted fires, carbon monoxide associated with soot emissions is responsible for most fire deaths, and limited understanding of soot processes is a major impediment {{to the development of}} computational combustion. Thus, soot processes within laminar nonpremixed (diffusion) flames are being studied, emphasizing space-based experiments at microgravity. The study is limited to laminar flames due to their experimental and computational tractability, noting the relevance of these results to practical flames through laminar flamelet concepts. The microgravity environment is emphasized because buoyancy affects soot processes in laminar diffusion flames whereas effects of buoyancy are small for most practical flames. Results discussed here were obtained from experiments carried out on two flights of the Space Shuttle Columbia. After a brief discussion of experimental methods, results found thus far are described, including soot concentration measurements, laminar flame shapes, laminar <b>smoke</b> <b>points</b> and flame structure. The present discussion is brief...|$|R

40|$|The {{harmful effects}} of {{aviation}} can only be reduced by using alternative fuels with excellent burning properties and a high hydrogen content in the constituent molecules.

Despite the fact that landfill plastic waste has been steadily reduced, the present scenario is not satisfactory. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} produce JET fuel containing an alternative component made from straight-run kerosene and the waste polyethylene cracking fraction. We carried out our experiments on a commercial NiMo/Al 2 O 3 /P catalyst at the following process parameters: T= 200 - 300 °C, P= 40 bar, LHSV= 1. 0 - 3. 0 h- 1, hydrogen/hydrocarbon ratio= 400 Nm 3 /m 3. We investigated the effects of the feedstocks and the process parameters on the product yields, the hydrodesulfurization and hydrodearomatization efficiencies, and the main product properties. The liquid product yields varied between 99. 7 - 99. 8 %.

50|$|The <b>smoke</b> <b>point</b> of any oil {{is defined}} by the {{temperature}} at which light blue smoke rises from the surface. The smoke, which contains acrolein, is an eye irritant and asphixiant. The <b>smoke</b> <b>point</b> of oils vary widely. Depending on origin, refinement, age, and source growth conditions, the <b>smoke</b> <b>point</b> for any given type of oil can drop nearly 20 °C. For example, the <b>smoke</b> <b>point</b> of olive oil can vary from being suitable for high temperature frying to only safely used for stir frying. As a cooking oil is refined its <b>smoke</b> <b>point</b> increases. This is because many of the impurities found in natural oils aid in their breakdown.

40|$|Soot {{processes}} within hydrocarbon/air diffusion flames {{are important}} because they affect the durability and performance of propulsion systems, the hazards of unwanted fires, the pollutant and particulate emissions from combustion processes, {{and the potential for}} developing computational combustion. Motivated by these observations, this investigation involved an experimental study of the structure and soot properties of round laminar jet diffusion flames, seeking an improved understanding of soot formation (growth and nucleation) within diffusion flames. The present study extends earlier work in this laboratory concerning laminar <b>smoke</b> <b>points</b> (l) and soot formation in acetylene/air laminar jet diffusion flames (2), emphasizing soot formation in hydrocarbon/air laminar jet diffusion flames for fuels other than acetylene. In the flame system, acetylene is the dominant gas species in the soot formation region and both nucleation and growth were successfully attributed to first-order reactions of acetylene, with nucleation exhibiting an activation energy of 32 kcal/gmol while growth involved negligible activation energy and a collision efficiency of O. 53 %. In addition, soot growth in the acetylene diffusion flames was comparable to new soot in premixed flame (which also has been attributed to first-order acetylene reactions). In view of this status, a major issue is the nature of soot formation processes in diffusion flame involving hydrocarbon fuels other than acetylene. In particular, information is needed about th dominant gas species in the soot formation region and the impact of gas species other than acetylene on soot nucleation and growth...|$|R
