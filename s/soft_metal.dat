5|$|Ferrite (α-iron) is {{a fairly}} <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> that can {{dissolve}} only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910°C). Austenite (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146°C). This form of iron {{is used in the}} type of stainless steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.|$|E
5|$|Flanders and his brother, Ernest, were {{instrumental}} in developing screw thread grinding machines. These incorporated advances in thread technology (furthered by the Hartness optical comparator) and Flanders’s engineering calculations for gear-cutting machinery. In 1946, the two brothers received the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute as recognition of this accomplishment. They had improved the accurate manufacture of die-cut screws in <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> and solved the problem of thread-grinding on hardened work.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is a <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> with {{a silvery}} appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E

5|$|Being a <b>soft</b> <b>metal,</b> mercury forms {{very stable}} {{derivatives}} with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar {{and is the}} brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form. Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is a very}} <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It {{is quite}} malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E
5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a <b>soft</b> <b>metal.</b> The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E

25|$|Aluminium {{is a much}} <b>softer</b> <b>metal</b> than steel, and the {{techniques}} to improve its machinability usually rely on making it more brittle. Alloys 2007, 2011 and 6020 have very good machinability.|$|R
5|$|Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide californium, to the left of the actinide fermium and below the lanthanide holmium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm3 is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm3) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm3), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860°C) is also relatively low – below californium (900°C), fermium (1527°C) and holmium (1461°C). Einsteinium is a <b>soft</b> <b>metal,</b> with the bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|Among the lanthanides, {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a <b>soft</b> <b>metal.</b> Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides. Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, it changes to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|Unhexquadium {{should be}} a <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> like mercury, and {{metallic}} unhexquadium should have a high melting point as it is predicted to bond covalently. It {{is also expected to}} be a soft Lewis acid and have Ahrlands softness parameter close to 4eV. It should also have some similarities to oganesson {{as well as to the}} other group 12 elements. Unhexquadium {{should be a}}t most moderately reactive, having a first ionization energy that should be around 685kJ/mol, comparable to that of molybdenum. Due to the lanthanide, actinide, and superactinide contractions, unhexquadium should have a metallic radius of only 158pm, very close to that of the much lighter magnesium, despite its being expected to have an atomic weight of around 474u, about 19.5times as much as that of magnesium. This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46g·cm−3, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61g·cm−3; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table, with only its neighbour unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47g·cm−3). Metallic unhexquadium should be quite stable, as the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are very deeply buried in the electron core and only the 7d electrons are available for bonding. Metallic unhexquadium should have a very large cohesive energy due to its covalent bonds, most probably resulting in a high melting point.|$|E

50|$|A {{piercing}} saw, {{also known}} as a jeweler's saw, is a type of saw commonly used in jewelry making on sheet metal. It is usually used on <b>softer</b> <b>metals</b> as the saw is delicate.|$|R
50|$|The most {{established}} {{materials for}} thermocompression bonding are copper (Cu), gold (Au) and aluminium (Al) {{because of their}} high diffusion rates. In addition, aluminium and copper as relatively <b>soft</b> <b>metals</b> have good ductile properties.|$|R
25|$|The {{brake pads}} must usually be {{replaced}} regularly (depending on pad material, and drivestyle), {{and some are}} equipped with a mechanism that alerts drivers that replacement is needed, such as a thin piece of <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> that rubs against the disc when the pads are too thin causing the brakes to squeal, a <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> tab embedded in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a warning light when the brake pad gets thin, or an electronic sensor.|$|E
25|$|Zinc is a <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> (MH 2.5) {{with poor}} {{mechanical}} properties. It has a crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) that is slightly distorted from the ideal. Many zinc compounds are markedly covalent in character. The oxide and hydroxide of zinc in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely ZnO and Zn(OH)2, are amphoteric; it forms anionic zincates in strongly basic solutions. Zinc forms Zintl phases such as LiZn, NaZn13 and BaZn13. Highly purified zinc, at room temperature, is ductile. It reacts with moist air {{to form a}} thin layer of carbonate that prevents further corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Gold is a <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> (MH 2.5–3) that {{is easily}} deformed. It has a {{close-packed}} face-centred cubic structure (BCN 12). The chemistry of gold {{is dominated by}} its +3 valence state; all such compounds of gold feature covalent bonding, as do its stable +1 compounds. Gold oxide (Au2O3) is amphoteric, with acidic properties predominating; it forms anionic hydroxoaurates M where M = Na, K, Ba, Tl; and aurates such as NaAuO2. Gold is a constituent of Zintl phases such as M2AuBi (M = Li or Na); Li2AuM (M = In, Tl, Ge, Pb, Sn) and Ca5Au4.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps most worrisome were {{experiments}} that suggested the A-9 and scissile phosphates must come within about 4 Å {{of one another}} in the transition-state, based upon double phosphorothioate substitution and <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> ion rescue experiments; the distance between these phosphates in the minimal hammerhead crystal structure was about 18 Å, with no clear mechanism for close approach if the Stem II and Stem I A-form helices were treated as rigid bodies. Taken together, these results appeared to suggest that a fairly large-scale conformational change must have taken place in order to reach the transition-state within the minimal hammerhead ribozyme structure.|$|E
25|$|Copper is a <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> (MH 2.5–3.0) {{with low}} {{mechanical}} strength. It has a close-packed face-centred cubic structure (BCN 12). Copper behaves like {{a transition metal}} in its preferred oxidation state of +2. Stable compounds in which copper is in its less preferred oxidation state of +1 (Cu2O, CuCl, CuBr, CuI and CuCN, for example) have significant covalent character. The oxide (CuO) is amphoteric, with predominating basic properties; it can be fused with alkali oxides (M2O; M = Na, K) to give anionic oxycuprates (M2CuO2). Copper forms Zintl phases such as Li7CuSi2 and M3Cu3Sb4 (M = Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, or Er).|$|E
25|$|Pure tin is an {{expensive}} and <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> {{and it is not}} practical to use it alone. However, it could be alloyed with lead and copper to make pewter or alloyed with copper alone to produce bronze. Today's tinplate is mild steel electroplated with tin. Its non-rusting qualities make it an invaluable coating. However, its quality depends on the iron or steel being free from rust and the surface tin an unbroken coating. A piece of tinware may develop rust if the tin coating has worn away or been cut in the metal. The respective properties of the metals mean that corrosion once started is likely to be rapid.|$|E
5000|$|Mallets {{used for}} {{metalworking}} usually have either wood or plastic faces. These [...] "faces" [...] {{come in a}} variety of shapes, such as flat, torpedo, hemispheric, or square in shape. The different faces (and material the mallet is made of) allow you to work and/or shrink different metals. For instance, the flat face can be used for planishing and smoothing and for hand shrinking thicker <b>soft</b> <b>metals.</b> Whereas a large hickory [...] "torpedo mallet's" [...] striking weight makes it best suitable for shaping <b>soft</b> <b>metals</b> such as aluminum or copper, but a similar torpedo mallet made from heavy black rubber has a striking weight which is best used for shaping steel.|$|R
50|$|Some winter {{tires are}} {{fabricated}} {{to allow the}} optional insertion of metal studs (consisting of a tungsten carbide or other hard material pin embedded in a base of a <b>softer</b> <b>metal)</b> for additional traction on icy roads.|$|R
5000|$|Other Andean {{cultures}} {{such as the}} Paracas {{have used}} the tumi for the neurological procedure of skull trepanation. Many of these operations were carefully performed, suggesting that the surgery was done for the relief of some body disturbance other than that associated with injury, perhaps an organic or mental condition. The tumi knives used in the earlier cultures of Peru, such as the Paracas, were likely different in composition {{than those of the}} later Lambayeque and Chimu, as tumis from these cultures were only functional in a symbolic ceremonial manner, to do the use of <b>soft</b> <b>metals.</b> These <b>soft</b> <b>metals</b> would not have allowed for the actual killing of animal or cutting of any kind of flesh.|$|R
25|$|Electrotype {{was also}} used to {{manufacture}} matrices {{that could be used}} as moulds for individual pieces of metal type. This had several advantages over traditional punchcutting in hard steel: the type master only needed to be carved out of <b>soft</b> <b>metal,</b> and was also useful for large sizes of type, since it was hard to drive large punches into a matrix effectively. It cut the cost of decorative types that would not be used so often as body text typefaces. On the other hand, it gave no steel punch {{that could be used to}} create multiple matrices quickly, and was reported to not always give such good results as steel punchcutting.|$|E
25|$|Lead is a <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> (MH 1.5, but hardens {{close to}} melting) which, in many cases, {{is unable to}} support its own weight. It has a {{close-packed}} structure (BCN 12) but an abnormally large inter-atomic distance that {{has been attributed to}} partial ionisation of the lead atoms. It forms a semi-covalent dioxide PbO2; a covalently bonded sulfide PbS; covalently bonded halides; and a range of covalently bonded organolead compounds such as the lead(II) mercaptan Pb(SC2H5)2, lead tetra-acetate Pb(CH3CO2)4, and the once common, anti-knock additive, tetra-ethyl lead (CH3CH2)4Pb. The oxide of lead in its preferred oxidation state (PbO; +2) is amphoteric; it forms anionic plumbates in strongly basic solutions. Lead forms Zintl phases such as CsPb, Sr31Pb20, La5Pb3N and Yb3Pb20. It has reasonable to good corrosion resistance; in moist air it forms a mixed gray coating of oxide, carbonate and sulfate that hinders further oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Dental amalgam {{has had a}} {{long history}} and global impact. It was first {{introduced}} in the Chinese materia medica of Su Kung in 659 A.D. during the Tang Dynasty. In Europe, Johannes Stockerus, a municipal physician in Ulm, Germany, recommended amalgam as a filling material as early as 1528. In 1818, Parisian physician Louis Nicolas Regnart added one-tenth by weight of mercury to the fusable metals used as fillings at the time to create a temporarily <b>soft</b> <b>metal</b> alloy at room temperature. Thus, amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal or metals, from the French word amalgame) was invented. This was further perfected in 1826, when Auguste Taveau of Paris used a silver paste made from mixing French silver-tin coins with mercury, which offered more plasticity and a quicker setting time. In Europe, prior to 1818, carious teeth were either filled with a melted metal, usually gold or silver (which would often lead to death of the nerve of the tooth from thermal trauma), or the tooth would be extracted.|$|E

50|$|Ligands {{and metal}} cations tend to follow hard soft acid base theory (HSAB) trends. This means that larger, more polarizable <b>soft</b> <b>metals</b> will {{coordinate}} more readily with larger more polarizable soft ligands, and small, non-polarizable, hard metals coordinate to small, non-polarizable, hard ligands.|$|R
