25|$|Chronic {{secretion}} {{of stress}} hormones, glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines (CAs), {{as a result}} of disease, may reduce the effect of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, or other receptors in the brain, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerve</b> terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express adrenoreceptors.

25|$|Reserpine (also {{known by}} trade names Raudixin, Serpalan, Serpasil) is an indole alkaloid, antipsychotic, and {{antihypertensive}} drug {{that has been}} used for the control of high blood pressure and for the relief of psychotic symptoms, although because of the development of better drugs for these purposes and because of its numerous side-effects, it is rarely used today. The antihypertensive actions of reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines (among other monoamine neurotransmitters) from peripheral <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerve</b> endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral vascular resistance.|$|E
25|$|Catecholamines are {{synthesized}} inside {{cells and}} sequestered in intracellular vesicles. This was first shown by Blaschko and Arnold Welch (1908–2003) in Oxford and by Hillarp {{and his group}} in Lund for the adrenal medulla and later for sympathetic nerves and the brain. In addition the vesicles contained adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with a molar noradrenaline:ATP ratio in <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerve</b> vesicles of 5.2:1 as determined by Hans-Joachim Schümann (1919–1998) and Horst Grobecker (born 1934) in Peter Holtz′ group at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Blaschko and Welch wondered how the catecholamines got out when nervous impulses reached the cells. Exocytosis was not among the possibilities they considered. It required the analogy of the ″quantal″ release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction shown by Bernard Katz, third winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the demonstration of the co-release with catecholamines of other vesicle constituents such as ATP and dopamine β-hydroxylase; and the unquestionable electron microscopic images of vesicles fusing with the cell membrane – to establish exocytosis.|$|E

40|$|The {{participation}} of the parasympathetic and <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerves</b> in the canine gallbladder motility was examined. Efferent stimulation of the parasympathetic (vagus) and <b>sympathetic</b> (celiac) <b>nerves</b> caused contraction or inhibition of the neck, body and fundus of the gallbladder. The contractile response induced by vagus nerve stimulation was reduced by subthreshold efferent stimulation of the celiac nerve, while the inhibitory response was neither reduced nor enhanced by subthreshold efferent stimulation of the celiac nerve. The contractile and inhibitory response induced by celiac nerve stimulation was not reduced in the neck, body and fundus by subthreshold efferent stimulation of the vagus nerve. The contractile response to vagus nerve stimulation was reversed to a relaxant response by atropine administration, which was reduced or abolished by hexamethonium. It is suggested that the vagus nerve-induced contractile response in the canine gallbladder is modulated by <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerves</b> presynaptically at the vagus nerve endings in the enteric ganglion, but the vagus nerve-induced relaxant response, which probably was induced by non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory neurons, is not modulated by the <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerves.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|Thanks to Holtz and Blaschko it {{was clear}} that animals {{synthesized}} noradrenaline. What was lacking to attribute a transmitter role to it was proof of its presence in tissues at effective concentrations and not only as a short-lived intermediate. On April 16, 1945, Ulf von Euler of Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, who had already discovered or co-discovered substance P and prostaglandins, submitted to Nature {{the first of a series}} of papers that gave this proof. After many bioassays and chemical assays on organ extracts he concluded that mammalian sympathetically innervated tissues as well as, in small amounts, the brain, but not the nerve-free placenta, contained noradrenaline and that noradrenaline was the sympathin of Cannon and Rosenblueth, the ″physiological transmitter of adrenergic nerve action in mammals″. Overflow of noradrenaline into the venous blood of the cat’s spleen upon <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerve</b> stimulation two years later bore out the conclusion. In amphibian hearts, on the other hand, the transmitter role of adrenaline was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|The war {{prevented}} Peter Holtz and {{his group}} in Rostock from being recognized {{side by side with}} von Euler as discoverers of the second catecholamine transmitter noradrenaline. Their approach was different. They sought for catecholamines in human urine and found a blood pressure-increasing material Urosympathin that they identified as a mixture of dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline. “As to the origin of Urosympathin we would like to suggest the following. Dopamine in urine is the fraction that was not consumed for the synthesis of sympathin E and I. … Sympathin E and I, i.e. noradrenaline and adrenaline, are liberated in the region of the <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerve</b> endings when these are excited.” The manuscript was received by Springer-Verlag in Leipzig on October 8, 1944. On October 15, the printing office in Braunschweig was destroyed by an airstrike. Publication was delayed to volume 204, 1947, of Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archiv für experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie. Peter Holtz later used to cite the paper as ″Holtz et al. 1944/47″ or ″Holtz, Credner and Kroneberg 1944/47″.|$|E
25|$|He had luck in {{the latter}} statement. In most {{amphibian}} organs including the heart, the concentration of adrenaline far exceeds that of noradrenaline, and adrenaline is indeed the main transmitter. In mammals, however, difficulties arose. In a comprehensive structure-activity study of adrenaline-like compounds, Dale and the chemist George Barger in 1910 pointed out that Elliott’s hypothesis assumed a stricter parallelism between the effects of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerve</b> impulses and adrenaline than actually existed. For example, sympathetic impulses shared with adrenaline contractile effects in the trigone but not relaxant effects in the fundus of the cat′s urinary bladder. In this respect, ″amino-ethanol-catechol″ – noradrenaline – mimicked sympathetic nerves more closely than adrenaline did. The Harvard Medical School physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon, who had popularized {{the idea of a}} sympatho-adrenal system preparing the body for fight and flight, and his colleague Arturo Rosenblueth developed an elaborate but ″queer″ theory of two sympathins, sympathin E (excitatory) and sympathin I (inhibitory). The Belgian pharmacologist Zénon Bacq as well as Canadian and US-American pharmacologists between 1934 and 1938 suggested that noradrenaline might be the – or at least one – postganglionic sympathetic transmitter. However, nothing definite was brought to light till after the war. In the meantime, Dale created a terminology that since has imprinted the thinking of neuroscientists: that nerve cells should be named after their transmitter, i.e. cholinergic if the transmitter was ″a substance like acetylcholine", and adrenergic if it was ″some substance like adrenaline″.|$|E

25|$|A {{new chapter}} was opened when Max Lewandowsky in 1899 in Berlin {{observed}} that adrenal extracts acted {{on the smooth}} muscle of the eye and orbit of cats – as the iris dilator muscle and nictitating membrane – {{in the same way}} as <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerve</b> stimulation. The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Schäfer’s presentation: ″Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. … I find that even after … complete denervation, whether of three days’ or ten months’ duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. … The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.″ The abstract is the ″birth certificate″ of chemical neurotransmission. Elliott was never so explicit again. It seems he was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research.|$|E

Intravenous noradrenaline was taken up into the heart and spleen of rats, and cocaine prevented the uptake, ″thus increasing the amount of noradrenaline available for combination with the adrenergic receptors″. The uptake of 3H-noradrenaline was severely impaired after sympathectomy, indicating that it occurred mainly into <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nerve</b> terminals. In support of this, Axelrod and Georg Hertting (born 1925) showed that freshly incorporated 3H-noradrenaline was re-released from the cat spleen when the sympathetic nerves were stimulated. A few years later, Leslie Iversen (born 1937) in Cambridge found that other cells also took up catecholamines. He called uptake into noradrenergic neurones, which were cocaine-sensitive, uptake1 and uptake into other cells, which were cocaine-resistant, uptake2. With the reserpine-sensitive uptake from the cytoplasm into the storage vesicles there were thus three catecholamine membrane passage mechanisms. Iversen’s book of 1967 “The Uptake and Storage of Noradrenaline in Sympathetic Nerves” was successful, showing the fascination of the field and its rich pharmacology.|$|E
