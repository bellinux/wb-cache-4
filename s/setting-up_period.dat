40|$|The {{setting up}} of the ARGO {{detector}} at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (4300 m a. s. l., Tibet, P. R. China) has been completed during the last spring (2007). It consists of a central carpet made of 130 identical sub-units of 12 RPCs each (a "cluster"), covering a surface of about 5800 m 2 with 93 % active area, and a guard ring of 24 further clusters of the same type surrounding the central carpet with a lower sampling density. Signals are picked up by external electrodes of small size, thus allowing the sampling of EAS with high space-time granularity. Shower events are detected at a trigger rate of about 4 kHz. Events with a few particles detected by a single cluster are counted in scaler mode on a time base of 500 ms. The intrinsic modularity of the ARGO detector allowed us to collect data even during the <b>setting-up</b> <b>period,</b> using only the central carpet (or even part of it). Some preliminary results from the analysis of events collected {{in a few months}} of data taking are presented. Â© 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The filter with the highest COD loading performed the worst in terms of outflow COD concentration (120 mg/l) but best in terms of COD load reduction (61 %). The wetland with the largest aggregate size had the lowest mean nitrate-nitrogen outflow concentration of 1. 2 mg/l. However, the results were similar regardless of aggregate size (10 versus 20 mm) and resting time (24 versus 48 h) for most water quality variables. However, different COD inflow concentrations (COD of 146 mg/l versus COD of 312 mg/l) had a significant (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) impact on the treatment performance for COD, ammonia-nitrogen, ortho-phosphate-phosphorus and suspended solids (SS). Serious clogging phenomena impacting negatively on the treatment performance were not observed for any columns. However, a small aggregate diameter, a short contact time, a long resting time and a low COD inflow concentration were most beneficial in reducing SS accumulation within the wetland filters...|$|E
