40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>septicity</b> within wastewater transfer systems often requires a significant investigative approach {{to determine the}} appropriate mitigation response. <b>Septicity</b> of sewage is generally related to extended retention within wastewater transfer systems. Potential effects of <b>septicity,</b> simplistically, are, generation, and emission, of odour to atmosphere, and, eventual infrastructure degradation, by way of formation, in situ, of corrosive compounds. <b>Septicity</b> produces an inherently poor working environment for operational staff within wastewater transfer systems and treatment plants. Complex operational issues arise, through generation of hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), a toxic compound prominently produced by <b>septicity,</b> when attempting maintenance activities within manholes, pipework, pumping stations and treatment plants. In addition, the generation of hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), an unpleasant gaseous compound, may result in complaints from people living, working, or just passing through, the area of emission. Furthermore, issues often arouse media interest and lead to negative publicity fo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{performance}} of the BiobeadTM version of the Biological Aerated Flooded Filter Process over the last few years. More than twenty of these units have been installed in the U. K. and the operating experience has enabled further development steps to be made, the range of application to be widened and the design methods associated with the technology to be refined. Operating problems have arisen when the design load is less than that found upon commissioning. For the BAFF system because of the short retention times within the media bed it is essential that excess dissolved oxygen is present at all times. Diurnal peaks in load must be allowed for in design. A related problem is that of septic influent. <b>Septicity</b> has a profound influence on the development flora and fauna in any biological system and so it is preferable that <b>septicity</b> is corrected outside of the BAFF system. Similarly intermittent saline intrusion will reduce performance, although to a lesser extent than that found on Activated Sludge processes. The final problem with BAFF's is that of media quality which is exclusively a quality control problem. The major engineering change introduced to the Biobead system is the aeration system which is now a simple sparge tube immersed in the media. This increases the allowable air rates and is particularly helpful in designing for larger than normal diurnal variation. Similarly, the air scour system now used an array of simple drop tubes. The performance of the media has been further improved by the use of charge neutralising additives to the plastic formulation together with broadening the range of source materials able to produce the textured surface finish. Modules of any size can be produced by assemblies of smaller modules of proven engineering performance...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was prompted by}} varied statements in the literature con-cerning {{the relationship of the}} Sphaeriidae of the genera Sphaerium, Musculium, and Pisidium as {{they may or may not}} be related to organic pollution, by a desire of the writers to suggest quantitative methods for the collection of bottom organ-isms in a small creek and for a valid expression of numbers of benthonic organisms. The field work was carried out on Lytle Creek (with a c. f. s. of approximately 0. 55 to 7. 0), in the vicinity of Wilmington, Ohio. The source of organic pollution in Lytle Creek is domestic sewage from Wilmington with a population (1950 census of population, preliminary counts) of 7, 412. Wilmington is sewered and has primary sewage treatment facilities. This treatment is not enough, however, to prevent <b>septicity</b> from setting in in the stream during periods of low flow...|$|E
30|$|Dengue viral {{diseases}} are a standout amongst the supreme critical mosquito-borne maladies these days. They create problems like dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue stun disorder (DSS) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Lately, {{the frequency of}} DHF has expanded significantly. Dengue {{may be caused by}} one of the serotypes DEN- 1 to DEN- 4. For the most part, <b>septicity</b> with one serotype presents upcoming defensive resistance against that specific serotype yet not against different serotypes. When anyone is infected for the second time with various serotypes, a serious disease will occur [1]. After an infected mosquito bites, the virus enters the human body and repeats inside the cell of the mononuclear phagocyte ancestry (monocytes, macrophages, and B cell). The incubation time frame is 7 - 10 days. Then a viremia stage, where the patient is plainly febrile and infective, takes place. From that point, the infected human body may either recuperate or advance to the leakage stage, prompting DHF and/or potentially DSS [2]. To calculate the span of viremia, analystsâ€™ assumed that noticeable viremia began on the eve of onset of ailment, and after the recognition of the disease in the human body, it vanishes soon.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Abdominal {{surgical}} site {{infections are}} among the most common complications of inpatient admissions and have serious consequences for outcomes and costs. Different risk factors may be involved, including age, sex, nutrition and immunity, prophylactic antibiotics, operation type and duration, type of shaving, and secondary infections. This study aimed to determine the risk factors affecting abdominal surgical site infections and their incidence at Imam Khomeini, a major referral teaching hospital in Iran. Methods Patients (n = 802) who had undergone abdominal surgery were studied and the relationships among variables were analyzed by Student's t and Chi-square tests. The subjects were followed for 30 days and by a 20 -item questionnaire. Data were collected through pre- and post-operative examinations and telephone follow-ups. Results Of the 802 patients, 139 suffered from SSI (17. 4 %). In 40. 8 % of the cases, the wound was dirty infected. The average age for the patients was 46. 7 years. The operations were elective in 75. 7 % of the cases and 24. 7 % were urgent. The average duration of the operation was 2. 24 hours, the average duration of pre-operative hospital stay 4. 31 days and the average length of (pre- and post-operation) hospital stay 11. 2 days. Three quarters of the cases were shaved 12 hours before the operation. The increased operation time, increased bed stay, electivity of the operation, <b>septicity</b> of the wound, type of incision, the administration of prophylactic antibiotic, type of operation, background disease, and the increased time lapse between shaving and operation all significantly associated with SSI with a p-value less than 0. 001. Conclusion In view of the high rate of SSI reported here (17. 4 % compared with the 14 % quoted in literature), this study suggests that by reducing the average operation time to less than 2 hours, the average preoperative stay to 4 days and the overall stay to less than 11 days, and approximating the timing of shaving to the operation and substituting cefazolin for cefaluthin when prophylactic antibiotic is to be administered, the SSI may be reduced to a more acceptable level. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} population, {{cities and towns}} {{all over the world}} usually results in the {{over-exploitation}} of resources and increased pollution. Water service providers (WSPs) are required to provide adequate sanitation to the community, taking into consideration technical, social, economic and environmental issues. Therefore, WSPs are faced with increasingly complex objectives and demands when making decisions related to asset investment. Sewer systems handle two types of water that require drainage: (sanitary) wastewater and stormwater. These two types of water typically convey different classes of solids into the system. The presence of these solids which include sediment in systems causes operational problems: loss of hydraulic capacity, in-pipe <b>septicity</b> and contribute to the pollutants in foul flushes. This leads to significant economic and environmental impact on stakeholders and the area into which storm water is discharged. This paper demonstrates a wide variety of effective strategies for addressing sewer sediment management to improve existing infrastructure and develop new systems using hydraulic modelling and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Sediment management generally relies on low technology practices that are applied by individuals, municipalities and industrial establishments. In the UK the current practices to control sediment in urban drainage catchments entail street, gully and sewer cleaning. Other techniques like (e. g. sediment traps, flushing tanks and flushing gates) have been considered elsewhere as an effective method of controlling sediment deposition in the sewer provided regular cleansing and maintenance are carried out (Ashley et al, 2004). There are six options being considered for the management of sewer sediment for this study. The first two are to control the solids entering the sewer system, three options are considering managing the sediment in the sewers and the final option is to manage the sediment {{at the end of the}} pipe at the wastewater treatment plant (WTP). The study has calculated the mass flow analysis (MFA) of solids that enter the sewer system using detailed hydraulic modelling. The dynamic model provides inputs needed by other components of the study in describing the life cycle assessment of sediment management options in sewer systems using life cycle assessment via the SimaPro software. The LCA goal of the reported study is to evaluate the energy use, resource consumption, pollutant emissions and the consequent environmental impacts of alternative solids management scenarios. ...|$|E
