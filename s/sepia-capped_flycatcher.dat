5000|$|Nine-primaried oscines make up much {{of almost}} every Neotropical mixed-species feeding flock. Namely, these birds are from {{families}} such as the cardinals, Parulidae (New World [...] "warblers"), and in particular Emberizidae (American [...] "sparrows") and Thraupidae (tanagers). Other members of a Neotropic mixed feeding flock may come {{from most of the}} local families of smaller diurnal insectivorous birds, and can also include woodpecker, toucans, and trogons. Most Furnariidae do not participate in mixed flocks, though there are exceptions such as Synallaxis spinetails and some species of the woodcreeper subfamily - e.g. those mentioned above or the lesser woodcreeper - are common or even [...] "core" [...] members. Among the tyrant flycatchers there are also some species joining mixed flocks on a somewhat regular basis, including the <b>sepia-capped</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> eared pygmy tyrant, white-throated spadebill, and Oustalet's tyrannulet.|$|E
40|$|Nest and or nest site reuse {{within and}} between {{breeding}} seasons was reported by the Euler's Flycatcher (Lathrotriccus euleri), the <b>Sepia-capped</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> (Leptopogon amaurocephalus) and the Gray-hooded Flycatcher (Mionectes -rufiventris) in forest fragments from southeastern Brazil. Nest and or nest site reuse between some years was frequent within a single breeding season by the <b>Sepia-capped</b> <b>Flycatcher.</b> Nest reuse, however, {{was not related to}} nesting success in the previous breeding attempt. Nest turnover rates (movement to a new site between years) were low for L. amaurocephalus, intermediate for L. euleri and high for M. rufiventris...|$|E
