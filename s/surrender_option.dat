50|$|The mid 1840s become {{somewhat}} confusing {{because there}} are two very closely timed military actions occurring: the struggle between the Californios and Mexican appointed leaders not of California and the occupation and annexation of California into the US. In early 1845, William Workman was appointed captain of a cadre of Americans and Europeans serving with Governor Pío Pico in his standoff with appointed Governor Manuel Micheltorena at the battle at Cahuenga Pass of the Mexican American War, northwest of Los Angeles. Although the battle that ensued was limited to minimal gunfire and no casualties, Workman, his lieutenant John Rowland, Benjamin Davis Wilson, and James McKinley from the Pico side worked out a <b>surrender</b> <b>option</b> with Americans and Europeans on the Micheltorena side and the governor was allowed to leave California by ship. Pico assumed the governorship, but his relocating of the Alta California capital to Los Angeles from Monterey and his plan to move the customs house to San Pedro Bay, among other issues, led northerner José Castro to mount a challenge to Pico's authority. Workman was appointed to lead the defense of Los Angeles against an incursion by Castro's forces, when news came that the American army was ready to invade the department of Alta California for other actions in the Mexican War.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroducing a <b>surrender</b> <b>option</b> in unit-linked life {{insurance}} contracts {{leads to a}} dependence between the surrender time and the financial market. [J. Barbarin, Risk minimizing strategies for {{life insurance}} contracts with <b>surrender</b> <b>option,</b> Tech. rep., University of Louvain-La-Neuve, 2007] used a lot of concepts from credit risk to describe the surrender {{time in order to}} hedge such types of contracts. The basic assumption made by Barbarin is that the surrender time is not a stopping time with respect to the financial market. The goal {{of this article is to}} make the hedging strategies more explicit by introducing concrete processes for the risky asset and by restricting the hazard process to an absolutely continuous process. First, we assume that the risky asset follows a geometric Brownian motion. This extends the theory of [T. Møller, Risk-minimizing hedging strategies for insurance payment processes, Finance and Stochastics 5 (2001) 419 – 446], in that the random times of payment are not independent of the financial market. Second, the risky asset follows a Lévy process. For both cases, we assume the payment process contains a continuous payment stream until surrender or maturity and a payment at surrender or at maturity, whichever comes first...|$|E
40|$|A {{variable}} annuity contract with Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) promises {{to return the}} entire initial investment through cash withdrawals during the policy life plus the remaining account balance at maturity, regardless of the portfolio performance. We assume that market is complete in financial risk and also there is no mortality risk (in the event of policyholder death, the contract is maintained by bene-ficiary), thus the annuity price can be expressed as an appropriate expectation. Under the optimal withdrawal strategy of a policyholder, the pricing of variable annuities with GMWB is an optimal stochastic control problem. The surrender feature available in marketed products allows {{termination of the contract}} before maturity, making it also an optimal stopping problem. Although the surrender feature is quite common in {{variable annuity}} contracts, {{there appears to be no}} published analysis and results for this feature in GMWB under optimal policyholder behavior - results found in the literature so far are consistent with the absence of such a feature. Recently, Azimzadeh and Forsyth (2014) prove the existence of an optimal bang-bang control for a Guaranteed Lifelong Withdrawal Benefits (GLWB) contract. In particular, they find that the holder of a GLWB can maximize a writers losses by only ever performing nonwithdrawal, withdrawal at exactly the contract rate, or full surrender. This dramatically reduces the optimal strategy space. However, they also demonstrate that the related GMWB contract is not convexity preserving, and hence does not satisfy the bang-bang principle other than in certain degenerate cases. For GMWB under optimal withdrawal assumption, the numerical algorithms developed by Dai et al. (2008), Chen and Forsyth (2008) and Luo and Shevchenko (2015 a) appear to be the only ones found in the literature, but none of them actually performed calculations with <b>surrender</b> <b>option</b> on top of optimal withdrawal strategy. Also, it is of practical interest to see how the much simpler bang-bang strategy, although not optimal for GMWB, compares with optimal GMWB strategy with <b>surrender</b> <b>option.</b> Recently, in Luo and Shevchenko (2015 a), we have developed a new efficient numerical algorithm for pricing GMWB contracts in the case when transition density of the underlying asset between withdrawal dates or its moments are known. This algorithm relies on computing the expected contract value through a high order Gauss-Hermite quadrature applied on a cubic spline interpolation and much faster than the standard partial differential equation methods. In this paper we extend our algorithm to include <b>surrender</b> <b>option</b> in GMWB and compare prices under different policyholder strategies: optimal, static and bang-bang. Results indicate that following a simple but sub-optimal bang-bang strategy does not lead to significant reduction in the price or equivalently in the fee, in comparison with the optimal strategy. We also observed that the extra value added by the <b>surrender</b> <b>option</b> strongly depends on volatility and the penalty charge, among other factors such as contractual rate, maturity and interest rate etc. At high volatility or at low penalty charge, the surrender feature adds very significant value to the GMWB contract - the required fair fee is more than doubled in some cases; thus it is critical to account for surrender feature in pricing of real products. We also performed calculations for static withdrawal with <b>surrender</b> <b>option,</b> which is the same as bang-bang minus the “no-withdrawal” choice. We find that the fee for such contract is only less than 1 % smaller when compared to the case of bang-bang strategy, meaning that the “no-withdrawal” option adds little value to the contract. 7 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The non-forfeiture {{options of}} a cash value life {{insurance}} policy allow the policyholder {{to gain access to}} any cash value he or she may have built up {{over the life of the}} contract. One of these options is the policy surrender, which is a voluntary decision to terminate coverage and to receive the entire cash value of the policy. ^ Since most life insurer assets are invested in fixed-income instruments of positive duration, insurer portfolios are susceptible to losses in the event of an increase in interest rates. As a withdrawal feature, the <b>surrender</b> <b>option</b> is a potential source of interest rate risk for life insurers. The <b>surrender</b> <b>option</b> may also be exercised by many policyholders in the event of economic duress. ^ Because the <b>surrender</b> <b>option</b> is a legally mandated part of all cash value life insurance policies, insurers may be legally bound to bear a risk that may be highly correlated across their pools of cash value life insurance policies, violating a primary principle of insurance. This dissertation analyzes data on {{life insurance policy}}holder surrender activity to determine whether the risks posed by policy surrender are functions of certain macroeconomic variables and, as a result, are highly correlated across all policies. The results indicate that surrender activity is positively related to inflation, real interest rates, and unemployment, while surrender activity is directly related to real per capita income. Average policy size also has an inverse relationship with surrender activity while policy loans and company leverage have a positive but lagged influence on surrenders. ^ Since many policies that are surrendered are replaced with new, and sometimes better, products, the incentives of the insurance agent in recommending surrender and replacement are potentially important factors in life insurance disintermediation. Specifically, the role of agent compensation is explored in a principal-agent context and legalized premium rebating is analyzed using data from the two states in which rebating has been legalized, California and Florida. Rebating is found to have a direct statistical relationship with surrender activity. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} pricing {{application}} analyzing, in a contingent-claims framework, the two most common types of life policies sold in Italy {{during the last two}} decades.

40|$|Throughout {{the past}} couple of decades, the surge in the sale of equity linked {{products}} has led to many discussions on the valuation of <b>surrender</b> <b>options</b> embedded in these products. However, most studies treat such options as American/Bermudian style options. In this thesis, a different approach is presented where only a portion of the policyholders react optimally, due to the belief that not all policyholders are rational. Through this method, a probability of surrender is found and the product is partially hedged by iteratively reducing the measure of risk to a non-positive value. This partial hedging framework is versatile since few assumptions are made. To demonstrate this, the initial capital requirement for an equity linked product is found under a bivariate equity/interest model with a copula based dependence structure. A numerical example is presented in order to demonstrate some of the dynamics of this valuation method. In addition, a surprising result is found during the adjustment of the surrender parameters which directly implies that under a particular valuation method, an increased number of policy surrenders causes a drop in the initial capital requirement. This counter-intuitive result is directly caused by the partial hedging method...|$|R
40|$|Insurance {{products}} {{become increasingly}} more innovative {{in order to}} face competitive pressures. Insurance policies today come with guarantees on the minimum rate of return, bonus provisions, and <b>surrender</b> <b>options.</b> These features make them attractive for investors who seek not only insurance but also investment vehicles. However, the new policies are much more complex to price and fund than traditional insurance products. In this chapter we discuss {{the development of a}} scenario-based optimization model for asset and liability management for the participating policies with guarantees and bonus provisions offered by Italian insurers.

It is applied to the analysis of policies offered by Italian insurance firms. While the optimized model results are in general agreement with current industry practices, inefficiencies are still identified and potential improvements are suggested.

40|$|The opacity of {{traditional}} accounting systems for insurance companies is well known. This was confirmed recently by unexpected repercussions of {{stock market and}} interest rates movements on the financial strength of many insurance companies. To improve transparency, new valuation standards are initiated by regulators or by professional bodies such as actuaries or accountants. Whether the purpose is pricing or risk management, the new standards are all based on a market consistent framework where assets and liabilities are valued at market value. Traditionally the pricing and the risk capital assessment are treated separately. In this thesis we build a unifying valuation framework where these two components can not be dissociated. To reflect the incompleteness of insurance markets and the limited access to equity capital, we introduce the notion of cost of capital. We analyse {{the impact of the}} cost of capital on the valuation of life insurance contracts with guarantees. In the last part of this thesis we focus on <b>surrender</b> <b>options</b> that represent today one of the most obscure risk for life insurers.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} model to compute the fair premium for equity-linked {{contracts}} that include a <b>surrender</b> <b>option.</b> In an equity linked policy, the premium can either be paid at inception in a unique solution or “divided ” in smaller amounts typically paid {{at the beginning of}} each year. The policy payoff is strictly dependent on the performance of the reference fund. The policy-holder bears the risk of a negative performance of the reference fund, hence, insurance companies generally include into the contract a minimum guarantee providing a lower bound for the policy payoff that protects the insured investment. In the case of equity-linked contracts that include a <b>surrender</b> <b>option,</b> the policy-holder can exercise the option and receive the pre-specified surrender value expiring the contract immediately while, if he decides to hold the contract until the maturity date, he receives the stated benefits.

40|$|Universal life {{insurance}} {{has been difficult}} to analyze due to its extremely flexible, dynamic design. ^ Methodology. The dissertation attempts to design a framework for evaluating investment and product design strategies for a universal life policy in light of the exogenous stochastic effects which influence the viability of the product. Data for the estimation were obtained from a large midwestern stock life insurer. A Box-Jenkins transfer function model approach is used to identify insurance cash flow models and ridge regression is used to control for multicollinearity. A set of significant exogenous economic input variables are identified for each cash flow component which include: new and renewal premium income, policy loans, cash value surrenders, and partial surrenders. ^ The estimated insurance cash flow models are then combined with assumptions about investment policy to form an 2 ̆ 2 integrated 2 ̆ 2 experience model. This combination allows for the use of a so-called scenario testing approach, through which the potential impact on policy experience of various exogenous economic and internal investment 2 ̆ 2 scenarios 2 ̆ 2 can be assessed. A detailed discussion of various asset/liability management approaches is provided and is followed by specific illustrations of how these approaches {{can be applied to the}} integrated experience model. ^ Results. Several interesting results are found with respect to insurance cash flows. First, the number of new policies and the premium on these increase with increases in the yield spread and decreases in the rate of unemployment. This suggests a sensitivity of universal {{life insurance}} premium flows to economic changes. Renewal and replacement premiums also increase with decreases in the rate of unemployment. Second, the direct recognition strategy used in the policy appears to lessen the disintermediation risk associated with policy loan activity. Some evidence suggests that policyholders may opt to 2 ̆ 2 disintermediate 2 ̆ 2 through the reduction of premium payments rather than through the exercise of policy loan and <b>surrender</b> <b>options.</b> ^ Conclusions. The dissertation provides some insight into premium and policy persistency under varying economic environments. Investigation of various credited rate strategies, also, suggests that this component is important in determining policy performance. Finally, the desirability of a particular investment strategy is found to vary across the different economic scenarios. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.) ...|$|R

For example, with respect to whether insurers should <b>surrender</b> their <b>option</b> to use genetic information in life insurance underwriting, a seemingly reasonable, innocuous suggestion might be made: Life insurers should voluntarily agree to place a moratorium on the use of genetic information in underwriting.
