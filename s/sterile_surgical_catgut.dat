40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among patients in a dermatology practice. METHODS. Historical cohort, matched case-control, and cross-sectional survey methods were used. RESULTS. The age-specific incidence of reported HBV infection in the practice from 1985 through 1991 was more than 12 times the expected rate. The dermatologist was not an HBV carrier. He practiced neither universal precautions nor <b>sterile</b> <b>surgical</b> technique. Seroprevalence of markers for HBV infection was highest (36. 8 %) among patients who had had surgery on the same day that HBV was apparently acquired by an index case; seroprevalence was near the expected background level for patients not exposed to index cases. Of HBV-infected patients with known dates of onset, 72 % had had surgery during their incubation periods. All of 30 HBV antigen specimens tested were of the same subtype. None of the patients tested, including 74 patients exposed to surgery on the same day as a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, had evidence of HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS.

All gloves were tested immediately following surgery using the test method described in Standard EN 455 – 1 (each glove was inflated with 1, 000 ± 50 ml of water and observed for leaks for 2 – 3 min.). Results. Analysis of tears took into consideration the role of medical personnel (operator, first assistant, second assistant) during surgical procedure, the type of procedure according to ICD- 9 and ICD- 10 codes, and the elective or emergency nature of the procedure. The {{results of the study}} show that these factors have a significant influence on the risk of glove tears. Significant differences were observed in tear frequency and tear location depending on the function performed by the surgeon during the procedure. Conclusion. The study proved that the role performed by the surgeon during the procedure (operator, first assistant, second assistant) has a significant influence on the risk of glove tearing. The role in the procedure determines exposure to glove tears.

Biopsy punches are disposable and range from 2 to 6 mm in diameter. PHOTOS 2 - 3 : Larger biopsies are usually preferred by the pathologist for histological diagnosis. The junction between normal and abnormal tissue should be biopsied. Punch biopsies are used to get skin samples. The skin directly over the selected site is clipped and cleaned with a surgical scrub. A local anaesthetic is injected around the lesion and the biopsy site is scrubbed again. The skin is stretched and the biopsy punch is placed at right angles to the skin surface. The punch is rotated in one direction and firm downward pressure is applied. The punch is then angled parallel to the skin while still applying pressure. The punch is rotated to sever the base of the biopsied material and is then removed. The tissue core is elevated with the point of a needle and the base severed with a scalpel.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Approximately 5 % of {{patients}} undergoing surgery develop surgical site infections (SSI), which prolong {{the length of}} hospital stay to 9. 7 days. This study was performed aimed to {{determine the amount of}} contamination of <b>sterile</b> <b>surgical</b> instruments with Staphylococcus aureus during long time orthopedic surgeries. Methods: In This study done as a prospective study, 245 <b>sterile</b> <b>surgical</b> instruments were sampled. The contaminated samples at every hour were excluded from samples of next hour. Then, antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus strains was tested by 14 antibiotics using disk diffusion method according to the recommendations of CLSI. The MIC of the strains towards methicillin was tested through microdilution method, and PCR was done on mecA gene. Data and results were analyzed by chi-square statistical test and significance level was considered to be p< 0 / 05. Results: Out of a total of 110 specimens obtained immediately after opening the sterile covering, 5 cultures were positive (4. 54 %); 10 (10. 98 %) in 91 samples taken after surgery; 5 (15. 62 %) in 32 samples taken 2 hours after surgery; and 1 (8. 33 %) 1 in 12 samples taken 3 hours after surgery. The highest resistance of the isolates was against ceftazidime (85. 71 %), and all strains were sensitive to vancomycin (100 %). In MIC test, 52. 38 % of the strains were resistant to methicillin, and 66. 66 % of the strains had mecA gene in the PCR method. Conclusion: Considering high contamination rate of surgical instruments with S. aureus, it is recommended that the covering of the sterile trays should not be opened until they are specifically needed during the procedure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} catgut implantation at acupoints on leptin resistance (LR) and insulin resistance (IR) in the simple obesity rat. MethodsRats were made obese with high-fat diets, after which <b>surgical</b> <b>catgut</b> was implanted at Zusanli (ST 36) and Neiting (ST 44) acupoints {{once a week for}} 4 weeks (implantation group). Rats from the implantation group were compared with normal rats and unoperated obese rats (control group). Gene expression of the leptin receptor (OB-R) was evaluated using RT-PCR and northern blot. Serum and hypothalamus leptin and insulin (INS) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Body weight, Lee's index, body fat, serum and hypothalamus leptin and INS levels, and hypothalamic OB-R gene expression were determined before and after treatment. ResultsBody weights, Lee's index, body fat, and serum leptin and INS levels were significantly higher in obese than in normal rats. Hypothalamic leptin and INS levels and OB-R gene expression were significantly lower in obese rats. Catgut implantation at acupoint promoted weight loss and decreased serum leptin and INS levels. Hypothalamic leptin and INS levels and OB-R gene expression increased significantly. ConclusionsCatgut implantation at acupoint adjusts central and peripheral leptin and promotes hypothalamic OB-R gene expression.

40|$|This {{randomized}} {{prospective study}} aims to evaluate any {{differences in the}} postoperative infection rate from dental extraction using either <b>sterile</b> or clean <b>surgical</b> gloves and to determine any predisposing factors that may complicate socket healing. A total of 609 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups, with the operators wearing either sterile or clean gloves in performing forcep extractions. 551 patients, who had 811 extractions performed, returned for the postoperative assessment visit. There was no difference in the incidence of an acutely inflamed socket, acutely infected socket and dry socket and also no significant predisposing factors found between the sterile and clean glove groups. The pre-operative diagnosis of caries, periodontal disease or retained root had a higher tendency of producing an acute-inflamed socket, whereas an acutely infected socket only developed in the cases of retained root. On the pain intensity level, an acutely inflamed socket caused mild to moderate pain, on acutely infected socket caused moderate to severe pain; and a dry socket caused severe pain in the majority of cases.

40|$|Following trauma, {{the amount}} of {{granulation}} tissue and subsequent mature scar tissue varies with {{the severity of the}} muscle fibre damage. Very little granulation tissue is seen in <b>sterile</b> <b>surgical</b> incisions, and the main changes that persist at the site of damage are atrophy of groups of muscle fibres due to denervation and a slight increase of fibro-adipose tissue.
