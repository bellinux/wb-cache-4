40|$|The bone–screw {{interface}} {{has been}} indicated as the weak link in pedicle screw spine fixation. Bisphosphonate treatment {{may have the}} effect of improving bone–screw interface fixation in spine fusion by inhibiting bone resorption. An experimental study was conducted using a porcine model to evaluate the influence of alendronate treatment on bone–pedicle screw interface fixation. Eleven pigs in the treatment group received alendronate 10  mg/day orally for three months postoperatively. The other 11 pigs served as a control group. Posterior lateral fusion with the CD Horizon pedicle screw system was performed with autograft on the lumbar spine on all animals. Biomechanical torsion test and histomorphometric parameters of screw fixation were evaluated three months after the operation. The maximum torque and initial angular stiffness of the treatment group was higher than that of the control group, but there was no statistical significance. The bone–screw contact surface was 23. 3 [*]±[*] 10 % for the treatment group and 9. 8 [*]±[*] 5. 9 % for the control group (P[*]<[*] 0. 01).

30|$|The six {{patients}} who complained of pain over their screws at maturity had screws {{placed in a}} parallel fashion. We are now countersinking the screw heads partially into the cortical bone at the meta-diaphyseal junction to address this concern. Although crossed screws are more technically demanding to achieve precise placement, crossed screws may have less screw head prominence and decrease the risk of irritating the adjacent soft tissues. Song et al. [17] treated 59 patients with PETS using crossed screws and reported no screw-related pain, infection, neurologic injury or hematoma. Three screws broke during attempted removal and the removal was abandoned in 2 others. Five patients (8  %) developed an axial deviation that was attributed to inadequate purchase of the epiphysis on one side {{in three of the}} five cases. In our study, no patient developed asymmetric growth that created an axial, coronal or sagittal deformity and we had no problems removing screws. Parallel screws are shorter than crossed screws and can be placed within 10 degrees of perpendicular to the physis in both the anteroposterior and lateral views making them theoretically more mechanically effective to inhibit growth than crossed screws. Since crossed screws are longer than parallel screws, 7.3 -mm cannulated screws with a 32 -mm thread are placed in a crossed fashion in case they are difficult to remove even though they have reverse-cutting threads. We believe that the ideal screw to address all these shortcomings would be a fully threaded 7.3 -mm cannulated <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|E

STUDY DESIGN Biomechanical cadaver study. ANIMALS Eighteen canine cervical vertebral columns (C 2 -C 7) {{were collected from}} skeletally mature dogs (weighing 22 - 32 [*]kg). METHODS Specimens were radiographed and examined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Stiffness of the unaltered C 4 -C 5 intervertebral motion unit was measured in extension, flexion and lateral bending using non-destructive 4 -point bend testing.

40|$|Objective: To compare metal {{artefact}} {{reduction in}} MRI at both 3. 0 [*]T and 1. 5 [*]T using different sequence strategies. Methods: Metal implants of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screw</b> and plate within agarose phantoms and tissue specimens {{as well as}} three patients with implants were imaged at both 1. 5 [*]T and 3. 0 [*]T, using view angle tilting (VAT), slice encoding for metal artefact correction with VAT (SEMAC-VAT) and conventional sequence. Artefact reduction in agarose phantoms was quantitatively assessed by artefact volume measurements. Blinded reads were conducted in tissue specimen and human imaging, with respect to artefact size, distortion, blurring and overall image quality. Wilcoxon and Friedman tests for multiple comparisons and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for interobserver agreement were performed with a significant level of p[*]<[*] 0. 05. Results: Compared with conventional sequences, SEMAC-VAT significantly reduced metal artefacts by 83 %[*]±[*] 9 % for the screw and 89 %[*]±[*] 3 % for the plate at 1. 5 [*]T; 72 %[*]±[*] 7 % for the screw and 38 %[*]±[*] 13 % for the plate at 3. 0 [*]T (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). In qualitative analysis, SEMAC-VAT allowed for better visualization of tissue structures adjacent to the implants and produced better overall image quality with good interobserver agreement for both tissue specimen and human imaging (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 80 - 0. 99; p[*]<[*] 0. 001). In addition, VAT also markedly reduced metal artefacts compared with conventional sequence, but was inferior to SEMAC-VAT. Conclusion: SEMAC-VAT and VAT techniques effectively reduce artefacts from metal implants relative to conventional imaging at both 1. 5 [*]T and 3. 0 [*]T. Advances in knowledge: The feasibility of metal artefact reduction with SEMAC-VAT was demonstrated at 3. 0 -T MR. SEMAC-VAT significantly reduced metal artefacts at both 1. 5 and 3. 0 [*]T. SEMAC-VAT allowed for better visualization of the tissue structures adjacent to the metal implants.

40|$|Background: Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} is {{a commonly}} diagnosed neurosensory disease of head, neck and face region, involving 5 th cranial nerve. Carbamazepine {{is the first}} line drug if there is decrease in efficacy or tolerability of medication, surgery needs to be considered. Factors such as pain relief, recurrence rates, morbidity and mortality rates should be taken in to account while considering which technique to use. Peripheral neurectomy is a safe and effective procedure for elderly patients and in rural and remote centers where neurosurgical facilities are not available. It is also effective in those patients who are reluctant for major neurosurgical procedures. Although loss of sensation along the branches of trigeminal nerve and recurrence rate are associated with peripheral neurectomy, we consider it as the safe and effective procedure in rural practice, which can be done under local anesthesia. Aims: The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the long term efficacy of peripheral neurectomy with and without the placement of stainless steel screws in the foramina and to calculate the mean remission period after peripheral neurectomies for different branches of trigeminal nerve. Setting and Design: The sample was divided into 2 groups by selecting randomly the patients, satisfying inclusion criteria. Both groups were operated under local anesthesia by regional nerve blocks. In one group of patients after peripheral neurectomy, the proximal nerve stump was left alone in the foramina, and in another group of patients, obturation of foramina was done with stainless steel screws after peripheral neurectomy. Materials and Methods: Peripheral neurectomy was done on the terminal branches of trigeminal nerve in 14 patients. We selected only those cases that were experiencing pain after Carbamazepine therapy, all our patients were from rural and remote areas where facilities to neurosurgical centers are limited. Elderly patients who were unfit for surgical procedures and those patients who were reluctant for major neurosurgical treatments were considered for the study. Results: Post-surgical pain relief varied from 15 months to 24 months in cases where neurectomy was done without placing stainless steel screws in the foramina. Those cases where peripheral neurectomy was done along with the placement of stainless steel screws in the foramina, none of the patient had painful symptoms even after minimum 2 years of follow-up. Student′s `t`-test of 2 groups showed the remission period to be statistically highly significant in patients with <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screw</b> obturation, having P-value < 0. 0005. Obturating the foramen with stainless steel screws can prevent nerve regeneration. Thus, remission of pain can be prolonged. Conclusion: Peripheral neurectomy is thus a safe and effective procedure for elderly patients, for those patients living in remote and rural places that cannot avail major neurosurgical facilities, and for those patients who are reluctant for major neurosurgical procedures...|$|E

In this preliminary study, we hypothesize that a chitosan coating either unloaded or loaded with an antibiotic, gentamicin, could lessen or prevent these devices from becoming an initial nidus for infection. The questions investigated for this hypothesis were: (1) {{how much of}} the sterilized coating remains on the screw with simulated functional use; (2) is the unloaded or loaded chitosan coating bacteriostatic and biocompatible; and (3) what amount and rate does an antibiotic elute from the coating?

40|$|Objectives/hypothesis: to {{demonstrate}} the capability of a fiber-based Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (ARCLaser, Nuremberg, Germany and Valam, Orangeburg, NY) to disrupt biofilm. Study design: biofilms were grown in broth for 72 hours prior to the experiment. A clinical otorrhea isolate from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used. Biofilms were placed in MatTek culture plates, on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screws,</b> tympanostomy tubes, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sutures. Methods: culture plates, <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screws,</b> tympanostomy tubes, and PET sutures {{were used for the}} laser disruption of biofilm experiments. Q-switched Nd:YAG laser pulses were delivered on biofilms using shockwave probes originally designed for cataract surgery. The thin laser fiber tip was targeted against a titanium target, creating the production of plasma and resulting in a shockwave effect. Results: biofilm areas were imaged before, during, and after laser application using a confocal microscope. The biofilm was imaged growing on the glass/plastic step of the plates, in the grooves of the threads of the screws, over the tympanostomy tube, and on the PET suture. During laser treatment, a time-lapse function was used to capture the results. As a result of laser-generated shockwaves, the biofilm was initially seen to oscillate and eventually break off with individual pulses. Large and small pieces of biofilm were totally and instantly removed from the surface to which they were attached in {{a matter of a few}} seconds. Conclusions: we were able to effectively disrupt Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in vitro using a miniature Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, thin fibers, and special probes that generated plasma formation and a resulting shockwave effect. This laser technology has the ability to generate a powerful stress wave sufficient to disrupt biofilm without any ill effect to the underlying host structure...|$|R

40|$|During the {{surgical}} preparation of bone, prior to insertion of an implant, bone will be traumatized {{which leads to}} local resorption. Consequently, early implant fixation might be reduced. Impaired early fixation, as evidenced by radiostereometry, {{has been associated with}} increased risk of late loosening. Bisphosphonates are known to inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts and have shown to increase implant fixation when administered systemically or locally directly at the bone prior to implant insertion. A method to bind bisphosphonates directly to the implant was developed. <b>Stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screws</b> were coated with crosslinked fibrinogen, serving as an anchor for bisphosphonate attachment. The screws were inserted in the tibial metaphysis in rats and implant fixation was analyzed with pullout measurements. Bisphosphonate coated screws turned out to have 28 % higher pullout force at 2 weeks compared to control screws with the fibrinogen coating only. The next experiment was designed to measure at what stage in the healing process the strongest bisphosphonate effect was gained. Bisphosphonate coated screws were expected to reduce the resorption of the traumatized bone. However, no decreased fixation was found in the control group. Instead, the fixation increased with time, and so did the effect of the bisphosphonates. At 8 weeks, the pullout force was twice as high for screws with bisphosphonate compared to control screws. By histology at 8 weeks, a bone envelope was found around bisphosphonate coated screws but absent around control screws. Thus, the anti catabolic action of the bisphosphonate resulted in an increased amount of bone surrounding the bisphosphonate screws. Titanium is generally considered to be better fixated in bone compared to <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> The coating technique was found to be applicable on titanium as well, again with improved fixation. A majority of fractures occur in osteoporotic bone. Despite the relatively low amount of bisphosphonates at the screws, the bisphosphonate coating improved implant fixation at 2 weeks also in rats made osteoporotic by ovariectomy. In conclusion, bisphosphonates bound to titanium or <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screws</b> coated with fibrinogen increased fixation in bone, in rats. These results suggest that the bisphosphonate and fibrinogen coating might improve the fixation of screw shaped implants and possibly also arthroplasties, in humans...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies show}} that surface immobilized bisphosphonates improve the {{fixation}} of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screws</b> in rat tibia after 2 - 8 weeks of implantation. We report here about the immobilization of a potent bisphosphonate, zoledronate, to crosslinked fibrinogen {{by the use of}} another technique, i. e. ethyl-dimethyl-aminopropylcarbodiimide (EDC) /imidazole immobilization. Bone fixation of zoledronate-coated screws was compared to screws coated with crosslinked fibrinogen only and ditto with EDC/N-hydroxy-succinimide immobilized pamidronate. Fixation in rat tibia was evaluated by a pull-out test at either 2 or 6 weeks after implantation. Both bisphosphonate coatings increased the pull-out force at both time points, and zoledronate showed a significantly higher pull-out force than pamidronate. To further evaluate the new coating technique we also performed a morphometric study, focusing on the area surrounding the implant. The zoledronate coating resulted in an increased bone density around the screws compared to controls. No pronounced increase was seen around the pamidronate coated screws. Together, the results demonstrate the possibility of obtaining a significant local therapeutic effect with minute amounts of surface immobilized zoledronate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{alkaline}} copper quaternary (ACQ) preservative treatment and of plywood glue lines on resistance-based moisture content (MC) measurements. Moisture meter readings using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screws</b> as electrodes were acquired over a range of moisture conditions in Southern Yellow Pine (SYP) lumber and plywood. Calibration equations are presented for predicting gravimetric MC from meter readings taken in SYP lumber and SYP plywood with or without ACQ treatment. These corrections assume that the meter has been set for SYP. Correlation equations are also presented for directly relating resistance to gravimetric MC, which may be useful for automated data collection systems employed in monitoring moisture levels in buildings. The conductance of SYP lumber was raised by treatment with ACQ, particularly at higher moisture contents, but was unaffected by vacuum-pressure treatment with water. The conductance of untreated SYP plywood, measured with electrodes penetrating the glue lines, exceeded that of untreated SYP lumber. The conductance of SYP plywood was lowered by treatment with ACQ, by vacuum-pressure soaking with water, and by exposure to rain. We suggest that electrolytes in the plywood glue lines increase the conductance of untreated plywood relative to that of untreated lumber, and that the concentration of these electrolytes is lowered by the (aqueous) preservative treatment process, thereby lowering the conductance of these high-conductance pathways...|$|R

40|$|A {{baseline}} {{approach to}} a design of a focusing solenoid for the superconducting section of the HINS linac was described in [1], where a set of requirements for the system can also be found. After this approach was accepted for implementation, several design iterations were made. Modifications were made to reflect better knowledge of coil winding density and superconducting strand parameters, to introduce dipole correctors {{in some of the}} solenoids and a gap in the flux return, and to make the solenoid shorter. The modifications resulted in some re-optimization of the solenoid’s geometry. It was shown in [2] {{that as a result of}} thermal contraction during cooling down, gaps can develop between bucking coils and a flux return. To fix the problem, a gap in the flux return was introduced in order to keep the coil assembly under compression during cool down and excitation by using additional compression elements (<b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screws).</b> The presence of this gap resulted in significantly higher stray field level and required additional shielding. Changing situation with availability of superconducting strand also resulted in some design modifications. One of the versions of the solenoid design that utilized 0. 808 mm NbTi SSC-type Sumitomo-brand strand for the main coil and 0. 5 mm NbTi 54 -filament Oxford strand for the bucking coil is shown in Fig. 1 below.

40|$|Surgical and {{behavioral}} procedure for monkey Y Monkey Y {{was an adult}} female monkey (Macaca mulatta). All procedures {{were in accordance with}} NIH guidelines and were approved by the National Institute of Mental Health Animal Care and Use Committee. The monkey received an operation to place a titanium head restraint post by using standard sterile techniques. The operation was preceded by sedation with ketamine hydrochloride (10 – 20 mg/kg; intramuscular, i. m.), atropine injection (0. 04 mg/kg, i. m.) to reduce oral secretions, and intravenous (i. v.) injection of antibiotics (30 mg/kg cefazolin). After hair removal and cleaning, a saline i. v. drip was established. Then, a surgical level of anesthesia was maintained with a gas inhalant (isoflurane, 1 – 4 %). Heart rate (EKG), pCO 2, SPO 2 and body temperature were constantly monitored to judge the animal’s anesthetic state. After the animal’s head was fixed in a standard stereotaxic frame, the skin was incised. The skin, fascia and muscles were retracted to expose the skull. The titanium head restraint post (pre-sterilized) was attached to the skull by using 14 <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screws.</b> Then the fascia and skin were re-approximated around the restraint post. Antibiotic therapy was continued for 5 days after the operation. After this operation, the animal was given one week for recovery. Then, with the physical condition approved by a veterinarian, the animal was trained to stay in a primate restraining chair wit...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis {{investigation}} {{sought to}} determine the feasibility of a novel method of a percutaneous mitral valve repair. BackgroundPercutaneous mitral valve repair has emerged as an alternative therapy for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. However, current methods that rely on cannulation of the coronary sinus may not result in direct reduction of the mitral annulus area due to the superior relationship of the sinus to the annulus. MethodsA novel device, consisting of helical <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>screws</b> connected by a biocompatible tether, was designed for percutaneous mitral valve repair. This device was implanted by implanting the helical screws directly into the myocardium at the posteromedial mitral annulus of 8 anesthetized pigs from the right internal jugular vein. ResultsImplantation of the device resulted in a 19. 7 ± 0. 1 % reduction in mitral annular area and an 18. 8 ± 0. 1 % decrease in the mitral anterior-posterior dimension (both p < 0. 05 vs. baseline). This annular reduction persisted at 3 -month follow-up. Both the coronary sinus and left circumflex coronary artery remained patent in all animals. There {{was no evidence of}} device migration, poor wound healing, or tissue thrombosis at the sites of device implantation. ConclusionsPercutaneous mitral valve repair targeting the ventricular myocardium from central venous access is feasible. By directly acting on the posteromedial mitral annulus, this methodology targets the mitral annular area most frequently affected by ischemic mitral regurgitation, lessens the risk of coronary artery impingement, promotes coronary sinus patency, and overcomes technical concerns that may arise when the coronary sinus lies significantly superior to the mitral annulus...|$|R
