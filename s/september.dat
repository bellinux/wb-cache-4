5|$|A northwestward moving {{tropical}} wave {{moved out}} the Caribbean Sea on <b>September</b> 1 {{and became a}} tropical depression on <b>September</b> 2 after crossing southern Florida. Still moving northwestward, the tropical depression made landfall in southeastern Louisiana on <b>September</b> 4. A building high pressure system over the Central United States forced the tropical depression to move southwest over the Gulf of Mexico. The warm waters then cause the depression to reach tropical storm strength and the storm was given the name Fern by the National Hurricane Center on <b>September</b> 7.|$|E
5|$|A sizable {{contingent}} of National Guard arrived on <b>September</b> 2 to establish order and provide essential provisions, and on <b>September</b> 3, buses began {{arriving at the}} convention center {{to pick up the}} refugees there.

5|$|A surface trough of low {{pressure}} with {{an area of}} convection persisted off the southeast coast of the United States on <b>September</b> 18. On the same day, a weak tropical wave which moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on <b>September</b> 8 approached the area. A cold front merged with the stationary area of disturbed weather on <b>September</b> 20, and on <b>September</b> 22 a circulation developed 200miles (325km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Organization continued as outflow became better defined, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Six later that day.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on <b>September</b> 9 and became Tropical Depression Fourteen-E later that day. The cyclone moved northwest and strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} on <b>September</b> 10. Linda then rapidly intensified, reaching hurricane intensity the next day as an eye formed. On <b>September</b> 12, Linda reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of —making it a Category5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale—and a minimum pressure of 902mbar (902hPa), making it the most intense Pacific hurricane ever recorded until Hurricane Patricia surpassed it in 2015. However, Linda soon moved over cooler waters, and began to weaken, falling below hurricane intensity on <b>September</b> 16. It then slowly weakened and dissipated on <b>September</b> 17.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance left Central America on <b>September</b> 22. Despite some wind shear, the system gradually became better organized and a tropical depression formed <b>September</b> 26, being upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} several hours later. The cyclone immediately moved north. Instead of strengthening into a hurricane before landfall as forecasted, Olaf weakened due to its proximity to land. On <b>September</b> 29, Olaf made landfall near Salina Cruz, Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved into}} the Pacific Ocean from Central America on <b>September</b> 10. Convection along the wave became better organized as it moved westward, and a tropical depression developed on <b>September</b> 18. The depression moved generally west-northwestward before strengthening into Tropical Storm Marty on <b>September</b> 19. The storm entrained dry air into its circulation as it curved toward the northwest, disrupting the storm's convective structure and inhibiting further intensification {{for the next two}} days. Eventually, Marty fought off the dry air and intensified, reaching hurricane strength on <b>September</b> 21.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on <b>September</b> 17. It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on <b>September</b> 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the <b>September</b> 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula. The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula on <b>September</b> 29.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, {{and it is}} estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on <b>September</b> 2. Continuing northward, it struck Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa early on <b>September</b> 3 as a minimal hurricane. Isis weakened to a tropical storm a few hours after landfall, and subsequent to turning to the north-northwest the low-level circulation dissipated over Sierra Madre Occidental. The remnants entered southern Arizona on <b>September</b> 4 and tracked around an upper-level low. After entering Nevada on <b>September</b> 5, the remnants of Isis passed into Oregon before dissipating in Idaho on <b>September</b> 8.|$|E
5|$|An area of squally {{weather was}} first noted {{a few hundred}} miles east of the Lesser Antilles on <b>September</b> 18. The {{convective}} area organized into a tropical depression near the north coast of Hispaniola on <b>September</b> 20. After moving west-northwestward for a day, it turned northeastward, where upper level winds were very favorable and steering currents were very weak. On <b>September</b> 22 Gracie was named as a tropical depression before it developed into Tropical Storm Gracie, followed by reaching hurricane strength later that night. It turned to the east on <b>September</b> 25, and turned back west to west-northwest on <b>September</b> 27 as a stable anticyclone built in to its north.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{information}} from historical weather maps, {{it appeared that}} eastward-moving lower-atmospheric flow was present between <b>September</b> 16 and 17, though a closed circulation {{did not appear to}} be present. On <b>September</b> 18, the system developed into tropical depression between the Bahamas and Florida while it moved west-northwestward. After swiftly crossing the southern portion of the state, it strengthened into a tropical storm on <b>September</b> 19 over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and attained its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h) early during <b>September</b> 20. It began turning north on <b>September</b> 21, and made landfall on the Mississippi coast on <b>September</b> 22. The storm weakened as it moved inland, and curved east-northeast later during that day, only to transition into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. The storm lost extratropical characteristics over Virginia on <b>September</b> 23. As there were no reports of strong winds near the point of landfall, Partagás had doubt as to whether or not this storm was a tropical storm, as the most intense winds were recorded when the system was classified as extratropical.|$|E
