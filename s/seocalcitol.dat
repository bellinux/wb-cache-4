40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a common}} malignant tumour, which has a poor prognosis. Surgical resection can be curative but most patients are inoperable and most chemotherapy agents have minimal activity in this disease. <b>Seocalcitol,</b> a vitamin D analogue, induces differentiation and inhibits growth in cancer cell lines and in vivo. The vitamin D receptor is expressed in hepatocytes and more abundantly in HCC cells. In total, 56 patients with inoperable advanced HCC were included in an uncontrolled study of oral <b>Seocalcitol</b> treatment for up to 1 year (with possible extension for responders). The dose was titrated according to serum calcium levels. The treatment effect was evaluated by regular CT scans. Out of 33 patients evaluable for tumour response, two had complete response (CR), 12 stable disease and 19 progressive disease. The CRs appeared after 6 and 24 months of treatment, and lasted for 29 and at least 36 months (patient still in remission when data censored). <b>Seocalcitol</b> was well tolerated; the most frequent toxicity was hypercalcaemia and related symptoms. Most patients tolerated a daily dose of 10 mug of <b>Seocalcitol.</b> This is the first study showing activity, by reduction in tumour dimensions, of a differentiating agent in patients with an advanced bulky, solid tumour. <b>Seocalcitol</b> may have an effect {{in the treatment of}} HCC, especially in early disease when a prolonged treatment can be instituted. The survival benefit with or without tumour response should be determined in controlled studies...|$|E
40|$|Inoperable {{cancer of}} the exocrine {{pancreas}} responds poorly to most conventional anti-cancer agents, and new agents are required to palliate this disease. <b>Seocalcitol</b> (EB 1089), a vitamin D analogue, can inhibit growth, induce differentiation and induce apoptosis of cancer cell lines in vitro and can also inhibit growth of pancreatic cancer xenografts in vivo. Thirty-six patients with advanced pancreatic cancer received once daily oral treatment with <b>seocalcitol</b> with dose escalation every 2 weeks until hypercalcaemia occurred, following which patients continued with maintenance therapy. The most frequent toxicity was the anticipated dose-dependent hypercalcaemia, with most patients tolerating a dose of 10 – 15 [*]μg per day in chronic administration. Fourteen patients completed at least 8 weeks of treatment and were evaluable for efficacy, whereas 22 patients were withdrawn prior to completing 8 weeks' treatment and in 20 of these patients withdrawal was due to clinical deterioration {{as a result of}} disease progression. No objective responses were observed, with five of 14 patients having stable disease in whom the duration of stable disease was 82 – 532 days (median= 168 days). The time to treatment failure (n= 36) ranged from 22 to 847 days, and with a median survival of approximately 100 days. <b>Seocalcitol</b> is well tolerated in pancreatic cancer but has no objective anti-tumour activity in advanced disease. Further studies are necessary to determine if this agent has any cytostatic activity in this malignancy in minimal disease states...|$|E
40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} {{is associated}} with three human tumors: Kaposi's sarcoma, and the B cell lymphomas, plasmablastic lymphoma associated with multicentric Castleman's disease, and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). Epstein-Barr virus, the closest human relative of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, mimics host B cell signaling pathways to direct B cell development toward a memory B cell phenotype. Epstein-Barr virus-associated B cell tumors are presumed to arise {{as a consequence of}} this virus-mediated B cell activation. The stage of B cell development represented by PEL, how this stage relates to tumor pathology, and how this information may be used to treat the disease are largely unknown. In this study we used gene expression profiling to order a range of B cell tumors by stage of development. PEL gene expression closely resembles that of malignant plasma cells, including the low expression of mature B cell genes. The unfolded protein response is partially activated in PEL, but is fully activated in plasma cell tumors, linking endoplasmic reticulum stress to plasma cell development through XBP- 1. PEL cells can be defined by the overexpression of genes involved in inflammation, cell adhesion, and invasion, which may be responsible for their presentation in body cavities. Similar to malignant plasma cells, all PEL samples tested express the vitamin D receptor and are sensitive to the vitamin D analogue drug EB 1089 (<b>Seocalcitol)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Conditions of disuse in {{bed rest}} patients, {{as well as}} {{microgravity}} experienced by astronauts are accompanied by reduced mechanical loading, reduced calcium absorption, and lower serum levels of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 (1, 25 -D), the active metabolite of vitamin D, all contributing to bone loss. To determine whether 1, 25 -D or a less calcemic analog, <b>Seocalcitol</b> or EB 1089 (1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxy- 22, 24 -diene- 24, 26, 27 -trihomovitamin D 3) can alleviate bone loss in a rat hindlimb unloading model of disuse osteopenia, mature male rats originally on a vitamin D replete diet containing 1. 01 % calcium were transferred to a vitamin D-deficient diet containing 0. 48 % calcium and then tail suspended and treated for 28 days with vehicle, 0. 05 microg/kg 1, 25 -D, or 0. 05 microg/kg EB 1089. The vitamin D-deficient diet caused a substantial decrease in bone mineral density (- 8 %), which may be compounded by hindlimb unloading (- 10 %). Exogenous 1, 25 -D not only prevented the bone loss but also increased the bone mineral density to greater than the baseline level (+ 7 %). EB 1089 was less effective in preventing bone loss. Analysis of site and cell-specific effects of 1, 25 -D and EB 1089 revealed that 1, 25 -D was more active than EB 1089 in the intestine, the site of calcium absorption, and in inducing osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption whereas EB 1089 was more effective in inducing osteoblast differentiation. These studies suggest that elevating circulating 1, 25 -D levels presumably increasing calcium absorption can counteract bone loss induced by disuse or microgravity with its associated reductions in circulating 1, 25 -D and decreased calcium absorption...|$|E
