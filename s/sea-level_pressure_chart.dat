Warm months were characterized by thermic indices (TI) based on values of the standardized anomalous temperatures. Different patterns of anomalously warm and cold months were qualitatively identified {{on the basis of}} the spatial distributions of the TIs. The standardized <b>sea-level</b> <b>pressure</b> (SLP) values at 56 grid points in the domain 35 – 65 °N, 30 °W– 40 °E, for each of the anomalously warm and cold months, were subjected to T-mode Principal Component Analysis. The mean TIs associated with each principal component in each season, for both warm and cold months, are arranged in four distinct different spatial distributions: (i) a Mediterranean-wide distribution of positive:negative anomalies; (ii) strong positive:negative anomalies in the west and central Mediterranean and weaker anomalies in the east; (iii) strong positive:negative anomalies in the eastern Mediterranean and weaker anomalies in central and western parts; (iv) strong positive: negative anomalies in the central Mediterranean and weaker anomalies in eastern and western parts.

40|$|Abstract Atmospheric {{pressure}} varies {{within a}} wide range of scales and thus a multi-scale description of its variability is particularly appealing. In this study, a scale-by-scale analysis of the global <b>sea-level</b> <b>pressure</b> field is carried out from reanalysis data. Wavelet-based analysis of variance is applied in order to describe the variability of the pressure field in terms of patterns representing the contribution of each scale to the overall variance. Signals at the seasonal scales account for the largest fraction of <b>sea-level</b> <b>pressure</b> variance (typically more than 60 %) except in the Southern Ocean, in the Equatorial Pacific and in the North Atlantic. In the Southern Ocean and over the North Atlantic, high-frequency signals contribute to a considerable fraction (30 – 50 %) of the overall variance in <b>sea-level</b> <b>pressure.</b> In the Equatorial Pacific, large-scale variability, associated with ENSO, contributes up to 40 % of the total variance. ...|$|R

The dominating atmospheric pressure patterns obtained from the climate model run allow in combination with ERA-Interim <b>sea-level</b> <b>pressure</b> and surface winds a reconstruction of the OBP variability in the North Pacific from atmospheric model data only, which correlates favorably (r= 0. 7) with GRACE ocean bottom pressure observations.

The variational SEASAT data analysis technique was designed to improve the sea level pressure analysis in the data sparse areas.

40|$|The {{influence}} of solar variability {{into the lower}} atmospheric regions has been suggested on different atmospheric parameters in different time scales. However, a plausible mechanism to explain these observations remains unclear. Although it is widely accepted that the climate change over the past 50 years is attributed to human influence, we present the case that local climate change in the tropical Pacific {{may be due to}} changes in the Earth's magnetic field strength. The changes in the tropical Pacific circulation have been observed during the last 50 years, and they are attributed to the increase of the global surface temperature. However, a geomagnetic modulation of the net radiative flux in the southern tropical Pacific was recently suggested. Moreover, comparisons of long-term reconstructions of the Northern Hemisphere surface temperature and solar activity proxies indicated that the existence of a geomagnetic signal in climate data would support a direct link between solar variability and their effects on climate. Here we show that in the tropical Pacific the <b>sea-level</b> <b>pressure,</b> which is a component of the Walker circulation, could be related to the magnetospheric, ionospheric, and upper-atmosphere processes which may propagate downward to the lower atmosphere. Furthermore, we show that the changes in <b>sea-level</b> <b>pressure</b> and the Walker circulation are correlated to the westward drift of the magnetic anomaly. We compare the region averaged monthly values of the <b>sea-level</b> <b>pressure</b> in the tropical Pacific with those of the magnetic field intensity near the surface for the last 50 years. We find that the <b>sea-level</b> <b>pressure</b> in the tropical Pacific is increasing as the magnetic field intensity is decreasing.
