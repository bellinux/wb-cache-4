5|$|The RIRA {{initially}} took {{small amounts}} of materiel from Provisional IRA arms dumps {{under the control of}} McKevitt and other former Provisional IRA members, including the plastic explosive <b>Semtex,</b> Uzi submachine guns, AK-47 and AK-74 assault rifles, handguns, shotguns, detonators, and timing devices. The defection of senior Provisional IRA members also gave the RIRA the ability to manufacture home-made explosives and improvised mortars, including the Mark 15 mortar capable of firing a 200lb shell.|$|E
5|$|On 17 April 1986—the day {{the bodies}} of the {{teachers}} were found and McCarthy was kidnapped—Ann Marie Murphy, a pregnant Irish chambermaid, was discovered in Heathrow airport with a <b>Semtex</b> bomb in the false bottom of one of her bags. She had been about to board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London. The bag had been packed by her Jordanian fiancé Nizar Hindawi, who had said he would join her in Israel where they were to be married.|$|E

5|$|The Confessions Tour is {{the second}} live album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on January 26, 2007 by Warner Bros. Records. Directed by Jonas Åkerlund, the album chronicles Madonna's 2006 Confessions Tour. It was recorded at Wembley Arena during the London dates of the tour, and was released in both CD and DVD format. The DVD contains the entire concert and the CD includes thirteen live songs only. The album became the first release from <b>Semtex</b> Films, a production company founded by Madonna in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of <b>semtex,</b> a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E
5|$|In June 2006, the PSNI made arrests {{following}} an MI5 sting operation targeting a dissident republican gun smuggling plot. The RIRA {{had attempted to}} procure arms from France including <b>Semtex</b> and C-4 plastic explosives, SA-7 surface-to-air missiles, AK-47s, rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols with silencers, anti-tank weapons and detonators. On 30 June 2010, two of those arrested were found guilty following a trial by judge in Belfast. On 1 October 2010 one man was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for attempting to import weapons and explosives, while the other was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment for making a Portuguese property available {{for the purpose of}} terrorism.|$|E
25|$|In mid-July 2013, the Gardaí {{displayed}} {{arms and}} explosives (<b>Semtex)</b> recently recovered from dissident {{republicans in the}} Dublin area. The Gardaí believe this <b>Semtex</b> {{to have come from}} the Libyan connection back in the 1980s and therefore should have been decommissioned.|$|E
25|$|<b>Semtex</b> (trade name): Plastic {{demolition}} explosives containing RDX and PETN {{as major}} energetic components.|$|E
25|$|Garda Síochána (the Police Service of the Republic of Ireland) {{uncovered}} numerous arms {{destined for}} the IRA in 1988. These included several hundred AK-47s, Russian DSHK HMGs, FN MAG machine guns and <b>Semtex.</b>|$|E
25|$|In October 1986, another {{shipment}} of 80 tonnes which included one tonne of <b>Semtex,</b> reportedly ten SAM-7 missiles, more RPG-7s, AK-47s {{and hundreds of}} thousands of rounds of ammunition arrived aboard the oil-rig replenishment Villa.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 the IRA {{receives}} another consignment of {{arms from}} Libya but the arms are intercepted on board Claudia {{by members of}} the Gardaí. Leading IRA man Joe Cahill and others arrested. The shipment consisted of Czech-made Vz 58 rifles, <b>Semtex</b> and other materials, possibly RPG-7s and handguns.|$|E
25|$|On 17 April 1986, <b>semtex</b> {{explosives}} {{were found}} in the bag of a pregnant Irishwoman attempting to board an El Al flight. The explosives had been given to her by her Jordanian boyfriend and father of her unborn child Nizar Hindawi. The incident became known as the Hindawi Affair.|$|E
25|$|After the raid, {{media reports}} claimed {{that there had}} been armed violent {{resistance}} during the raid. However these stories were denied and withdrawn {{when it became clear that}} O'Neill was not carrying a weapon at the time of the shooting. According to CAIN, ten tonnes of home-made explosives, two pounds of <b>Semtex,</b> rifles and other bomb equipment were recovered at another location following the raid.|$|E
25|$|No {{radio to}} {{remotely}} control a bomb {{was found on}} the bodies, nor was there a bomb in the car in Gibraltar which had been identified as belonging to the team. Keys to a car found in Farrell's handbag led to the discovery in Spain of five packages totalling 84kg of <b>Semtex</b> explosive. These packages had four separate detonators attached. Around this was packed 200 rounds of ammunition as shrapnel. There were two timers, marked 10 hrs 45 mins and 11 hrs 15 mins respectively, but they were not primed or connected.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April 1992 at 9:20 pm, the façade of the Exchange's {{offices at}} 24–28 St Mary Axe was {{partially}} demolished, {{and the rest}} of the building was extensively damaged in a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb attack. The one-ton bomb was contained in a large white truck and consisted of a fertilizer device wrapped with a detonation cord made from 45kg of <b>semtex.</b> It killed three people: Paul Butt, 29, Baltic Exchange employee; Thomas Casey, 49, Baltic Exchange doorman; and 15-year-old Danielle Carter. Another 91 people were injured.|$|E
25|$|Although {{aware that}} he was a {{potential}} IRA assassination target, Gow declined to take anything more than routine security precautions. Unlike most British MPs of that era, he left his telephone number and home address in the local telephone directory. In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow's Austin Montego car, which was parked in the driveway of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex. The 4½-lb <b>Semtex</b> bomb detonated at 08:39 as Gow reversed out of his driveway, leaving him with severe wounds to his lower body. He died ten minutes later.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} investigations at the site, which was cordoned off {{soon after the}} incident and screened by the investigating agencies, improvised explosive device (IED) was recovered from a metal dustbin, though no residue of the explosives, remains of any circuit or detonator were found, the device did not have shrapnel in it, thus there were no burn or shrapnel injuries, and all the injured were hit by pieces of wall that broke following the explosion, all suggesting the use of plastique explosive, PETN, TNT or C4. Early results revealed used of <b>Semtex,</b> a general-purpose plastic explosive containing RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN); however, the final report of the Forensic Science Institute, Gujarat is awaited.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1980s, the Provisional IRA {{received}} {{large quantities}} of modern weaponry, including heavy weaponry such as heavy machine guns, over 1,000 rifles, several hundred handguns, rocket-propelled grenades, flamethrowers, surface-to-air missiles and the plastic explosive <b>Semtex,</b> from the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi. There were four successful shipments between 1985 and 1986; three of these trips were {{carried out by the}} trawler Casamara and a fourth by the oil-rig replenisher Villa. All told, they brought in 110 tons of weaponry. A fifth arms cargo on board the coaster Eksund was intercepted by the French Navy in 1987. This brought the Provisional IRA's new capability {{to the attention of the}} authorities on either side of the Irish border. Five men were captured with the boat; three IRA members, including Gabriel Cleary, received jail sentences. Reportedly, Gaddafi donated enough weapons to arm the equivalent of two infantry battalions.|$|E
25|$|However, on 1 November 1987, during {{transit to}} Ireland, {{one-third of the}} total Libyan arms {{consignment}} being carried aboard the MV Eksund was intercepted by the French Navy while the ship was in the Bay of Biscay, along with five crew members, among them Gabriel Cleary. The vessel was found to contain 120 tonnes of weapons, including HMGs, 36 RPGs, 1000 detonators, 20 SAMs, <b>Semtex</b> and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition. Ed Moloney claimed that the Eksund shipment also contained military mortars and a 106-millimetre cannon, an assertion never confirmed by the Irish authorities. Despite the Eksund fiasco, the IRA was by then equipped with a {{quantity and quality of}} weaponry and explosives never available to them at any other phase of their history. Furthermore, according to Brendan O'Brien there was actually an 'over-supply', especially regarding the 600 AK-47s still {{in the hands of the}} IRA by 1992.|$|E
25|$|The blast {{fragments}} included {{parts of}} a radio cassette player and {{a small piece of}} circuit board. This rang alarm bells within the intelligence communities in Britain, the U.S., and West Germany, as the West German police had recovered a <b>Semtex</b> bomb hidden inside a Toshiba radio cassette player in an apartment in Neuss, West Germany, in October 1988, two months before PA 103 exploded. The bomb, one of five, had been in the possession of members of the Damascus–based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC), led by Ahmed Jibril, a former Syrian army captain. Feraday travelled to West Germany to examine this bomb, and though he found that the Lockerbie fragments did not precisely match the Toshiba model, they were similar enough for him to contact Toshiba. With the company's help, DERA discovered there were seven models in which the printed circuit board bore exactly the same details as the Lockerbie fragments.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit board}} fragment, {{allegedly}} found {{embedded in a}} piece of charred material, was identified as part of an electronic timer similar to one found on a Libyan intelligence agent who had been arrested 10 months previously for carrying materials for a <b>Semtex</b> bomb. The timer was allegedly traced through its Swiss manufacturer, Mebo, to the Libyan military, and Mebo employee Ulrich Lumpert identified the fragment at al-Megrahi's trial. Mebo's owner, Edwin Bollier, testified at the trial that the Scottish police had originally shown him a fragment of a brown 8-ply circuit board from a prototype timer which had never been supplied to Libya. Yet the sample he was asked to identify at the trial was a green 9-ply circuit board that Mebo had indeed supplied to Libya. Bollier wanted to pursue this discrepancy, but was told by trial judge Lord Sutherland that he could not do so. Bollier later claimed that in 1991 he had declined an offer of $4million from the FBI in exchange for his support of the main line of inquiry, though this claim has never been verified.|$|E
500|$|On 7 June 2017 Gardaí foiled {{a serious}} New IRA bomb plot after {{discovering}} six kilos of <b>Semtex,</b> [...] "enough {{to blow up}} a street".|$|E
500|$|When {{the bodies}} were searched, a set of car keys was found on Farrell. Spanish and British {{authorities}} conducted enquiries to trace the vehicle, which—two days after the shootings—led them to a red Ford Fiesta in a car park in Marbella ( [...] from Gibraltar). The car contained a large quantity of <b>Semtex</b> surrounded by 200 rounds of ammunition, along with four detonators and two timers.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with BBC's DJ <b>Semtex,</b> Jay said he didn't mean the verses as a personal attack. [...] "I didn't know that [...] wasn't {{on the table for}} discussion!" [...] he said. [...] "I didn't know I was the first person ever to say that..." [...] He continued, [...] "When I say things, I think people believe me so much that they take it a different way — it's, like, not rap anymore at that point. I say some great things about him in the book I have coming out [...] — that's wasn't a cheap plug," [...] he laughed. [...] "He's gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people's perception of him. But it is what it is, he took it that wrong way, and I didn't know I said anything wrong!" ...|$|E

Moreover, Pusha T confirmed a further collaboration with Rick Ross.|$|E
500|$|Within {{minutes of}} the {{military}} operation ending, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) issued a press release, stating that [...] "a suspected car bomb {{has been found in}} Gibraltar, and three suspects have been shot dead by the civilian police". That evening, both the BBC and the ITN (Independent Television News) reported that the IRA team had been involved in a [...] "shootout" [...] with the authorities. The following morning, BBC Radio 4 reported that the alleged bomb was [...] "packed with bits of metal and shrapnel", and later carried a statement from Ian Stewart, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, that [...] "military personnel were involved. A car bomb was found, which has been defused". Each of the eleven British daily newspapers reported the alleged finding of the car bomb, of which eight quoted its size as [...] The IRA issued a statement later on 7 March to the effect that McCann, Savage, and Farrell were [...] "on active service" [...] in Gibraltar and had [...] "access to and control over [...] " [...] of <b>Semtex.</b>|$|E
500|$|The first {{witnesses}} to testify were the Gibraltar Police officers {{involved in the}} operation and its aftermath. Following them, on 7 September, was [...] "Mr O", the senior MI5 officer in charge of Operation Flavius. [...] "O" [...] told the inquest that, in January 1988, Belgian authorities found a car being used by IRA operatives in Brussels. In the car were found a quantity of <b>Semtex,</b> detonators, and equipment for a radio detonation device, which, [...] "O" [...] told the coroner, led MI5 {{to the conclusion that}} the IRA might use a similar device for the planned attack in Gibraltar. MI5 further believed that the IRA had been unlikely to use a [...] "blocking car" [...] (an empty vehicle used to hold a parking space until the bombers bring in the vehicle containing the explosives) as this entailed the added risk of multiple border crossings. Finally, [...] "O" [...] told the coroner that McCann, Savage, and Farrell had been observed by Spanish authorities arriving at Málaga Airport, after which he claimed the trio had been lost, and that the British and Gibraltarian authorities did not detect them crossing the border.|$|E

Malice, a member of the hip hop duo, claimed: [...] "Illmatic captured the whole New York state of mind for me. It embraced everything I knew New York to be. The album had 10 songs, all of them flawless. Me and my homies got great memories of rolling around listening to that, huslin', smokin', chillin'. That embodied everything that was right with hip-hop. That CD never came out my deck." [...] Speaking in 2012, British producer, DJ <b>Semtex</b> described Illmatic as [...] "an exemplary album of perfection that forced the evolution of lyricism and production values within hip hop. Eighteen years later it remains omnipotent." ...|$|E
500|$|A large Real IRA {{explosives}} dump {{and arms}} cache {{were discovered in}} Dunleer, County Louth by Gardaí in October 2010, following a weekend of searches and arrests in {{the east of the}} country. In addition, two Real IRA men were charged in Dublin's non-jury Special Criminal Court of membership of an illegal organisation. The Real IRA claimed responsibility for kidnapping and shooting dead of one of their members, Kieran Doherty, for alleged drug dealing. Further significant seizures of Real IRA arms and explosives were made by the Gardaí during 2012 and 2013, leading to the arrest of over a dozen persons. In 2011 Michael Campbell, brother of Liam, was found guilty in Vilnius, Lithuania, of trying to purchase arms and explosives and was sentenced to twelve years in prison. In October 2013 Campbell was freed on appeal, only to have the Supreme Court of Lithuania order a retrial in June 2014. Campbell has maintained his innocence, accusing British intelligence of attempting to frame him. In June 2013 Gardaí arrested eight people after a Real IRA meeting and uncovered a massive haul of the plastic explosive <b>Semtex</b> in two raids in Dublin. In October 2013 the Real IRA claimed responsibility for [...] "executing" [...] an alleged leading cocaine dealer in north Belfast.|$|E
