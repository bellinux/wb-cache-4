40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>shoulder</b> gradient and acromiohumeral interval of both <b>shoulders</b> in patients with unilateral <b>shoulder</b> impingement syndrome.

Using the radiography, we measured the acromiohumeral interval and the angle between a vertical line and a line connecting a superior angle with an inferior angle of the scapula.

40|$|Altered neuromuscular control due to {{compromised}} position sense {{may contribute}} to <b>shoulder</b> instability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects exhibit larger errors than intact <b>shoulder</b> subjects in kinesthetically guided active positioning and reaching that are of greater functional significance than passive testing of <b>shoulder</b> position sense. Ten subjects with a history of anterior <b>shoulder</b> dislocation and 15 intact <b>shoulder</b> subjects participated in the study. <b>Shoulder</b> position sense was examined with three different protocols (imposed motion to remembered <b>shoulder</b> rotation angles and active <b>shoulder</b> abduction/rotation to verbally specified positions) with targets located in both the mid- and end-range of rotation. Three dimensional end-point accuracy of kinesthetically guided reaches to visually specified targets, along with the <b>shoulder</b> rotation angle and scapula orientations at the end-point, were also analyzed. In agreement with previous studies, unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects exhibited significantly larger errors in perception of <b>shoulder</b> joint angles than healthy controls in a protocol involving imposed motion to remembered <b>shoulder</b> rotation angles. However, the clinical significance of the observed deficit is questionable because the averaged rms error differences between unstable and intact <b>shoulders</b> were relatively small (average: 1. 8 °). During tests of active positioning, unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects were able to move the <b>shoulder</b> to verbally defined angles as accurately as healthy controls in both <b>shoulder</b> abduction and rotation. Unstable and intact <b>shoulder</b> subjects exhibited similar reaching accuracy and scapular orientations in the kinesthetically guided reaching test, but unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects consistently used less <b>shoulder</b> rotation angle than healthy controls. However, they were able to point to a remembered target as accurately as intact <b>shoulder</b> subjects, suggesting that a different reaching strategy was adopted by unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects to minimize <b>shoulder</b> rotation. Results of this study show that unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects can perceive <b>shoulder</b> angles and reach to visually specified targets in space as accurately as healthy controls in functional activities with voluntarily arm movements.

40|$|Background. Altered neuromuscular control due to {{compromised}} joint position sense {{may contribute}} to recurrent <b>shoulder</b> instability. Objective. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine whether individuals with anterior <b>shoulder</b> instability exhibit larger <b>shoulder</b> position sense errors than those with healthy <b>shoulders</b> in both passive matching and active positioning. Design. This was a between-groups study with repeated measures. Methods. Ten people with anterior <b>shoulder</b> instability and 15 people with healthy <b>shoulders</b> participated in the study. <b>Shoulder</b> position sense was examined with 3 different protocols (passive motion to remembered <b>shoulder</b> rotation angles and active <b>shoulder</b> abduction and rotation to verbally specified positions) in posi-tions of both mid-range and end-range of motion. Results. Participants with unstable <b>shoulders</b> exhibited significantly larger errors (by 1. 8 ° on average) in perception of <b>shoulder</b> position compared with those with healthy <b>shoulders</b> during passive matching. During active positioning, participants with unstable <b>shoulders</b> were able to voluntarily move the <b>shoulder</b> to verbally specified angles as accurately as those with healthy <b>shoulders</b> in both abduction (0. 85 ° difference) and rotation (0. 99 ° difference) tasks. Conclusions. Results of this study indicate that people with unstable <b>shoulders</b> can perceive <b>shoulder</b> angles as accurately as people with healthy <b>shoulders</b> in activities with voluntary arm movements. Compared with passive matching, better information from muscle spindles and other sources during voluntary arm move-ments may compensate for the potential joint position sense deficits after the injury. Therefore, individuals with an unstable <b>shoulder</b> may have adequate neuromuscular control to engage proper protective mechanisms to stabilize the <b>shoulder</b> joint during functional activities...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Shoulder</b> pain is {{the most}} common and {{well-documented}} site of musculoskeletal pain in elite swimmers. Structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of elite swimmers’ symptomatic <b>shoulders</b> are common. Little has been documented about the association between MRI findings in the asymptomatic <b>shoulder</b> versus the symptomatic <b>shoulder.</b> Objective: To assess clinically relevant MRI findings in the <b>shoulders</b> of symptomatic and asymptomatic elite swimmers. Method: Twenty (aged 16 – 23 years) elite swimmers completed questionnaires on their swimming training, pain and <b>shoulder</b> function. MRI of both <b>shoulders</b> (n = 40) were performed and all swimmers were given a standardised clinical <b>shoulder</b> examination. Results: Both <b>shoulders</b> of 11 male and 9 female elite swimmers (n = 40) were examined. Eleven of the 40 <b>shoulders</b> were clinically symptomatic and 29 were asymptomatic. The most common clinical finding in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic <b>shoulders</b> was impingement during internal rotation, with impingement in 54. 5 % of the symptomatic <b>shoulders</b> and in 31. 0 % of the asymptomatic <b>shoulders.</b> The most common MRI findings in the symptomatic and asymptomatic <b>shoulders</b> were supraspinatus tendinosis (45. 5 % vs. 20. 7 %), subacromial subdeltoid fluid (45. 5 % vs. 34. 5 %), increased signal in the AC Joint (45. 5 % vs. 37. 9 %) and AC joint arthrosis (36. 4 % vs. 34. 5 %).
