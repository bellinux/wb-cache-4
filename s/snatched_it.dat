5|$|With Orton {{trapped in}} Bryan's {{submission}} hold, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon emerged from backstage {{and pulled the}} original referee {{out of the ring}} to prevent the match from ending. Triple H then sent in referee Scott Armstrong on his behalf, as Batista performed the Batista Bomb on a distracted Bryan. Armstrong made the count, but Bryan kicked out at two. A charging Batista was sent into the ring post when Bryan dodged. With no disqualifications in a triple threat match, Bryan kicked referee Armstrong in the head, following with a suicide dive out of the ring onto Triple H, Stephanie McMahon and Armstrong. Triple H tried to retaliate with a sledgehammer, but Bryan <b>snatched</b> <b>it</b> and used the sledgehammer on Triple H, knocking him off the ring apron. This ended Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's interference in the match.|$|E

500|$|Mos Def {{collaborated with}} singer Georgia Anne Muldrow and rappers Slick Rick and Talib Kweliâ€”his {{partner in the}} rap duo Black Star. Muldrow sang and played piano on [...] "Roses", which she {{originally}} wrote and recorded in 2008 for her album Umsindo (2009). She said Mos Def [...] "borrowed" [...] the song for The Ecstatic after they met through a mutual friend. [...] "They came over one day and started playing 'Roses.' He was singing the song and knew it. He said 'I wanna grab that.' I said, 'Man, I already got this as a single'. He just wanted that song. He <b>snatched</b> <b>it</b> up real quick", she recalled in laughter. Along with Madlib, Oh No, and J Dilla, Muldrow had been an affiliate of Stones Throw Records; according to journalist Nathan Rabin, they collectively produced half of the album, giving its sound a [...] "sympathetic" [...] quality. With The Ecstatic, Mos Def {{said he wanted to}} offer listeners sincere, uninhibited observations about life and love, [...] "some truth and positive heart lift", without the need for club songs.

2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been <b>snatched,</b> <b>it</b> would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E
