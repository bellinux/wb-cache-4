5|$|The tugs {{took the}} hulk of the Temeraire in tow at 7:30 am on 5 September 1838, taking {{advantage}} of the beginning of the <b>slack</b> <b>water.</b> They had reached Greenhithe by 1:30 pm at the , where they anchored overnight. They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing Woolwich and then Greenwich at noon. They reached Limehouse Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at 2 pm. The Temeraire was hauled up onto the mud, where she lay as she was slowly broken up. The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder pintles and gudgeons, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.|$|E
25|$|Oscillating {{currents}} {{produced by}} tides {{are known as}} tidal streams. The moment that the tidal current ceases is called <b>slack</b> <b>water</b> or slack tide. The tide then reverses direction and {{is said to be}} turning. <b>Slack</b> <b>water</b> usually occurs near high water and low water. But there are locations where the moments of slack tide differ significantly from those of high and low water.|$|E

25|$|Tidal {{currents}} {{and changes in}} sea level caused by gravitational forces and the earth's rotation. Some dive sites can only be dived safely at <b>slack</b> <b>water</b> when the tidal cycle reverses and the current slows. Strong currents can cause problems for divers. Buoyancy control can be difficult when a strong current meets a vertical surface. Divers consume more breathing gas when swimming against currents. Divers on the surface can be separated from their boat cover by currents. On the other hand, drift diving is only possible {{when there is a}} reasonable current.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{its great}} depth, the lake {{as a whole}} never freezes in winter, but an ice sheet {{covering}} between 10% and 90% of the lake area typically develops, depending on {{the severity of the}} winter. Ice sheets typically form along the shoreline and in <b>slack</b> <b>water</b> bays, where the lake is not as deep. During the winters of 1877 and 1878, the ice sheet coverage was up to 95–100% in most of the lake. In the winter of 1812, the ice cover was stable enough that the American naval commander stationed at Sackets Harbor feared a British attack from Kingston, over the ice.|$|E

25|$|Port Phillip lies in {{southern}} Victoria, separated from Bass Strait by the Bellarine Peninsula {{to the southwest}} and Mornington Peninsula to the southeast. It is the largest bay in Victoria {{and one of the}} largest inland bays in Australia. The narrow entrance to the bay, called the Rip, between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean, features strong tidal streams made turbulent by the uneven contours of the seabed. The best time for small craft to enter the Rip is at <b>slack</b> <b>water.</b> Large ships require expert local guidance to enter and exit, provided by the Port Phillip Sea Pilots. Work has commenced to deepen the channel entrance, to allow newer, larger container ships to access Melbourne's docks.|$|E

5|$|The Touchet {{beds are}} one element {{in a chain}} of {{evidence}} which helped identify and define the progression of the Missoula Floods, which occurred around 16,450 to 13,750 yearsBCE. During the floods, flow through the Wallula Gap was slow enough such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis. Lake Lewis back-flooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River Valleys. In these relatively calm arms of the lake, the <b>slack</b> <b>waters</b> deposited the suspended materials eroded from the scabland regions north of Lake Lewis, and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding.|$|R
50|$|Just before {{reaching}} the Goodbars community, the river passes under State Highway 30 (Spencer Road).

5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the <b>slack</b> <b>waters</b> were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|R
50|$|Glassmaking was {{the primary}} {{industry}} for many Monongahela River towns, including the city of Pittsburgh as well as small towns such as New Geneva and Greensboro, for several decades preceding the Civil War. The late 18th-early 19th century New Geneva/Greensboro glassworks proved that quality glass, natural resources, and transportation networks could be effectively harnessed. After the Civil War, the manufacture of stoneware became Greensboro's leading industry, {{in addition to a}} prosperous clay tile manufacturer who specialized in roofing tiles. The mid 19th-century Greensboro stoneware potteries were among the most productive in the eastern United States. Talented artisans and craftsmen along with the excellent nearby clay banks produced a distinctive blue-gray stoneware which had a large market. Due to its location {{at the head of the}} <b>slack</b> <b>waters</b> of the Monongahela, Greensboro's influence as a commercial and manufacturing center expanded far beyond its small boundaries.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>slacker</b> <b>water</b> {{above the}} rapid; and all {{afternoon}} they slid slowly up on deep, winding {{reaches of the}} still, green river. Sometimes it flashed under dazzling sunshine, but at least as often they moved through the dim shadow of towering pines that rolled, rank on rank, somber and stately, up the steep hillside, while high above them all rose tremendous ramparts of eternal snow. Then, as the sun dipped behind the great mountain wall, the clean, aromatic fragrance of pine and fir and cedar crept into the cooling air, and a stillness so deep that it became almost oppressive descended upon the lonely valley. The splash of pole or paddle broke through it with a startling distinctness, and the faint gurgle at the bows became curiously intensified. The pines grew slower, blacker and more solemn; filmy trails of mist crawled out from among the hollows of the hills; and the still air was charged with an elixir-like quality when Weston ran his canoe ashore.|$|R

60|$|They {{got through}} the reach, paddled laboriously against a swifter stream, and dragged the canoe over a portage, {{stumbling}} among big stones and across frozen pools. During this passage Andrew fell and hurt himself; but stopping {{was out of the}} question. Launching the craft on the upper edge of the rapid, they drove her out. For a minute or two they made no progress, and Andrew, straining at his pole, feared that they would be swept down the wild, foaming rush; but they found <b>slacker</b> <b>water</b> and the ominous roar of the rapid died away. Then snow began to fall, making it difficult to see, though they had the faint glimmer of the shore-ice for a guide. In the reach up which they were poling, it did not run out far because the stream was strong, and they had gone some distance when there was a heavy thud and a curious crunch at the bows.|$|R
40|$|In Colorado as elsewhere, {{water supply}} systems and water supply {{managers}} are largely evaluated by {{their ability to}} withstand droughts.

30|$|The {{concentrations}} of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), total metals, and fecal coliform (FC) coupling with chlorophyll-a (chl-a), 5 -day {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (BOD 5) and other general environmental parameters were evaluated at the sub-surface and near-bottom water columns of 13 stations in the Sibu Laut River during low and high <b>slack</b> <b>waters.</b> The results indicated that inorganic nitrogen (mainly nitrate) was the primary form of nitrogen whereas organic phosphorus was the major form of phosphorus. The abundance of total heavy metals in Sibu Laut River and its tributaries was {{in the order of}} Pb < Cu < Zn < Cd. Fecal coliform concentration was relatively low along Sibu Laut River. The shrimp farm effluents contributed a substantial amount of chl-a, BOD 5, nutrients, and FC to the receiving creek except for total metals. Nevertheless, the influence was merely noticeable in the intake creek and amended rapidly along Selang Sibu River and brought minimal effects on the Sibu Laut River. Besides, the domestic sewage effluents from villages nearby also contributed a substantial amount of pollutants.|$|R
