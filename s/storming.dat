In 1827 at Plochingen, Baden-Württemberg, several male-voiced choirs combined for a regional liederfest. Sängerfests were part of the Hambach Festival of 1832.|$|E

5|$|Light {{infantry}} were equipped more lightly {{than regular}} line regiments, and marched at 140 paces per minute.

During the Peninsular War they were regarded as the army's elite corps.|$|E

5|$|A new comedy duo called Supergirly {{were also}} {{introduced}} from January 2000 {{to fill the}} gap left by 'Ben, Gez and Rich' who had quit the show the previous series. Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the morning as BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests, either through a misunderstanding, by being tactless or by mistaking the guests as someone else.

30|$|The Dst {{index is}} then {{examined}} during each <b>storm.</b> Selection of moderate <b>storms</b> {{began with a}} broad search for all <b>storms</b> with the peak Dst between − 50 and − 100  nT.

These criteria provide a list of 16 CIR and 25 ICME moderate <b>storms.</b> It {{should be noted that}} these moderate ICME <b>storms</b> contain MC <b>storms</b> {{due to the nature of}} the initial ICME list. Therefore, the <b>storms</b> studied in “Superposed epoch analysis results for CIR <b>storms</b> and ICME storms” and “Superposed epoch analysis results for moderate <b>storms</b> and intense storms” sections contain intense MC <b>storms.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Winter <b>Storm</b> naming in the United States {{goes back}} to the 1700s when a {{snowstorm}} dubbed [...] "The Great Snow of 1717" [...] hit the colonies of New England in 1717. Another noteworthy <b>storm</b> that hit the great plains in 1888 was dubbed [...] "The Schoolhouse Blizzard" [...] or [...] "Children's Blizzard". Naming would be used again in 1905 for The Mataafa <b>Storm</b> that occurred on the Great Lakes. In 1924, a <b>storm</b> hit the upper South and middle Atlantic United States. This <b>storm</b> turned blizzard was dubbed the Knickerbocker <b>Storm</b> after the Knickerbocker Theatre in Washington D.C. which the <b>storm</b> destroyed. Named days of the calendar for <b>storms</b> include a <b>storm</b> that hit in 1940 called the Armistice Day Blizzard, a <b>storm</b> in Oregon in 1962 called the Columbus Day <b>Storm,</b> a <b>storm</b> in 1976 called the Groundhog Day gale, and more recently a <b>storm</b> in 1991 dubbed the Halloween blizzard. The twentieth century closed with two more <b>storms</b> that received names. In 1993, a <b>storm</b> that spanned {{a large portion of the}} eastern United States was called the 1993 <b>Storm</b> of the Century.

5|$|Tropical <b>Storm</b> Larry was {{the twelfth}} {{tropical}} <b>storm</b> in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season.

5|$|The first <b>storm</b> of the season, Tropical <b>Storm</b> Aletta, formed off the {{southwest}} coast of Mexico.
