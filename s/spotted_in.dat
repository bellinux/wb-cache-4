5|$|Many {{species of}} birds have been <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> the Little Butte Creek region. Twenty-two species are known to breed in the {{chaparral}} region, including several species of wrens, blackbirds, and sparrows. The mixed coniferous forest is home to white-headed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, green-tailed towhees, northern pygmy-owls, Vaux's swifts, winter wrens, and MacGillivray's warblers. The American coot has also been <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> several places along the creek. Williamson's sapsuckers, black-backed woodpeckers, gray jays, and hermit warblers frequent the higher elevations. The near-threatened olive-sided flycatcher and Cassin's finch also live in this area.

5|$|A second {{hurricane}} was <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> the Straits of Florida at {{tropical storm}} intensity on September10. Several hours later, the system made landfall in Marquesas Keys, Florida. Early on September11, it strengthened into a hurricane. Intensifying slightly further, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) shortly thereafter. The hurricane maintained this intensity while moving west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and struck extreme southwestern Cameron Parish, Louisiana early on September13. Shortly thereafter, it weakened to {{a tropical storm}} over Texas, before dissipating several hours later.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the loss}} was so lopsided, and because Cal was {{expected}} to do highly well this season, many immediately dismissed Cal from any type of national discussion.

The pilot {{had failed to}} load enough fuel on the reconnaissance aircraft and had to refuel at a Laotian base on the return trip to Udorn. Since United States armed forces personnel were never officially acknowledged as being in Laos, the United States Ambassador to Laos became enraged that U.S. personnel had been <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> uniform at the remote refueling field in Laos.|$|E

The coast here has open grass heath land and mountain, giving way to rugged sea cliffs and coves.

5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. It {{has been reported that}} following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E
5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} enough time to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 U.S. recon {{photographs}} uncovered {{an unusual}} sight. POL barrels were spotted {{floating in the}} waters of the Kong River south of Ban Bak, Laos. Soon, PAVN was making use of the Banghiang River which flowed southwestward from the Demilitarized Zone {{all the way to the}} Mekong River, for the same purposes. The watertight drums were launched en masse from tributary streams into the main channel, floated downstream, and were recovered by systems of nets and booms. The Kaman River was added to the system in 1969. By 1970 the North Vietnamese were making intense use of streams and rivers to supplement their logistical route, especially in the rainy season, when the water levels rose and the roadways became impassable mires. During one two and one-half month period during 1969, over 10,000 POL barrels were <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> the waterways of southeastern Laos.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{population}} of blue whales occurring off Chile and Peru {{may also be a}} distinct subspecies. Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean. In Chile, the Cetacean Conservation Center, with support from the Chilean Navy, is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of Chiloe Island in the Gulf of Corcovado (Chiloé National Park), where 326 blue whales were <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> 2007. In this regions, it is normal for blue whales to enter Fiords. Whales also reach southern Los Lagos, such as off Caleta Zorra, live along with other rorquals.|$|E
5|$|New Yorks ordeal was not over, however. Badly {{damaged by}} the loss of a propeller, the ship sailed to Rosyth under heavy escort for repairs on 15 October. At 01:00 the next morning, a U-boat {{launched}} three torpedoes at the damaged vessel, all of which passed ahead of her. Unlike in previous cases, sufficient evidence existed to suppose that this torpedo attack was not a false alarm—a number of officers and men aboard New York clearly saw the wakes of the torpedoes in the full moonlight, and a submarine was <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> the immediate vicinity by a patrol shortly after the attack.|$|E
